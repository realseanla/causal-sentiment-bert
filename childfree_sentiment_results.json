Second off, we were at a point in the pandemic where we were seeing just how bad it actually is, so there isn't even the excuse of thinking this would be over in a couple weeks.\n\nI vented about this to a couple friends who don't know the couple. One of them wants kids but is usually reasonable, and one of them is also CF. The responses I got:\n\n* The CF friend told me that 26 is pushing it as far as getting pregnant, and she can understand why you'd do IVF at that point because you're \"running out of time\". To be fair to her, she comes from a family where she's the only one who wasn't pregnant by 21 or so, and her siblings are in their 20s and early 30s with 3+ kids each. She's basically the old maid at 27 with no kids and no plans to have them. Still, 26 is nowhere fucking close to \"running out of time\". I can see that argument for something like 36, but not 26.\n\n* My other friend told me that I'm discriminating against parents and need to stop hating parents so much. Dude, I never said I hate parents. I said I don't get why the fuck you'd do IVF in the middle of a global pandemic. I told him if they want to be parents that badly during something like this, why not go through the adoption process and help a kid in need? His counter was that adoption is expensive and I'm being unrealistic. I pointed out that IVF is also expensive and got \"you don't understand and will never understand because you don't want kids.\" I took that as getting a last word in because he didn't have a counter to that.

In the past, for all of human history, each extra human born was essentially to the betterment for everybody in society. Each extra human would:\n\n- On average, have a better life than those of the generation before it\n\n- Would help to grow and develop society\n\n- Would further ensure the survival of that particular society\n\n- Would increase their parent's economic security, especially in their later years\n\n\nWhereas now, due to limited resources etc, we seem to be reaching a point where that status quo is beginning to flip to the opposite.\n\n- On average, each child born today can expect to have a worse quality of life than those of the generation before it\n\n- Is increasing the burden on society as resources are becoming limited and the Earth's capacity to sustain our population is faltering\n\n- On average, each extra child is therefore decreasing the odds of survival for society\n\n- Children now decrease the economic security of the parents, rather than increase, as the cost of child-rearing has risen sharply and continues to accelerate sharper still. Healthcare and security in later life is now more achievable for those without children than those with\n\nI think it does help also to realise that, whilst we do have a built in need to have sex, there is in fact no evidence for any built in biological or instinctive need for us to have children. Rather, such feelings are entirely a cultural thing, a product of our cultural beliefs and upbringing, which may have in turn perhaps ultimately been influenced by our governments wanting their citizens to reproduce for the increased economic and military power that each extra human provided! Historically, there hasn't been as much evidence for humans on the whole thinking the same way about children. For the vast majority of human history, they were somewhat unavoidable (unless you remained abstinent) and were accepted as such, some loved them, some didn't, many parents routinely abandoned their kids, neglected them, or had them merely to do labour for them.

Literally thousands of dollars per year, and for the first 1-4 years, a good chunk of that cost is just shit like diapers/pull-ups, wipes, baby food, and formula. You can be spending upwards of $200 - $400 a month on just those items ALONE depending on brand and your child's needs (sometimes, you're stuck with the pricier crap if they're allergic to an ingredient in any of the above, have sensitive skin, etc., and some babies go through diapers faster than others. Even cloth diapers are going to have extra costs like laundering and maintenance) before factoring in shit like clothes, daycare, school supplies, toys, etc.\n\nNow imagine what else you can do with that money: go to school, go on a trip you've always wanted to go on, buy a house, save for retirement, invest, donate to a charity you love, buy things for your hobbies, etc. I make a decent living. I could not afford to do some of the things I like doing (good art supplies aren't cheap, and pre-lockdown, I could take a week off work and visit a friend) if I had kids.\n\nI would also suggest Googling and reading the Lemon Clot Essay (warning: a little graphic) which goes into what it's *actually* like after childbirth if you were thinking of having your own. Then imagine going through that with an unsupportive spouse, which is an unfortunate reality for some women who *do* want kids. Not having to deal with that in and of itself is a benefit.\n\nThe only thing more valuable than money is time, and kids take a lot of it. Trust me, as I came from a large family: kids need a LOT of attention. You are also going to spending a LOT of time repeating yourself: reading the same books over and over again, playing with the same toys and games they like, helping them potty train, disciplining over and over again until they get it. When they're younger, you'll be having to run after them, putting them down for naps, juggling how to run your daily errands while accounting for your child's needs (and Satan help you if they haven't had a chance to nap that day, and the errands take longer than expected. After parents outright not disciplining their kids, this is probably the second biggest reason for public outbursts: the child is tired/overstimulated, and is too young to communicate it effectively). You think you have more hours in the day than you actually do until the end of the day comes.\n\nAnd that's before touching on how if you weren't lucky enough to get an easy infant, you're going to have teach them to sleep on a schedule, and that means many rough and sleepless nights. If the baby has colic or special needs, that can make this already unpleasant experience even worse. I work night shifts, and I've helped my mom with cranky babies who wouldn't settle down. I'll take the night shift over the baby every single time.\n\nThink of the free time you have now, and what you do with it. While it's possible to balance work, hobbies, and kids (many of my friends with kids have figured it out), your free time is going to get drastically cut short. If you have things you value your free time for (hobbies, going out, quiet night at home, just resting after work without the expectation to do more than cook dinner and wind down, etc.), you need to think long and hard about if that time is worth sacrificing to you, because it WILL be a sacrifice.

Instead of spending that extra $1500-$2000 a month on just a single kid (assuming that kid is neurotypical, not special needs or medically ill or anything else that could quickly double or even quadruple your monthly cost), think of everything you could spend that money on instead! Maybe a private beach house, or a reclusive mountain getaway? Several extra vacations each year? And those vacations would be doing everything you want to do, not limited to whatever \"kid friendly\" activities happen to be in the area you're visiting. You have the option to pamper yourself like no other parent can, cause unlike them, you can actually afford it.   \n\n\nYou're also free to not work jobs that would enable you to afford that extra monthly mortgage cost. You could actually make the choice between having a career that makes you happy, instead of defaulting to whatever career actually pays the bills, or killing your chances at any future career by becoming a stay at home mom because the monthly cost of daycare would cost more than you'd earn at any regular job in any given month. You could both save to retire earlier, or be financially secure enough that should one of you get laid off or need to stop working for any reason, you can still stay afloat financially. It's a lot easier to avoid massive financial hardship when you only have to worry about a household of 2 adults, and not a household of 2 adults and 3 children.   \n\n\nFinally, and I think this is probably the biggest positive point you should consider, you will never be forced into single parenthood. One of my default questions for anyone who wants to become a parent is, \"Would you still want to be a parent if it meant being a single parent?\" Even if they say yes to that, I clarify, \"Even if it meant being a single parent of a special needs, disabled, or severely ill child?\" The sad fact is, life is unpredictable. Your partner could leave, or die, become overwhelmed by the needs of the child and refuse to contribute, become disabled and be unable to contribute, or any number of other reasons that would force either parent into a 100% caretaker role. Sometimes it's done out of malicious resentment because the reality of parenting is worse than anticipated, other times it's simply an accident, like the sudden death of a partner.

We were all in our late teens - early 20s and it was bar and wait staff work. I'm in Europe so tipping culture isn't super common, but sometimes people will round their bill up or give you some change here and there\n\n\nAnyway, one girl was 19 and had a two year old, her boyfriend was cheating on her (he was also 32, but that's a whole separate story), but he made literally 5 times as much as she did, so she was scared to leave him and have to move back in with her parents. The other girl was 25 and had a newborn. They were both kind of out of shape, always exhausted, and also just bad at their jobs. Like it was a small, casual venue, the menu changed weekly but there were only ever 3 options - a vegetarian or vegan thing, a standard thing, and an \"allergy friendly thing\" that was literally always cheese,nut,mustard, and gluten free risotto. The star vegetable changed every week, but it was always some form of risotto. The bar served lager, cider, wine, or Guinness. Your non alcoholic options were water or coke. So you'd think memorising the menu would take like 30 seconds, but without fail they'd tell the customers we had stuff we didn't, then freak out when an annoyed customer didn't have their food 30 minutes later and was demanding a refund.\n\nOn an average night I'd have PS10 - 20 in tips, they'd have maybe PS5, and half the time they'd have to give that back to the bar because they'd counted change wrong and the till was short. \n\nI wasn't the best waitress to ever waitress or anything, but I got to work, wrote the menu down on the back of my order pad, and was generally polite to people. I'd flirt with some of the single guys that came in, and they'd pretty much always give me an extra PS1 or so on each drink order. I wasn't over the top, but I got people the food they ordered soon after they ordered it and I was generally competent. \n\nI also befriended a lot of the kitchen staff, because I speak (some, bad) French, and a couple of the guys were from France. My manager really liked me, and I'd always get out of random stuff I hated doing. Nothing major, just \"girls, you two go clear plates at tables 21 - 24. Steph, you go behind the bar for now. There was cottage pie today.\" I'm vegetarian and touching meat grosses me out, manager noticed I was gagging a bit clearing once, so he never made me do it when there was mince or gravy. I'd still be given a job, but obviously gave the impression I was getting the better role. \n\nChef would always set aside risotto and vegetarian mains for me, the girls always got the anonymous meat slop left over. If there wasn't any risotto left, chef would ask me what I wanted and make it for me, even if it wasn't on the menu. Dude literally made me tortillas once because I complained that I missed nice Mexican food. \n\nNone of it was against the rules, one of the perks of working there was free food, but we weren't supposed to request special food, it was whatever the kitchen felt like feeding us that day. \n\nBut it didn't take long for the girls to start rumours that I was sleeping with the manager, sleeping with the chef, sleeping with the customers, and stealing from the till.\n\nThey demanded we start splitting tips evenly, they wanted first choice of food because they're always so hungry and tired from their children, and demanded me and the other childfree wait staff do all the heavy lifting, they both wanted to pour pints all shift (and wanted to sit while they did it. Behind a bar that had like 4 square feet of space and only needed one person at a time).\n\n Luckily my manager shut that down pretty quickly and I had enough friends at work who made similar amounts in tips, so it was easy enough to prove that all our tills were even at the end of the night and we could all say ee'd seen the others get cash directly from customers, so the other girls had done nothing to deserve even splits (some customers would even say things alo.g the lines of \"this is for YOU. Don't share with the girl who forgot my order 3 times\")  but it still had to be investigated because they made a formal complaint to the company that owned the venue. \n\nMy manager got sick of them at some point and ended up sending them to work in reception, where there are *no* tips, fewer ways to fuck up, and also no heating, but the door opens every time somebody walks in front of it. \n\nI ended up moving and getting a job that pays slightly better with more sociable hours, so I don't really know how they're doing now, but I know they still work there and my friends who are still there say my old manager still refuses to put them back in the restaurant.", "score": 14, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.085, "neu": 0.817, "pos": 0.098, "compound": 0.9368}}, "gfox6gw": {"comment": "I have a really nice coworker but lately I've noticed she makes uncomfortable comments about weight- she's probably 200lbs+ and I'm 125 and am really into fitness.

She eventually gets sterilized to prevent and children should she ever gets recaptured (she does and she gets the last laugh).

No one knows if these individuals can have biological children, but she has no interest in raising children as she's focused on defeating the next threat and mentoring a man who's eventually resurrected and can't remember the sins he's committed in his past life. She's a badass former soldier who curses, carries around a sword, wrapped a heavy sniper in the bones of a now dead worm god and tends to style her hair up with static that she generates. Her biggest fear is that someday she may not be resurrected when she dies, and worries that her girlfriend made the wrong choice in partners and may be better off seeing out someone who wasn't resurrected. \n\nIn both cases, both are women who see themselves as unfit for motherhood and instead tend to follow a violent soldier like life.

Until you have completed 90 days of sessions, without fail, emailing the same proof each time to that address, we will have no contact with you, and will remove you from social. This will give you the next three months alone to focus on yourself. At the end of those three months, we will speak with the therapist to verify that you are working hard and making progress. If that goes well, we may consider resuming some contact on a limited and probationary basis. Something like a monthly zoom call with the three of us for 15 minutes.\"\n\nSis: If you continue to make progress in therapy, we may be willing to add additional contact, such as having coffee every few months. If things go well over the next few years, and therapy shows great progress, then you will have the opportunity to earn your way back into our lives.\n\nYou: Finally, to be clear on the most important thing: if you choose not to go to therapy then we have made the decision that we are done, and today will be our final goodbye. If you are not willing to get better, then we simply need to move on with our lives, and you can figure out what you want to do with your own life without us. \n\nSis: This isn't negotiable. You either do it, or you will never be part of our lives again.\n\nYou: OK, well we have said what we have to say. Here is the paper with the therapists names and the email box of where to send your proof. We will check the email box in 10 days to see if you have provided the information required. If we do not see that, then we will stop checking the inbox for good and get on with our lives.\n\nSis: We both hope that you will make the right decision.
