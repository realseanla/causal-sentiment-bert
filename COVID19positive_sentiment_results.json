Didn't think much of it except that it was annoying as heck. Otherwise felt fine! I have IBS-C and SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth). I've had weird symptoms on and off for a while due to SIBO, so I tied it to that. Fast forward to Tuesday of this week. I had a really bad itchy nose. The air in our apartment is DRY. Like bad. I'm also allergy sensitive so I figured it was allergies. Then last night I began noticing that my nose was becoming a bit more wet, but not drippy. I also felt my throat getting scratchy. Again, I figured this was allergies. Benadryl didn't do a thing. I can't take cold medicine as it always sends me into a flare, so I haven't taken that as of yet. \n\nThis morning, I woke up with a 99.7 temperature. My throat was still irritated feeling and I noticed that my shoulders were extremely tight and sore. Like bricks. I felt energized, however. Today was a bad mental health day so I did some crying, and my nose was extremely runny from that, but then never recovered. It just stayed runny and stuffy, and now at 2:58 am I cannot breathe out of it at all. Nausea has kicked into high gear and I have zero appetite and feel my stomach hurting and grumbly. It's very uneasy, like I'm going to throw up or have diarrhea or both. Temp came down, but my body still feels hot. Other than the nausea, my nose is completely stuffed and my throat irritation comes and goes. We do have a window open because I'm hot. \n\nI've been tested for Covid 4 times in the past (for different reasons) and all times were negative. Testing is becoming very hard to get in my state (Oregon) due to high demand. Many places also require a virtual visit first. The soonest I can get anything anywhere is late on Tuesday. \n\nI'm curious if anyone believes this could be Covid or just a cold/allergies. The only way to be sure is get tested, so maybe I'll just sign up for something on Tuesday. To me this seems a bit more extreme for the allergy side. I genuinely feel a bit sick. I do have energy but tomorrow I'm sure I'll feel like shit as I can't sleep due to the nausea and inability to fuckin breathe. This sucks. I really did not want this before Christmas. My husband and I don't go anywhere and we do pickup or delivery for everything. I did get my haircut exactly 14 days ago, so there is that. I was desperate as my hair kept falling out and needed some serious TLC due to SIBO, but I understand this was a risk.

There's a very high chance that what you had in March was not SARS-CoV2. \n\nThere was another strain of coronavirus going through the US in first few months of 2020 & late 2019. That was part of a much heavier strain  of the \"flu\" virus. Obviously SARS-CoV2 is also a coronavirus but it's has long standing deleterious effects & its biology is non well known (probably cause it's new). SARS-CoV2 is causing the COVID-19 pandemic, other strains of coronavirus are not the cause of COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nVery much possible that you got one of the lighter versions of coronavirus / flu infections in March & then later on got the actual COVID-19 infection after thanksgiving. Second wave of infection has widely been reported to be a lot more intense among majority patients. So in the case that if you don't have PCR proof that your infection in March was really COVID-19, I would safely guess what you got on Thanksgiving was your first infection.

Just as a quick explanation of the treatment itself, though - the monoclonal antibody is kind of like the foam padding you might put on sharp corners around the house when you have toddlers. It blocks the tip of the spike protein that the virus uses to invade cells, reducing the percentage of virus particles that can successfully be replicated. Studies have found that early in the course of disease this is particularly helpful, as it slows the growth of the infection during its exponential expansion phase (where the virus can rapidly double and double again). Later in the course of disease, the symptoms are more often due to our own immune systems responding to the presence of the virus - here, the monoclonal antibody wouldn't yield much benefit, but it also wouldn't harm the patient. Because the antibody specifically binds to the viral spike protein, it's not going to cause any other issues.\n\nI would talk to your doctor about their recommendation when you go in - it sounds like your father might have been fortunate enough to have a mild course of disease, but doctors will give feedback that's informed by population-level statistics (I.e. for other patients in his situation, with his co-morbidities, etc how did their disease progress and/or respond to this treatment). \n\nWishing the best for you and your father - it sounds like you're doing all the right things!", "score": 1, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.012, "neu": 0.857, "pos": 0.131, "compound": 0.9839}}, "gfpwhb5": {"comment": "Thank you for your submission!\n\nPlease remember to read the rules and ensure your post aligns with the sub's purpose.\n\nWe are all going through a stressful time right now and any hateful comments will not be tolerated.\n\nLet's be supportive and kind during this time of despair.\n\nNow go wash your hands.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's a long story but I had to work right through it until I could get a positive test. I work a highly physical job where many days I'm the only one in my position, so yeah I was right there moving around heavy pallets all by myself while sniffling and coughing and in pain. When my positive test came back, I tried the whole \"bed rest\" thing, but again I lead a pretty active life coupled with my ADHD so I was up and about the whole time, even with the muscle aches I still gotta be up. This all made it really easy for me to bounce back and jump into working out.\n\nI saw an article someone posted to a fitness sub about people who are active dropping dead from blood clots when they try to return to physical activity. I got scared and called my doctor, who said that due to how new this disease is, there isn't any long-term well-backed research. According to the CDC-approved data, there is nothing special about COVID that is triggering blood clots or anything else that is getting posted online, but having certain underlying conditions is what triggers it. Another trigger is staying in the same position for too long, which is why the average office worker has a higher chance of developing blood clots vs a school teacher who is on their feet moving around all day. So, being on bed rest can cause blood clot complications since you've stayed in the same position for a very long time.\n\nDue to my medical history and the fact that I continued to be active while dealing with COVID, my doctor says I do not have any activity limitations and as long as I feel fine I should continue my journey to normalcy. She did mention that for the average person who gets sick and puts themselves on bed rest, they should practice great caution when returning to physical activity post COVID because the disease is so unpredictable at this point.\n\nMy favorite thing my doctor said during the call is is \"anytime you are presented an option to progress forward towards normalcy or move backwards towards regression, you should always choose to return to normalcy.\"", "score": 5, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.066, "neu": 0.803, "pos": 0.131, "compound": 0.9832}}, "gfnpz7d": {"comment": "Thank you for your submission!\n\nPlease remember to read the rules and ensure your post aligns with the sub's purpose.\n\nWe are all going through a stressful time right now and any hateful comments will not be tolerated.\n\nLet's be supportive and kind during this time of despair.\n\nNow go wash your hands.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There hadn't been any positive cases in their facility and we made a plan that once they did have a positive case we would try to figure out a way to keep them home. Well, my daughter came home with a clear runny nose one day. I thought it was just a small allergy thing. I used the nose Frieda on her. If you don't know what that is, look it up. Even though I thought it probably wasn't covid I still took a test to be sure. My first test came back negative (6 days after her coming home with the runny nose). The day I got my results back, I started feeling symptoms. I scheduled another test and started isolating. The second test came back positive. Besides that runny nose, she was completely fine. My other daughter was also completely fine. My husband has had 2 negative tests. So here is what I believe- children most of the time show little to know symptoms. I believe I got covid from my daughter who had to have picked it up at daycare. The facility believes they have no cases, but they obviously do. I also believe it is hard for kids to spread it to adults. My husband was around her and she sneezed directly in his face more than a few times (she's 18 months) and he is completely fine. I think the only reason I got it, is because I used that stupid nose Frieda on her, and basically sucked the virus directly into my lungs.

You've actually articulated it better than I've been able to. I try to explain it to my spouse and loved ones but after 9 months of never ending symptoms, I barely voice it anymore.\n\n I believe I contracted Covid-19 in March and it's been such a crazy long journey and endless stream of symptoms. Dizziness, heart thumping, breathing issues, insomnia, fatigue, etc. To sum it up, I tell those who ask that I had one body that I knew and loved my whole life up until March but post getting sick, I just don't recognize it, I can't rely on it, and just doesn't feel quite right like it used to. \n\n2 things I wanted to highlight that have really affected me that I don't hear many people talk about; just in case anyone out there has had a similar experience. \n\n1) How the difficulty breathing, heart palpitations, and overall trouble that I feel in my chest (of varying degrees at different times) brings that anxiety and sense of dread with it. Am I having a heart attack? Is this spell of difficult breathing the beginning of the end? I need more air. If this worsens will I need the ER? A ventilator?! Will my chest and breathing be like this forever? After 6 months of this my nerves were absolutely shot. 10 months later I'm more used to the varying symptoms when they arise but still get anxious every once in a while when they come on stronger than \"usual\" for no apparent reason. Also, I just can't bring myself to care as much and spend that emotional energy anymore. I find myself thinking well if this gets really bad, what happens happens. All I can do is monitor it and act accordingly. Which is kind of a sad but necessary place to get to considering it's my life and health. Also, I've had MRI's, EKG, Chest Scan, and blood tests along the way. My doc and cardiologist said everything looked normal. \n\n2) I'm a fit 41 year old guy. I've missed working out badly this year. Since July I've tried to start working out again. I've tried and stopped 5/6 times. Cardio is tough. I'm in LA and the fires and air quality this year made cardio a tough proposition. I can go light but not enough to sweat or I'm gasping for air and experiencing chest issues for the next day. So I try to weight train. I have a little set up at home. I can go light over a couple of days but if I ever train enough to get good and sore, I'll start experiencing flu like symptoms and It'll put me out for 5 days. Not like the full blown flu. More like the day before where you think, \"am I getting sick?\" I weight train very light for 4 days and then increase weight/reps. As soon as I do, I get sore and it feels good until I wake up the next morning feeling terrible. I'll have to stop it all together for a week. 5 times in a row this has happened and it's driving me crazy.\n\nAnyway, you're not alone in your experience. On one hand I recognize others have it worse off than me and many have even lost their lives. But I do mourn for my old body and the days of waking up feeling good and full of energy. I wish you all the best.

This virus sucks. No one can deny that. Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C, and a multivitamin if you aren't already. Drinks lots of water and hot beverages. Make sure you get up and move around a little bit each day. I have been told to make sure you take deep breaths a couple of times a day. Supposedly it helps prevent pneumonia. If you are having trouble breathing, lay on your stomach in the \"prone\" position.\n\nFor the loss of smell, I did an essential oil thing my sister called \"smell training\". It sounds hokey but I have most of my smell back. Pick two or three things (or essential oils) that you know the smell of really well. A couple of times a day, deeply inhale that scent and think about what it smells like for like 10 seconds. I did this with lavender, rose, and eucalyptus essential oils. I got my smell and taste back in three days. Again, it might be hokey but it worked for me and my sister.

I experienced chills and shivering, fever, loose stool and my arm felt like it was hit with a bat. But most of these symptoms went away the following day or two. I don't usually get any symptoms with the flu shot. After getting the 2nd shot of the vaccine, I started getting some peace of mind, and I do not regret my decision to participate.

Sweden reported mid-November that 150 people who had had PCR-confirmed COVID in the first wave (and recovered), caught it *again* in the second wave. That may not seem much, but actually, statistically, it is quite a lot, for the following reason. Sweden had about 70K confirmed cases in their first wave (~ March 1 until July 1), i.e. 0.7% of the population. They had about 100K confirmed cases in the second wave starting ~ Oct 1 at the time of that report (~ Nov 15). Let us assume first for simplicity that the probability of exposure in the second wave is approximately uncorrelated with having caught covid in the first wave. Then, *if* there was *no* post-infection immunity whatsoever left after 3 months, you'd expect 0.7% of those 100K second-wave cases until then, i.e. 700 cases, to consist of PCR-confirmed reinfections. The actual number, 150, was about 5 times less than that, suggesting a risk reduction by a factor of 5, on a time scale of about half a year. Or, in the vaccine lingo used these days: a protection efficacy of 80%, quite in line with phase 3 vaccine trial data so far (which,  keep in mind, have been running for a considerably shorter amount of time than half a year). \n\nNow, you could argue that those who got COVID in the first wave probably had a considerably higher exposure probability, including during the second wave, than the general population (eg due to the kind of work they are doing). Let's say 2 to 4 times higher. Then the above naive risk reduction estimate would get corrected from a factor 5 to a factor of 10 to 20, ie 90-95% protection efficacy, on a time scale of about half a year. That is as good as the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine performed on a time scale of 3 months. Indeed this would be fully in line with expectations: protection offered by vaccines is rarely stronger (on average) than protection offered by getting (and recovering from) the disease itself. \n\nSo, for sure, what this data (and vaccine trial data) suggests, is that getting COVID once offers significant protection for at least half a year, something like 80%-95%. But, evidently, it is not at all like, say, measles, which after getting it once provides ~100% protection for the rest of your life. \n\nAs for protection on longer time scales, like a year or two, either by vaccines or  infection: well, we'll know when that amount of time has passed. \n\nMy guess is that COVID is here to stay, but that vaccinations (and maybe mutations) will degrade it over the next year or so to something of no more concern, overall, than the seasonal flu, or perhaps even the common cold. But my guess is as good as yours. \n\nIt is what it is. We don't get to choose reality.

It continued into the weekend and come Sunday afternoon had the husband take me to urgent care. There is an outbreak of covid at my work right now, at least 10 people have popped positive in the last week, so urgent care gave me covid test and sent me on my way with a letter excusing me from work while waiting for results.

Went back to work Wednesday and then yesterday noticed the change in taste and smell.\n\nI can taste bitter and sour but no salty or sweet. I can smell some things like my husband's deodorant which typically would be way to strong for me and I can't stand it. Haven't completely lost taste and smell but greatly diminished.

Here's why I think these are just the tip of the iceberg:\n\n1.  Of the tens of millions of people who have caught it, the opportunity for reinfection is necessarily still low:  they need to have had it in the  first (spring) wave -- had enough time to recover -- and then still been in a location for the second (fall/winter) wave where there was opportunity to catch it.  This knocks out many of the Asian countries that got the virus under control (no opportunity for reinfection).  In the US, many of the hard-hit blue states from the first wave also lowered their numbers, so people there had less of an opportunity to catch it again (though that will change through the winter).  It also knocks out the millions of first-time covid patients who caught it during the second wave.  For those people, not enough time has passed to have an opportunity for reinfection.   So *the population of people who could have already been re-infected is really a much smaller number than the full population of people who have ever caught covid.*\n\n2.  The stories of spouses who have gotten reinfected (I think about me and my husband as an example):  these are genetically unrelated individuals both getting reinfected at the same time.  Yes, there are environmental similarities, but I think cases like these strongly suggest that we're not looking at \"certain pre-disposed individuals\" who may get reinfected.  I think it suggests a general human response to coronaviruses, when given the opportunity for reinfection after a period of time.\n\n3.  The tens of millions of cases of coronavirus around the world include a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases who were tested due to contact tracing or for other, non-symptomatic reasons.  If those individuals were infected again and were mild or asymptomatic, they would not be getting a test to find out.  (It also raises the possibility that people who were asymptomatic back in the spring but who have symptomatic covid now are actually reinfected rather than first-timers).  \n\n4.  Finally, these are only the stories that I, as one person, have been keeping track of over the past couple of months from Reddit.  I'm not doing a thorough search.  It also doesn't include all the anecdotal cases of reinfection that people are sharing in comments or on personal experience posts.   Moreover, these news stories only reflect cases that specifically got to the press.  It reminds me of early in the pandemic when we were told it was \"exceedingly rare\" to catch SARS-COV-2 in a western country... well, that's only because we weren't testing.  When you start testing (or looking around for something), you may find it's a lot more common.  These, I think, are just the tip of the iceberg, and for every case of reinfection that is being reported, there must be an immense number of them that are not..", "score": 4, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.028, "neu": 0.918, "pos": 0.054, "compound": 0.9336}}, "gf7bme3": {"comment": "People are downvoting your completely correct statement due to whatever reason", "score": 5, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.0, "neu": 1.0, "pos": 0.0, "compound": 0.0}}, "gf87euz": {"comment": "Vitamin D is an immunomodulator.

I cant really tell if it's just packaged in with tachycardia of course, being tachy just makes me breathe harder, but I certainly feel short of breath with POTS and do when exercising. \n\nHonestly, if you're walking around with a 120 hr it doesn't sound unlike POTS and since they've ruled out other conditions with all the testing, I think I'd call your cardiologist and specifically ask about POTS and a tilt table test. Beta blockers is already my medication personally but there are some other meds they do offer if this isn't doing enough for you. \n\n1. You absolutely must stay hydrated. People with POTS need to be drinking around 3 liters of water a day, it's a lot, but it helps the most in symptom management. In my worst tachycardia episodes, I just lay and sip water until it improves. NEVER LET YOURSELF be dehydrated. That's gonna be one of the worst things you can do. \n\n2. Salt, but talk to your doctor about this first. People with high blood pressure shouldn't be adding salt to their diet but if you have POTS with low BP, we also add a lot of sodium to our diet because the sodium + water increases blood volume and the more blood volume, the better your symptoms will be. Again, talk to your doctor first, make sure there isn't anything in your medical history that should prevent you from doing this and specifically mention the POTS because any cardiologist familiar with POTS will be able to give you a plan for your sodium intake. My cardiologist actually wanted to set me up with a dietician just to figure out how to make my diet more salty LOL so they help with this too. \n\n3. STAY COOL I can't stress enough that besides being dehydrated, heat is the thing that makes POTS worse and you may even notice you get hot way quicker than you used to especially with exercise. Even in the dead of winter, I work out with my AC blasting. When I leave my house, I bring ice packs. If youre having a tachy episode, grab an ice pack and sit with it. Don't take hot showers, I know, that sucks but a cooler shower will leave you feeling better afterward. Just generally stay cool and cool yourself down when your symptomatic. \n\n4. Just lay down if youre symptomatic at all, flat on your back. Don't even bother sitting up until your heart rate is under control, laying down is going to be the position you need to be in during an episode. \n\n\nAnd I totally get the inability to exercise, believe you me I think we all with POTS have suffered through that. But my advice to you now is if traditional exercise is not possible, try to at least do very very simple \"exercises\" in bed laying down. Just little leg lifts, some arm circles in bed. I know it doesn't feel like much but you have to REALLY work back up to exercise with POTS and it's going to be tiny increments. I did physical therapy at first and then when I could upgrade from easy exercises laying down, I had to start on my recumbent bike for like 3 minutes. Three minutes! And two of those minutes were warm-up and cool down lol! It's rough but you just keep inching and inching and doing at least A LITTLE BIT of exercise each day is what is going to improve POTS. \n\nBest of luck to you! I really hope you start to get relief soon. i'm glad youre on beta blockers at least cuz that tachycardia is a bitch.", "score": 3, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.073, "neu": 0.796, "pos": 0.131, "compound": 0.9912}}, "gf7l00h": {"comment": "As someone with dysautonomia (the umbrella term that POTS falls under), it is mostly just lifestyle changes.

I'm not currently taking any medications, but I drink a lot of LiquidIV (like super Gatorade) and that has been the biggest improvement for me.
