Two/CD distinct/JJ algorithms/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN to/TO extract/VB (/-LRB- schemata/NN of/IN )/-RRB- resolution/NN proofs/NNS from/IN closed/JJ tableaux/NN for/IN propositional/JJ schemata/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ one/CD handles/VBZ the/DT most/RBS efficient/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT tableau/NN calculus/NN but/CC generates/VBZ very/RB complex/JJ derivations/NNS (/-LRB- denoted/VBN by/IN rather/RB elaborate/JJ rewrite/VBP systems/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT second/JJ one/NN has/VBZ the/DT advantage/NN that/WDT much/RB simpler/JJR systems/NNS can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN ,/, however/RB the/DT considered/VBN proof/NN procedure/NN is/VBZ less/RBR efficient/JJ ./.
