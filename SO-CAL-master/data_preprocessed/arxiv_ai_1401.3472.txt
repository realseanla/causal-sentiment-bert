In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP knowledge/NN reasoning/NN within/IN a/DT simple/JJ framework/NN called/VBN knowledge/NN structure/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP variable/JJ forgetting/VBG as/IN a/DT basic/JJ operation/NN for/IN one/CD agent/NN to/IN reason/NN about/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ or/CC other/JJ agents/NNS \/SYM knowledge/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ framework/NN ,/, two/CD notions/NNS namely/RB agents/NNS \/SYM observable/JJ variables/NNS and/CC the/DT weakest/JJS sufficient/JJ condition/NN play/NN important/JJ roles/NNS in/IN knowledge/NN reasoning/NN ./.
Given/VBN a/DT background/NN knowledge/NN base/NN and/CC a/DT set/NN of/IN observable/JJ variables/NNS for/IN each/DT agent/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN an/DT agent/NN knowing/VBG a/DT formula/NN can/MD be/VB defined/VBN as/IN a/DT weakest/JJS sufficient/JJ condition/NN of/IN the/DT formula/NN under/IN background/NN knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP how/WRB to/TO capture/VB the/DT notion/NN of/IN common/JJ knowledge/NN by/IN using/VBG a/DT generalized/VBN notion/NN of/IN weakest/JJS sufficient/JJ condition/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN public/JJ announcement/NN operator/NN can/MD be/VB conveniently/RB dealt/VBN with/IN via/IN our/PRP$ notion/NN of/IN knowledge/NN structure/NN ./.
Further/RB ,/, we/PRP explore/VBP the/DT computational/JJ complexity/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN whether/IN an/DT epistemic/JJ formula/NN is/VBZ realized/VBN in/IN a/DT knowledge/NN structure/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT general/JJ case/NN ,/, this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ PSPACE/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ ;/: however/RB ,/, for/IN some/DT interesting/JJ subcases/NNS ,/, it/PRP can/MD be/VB reduced/VBN to/IN co-NP/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP discuss/VBP possible/JJ applications/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ framework/NN in/IN some/DT interesting/JJ domains/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT automated/VBN analysis/NN of/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN muddy/JJ children/NNS puzzle/NN and/CC the/DT verification/NN of/IN the/DT revised/VBN Needham/NNP -/HYPH Schroeder/NNP protocol/NN ./.
We/PRP believe/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ scenarios/NNS where/WRB the/DT natural/JJ presentation/NN of/IN the/DT available/JJ information/NN about/IN knowledge/NN is/VBZ under/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT knowledge/NN structure/NN ./.
What/WP makes/VBZ it/PRP valuable/JJ compared/VBN with/IN the/DT corresponding/VBG multi-agent/JJ S5/NN Kripke/NNP structure/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB much/RB more/RBR succinct/JJ ./.
