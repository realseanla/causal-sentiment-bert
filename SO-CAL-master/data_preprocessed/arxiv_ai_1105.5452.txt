The/DT notion/NN of/IN class/NN is/VBZ ubiquitous/JJ in/IN computer/NN science/NN and/CC is/VBZ central/JJ in/IN many/JJ formalisms/NNS for/IN the/DT representation/NN of/IN structured/JJ knowledge/NN used/VBN both/CC in/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN and/CC in/IN databases/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP study/VBP the/DT basic/JJ issues/NNS underlying/VBG such/JJ representation/NN formalisms/NNS and/CC single/JJ out/IN both/CC their/PRP$ common/JJ characteristics/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ distinguishing/JJ features/NNS ./.
Such/JJ investigation/NN leads/VBZ us/PRP to/TO propose/VB a/DT unifying/JJ framework/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO capture/VB the/DT fundamental/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN several/JJ representation/NN languages/NNS used/VBN in/IN different/JJ contexts/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN formalism/NN is/VBZ expressed/VBN in/IN the/DT style/NN of/IN description/NN logics/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN introduced/VBN in/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN as/IN a/DT means/NN to/TO provide/VB a/DT semantically/RB well/RB -/HYPH founded/VBN basis/NN for/IN the/DT structural/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN systems/NNS ./.
The/DT description/NN logic/NN considered/VBN in/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ a/DT subset/NN of/IN first/JJ order/NN logic/NN with/IN nice/JJ computational/JJ characteristics/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ quite/RB expressive/JJ and/CC features/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ combination/NN of/IN constructs/NNS that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN studied/VBN before/RB ./.
The/DT distinguishing/JJ constructs/NNS are/VBP number/NN restrictions/NNS ,/, which/WDT generalize/VBP existence/NN and/CC functional/JJ dependencies/NNS ,/, inverse/JJ roles/NNS ,/, which/WDT allow/VBP one/CD to/TO refer/VB to/IN the/DT inverse/NN of/IN a/DT relationship/NN ,/, and/CC possibly/RB cyclic/JJ assertions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP necessary/JJ for/IN capturing/VBG real/JJ world/NN domains/NNS ./.
We/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO show/VB that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ precisely/RB such/JJ combination/NN of/IN constructs/NNS that/WDT makes/VBZ our/PRP$ logic/NN powerful/JJ enough/JJ to/TO model/VB the/DT essential/JJ set/NN of/IN features/NNS for/IN defining/VBG class/NN structures/NNS that/WDT are/VBP common/JJ to/IN frame/NN systems/NNS ,/, object/NN -/HYPH oriented/VBN database/NN languages/NNS ,/, and/CC semantic/JJ data/NNS models/NNS ./.
As/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN the/DT established/VBN correspondences/NNS ,/, several/JJ significant/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT above/JJ formalisms/NNS become/VBP available/JJ ./.
The/DT high/JJ expressiveness/NN of/IN the/DT logic/NN we/PRP propose/VBP and/CC the/DT need/NN for/IN capturing/VBG the/DT reasoning/NN in/IN different/JJ contexts/NNS forces/VBZ us/PRP to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN unrestricted/JJ and/CC finite/JJ model/NN reasoning/NN ./.
A/DT notable/JJ feature/NN of/IN our/PRP$ proposal/NN is/VBZ that/IN reasoning/NN in/IN both/DT cases/NNS is/VBZ decidable/JJ ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN ,/, by/IN virtue/NN of/IN the/DT high/JJ expressive/JJ power/NN and/CC of/IN the/DT associated/VBN reasoning/NN capabilities/NNS on/IN both/DT unrestricted/JJ and/CC finite/JJ models/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ logic/NN provides/VBZ a/DT common/JJ core/NN for/IN class/NN -/HYPH based/VBN representation/NN formalisms/NNS ./.
