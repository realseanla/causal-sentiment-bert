Neural/JJ Machine/NN Translation/NN (/-LRB- NMT/NN )/-RRB- has/VBZ become/VBN the/DT new/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN in/IN several/JJ language/NN pairs/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP remains/VBZ a/DT challenging/JJ problem/NN how/WRB to/TO integrate/VB NMT/NN with/IN a/DT bilingual/JJ dictionary/NN which/WDT mainly/RB contains/VBZ words/NNS rarely/RB or/CC never/RB seen/VBN in/IN the/DT bilingual/JJ training/NN data/NNS ./.

The/DT core/NN idea/NN behind/RB is/VBZ to/TO design/VB novel/JJ models/NNS that/WDT transform/VBP the/DT bilingual/JJ dictionaries/NNS into/IN adequate/JJ sentence/NN pairs/NNS ,/, so/IN that/IN NMT/NNP can/MD distil/VB latent/JJ bilingual/JJ mappings/NNS from/IN the/DT ample/JJ and/CC repetitive/JJ phenomena/NNS ./.
