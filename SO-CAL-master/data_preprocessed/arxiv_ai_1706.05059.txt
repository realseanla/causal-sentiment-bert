Many/JJ existing/VBG global/JJ constraints/NNS can/MD be/VB encoded/VBN as/IN a/DT conjunction/NN of/IN among/IN constraints/NNS ./.
An/DT among/IN constraint/NN holds/VBZ if/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN the/DT variables/NNS in/IN its/PRP$ scope/NN whose/WP$ value/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN a/DT prespecified/VBN set/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP call/VBP its/PRP$ range/NN ,/, is/VBZ within/IN some/DT given/VBN bounds/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ known/VBN that/IN domain/NN filtering/NN algorithms/NNS can/MD benefit/VB from/IN reasoning/NN about/IN the/DT interaction/NN of/IN among/IN constraints/NNS so/IN that/IN values/NNS can/MD be/VB filtered/VBN out/RP taking/VBG into/IN consideration/NN several/JJ among/IN constraints/NNS simultaneously/RB ./.
The/DT present/JJ pa/NN -/HYPH per/IN embarks/NNS into/IN a/DT systematic/JJ investigation/NN on/IN the/DT circumstances/NNS under/IN which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO obtain/VB efficient/JJ and/CC complete/JJ domain/NN filtering/VBG algorithms/NNS for/IN conjunctions/NNS of/IN among/IN constraints/NNS ./.
We/PRP start/VBP by/IN observing/VBG that/DT restrictions/NNS on/IN both/CC the/DT scope/NN and/CC the/DT range/NN of/IN the/DT among/IN constraints/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ to/TO obtain/VB meaningful/JJ results/NNS ./.
