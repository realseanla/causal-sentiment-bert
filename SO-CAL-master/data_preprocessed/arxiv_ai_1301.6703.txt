A/DT conceptual/JJ foundation/NN for/IN approximation/NN of/IN belief/NN functions/NNS is/VBZ proposed/VBN and/CC investigated/VBN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN consistency/NN and/CC closeness/NN ./.
An/DT optimal/JJ approximation/NN is/VBZ studied/VBN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT computation/NN of/IN the/DT optimal/JJ approximation/NN turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO be/VB intractable/JJ ./.
Hence/RB ,/, various/JJ heuristic/NN methods/NNS are/VBP proposed/VBN and/CC experimantally/RB evaluated/VBN both/CC in/IN terms/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ accuracy/NN and/CC in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT speed/NN of/IN computation/NN ./.
These/DT methods/NNS are/VBP compared/VBN to/IN the/DT earlier/RBR proposed/VBN approximations/NNS of/IN belief/NN functions/NNS ./.
