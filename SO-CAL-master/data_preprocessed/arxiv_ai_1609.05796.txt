Understanding/VBG the/DT nature/NN of/IN dark/JJ energy/NN ,/, the/DT mysterious/JJ force/NN driving/VBG the/DT accelerated/VBN expansion/NN of/IN the/DT Universe/NNP ,/, is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ challenge/NN of/IN modern/JJ cosmology/NN ./.
The/DT next/JJ generation/NN of/IN cosmological/JJ surveys/NNS ,/, specifically/RB designed/VBN to/TO address/VB this/DT issue/NN ,/, rely/VBP on/IN accurate/JJ measurements/NNS of/IN the/DT apparent/JJ shapes/NNS of/IN distant/JJ galaxies/NNS ./.
