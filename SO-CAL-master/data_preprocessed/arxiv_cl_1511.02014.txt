We/PRP document/VBP an/DT apparently/RB spectacular/JJ relationship/NN between/IN population/NN size/NN and/CC lexical/JJ diversity/NN -/HYPH for/IN five/CD out/IN of/IN seven/CD investigated/VBN languages/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ relationship/NN between/IN population/NN size/NN and/CC lexical/JJ diversity/NN of/IN the/DT primary/JJ language/NN in/IN this/DT country/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN this/DT relationship/NN is/VBZ the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT misspecified/VBN model/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB consider/VB the/DT temporal/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS by/IN presenting/VBG a/DT similar/JJ but/CC nonsensical/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT global/JJ annual/JJ mean/NN sea/NN level/NN and/CC lexical/JJ diversity/NN ./.
