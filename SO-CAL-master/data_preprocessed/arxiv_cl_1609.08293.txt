This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT effects/NNS of/IN data/NNS size/NN and/CC frequency/NN range/NN on/IN distributional/JJ semantic/JJ models/NNS ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN representative/NN models/NNS for/IN several/JJ test/NN settings/NNS over/IN data/NNS of/IN varying/VBG sizes/NNS ,/, and/CC over/IN test/NN items/NNS of/IN various/JJ frequency/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN neural/JJ network/NN -/HYPH based/VBN models/NNS underperform/VBP when/WRB the/DT data/NNS is/VBZ small/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT most/RBS reliable/JJ model/NN over/IN data/NNS of/IN varying/VBG sizes/NNS and/CC frequency/NN ranges/NNS is/VBZ the/DT inverted/VBN factorized/VBN model/NN ./.
