The/DT early/JJ detection/NN ,/, diagnosis/NN and/CC monitoring/NN of/IN liver/NN cancer/NN progression/NN can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN with/IN the/DT precise/JJ delineation/NN of/IN metastatic/JJ tumours/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT unsupervised/JJ metastatic/JJ liver/NN tumour/NN segmentation/NN framework/NN using/VBG a/DT machine/NN learning/NN approach/NN based/VBN on/IN discriminant/JJ Grassmannian/JJ manifolds/NNS which/WDT learns/VBZ the/DT appearance/NN of/IN tumours/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/IN normal/JJ tissue/NN ./.
