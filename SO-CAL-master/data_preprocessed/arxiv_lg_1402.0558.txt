Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN is/VBZ the/DT notoriously/RB difficult/JJ problem/NN of/IN discovering/VBG a/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN that/WDT optimally/RB represents/VBZ a/DT given/VBN set/NN of/IN training/NN data/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP study/VBP the/DT computational/JJ worst/JJS -/HYPH case/NN complexity/NN of/IN exact/JJ Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN under/IN graph/NN theoretic/JJ restrictions/NNS on/IN the/DT (/-LRB- directed/VBN )/-RRB- super-structure/NN ./.
The/DT super-structure/NN is/VBZ an/DT undirected/JJ graph/NN that/WDT contains/VBZ as/IN subgraphs/NNS the/DT skeletons/NNS of/IN solution/NN networks/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT directed/VBN super-structure/NN as/IN a/DT natural/JJ generalization/NN of/IN its/PRP$ undirected/JJ counterpart/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS apply/VBP to/IN several/JJ variants/NNS of/IN score/NN -/HYPH based/VBN Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN where/WRB the/DT score/NN of/IN a/DT network/NN decomposes/VBZ into/IN local/JJ scores/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ nodes/NNS ./.
Results/NNS :/: We/PRP show/VBP that/IN exact/JJ Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN can/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN non-uniform/JJ polynomial/JJ time/NN if/IN the/DT super-structure/NN has/VBZ bounded/VBN treewidth/JJ ,/, and/CC in/IN linear/JJ time/NN if/IN in/IN addition/NN the/DT super-structure/NN has/VBZ bounded/VBN maximum/JJ degree/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN if/IN the/DT directed/VBN super-structure/NN is/VBZ acyclic/JJ ,/, then/RB exact/RB Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN can/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP in/IN quadratic/JJ time/NN ./.
We/PRP complement/VBP these/DT positive/JJ results/NNS with/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN hardness/NN results/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN both/DT restrictions/NNS (/-LRB- treewidth/JJ and/CC degree/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP essential/JJ and/CC can/MD not/RB be/VB dropped/VBN without/IN loosing/VBG uniform/JJ polynomial/JJ time/NN tractability/NN (/-LRB- subject/NN to/IN a/DT complexity/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ assumption/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Similarly/RB ,/, exact/JJ Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN remains/VBZ NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ for/IN "/`` almost/RB acyclic/JJ "/`` directed/VBN super-structures/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT restrictions/NNS remain/VBP essential/JJ if/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB search/VB for/IN a/DT globally/RB optimal/JJ network/NN but/CC aim/VB to/TO improve/VB a/DT given/VBN network/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN at/IN most/RBS k/CD arc/NN additions/NNS ,/, arc/NN deletions/NNS ,/, or/CC arc/NN reversals/NNS (/-LRB- k/CD -/SYM neighborhood/NN local/JJ search/NN )/-RRB- ./.
