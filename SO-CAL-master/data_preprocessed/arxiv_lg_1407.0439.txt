This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ about/IN authenticating/VBG genuine/JJ van/NNP Gogh/NNP paintings/NNS from/IN forgeries/NNS ./.
The/DT authentication/NN process/NN depends/VBZ on/IN two/CD key/JJ steps/NNS :/: feature/NN extraction/NN and/CC outlier/NN detection/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT geometric/JJ tight/JJ frame/NN and/CC some/DT low/JJ order/NN moment/NN statistics/NNS of/IN the/DT tight/JJ frame/NN coefficients/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO extract/VB features/NNS from/IN the/DT paintings/NNS ./.
Then/RB a/DT forward/JJ stage-wise/NN rank/NN boosting/VBG is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO select/VB a/DT small/JJ set/NN of/IN features/NNS for/IN more/RBR accurate/JJ classification/NN so/IN that/IN van/NNP Gogh/NNP paintings/NNS are/VBP highly/RB concentrated/JJ towards/IN some/DT center/NN point/NN while/IN forgeries/NNS are/VBP spread/VBN out/RP as/IN outliers/NNS ./.
Numerical/NNP results/VBZ on/IN leave/NN -/HYPH one/CD -/HYPH out/IN cross-validation/NN show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/JJ method/NN can/MD achieve/VB a/DT 87/CD percent/NN classification/NN accuracy/NN which/WDT is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN any/DT reported/VBN in/IN literature/NN so/RB far/RB ./.
Even/RB with/IN only/RB 4/CD features/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN can/MD give/VB a/DT 84/CD percent/NN classification/NN accuracy/NN ,/, indicating/VBG a/DT highly/RB consistent/JJ style/NN in/IN van/NNP Gogh/NNP 's/POS brushstroke/NN movements/NNS ./.
