In/IN Pawlak/NNP 's/POS rough/JJ set/NN theory/NN ,/, each/DT rough/JJ set/NN is/VBZ approximated/VBN by/IN a/DT pair/NN of/IN lower/JJR and/CC upper/JJ approximations/NNS ./.
To/TO measure/VB numerically/RB the/DT roughness/NN of/IN an/DT approximation/NN ,/, Pawlak/NNP introduced/VBD a/DT quantitative/JJ measure/NN of/IN roughness/NN by/IN using/VBG the/DT ratio/NN of/IN the/DT cardinalities/NNS of/IN the/DT lower/JJR and/CC upper/JJ approximations/NNS ./.
Although/IN the/DT roughness/NN measure/NN is/VBZ effective/JJ ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ the/DT drawback/NN of/IN not/RB being/VBG strictly/RB monotonic/JJ with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT standard/JJ ordering/NN on/IN partitions/NNS ./.
Recently/RB ,/, some/DT improvements/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN by/IN taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT granularity/NN of/IN partitions/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP approach/VBP the/DT roughness/NN measure/NN in/IN an/DT axiomatic/JJ way/NN ./.
After/IN axiomatically/RB defining/VBG roughness/NN measure/NN and/CC partition/NN measure/NN ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP a/DT unified/JJ construction/NN of/IN roughness/NN measure/NN ,/, called/VBN generalized/VBN Pawlak/NNP roughness/NN measure/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB explore/VB the/DT properties/NNS of/IN this/DT measure/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT improved/VBN roughness/NN measures/NNS in/IN the/DT literature/NN are/VBP special/JJ instances/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ generalized/VBN Pawlak/NNP roughness/NN measure/NN and/CC introduce/VB three/CD more/JJR generalized/VBN Pawlak/NNP roughness/NN measures/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT advantage/NN of/IN our/PRP$ axiomatic/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ that/IN some/DT properties/NNS of/IN a/DT roughness/NN measure/NN follow/VB immediately/RB as/RB soon/RB as/IN the/DT measure/NN satisfies/VBZ the/DT relevant/JJ axiomatic/JJ definition/NN ./.
