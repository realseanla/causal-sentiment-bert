The/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ AND/CC //, OR/CC importance/NN sampling/NN for/IN probabilistic/JJ graphical/JJ models/NNS ./.
In/IN contrast/NN to/IN importance/NN sampling/NN ,/, AND/CC //, OR/CC importance/NN sampling/NN caches/NNS samples/NNS in/IN the/DT AND/CC //SYM OR/CC space/NN and/CC then/RB extracts/NNS a/DT new/JJ sample/NN mean/NN from/IN the/DT stored/VBN samples/NNS ./.
We/PRP prove/VBP that/IN AND/CC //, OR/CC importance/NN sampling/NN may/MD have/VB lower/JJR variance/NN than/IN importance/NN sampling/NN ;/: thereby/RB providing/VBG a/DT theoretical/JJ justification/NN for/IN preferring/VBG it/PRP over/IN importance/NN sampling/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ empirical/JJ evaluation/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN AND/CC //, OR/CC importance/NN sampling/NN is/VBZ far/RB more/RBR accurate/JJ than/IN importance/NN sampling/NN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ./.
