ListNet/NNP is/VBZ a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN listwise/NN learning/NN to/IN rank/NN model/NN and/CC has/VBZ gained/VBN much/JJ attention/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.
A/DT particular/JJ problem/NN of/IN ListNet/NNP ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT high/JJ computation/NN complexity/NN in/IN model/NN training/NN ,/, mainly/RB due/IN to/IN the/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN object/NN permutations/NNS involved/VBN in/IN computing/VBG the/DT gradients/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT stochastic/JJ ListNet/NNP approach/NN which/WDT computes/VBZ the/DT gradient/NN within/IN a/DT bounded/VBN permutation/NN subset/NN ./.
