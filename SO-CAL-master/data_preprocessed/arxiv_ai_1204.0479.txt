The/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ an/DT ant/NN colony/NN optimization/NN metaheuristic/NN for/IN collaborative/JJ planning/NN ./.
Collaborative/JJ planning/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO coordinate/VB individual/JJ plans/NNS of/IN self/NN -/HYPH interested/JJ decision/NN makers/NNS with/IN private/JJ information/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO increase/VB the/DT overall/JJ benefit/NN of/IN the/DT coalition/NN ./.
The/DT method/NN consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT new/JJ search/NN graph/NN based/VBN on/IN encoded/VBN solutions/NNS ./.
Distributed/VBN and/CC private/JJ information/NN is/VBZ integrated/VBN via/IN voting/NN mechanisms/NNS and/CC via/IN a/DT simple/JJ but/CC effective/JJ collaborative/JJ local/JJ search/NN procedure/NN ./.
The/DT approach/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/IN a/DT distributed/VBN variant/NN of/IN the/DT multi-level/JJ lot/NN -/HYPH sizing/VBG problem/NN and/CC evaluated/VBN by/IN means/NNS of/IN 352/CD benchmark/NN instances/NNS from/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN clearly/RB outperforms/VBZ existing/VBG approaches/NNS on/IN the/DT sets/NNS of/IN medium/NN and/CC large/JJ sized/JJ instances/NNS ./.
While/IN the/DT best/JJS method/NN in/IN the/DT literature/NN so/RB far/RB achieves/VBZ an/DT average/JJ deviation/NN from/IN the/DT best/RBS known/VBN non-distributed/JJ solutions/NNS of/IN 46/CD percent/NN for/IN the/DT set/NN of/IN the/DT largest/JJS instances/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, the/DT presented/VBN approach/NN reduces/VBZ the/DT average/JJ deviation/NN to/IN only/RB 5/CD percent/NN ./.
