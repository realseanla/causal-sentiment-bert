Text/VB segmentation/NN (/-LRB- TS/NN )/-RRB- aims/VBZ at/IN dividing/VBG long/JJ text/NN into/IN coherent/JJ segments/NNS which/WDT reflect/VBP the/DT subtopic/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT text/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ beneficial/JJ to/IN many/JJ natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN tasks/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Information/NNP Retrieval/NNP (/-LRB- IR/NN )/-RRB- and/CC document/NN summarisation/NN ./.
Current/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN text/NN segmentation/NN are/VBP similar/JJ in/IN that/IN they/PRP all/DT use/VBP word/NN -/HYPH frequency/NN metrics/NNS to/TO measure/VB the/DT similarity/NN between/IN two/CD regions/NNS of/IN text/NN ,/, so/IN that/IN a/DT document/NN is/VBZ segmented/JJ based/VBN on/IN the/DT lexical/JJ cohesion/NN between/IN its/PRP$ words/NNS ./.
Various/JJ NLP/NN tasks/NNS are/VBP now/RB moving/VBG towards/IN the/DT semantic/JJ web/NN and/CC ontologies/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN ontology/NN -/HYPH based/VBN IR/NN systems/NNS ,/, to/TO capture/VB the/DT conceptualizations/NNS associated/VBN with/IN user/NN needs/NNS and/CC contents/NNS ./.
Text/VB segmentation/NN based/VBN on/IN lexical/JJ cohesion/NN between/IN words/NNS is/VBZ hence/RB not/RB sufficient/JJ anymore/RB for/IN such/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ OntoSeg/NNP ,/, a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN to/IN text/NN segmentation/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT ontological/JJ similarity/NN between/IN text/NN blocks/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN uses/VBZ ontological/JJ similarity/NN to/TO explore/VB conceptual/JJ relations/NNS between/IN text/NN segments/NNS and/CC a/DT Hierarchical/JJ Agglomerative/JJ Clustering/NN (/-LRB- HAC/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN to/TO represent/VB the/DT text/NN as/IN a/DT tree/NN -/HYPH like/JJ hierarchy/NN that/WDT is/VBZ conceptually/RB structured/VBN ./.
The/DT rich/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT created/VBN tree/NN further/JJ allows/VBZ the/DT segmentation/NN of/IN text/NN in/IN a/DT linear/JJ fashion/NN at/IN various/JJ levels/NNS of/IN granularity/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN was/VBD evaluated/VBN on/IN a/DT wellknown/JJ dataset/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT results/NNS show/VBP that/IN using/VBG ontological/JJ similarity/NN in/IN text/NN segmentation/NN is/VBZ very/RB promising/JJ ./.
Also/RB we/PRP enhance/VB the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN by/IN combining/VBG ontological/JJ similarity/NN with/IN lexical/JJ similarity/NN and/CC the/DT results/NNS show/VBP an/DT enhancement/NN of/IN the/DT segmentation/NN quality/NN ./.
