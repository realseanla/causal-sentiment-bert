Interior/NNP point/NN methods/NNS and/CC random/JJ walk/NN approaches/NNS have/VBP been/VBN long/RB considered/VBN disparate/JJ approaches/NNS for/IN convex/NN optimization/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP how/WRB simulated/JJ annealing/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS common/JJ random/JJ walk/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, is/VBZ equivalent/JJ ,/, in/IN a/DT certain/JJ sense/NN ,/, to/IN the/DT central/JJ path/NN interior/NN point/NN algorithm/NN applied/VBD to/IN the/DT entropic/JJ universal/JJ barrier/NN function/NN ./.
