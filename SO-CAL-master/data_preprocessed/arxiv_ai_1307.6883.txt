A/DT prototype/NN tool/NN to/TO assist/VB architects/NNS during/IN the/DT early/JJ design/NN stage/NN of/IN floor/NN plans/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN developed/VBN ,/, consisting/VBG of/IN an/DT Evolutionary/NNP Program/NNP for/IN the/DT Space/NNP Allocation/NNP Problem/NNP (/-LRB- EPSAP/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT generates/VBZ sets/NNS of/IN floor/NN plan/NN alternatives/NNS according/VBG to/IN the/DT architect/NN 's/POS preferences/NNS ;/: and/CC a/DT Floor/NN Plan/NN Performance/NN Optimization/NN Program/NN (/-LRB- FPOP/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT optimizes/VBZ the/DT selected/VBN solutions/NNS according/VBG to/IN thermal/JJ performance/NN criteria/NNS ./.
The/DT design/NN variables/NNS subject/JJ to/IN optimization/NN are/VBP window/NN position/NN and/CC size/NN ,/, overhangs/NNS ,/, fins/NNS ,/, wall/NN positioning/NN ,/, and/CC building/VBG orientation/NN ./.
A/DT procedure/NN using/VBG a/DT transformation/NN operator/NN with/IN gradient/NN descent/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN behavior/NN ,/, coupled/VBN with/IN a/DT dynamic/JJ simulation/NN engine/NN was/VBD developed/VBN for/IN the/DT thermal/JJ evaluation/NN and/CC optimization/NN process/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT need/NN to/TO evaluate/VB all/DT possible/JJ alternatives/NNS regarding/VBG designing/VBG variables/NNS being/VBG used/VBN during/IN the/DT optimization/NN process/NN leads/VBZ to/IN an/DT intensive/JJ use/NN of/IN thermal/JJ simulation/NN ,/, which/WDT dramatically/RB increases/VBZ the/DT simulation/NN time/NN ,/, rendering/VBG it/PRP unpractical/JJ ./.
An/DT alternative/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ a/DT smart/JJ optimization/NN approach/NN ,/, which/WDT utilizes/VBZ an/DT oriented/VBN and/CC adaptive/JJ search/NN technique/NN to/TO efficiently/RB find/VB the/DT near/JJ optimum/JJ solution/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ the/DT search/NN methodology/NN for/IN the/DT building/NN orientation/NN of/IN floor/NN plan/NN designs/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT corresponding/VBG efficiency/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN indicators/NNS ./.
The/DT calculations/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN 100/CD floor/NN plan/NN designs/VBZ generated/VBN by/IN EPSAP/NNP ./.
All/DT floor/NN plans/NNS have/VBP the/DT same/JJ design/NN program/NN ,/, location/NN ,/, and/CC weather/NN data/NNS ,/, changing/VBG only/RB their/PRP$ geometry/NN ./.
