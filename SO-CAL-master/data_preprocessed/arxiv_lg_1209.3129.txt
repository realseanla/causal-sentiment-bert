Reservoir/NNP computing/NN is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ ,/, powerful/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ machine/NN learning/VBG technique/NN that/WDT is/VBZ easily/RB implemented/VBN in/IN hardware/NN ./.
Recently/RB ,/, by/IN using/VBG a/DT time/NN -/HYPH multiplexed/VBN architecture/NN ,/, hardware/NN reservoir/NN computers/NNS have/VBP reached/VBN performance/NN comparable/JJ to/IN digital/JJ implementations/NNS ./.
Operating/VBG speeds/NNS allowing/VBG for/IN real/JJ time/NN information/NN operation/NN have/VBP been/VBN reached/VBN using/VBG optoelectronic/JJ systems/NNS ./.
At/IN present/JJ the/DT main/JJ performance/NN bottleneck/NN is/VBZ the/DT readout/NN layer/NN which/WDT uses/VBZ slow/RB ,/, digital/JJ postprocessing/NN ./.
