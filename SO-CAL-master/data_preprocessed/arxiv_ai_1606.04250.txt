The/DT amount/NN of/IN digitally/RB available/JJ but/CC heterogeneous/JJ information/NN about/IN the/DT world/NN is/VBZ remarkable/JJ ,/, and/CC new/JJ technologies/NNS such/JJ as/IN self/NN -/HYPH driving/VBG cars/NNS ,/, smart/JJ homes/NNS or/CC the/DT "/`` internet/NN of/IN things/NNS "/'' will/MD further/RBR increase/VB it/PRP ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP examine/VBP certain/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN how/WRB such/JJ heterogeneous/JJ information/NN can/MD be/VB harnessed/VBN by/IN intelligent/JJ agents/NNS ./.
We/PRP first/RB discuss/VBP potentials/NNS and/CC limitations/NNS of/IN some/DT existing/VBG approaches/NNS ,/, followed/VBN by/IN two/CD investigations/NNS ./.
The/DT focus/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ investigation/NN is/VBZ on/IN using/VBG the/DT novel/JJ experimentation/NN platform/NN {/-LRB- \/SYM em/PRP Malmo/NNP }/-RRB- to/TO obtain/VB a/DT better/JJR understanding/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.
The/DT focus/NN of/IN the/DT second/JJ investigation/NN is/VBZ on/IN understanding/VBG how/WRB information/NN about/IN the/DT hardware/NN of/IN different/JJ agents/NNS (/-LRB- such/JJ as/IN self/NN -/HYPH driving/VBG cars/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT agents/NNS '/POS sensory/JJ data/NNS ,/, and/CC physical/JJ or/CC causal/JJ information/NN can/MD be/VB utilized/VBN for/IN knowledge/NN transfer/NN between/IN agents/NNS and/CC subsequent/JJ more/JJR data/NN -/HYPH efficient/JJ decision/NN making/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP some/DT thoughts/NNS on/IN what/WP a/DT general/JJ theory/NN for/IN the/DT problem/NN could/MD look/VB like/IN ,/, and/CC formulate/VB open/JJ questions/NNS ./.
