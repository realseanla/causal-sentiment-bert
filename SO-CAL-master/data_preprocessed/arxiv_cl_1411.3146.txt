The/DT mathematical/JJ representation/NN of/IN semantics/NNS is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ issue/NN for/IN Natural/NNP Language/NNP Processing/NNP (/-LRB- NLP/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
A/DT lot/NN of/IN research/NN has/VBZ been/VBN devoted/VBN to/IN finding/VBG ways/NNS of/IN representing/VBG the/DT semantics/NNS of/IN individual/JJ words/NNS in/IN vector/NN spaces/NNS ./.
