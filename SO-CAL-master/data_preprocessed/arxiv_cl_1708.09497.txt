Human/JJ engagement/NN in/IN narrative/NN is/VBZ partially/RB driven/VBN by/IN reasoning/NN about/IN discourse/NN relations/NNS between/IN narrative/NN events/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT expectations/NNS about/IN what/WP is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO happen/VB next/JJ that/IN results/NNS from/IN such/JJ reasoning/NN ./.
Researchers/NNS in/IN NLP/NNP have/VBP tackled/VBN modeling/VBG such/JJ expectations/NNS from/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN perspectives/NNS ,/, including/VBG treating/VBG it/PRP as/IN the/DT inference/NN of/IN the/DT contingent/JJ discourse/NN relation/NN ,/, or/CC as/IN a/DT type/NN of/IN common/JJ -/HYPH sense/NN causal/NN reasoning/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ to/TO model/VB likelihood/NN between/IN events/NNS by/IN drawing/VBG on/IN several/JJ of/IN these/DT lines/NNS of/IN previous/JJ work/NN ./.
We/PRP implement/VBP and/CC evaluate/VBP different/JJ unsupervised/JJ methods/NNS for/IN learning/VBG event/NN pairs/NNS that/WDT are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO be/VB contingent/JJ on/IN one/CD another/DT ./.
We/PRP refine/VBP event/NN pairs/NNS that/WDT we/PRP learn/VBP from/IN a/DT corpus/NN of/IN film/NN scene/NN descriptions/NNS utilizing/VBG web/NN search/NN counts/NNS ,/, and/CC evaluate/VB our/PRP$ results/NNS by/IN collecting/VBG human/JJ judgments/NNS of/IN contingency/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN web/NN search/NN counts/VBZ increases/VBZ the/DT average/JJ accuracy/NN of/IN our/PRP$ best/JJS method/NN to/TO 85.64/CD percent/NN over/IN a/DT baseline/NN of/IN 50/CD percent/NN ,/, as/IN compared/VBN to/IN an/DT average/JJ accuracy/NN of/IN 75.15/CD percent/NN without/IN web/NN search/NN ./.
