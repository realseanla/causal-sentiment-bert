We/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ abductive/JJ ,/, probabilistic/JJ theory/NN of/IN plan/NN recognition/NN ./.
This/DT model/NN differs/VBZ from/IN previous/JJ plan/NN recognition/NN theories/NNS in/IN being/VBG centered/VBN around/IN a/DT model/NN of/IN plan/NN execution/NN :/: most/RBS previous/JJ methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN based/VBN on/IN plans/NNS as/IN formal/JJ objects/NNS or/CC on/IN rules/NNS describing/VBG the/DT recognition/NN process/NN ./.
