Estimating/VBG statistical/JJ models/NNS within/IN sensor/NN networks/NNS requires/VBZ distributed/VBN algorithms/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT both/DT data/NNS and/CC computation/NN are/VBP distributed/VBN across/IN the/DT nodes/NNS of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT general/JJ approach/NN for/IN distributed/VBN learning/NN based/VBN on/IN combining/VBG local/JJ estimators/NNS defined/VBN by/IN pseudo-likelihood/NN components/NNS ,/, encompassing/VBG a/DT number/NN of/IN combination/NN methods/NNS ,/, and/CC provide/VB both/DT theoretical/JJ and/CC experimental/JJ analysis/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN simple/JJ linear/JJ combination/NN or/CC max/NN -/HYPH voting/NN methods/NNS ,/, when/WRB combined/VBN with/IN second/JJ -/HYPH order/NN information/NN ,/, are/VBP statistically/RB competitive/JJ with/IN more/JJR advanced/JJ and/CC costly/JJ joint/JJ optimization/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ algorithms/NNS have/VBP many/JJ attractive/JJ properties/NNS including/VBG low/JJ communication/NN and/CC computational/JJ cost/NN and/CC "/`` any/DT -/HYPH time/NN "/'' behavior/NN ./.
