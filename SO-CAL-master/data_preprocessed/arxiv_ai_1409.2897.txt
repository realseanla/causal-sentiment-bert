Handwriting/NN is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ and/CC versatile/JJ method/NN for/IN human/JJ -/HYPH computer/NN interaction/NN ,/, especially/RB on/IN small/JJ mobile/JJ devices/NNS such/JJ as/IN smart/JJ phones/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, as/IN handwriting/NN varies/VBZ significantly/RB from/IN person/NN to/IN person/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO design/VB handwriting/NN recognizers/NNS that/WDT perform/VBP well/RB for/IN all/DT users/NNS ./.
A/DT natural/JJ solution/NN is/VBZ to/TO use/VB machine/NN learning/NN to/TO adapt/VB the/DT recognizer/NN to/IN the/DT user/NN ./.
One/CD complicating/VBG factor/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, as/IN the/DT computer/NN adapts/VBZ to/IN the/DT user/NN ,/, the/DT user/NN also/RB adapts/VBZ to/IN the/DT computer/NN and/CC probably/RB changes/VBZ their/PRP$ handwriting/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN co-adaptation/NN ,/, a/DT process/NN in/IN which/WDT both/CC the/DT computer/NN and/CC the/DT user/NN are/VBP adapting/VBG their/PRP$ behaviors/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT speed/NN and/CC accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT communication/NN through/IN handwriting/NN ./.
We/PRP devised/VBD an/DT information/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ framework/NN for/IN quantifying/VBG the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN a/DT handwriting/NN system/NN where/WRB the/DT system/NN includes/VBZ both/CC the/DT user/NN and/CC the/DT computer/NN ./.
Using/VBG this/DT framework/NN ,/, we/PRP analyzed/VBD data/NNS collected/VBN from/IN an/DT adaptive/JJ handwriting/NN recognition/NN system/NN and/CC characterized/VBD the/DT impact/NN of/IN machine/NN adaptation/NN and/CC of/IN human/JJ adaptation/NN ./.
We/PRP found/VBD that/IN both/DT machine/NN adaptation/NN and/CC human/JJ adaptation/NN have/VBP significant/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT input/NN rate/NN and/CC must/MD be/VB considered/VBN together/RB in/IN order/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN as/IN a/DT whole/JJ ./.
