In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT preliminary/JJ work/NN on/IN an/DT approach/NN to/TO fill/VB the/DT gap/NN between/IN logic/NN -/HYPH based/VBN argumentation/NN and/CC the/DT numerous/JJ approaches/NNS to/TO tackle/VB the/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN abstract/JJ argumentation/NN frameworks/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ idea/NN is/VBZ that/IN ,/, even/RB when/WRB arguments/NNS and/CC attacks/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN by/IN means/NNS of/IN a/DT logical/JJ belief/NN base/NN ,/, there/EX may/MD be/VB some/DT uncertainty/NN about/IN how/WRB accurate/JJ is/VBZ the/DT content/NN of/IN an/DT argument/NN ,/, and/CC so/IN the/DT presence/NN (/-LRB- or/CC absence/NN )/-RRB- of/IN attacks/NNS concerning/VBG it/PRP ./.
We/PRP use/VBP enthymemes/NNS to/TO illustrate/VB this/DT notion/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN of/IN arguments/NNS and/CC attacks/NNS ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, as/IN argued/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN ,/, real/JJ arguments/NNS are/VBP often/RB enthymemes/NNS instead/RB of/IN completely/RB specified/VBN deductive/JJ arguments/NNS ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN some/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT pair/NN (/-LRB- support/NN ,/, claim/NN )/-RRB- may/MD be/VB missing/VBG because/IN they/PRP are/VBP supposed/VBN to/TO belong/VB to/IN some/DT "/`` common/JJ knowledge/NN "/'' ,/, and/CC then/RB should/MD be/VB deduced/VBN by/IN the/DT agent/NN which/WDT receives/VBZ the/DT enthymeme/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT perception/NN that/IN agents/NNS have/VBP of/IN the/DT common/JJ knowledge/NN may/MD be/VB wrong/JJ ,/, and/CC then/RB a/DT first/JJ agent/NN may/MD state/VB an/DT enthymeme/NN that/WDT her/PRP$ opponent/NN is/VBZ not/RB able/JJ to/TO decode/VB in/IN an/DT accurate/JJ way/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ likely/JJ that/IN the/DT decoding/NN of/IN the/DT enthymeme/NN by/IN the/DT agent/NN leads/VBZ to/IN mistaken/JJ attacks/NNS between/IN this/DT new/JJ argument/NN and/CC the/DT existing/JJ ones/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT case/NN ,/, the/DT agent/NN can/MD receive/VB some/DT information/NN about/IN attacks/NNS or/CC arguments/NNS acceptance/NN statuses/NNS which/WDT disagree/VBP with/IN her/PRP$ argumentation/NN framework/NN ./.
We/PRP exemplify/VBP a/DT way/NN to/TO incorporate/VB this/DT new/JJ piece/NN of/IN information/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN existing/VBG works/NNS on/IN the/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN abstract/JJ argumentation/NN frameworks/NNS ./.
