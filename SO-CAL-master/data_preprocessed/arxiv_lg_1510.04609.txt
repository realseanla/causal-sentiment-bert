The/DT increasing/VBG complexity/NN of/IN deep/JJ learning/NN architectures/NNS is/VBZ resulting/VBG in/IN training/NN time/NN requiring/VBG weeks/NNS or/CC even/RB months/NNS ./.
This/DT slow/JJ training/NN is/VBZ due/JJ in/IN part/NN to/IN vanishing/VBG gradients/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT gradients/NNS used/VBN by/IN back/RB -/HYPH propagation/NN are/VBP extremely/RB large/JJ for/IN weights/NNS connecting/VBG deep/JJ layers/NNS (/-LRB- layers/NNS near/IN the/DT output/NN layer/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC extremely/RB small/JJ for/IN shallow/JJ layers/NNS (/-LRB- near/IN the/DT input/NN layer/NN )/-RRB- ;/: this/DT results/VBZ in/IN slow/JJ learning/NN in/IN the/DT shallow/JJ layers/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP attempt/VBP to/TO overcome/VB the/DT two/CD above/IN problems/NNS by/IN proposing/VBG an/DT optimization/NN method/NN for/IN training/NN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS which/WDT uses/VBZ learning/NN rates/NNS which/WDT are/VBP both/DT specific/JJ to/IN each/DT layer/NN in/IN the/DT network/NN and/CC adaptive/JJ to/IN the/DT curvature/NN of/IN the/DT function/NN ,/, increasing/VBG the/DT learning/NN rate/NN at/IN low/JJ curvature/NN points/NNS ./.
This/DT enables/VBZ us/PRP to/TO speed/VB up/RP learning/VBG in/IN the/DT shallow/JJ layers/NNS of/IN the/DT network/NN and/CC quickly/RB escape/VB high/JJ -/HYPH error/NN low/JJ curvature/NN saddle/NN points/NNS ./.
We/PRP test/VBP our/PRP$ method/NN on/IN standard/JJ image/NN classification/NN datasets/NNS such/JJ as/IN MNIST/NNP ,/, CIFAR10/NN and/CC ImageNet/NNP ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN increases/VBZ accuracy/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN reduces/VBZ the/DT required/JJ training/NN time/NN over/IN standard/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
