This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT study/NN of/IN the/DT dynamic/JJ coupling/NN between/IN a/DT user/NN and/CC a/DT virtual/JJ character/NN during/IN body/NN interaction/NN ./.
Coupling/NN is/VBZ directly/RB linked/VBN with/IN other/JJ dimensions/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN co-presence/NN ,/, engagement/NN ,/, and/CC believability/NN ,/, and/CC was/VBD measured/VBN in/IN an/DT experiment/NN that/WDT allowed/VBD users/NNS to/TO describe/VB their/PRP$ subjective/JJ feelings/NNS about/IN those/DT dimensions/NNS of/IN interest/NN ./.
The/DT experiment/NN was/VBD based/VBN on/IN a/DT theatrical/JJ game/NN involving/VBG the/DT imitation/NN of/IN slow/JJ upper/JJ -/HYPH body/NN movements/NNS and/CC the/DT proposal/NN of/IN new/JJ movements/NNS by/IN the/DT user/NN and/CC virtual/JJ agent/NN ./.
The/DT agent/NN 's/POS behaviour/NN varied/VBD in/IN autonomy/NN :/: the/DT agent/NN could/MD limit/VB itself/PRP to/IN imitating/VBG the/DT user/NN 's/POS movements/NNS only/RB ,/, initiate/VBP new/JJ movements/NNS ,/, or/CC combine/VB both/DT behaviours/NNS ./.
After/IN the/DT game/NN ,/, each/DT participant/NN completed/VBD a/DT questionnaire/NN regarding/VBG their/PRP$ engagement/NN in/IN the/DT interaction/NN ,/, their/PRP$ subjective/JJ feeling/NN about/IN the/DT co-presence/NN of/IN the/DT agent/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.
Based/VBN on/IN four/CD main/JJ dimensions/NNS of/IN interest/NN ,/, we/PRP tested/VBD several/JJ hypotheses/NNS against/IN our/PRP$ experimental/JJ results/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP discussed/VBN here/RB ./.
