Coordinate/VB descent/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ approaches/NNS for/IN solving/VBG Lasso/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ extensions/NNS due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ simplicity/NN and/CC efficiency/NN ./.
When/WRB applying/VBG coordinate/JJ descent/NN to/IN solving/VBG Lasso/NNP ,/, we/PRP update/VBP one/CD coordinate/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN while/IN fixing/VBG the/DT remaining/VBG coordinates/NNS ./.
Such/PDT an/DT update/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ usually/RB easy/JJ to/TO compute/VB ,/, greedily/RB decreases/VBZ the/DT objective/JJ function/NN value/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP aim/VBP to/TO improve/VB its/PRP$ computational/JJ efficiency/NN by/IN reducing/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN coordinate/JJ descent/NN iterations/NNS ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ technique/NN called/VBN Successive/NNP Ray/NNP Refinement/NNP (/-LRB- SRR/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
SRR/NNP makes/VBZ use/NN of/IN the/DT following/VBG ray/NN continuation/NN property/NN on/IN the/DT successive/JJ iterations/NNS :/: for/IN a/DT particular/JJ coordinate/NN ,/, the/DT value/NN obtained/VBN in/IN the/DT next/JJ iteration/NN almost/RB always/RB lies/VBZ on/IN a/DT ray/NN that/WDT starts/VBZ at/IN its/PRP$ previous/JJ iteration/NN and/CC passes/VBZ through/IN the/DT current/JJ iteration/NN ./.
Motivated/VBN by/IN this/DT ray/NN -/HYPH continuation/NN property/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP that/IN coordinate/JJ descent/NN be/VB performed/VBN not/RB directly/RB on/IN the/DT previous/JJ iteration/NN but/CC on/IN a/DT refined/VBN search/NN point/NN that/WDT has/VBZ the/DT following/VBG properties/NNS :/: on/IN one/CD hand/NN ,/, it/PRP lies/VBZ on/IN a/DT ray/NN that/WDT starts/VBZ at/IN a/DT history/NN solution/NN and/CC passes/VBZ through/IN the/DT previous/JJ iteration/NN ,/, and/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, it/PRP achieves/VBZ the/DT minimum/JJ objective/NN function/NN value/NN among/IN all/PDT the/DT points/NNS on/IN the/DT ray/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP two/CD schemes/NNS for/IN defining/VBG the/DT search/NN point/NN and/CC show/VBP that/IN the/DT refined/VBN search/NN point/NN can/MD be/VB efficiently/RB obtained/VBN ./.
Empirical/JJ results/NNS for/IN real/JJ and/CC synthetic/JJ data/NNS sets/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN SRR/NN can/MD significantly/RB reduce/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN coordinate/JJ descent/NN iterations/NNS ,/, especially/RB for/IN small/JJ Lasso/NNP regularization/NN parameters/NNS ./.
