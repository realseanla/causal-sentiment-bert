We/PRP study/VBP a/DT general/JJ adaptive/JJ ranking/NN problem/NN where/WRB an/DT algorithm/NN needs/VBZ to/TO perform/VB a/DT sequence/NN of/IN actions/NNS on/IN a/DT random/JJ user/NN ,/, drawn/VBN from/IN a/DT known/JJ distribution/NN ,/, so/RB as/IN to/TO "/`` satisfy/VB "/'' the/DT user/NN as/IN early/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.
The/DT satisfaction/NN of/IN each/DT user/NN is/VBZ captured/VBN by/IN an/DT individual/JJ submodular/JJ function/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT user/NN is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO be/VB satisfied/JJ when/WRB the/DT function/NN value/NN goes/VBZ above/IN some/DT threshold/NN ./.
We/PRP obtain/VBP a/DT logarithmic/JJ factor/NN approximation/NN algorithm/NN for/IN this/DT adaptive/JJ ranking/NN problem/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ ./.
The/DT adaptive/JJ ranking/NN problem/NN has/VBZ many/JJ applications/NNS in/IN active/JJ learning/NN and/CC ranking/NN :/: it/PRP significantly/RB generalizes/VBZ previously/RB -/HYPH studied/VBN problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN optimal/JJ decision/NN trees/NNS ,/, equivalence/NN class/NN determination/NN ,/, decision/NN region/NN determination/NN and/CC submodular/JJ cover/NN ./.
