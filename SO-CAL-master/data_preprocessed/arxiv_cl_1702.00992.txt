Accurate/JJ prediction/NN of/IN suitable/JJ discourse/NN connectives/NNS (/-LRB- however/RB ,/, furthermore/RB ,/, etc./FW )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ component/NN of/IN any/DT system/NN aimed/VBN at/IN building/VBG coherent/JJ and/CC fluent/JJ discourses/NNS from/IN shorter/JJR sentences/NNS and/CC passages/NNS ./.
As/IN an/DT example/NN ,/, a/DT dialog/NN system/NN might/MD assemble/VB a/DT long/JJ and/CC informative/JJ answer/NN by/IN sampling/NN passages/NNS extracted/VBN from/IN different/JJ documents/NNS retrieved/VBN from/IN the/DT web/NN ./.
We/PRP formulate/VBP the/DT task/NN of/IN discourse/NN connective/JJ prediction/NN and/CC release/VB a/DT dataset/NN of/IN 2.9/CD M/NN sentence/NN pairs/NNS separated/VBN by/IN discourse/NN connectives/NNS for/IN this/DT task/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, we/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT hardness/NN of/IN the/DT task/NN for/IN human/JJ raters/NNS ,/, apply/VB a/DT recently/RB proposed/VBN decomposable/JJ attention/NN (/-LRB- DA/NN )/-RRB- model/NN to/IN this/DT task/NN and/CC observe/VBP that/IN the/DT automatic/JJ predictor/NN has/VBZ a/DT higher/JJR F1/NN than/IN human/JJ raters/NNS (/-LRB- 32/CD vs./IN 30/CD )/-RRB- ./.
