This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ results/NNS on/IN Speaker/NNP Recognition/NNP (/-LRB- SR/NNP )/-RRB- for/IN children/NNS 's/POS speech/NN ,/, using/VBG the/DT OGI/NNP Kids/NNPS corpus/NN and/CC GMM/NN -/HYPH UBM/NN and/CC GMM/NN -/HYPH SVM/NN SR/NN systems/NNS ./.
Regions/NNS of/IN the/DT spectrum/NN containing/VBG important/JJ speaker/NN information/NN for/IN children/NNS are/VBP identified/VBN by/IN conducting/VBG SR/NNP experiments/NNS over/IN 21/CD frequency/NN bands/NNS ./.
As/IN for/IN adults/NNS ,/, the/DT spectrum/NN can/MD be/VB split/VBN into/IN four/CD regions/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT first/JJ (/-LRB- containing/VBG primary/JJ vocal/JJ tract/NN resonance/NN information/NN )/-RRB- and/CC third/JJ (/-LRB- corresponding/VBG to/IN high/JJ frequency/NN speech/NN sounds/VBZ )/-RRB- being/VBG most/RBS useful/JJ for/IN SR/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT frequencies/NNS at/IN which/WDT these/DT regions/NNS occur/VBP are/VBP from/IN 11/CD percent/NN to/IN 38/CD percent/NN higher/JJR for/IN children/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB noted/VBN that/IN subband/NN SR/NN rates/NNS are/VBP lower/JJR for/IN younger/JJR children/NNS ./.
Finally/RB results/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN of/IN SR/NNP experiments/NNS to/TO identify/VB a/DT child/NN in/IN a/DT class/NN (/-LRB- 30/CD children/NNS ,/, similar/JJ age/NN )/-RRB- and/CC school/NN (/-LRB- 288/CD children/NNS ,/, varying/VBG ages/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
Class/NN performance/NN depends/VBZ on/IN age/NN ,/, with/IN accuracy/NN varying/VBG from/IN 90/CD percent/NN for/IN young/JJ children/NNS to/IN 99/CD percent/NN for/IN older/JJR children/NNS ./.
The/DT identification/NN rate/NN achieved/VBN for/IN a/DT child/NN in/IN a/DT school/NN is/VBZ 81/CD percent/NN ./.
