In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP tackle/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN extracting/VBG frequent/JJ opinions/NNS from/IN uncertain/JJ databases/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT foundation/NN of/IN an/DT opinion/NN mining/NN approach/NN with/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN pattern/NN and/CC support/NN measure/NN ./.
The/DT support/NN measure/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN from/IN the/DT commitment/NN definition/NN ./.
A/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN called/VBN OpMiner/NNP that/IN extracts/NNS the/DT set/NN of/IN frequent/JJ opinions/NNS modelled/VBN as/IN a/DT mass/NN functions/VBZ is/VBZ detailed/VBN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN on/IN a/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN biomedical/JJ database/NN that/WDT stores/VBZ opinions/NNS of/IN experts/NNS to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT reliability/NN level/NN of/IN biomedical/JJ data/NNS ./.
Performance/NN analysis/NN showed/VBD a/DT better/JJR quality/NN patterns/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN model/NN in/IN comparison/NN with/IN literature/NN -/HYPH based/VBN methods/NNS ./.
