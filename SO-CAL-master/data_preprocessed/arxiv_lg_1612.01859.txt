The/DT combinatorial/JJ stochastic/JJ semi-bandit/NN problem/NN is/VBZ an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT classical/JJ multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN problem/NN in/IN which/WDT an/DT algorithm/NN pulls/VBZ more/JJR than/IN one/CD arm/NN at/IN each/DT stage/NN and/CC the/DT rewards/NNS of/IN all/DT pulled/VBN arms/NNS are/VBP revealed/VBN ./.
One/CD difference/NN with/IN the/DT single/JJ arm/NN variant/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT dependency/NN structure/NN of/IN the/DT arms/NNS is/VBZ crucial/JJ ./.
Previous/JJ works/NNS on/IN this/DT setting/NN either/CC used/VBD a/DT worst/JJS -/HYPH case/NN approach/NN or/CC imposed/VBN independence/NN of/IN the/DT arms/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT way/NN to/TO quantify/VB the/DT dependency/NN structure/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN and/CC design/NN an/DT algorithm/NN that/WDT adapts/VBZ to/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN linear/JJ regression/NN and/CC the/DT analysis/NN develops/VBZ techniques/NNS from/IN the/DT linear/JJ bandit/NN literature/NN ./.
By/IN comparing/VBG its/PRP$ performance/NN to/IN a/DT new/JJ lower/JJR bound/JJ ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ optimal/JJ ,/, up/IN to/IN a/DT poly/NN -/HYPH logarithmic/JJ factor/NN in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN pulled/VBN arms/NNS ./.
