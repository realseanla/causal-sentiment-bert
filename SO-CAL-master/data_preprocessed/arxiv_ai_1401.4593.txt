Recent/JJ research/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN surprisingly/RB rich/JJ models/NNS of/IN human/JJ activity/NN can/MD be/VB learned/VBN from/IN GPS/NNP (/-LRB- positional/JJ )/-RRB- data/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, most/JJS effort/NN to/TO date/NN has/VBZ concentrated/VBN on/IN modeling/VBG single/JJ individuals/NNS or/CC statistical/JJ properties/NNS of/IN groups/NNS of/IN people/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, prior/JJ work/NN focused/VBD solely/RB on/IN modeling/VBG actual/JJ successful/JJ executions/NNS (/-LRB- and/CC not/RB failed/VBN or/CC attempted/VBN executions/NNS )/-RRB- of/IN the/DT activities/NNS of/IN interest/NN ./.
We/PRP ,/, in/IN contrast/NN ,/, take/VB on/RP the/DT task/NN of/IN understanding/VBG human/JJ interactions/NNS ,/, attempted/VBD interactions/NNS ,/, and/CC intentions/NNS from/IN noisy/JJ sensor/NN data/NNS in/IN a/DT fully/RB relational/JJ multi-agent/JJ setting/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP a/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN game/NN of/IN capture/NN the/DT flag/NN to/TO illustrate/VB our/PRP$ approach/NN in/IN a/DT well/RB -/HYPH defined/VBN domain/NN that/WDT involves/VBZ many/JJ distinct/JJ cooperative/JJ and/CC competitive/JJ joint/JJ activities/NNS ./.
We/PRP model/VBP the/DT domain/NN using/VBG Markov/NNP logic/NN ,/, a/DT statistical/JJ -/HYPH relational/JJ language/NN ,/, and/CC learn/VB a/DT theory/NN that/IN jointly/RB denoises/VBZ the/DT data/NNS and/CC infers/VBZ occurrences/NNS of/IN high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN activities/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN a/DT player/NN capturing/VBG an/DT enemy/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ unified/JJ model/NN combines/VBZ constraints/NNS imposed/VBN by/IN the/DT geometry/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN area/NN ,/, the/DT motion/NN model/NN of/IN the/DT players/NNS ,/, and/CC by/IN the/DT rules/NNS and/CC dynamics/NNS of/IN the/DT game/NN in/IN a/DT probabilistically/RB and/CC logically/RB sound/JJ fashion/NN ./.

We/PRP compare/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN with/IN other/JJ alternatives/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ unified/JJ model/NN ,/, which/WDT takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN not/RB only/RB relationships/NNS among/IN individual/JJ players/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB relationships/NNS among/IN activities/NNS over/IN the/DT entire/JJ length/NN of/IN a/DT game/NN ,/, although/IN more/JJR computationally/RB costly/JJ ,/, is/VBZ significantly/RB more/RBR accurate/JJ ./.
