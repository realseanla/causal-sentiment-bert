Sustainable/JJ and/CC economical/JJ generation/NN of/IN electrical/JJ power/NN is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ and/CC mandatory/JJ component/NN of/IN infrastructure/NN in/IN today/NN 's/POS world/NN ./.
Optimal/JJ generation/NN (/-LRB- generator/NN subset/NN selection/NN )/-RRB- of/IN power/NN requires/VBZ a/DT careful/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN various/JJ factors/NNS like/IN type/NN of/IN source/NN ,/, generation/NN ,/, transmission/NN &amp;/CC storage/NN capacities/NNS ,/, congestion/NN among/IN others/NNS which/WDT makes/VBZ this/DT a/DT difficult/JJ task/NN ./.
We/PRP created/VBD a/DT grid/NN to/TO simulate/VB various/JJ conditions/NNS including/VBG stimuli/NNS like/IN generator/NN supply/NN ,/, weather/NN and/CC load/NN demand/NN using/VBG Siemens/NNP PSS/NNP //SYM E/NN software/NN and/CC this/DT data/NN is/VBZ trained/VBN using/VBG deep/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS and/CC subsequently/RB tested/VBN ./.
