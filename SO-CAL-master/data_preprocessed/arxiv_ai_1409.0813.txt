Relentless/JJ progress/NN in/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN (/-LRB- AI/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ increasingly/RB raising/VBG concerns/NNS that/IN machines/NNS will/MD replace/VB humans/NNS on/IN the/DT job/NN market/NN ,/, and/CC perhaps/RB altogether/RB ./.
Eliezer/NNP Yudkowski/NNP and/CC others/NNS have/VBP explored/VBN the/DT possibility/NN that/IN a/DT promising/JJ future/NN for/IN humankind/NN could/MD be/VB guaranteed/VBN by/IN a/DT superintelligent/NN "/`` Friendly/JJ AI/NN "/'' ,/, designed/VBN to/TO safeguard/VB humanity/NN and/CC its/PRP$ values/NNS ./.
I/PRP argue/VBP that/IN ,/, from/IN a/DT physics/NN perspective/NN where/WRB everything/NN is/VBZ simply/RB an/DT arrangement/NN of/IN elementary/JJ particles/NNS ,/, this/DT might/MD be/VB even/RB harder/JJR than/IN it/PRP appears/VBZ ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, it/PRP may/MD require/VB thinking/VBG rigorously/RB about/IN the/DT meaning/NN of/IN life/NN :/: What/WP is/VBZ "/`` meaning/VBG "/'' in/IN a/DT particle/NN arrangement/NN ?/.
What/WP is/VBZ "/`` life/NN "/'' ?/.
What/WP is/VBZ the/DT ultimate/JJ ethical/JJ imperative/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, how/WRB should/MD we/PRP strive/VB to/TO rearrange/VB the/DT particles/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ Universe/NNP and/CC shape/VB its/PRP$ future/NN ?/.
If/IN we/PRP fail/VBP to/TO answer/VB the/DT last/JJ question/NN rigorously/RB ,/, this/DT future/NN is/VBZ unlikely/JJ to/TO contain/VB humans/NNS ./.
