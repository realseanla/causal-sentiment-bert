In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT system/NN that/WDT employs/VBZ a/DT wearable/JJ acoustic/JJ sensor/NN and/CC a/DT deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN for/IN detecting/VBG coughs/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ system/NN on/IN 14/CD healthy/JJ volunteers/NNS and/CC compare/VB it/PRP to/IN that/DT of/IN other/JJ cough/NN detection/NN systems/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN reported/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ system/NN achieves/VBZ a/DT classification/NN sensitivity/NN of/IN 95.1/CD percent/NN and/CC a/DT specificity/NN of/IN 99.5/CD percent/NN ./.
