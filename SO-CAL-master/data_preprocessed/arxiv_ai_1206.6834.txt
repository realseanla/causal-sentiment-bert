This/DT paper/NN studies/NNS a/DT new/JJ and/CC more/RBR general/JJ axiomatization/NN than/IN one/CD presented/VBN previously/RB for/IN preference/NN on/IN likelihood/NN gambles/VBZ ./.
Likelihood/NN gambles/VBZ describe/VB actions/NNS in/IN a/DT situation/NN where/WRB a/DT decision/NN maker/NN knows/VBZ multiple/JJ probabilistic/JJ models/NNS and/CC a/DT random/JJ sample/NN generated/VBN from/IN one/CD of/IN those/DT models/NNS but/CC does/VBZ not/RB know/VB prior/JJ probability/NN of/IN models/NNS ./.
This/DT new/JJ axiom/NN system/NN is/VBZ inspired/VBN by/IN Jensen/NNP 's/POS axiomatization/NN of/IN probabilistic/JJ gambles/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN provides/VBZ a/DT new/JJ perspective/NN to/IN the/DT role/NN of/IN data/NNS in/IN decision/NN making/VBG under/IN ambiguity/NN ./.
It/PRP avoids/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS controversial/JJ issue/NN of/IN Bayesian/JJ methodology/NN namely/RB the/DT assumption/NN of/IN prior/JJ probability/NN ./.
