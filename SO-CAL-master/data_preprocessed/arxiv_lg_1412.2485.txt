A/DT widely/RB -/HYPH used/VBN tool/NN for/IN binary/JJ classification/NN is/VBZ the/DT Support/NN Vector/NNP Machine/NNP (/-LRB- SVM/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT supervised/JJ learning/NN technique/NN that/WDT finds/VBZ the/DT "/`` maximum/JJ margin/NN "/'' linear/JJ separator/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD classes/NNS ./.
While/IN SVMs/NNS have/VBP been/VBN well/RB studied/VBN in/IN the/DT batch/NN (/-LRB- offline/RB )/-RRB- setting/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ considerably/RB less/JJR work/NN on/IN the/DT streaming/NN (/-LRB- online/NN )/-RRB- setting/NN ,/, which/WDT requires/VBZ only/RB a/DT single/JJ pass/NN over/IN the/DT data/NNS using/VBG sub-linear/JJ space/NN ./.
Existing/VBG streaming/NN algorithms/NNS are/VBP not/RB yet/RB competitive/JJ with/IN the/DT batch/NN implementation/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP use/VBP the/DT formulation/NN of/IN the/DT SVM/NNP as/IN a/DT minimum/NN enclosing/VBG ball/NN (/-LRB- MEB/NNP )/-RRB- problem/NN to/TO provide/VB a/DT streaming/NN SVM/NN algorithm/NN based/VBN off/IN of/IN the/DT blurred/JJ ball/NN cover/NN originally/RB proposed/VBN by/IN Agarwal/NNP and/CC Sharathkumar/NNP ./.
Our/PRP$ implementation/NN consistently/RB outperforms/VBZ existing/VBG streaming/NN SVM/NN approaches/NNS and/CC provides/VBZ higher/JJR accuracies/NNS than/IN libSVM/NN on/IN several/JJ datasets/NNS ,/, thus/RB making/VBG it/PRP competitive/JJ with/IN the/DT standard/JJ SVM/NN batch/NN implementation/NN ./.
