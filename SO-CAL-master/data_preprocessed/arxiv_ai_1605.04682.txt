Many/JJ academic/JJ disciplines/NNS -/, including/VBG information/NN systems/NNS ,/, computer/NN science/NN ,/, and/CC operations/NNS management/NN -/HYPH face/NN scheduling/NN problems/NNS as/IN important/JJ decision/NN making/VBG tasks/NNS ./.
Since/IN many/JJ scheduling/NN problems/NNS are/VBP NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ in/IN the/DT strong/JJ sense/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN for/IN developing/VBG solution/NN heuristics/NNS ./.
For/IN scheduling/NN problems/NNS with/IN setup/NN times/NNS on/IN unrelated/JJ parallel/JJ machines/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ limited/JJ research/NN on/IN solution/NN methods/NNS and/CC to/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, parallel/JJ computer/NN architectures/NNS have/VBP not/RB yet/RB been/VBN taken/VBN advantage/NN of/IN ./.
