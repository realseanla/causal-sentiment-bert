The/DT weekly/JJ maintenance/NN schedule/NN specifies/VBZ when/WRB maintenance/NN activities/NNS should/MD be/VB performed/VBN on/IN the/DT equipment/NN ,/, taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT availability/NN of/IN workers/NNS and/CC maintenance/NN bays/NNS ,/, and/CC other/JJ operational/JJ constraints/NNS ./.
The/DT current/JJ approach/NN to/IN generating/VBG this/DT schedule/NN is/VBZ labour/NN intensive/JJ and/CC requires/VBZ coordination/NN between/IN the/DT maintenance/NN schedulers/NNS and/CC operations/NNS staff/NN to/TO minimise/VB its/PRP$ impact/NN on/IN the/DT operation/NN of/IN the/DT mine/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ methods/NNS for/IN automatically/RB generating/VBG this/DT schedule/NN from/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN maintenance/NN tasks/NNS to/TO be/VB performed/VBN ,/, the/DT availability/NN roster/NN of/IN the/DT maintenance/NN staff/NN ,/, and/CC time/NN windows/NNS in/IN which/WDT each/DT piece/NN of/IN equipment/NN is/VBZ available/JJ for/IN maintenance/NN ./.
Both/DT Mixed/JJ -/HYPH Integer/NN Linear/NNP Programming/NNP (/-LRB- MILP/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC genetic/JJ algorithms/NNS are/VBP evaluated/VBN ,/, with/IN the/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN shown/VBN to/TO significantly/RB outperform/VB the/DT MILP/NN ./.
Two/CD fitness/NN functions/NNS for/IN the/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN are/VBP also/RB examined/VBN ,/, with/IN a/DT linear/JJ fitness/NN function/NN outperforming/VBG an/DT inverse/JJ fitness/NN function/NN by/IN up/RB to/IN 5/CD percent/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ calculation/NN time/NN ./.
The/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN approach/NN is/VBZ computationally/RB fast/RB ,/, allowing/VBG the/DT schedule/NN to/TO be/VB rapidly/RB recalculated/VBN in/IN response/NN to/IN unexpected/JJ delays/NNS and/CC breakdowns/NNS ./.
