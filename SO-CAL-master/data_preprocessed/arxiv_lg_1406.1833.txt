Unlike/IN unsupervised/JJ approaches/NNS such/JJ as/IN autoencoders/NNS that/WDT learn/VBP to/TO reconstruct/VB their/PRP$ inputs/NNS ,/, this/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ an/DT alternative/JJ approach/NN to/IN unsupervised/JJ feature/NN learning/NN called/VBN divergent/JJ discriminative/JJ feature/NN accumulation/NN (/-LRB- DDFA/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT instead/RB continually/RB accumulates/VBZ features/NNS that/WDT make/VBP novel/JJ discriminations/NNS among/IN the/DT training/NN set/NN ./.
Thus/RB DDFA/NN features/NNS are/VBP inherently/RB discriminative/JJ from/IN the/DT start/NN even/RB though/IN they/PRP are/VBP trained/VBN without/IN knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ classification/NN problem/NN ./.
Interestingly/RB ,/, DDFA/NNP also/RB continues/VBZ to/TO add/VB new/JJ features/NNS indefinitely/RB (/-LRB- so/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB depend/VB on/IN a/DT hidden/JJ layer/NN size/NN )/-RRB- ,/, is/VBZ not/RB based/VBN on/IN minimizing/VBG error/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ inherently/RB divergent/JJ instead/RB of/IN convergent/JJ ,/, thereby/RB providing/VBG a/DT unique/JJ direction/NN of/IN research/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ feature/NN learning/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN the/DT quality/NN of/IN its/PRP$ learned/VBN features/NNS is/VBZ demonstrated/VBN on/IN the/DT MNIST/NN dataset/NN ,/, where/WRB its/PRP$ performance/NN confirms/VBZ that/IN indeed/RB DDFA/NNP is/VBZ a/DT viable/JJ technique/NN for/IN learning/VBG useful/JJ features/NNS ./.
