In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, the/DT answer/NN selection/NN problem/NN in/IN community/NN question/NN answering/VBG (/-LRB- CQA/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ regarded/VBN as/IN an/DT answer/NN sequence/NN labeling/NN task/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT recurrent/JJ architecture/NN for/IN this/DT problem/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN applies/VBZ convolution/NN neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNNs/NNS )/-RRB- to/IN learning/VBG the/DT joint/JJ representation/NN of/IN question/NN -/HYPH answer/NN pair/NN firstly/RB ,/, and/CC then/RB uses/VBZ the/DT joint/JJ representation/NN as/IN input/NN of/IN the/DT long/JJ short/JJ -/HYPH term/NN memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- to/TO learn/VB the/DT answer/NN sequence/NN of/IN a/DT question/NN for/IN labeling/VBG the/DT matching/JJ quality/NN of/IN each/DT answer/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS conducted/VBN on/IN the/DT SemEval/NNP 2015/CD CQA/NNP dataset/NN shows/VBZ the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN ./.
