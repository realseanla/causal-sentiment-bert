In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, adaptive/JJ learning/NN systems/NNS rely/VBP increasingly/RB on/IN learning/VBG hierarchy/NN to/IN customize/VB the/DT educational/JJ logic/NN developed/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ courses/NNS ./.
Most/JJS approaches/NNS do/VBP not/RB consider/VB that/IN the/DT relationships/NNS of/IN prerequisites/NNS between/IN the/DT skills/NNS are/VBP fuzzy/JJ relationships/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT article/NN ,/, we/PRP describe/VBP a/DT new/JJ approach/NN of/IN a/DT practical/JJ application/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ logic/NN techniques/NNS to/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN learning/VBG hierarchies/NNS ./.
For/IN this/DT ,/, we/PRP use/VBP a/DT learning/NN hierarchy/NN predefined/VBN by/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR experts/NNS of/IN a/DT specific/JJ field/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT relationships/NNS of/IN prerequisites/NNS between/IN the/DT skills/NNS in/IN the/DT learning/NN hierarchy/NN are/VBP not/RB definitive/JJ and/CC they/PRP are/VBP fuzzy/JJ relationships/NNS ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, we/PRP measure/VBP relevance/NN degree/NN of/IN all/DT relationships/NNS existing/VBG in/IN this/DT learning/NN hierarchy/NN and/CC we/PRP try/VBP to/TO answer/VB to/IN the/DT following/VBG question/NN :/: Is/VBZ the/DT relationships/NNS of/IN prerequisites/NNS predefined/VBN in/IN initial/JJ learning/NN hierarchy/NN are/VBP correctly/RB established/VBN or/CC not/RB ?/.
