It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN proved/VBN that/IN large/JJ scale/NN realistic/JJ Knowledge/NN Based/VBN Machine/NN Translation/NN applications/NNS require/VBP acquisition/NN of/IN huge/JJ knowledge/NN about/IN language/NN and/CC about/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
This/DT knowledge/NN is/VBZ encoded/VBN in/IN computational/JJ grammars/NNS ,/, lexicons/NNS and/CC domain/NN models/NNS ./.
Another/DT approach/NN which/WDT avoids/VBZ the/DT need/NN for/IN collecting/VBG and/CC analyzing/VBG massive/JJ knowledge/NN ,/, is/VBZ the/DT Example/NNP Based/VBN approach/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT topic/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN ./.
