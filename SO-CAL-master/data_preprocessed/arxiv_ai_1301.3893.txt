This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ a/DT domain/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ knowledge/NN acquisition/NN tool/NN for/IN intelligent/JJ automated/VBN troubleshooters/NNS based/VBN on/IN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ./.
No/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN knowledge/NN is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO use/VB the/DT tool/NN ,/, and/CC troubleshooting/VBG information/NN can/MD be/VB specified/VBN as/IN natural/JJ and/CC intuitive/JJ as/IN possible/JJ ./.
Probabilities/NNS can/MD be/VB specified/VBN in/IN the/DT direction/NN that/WDT is/VBZ most/RBS natural/JJ to/IN the/DT domain/NN expert/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, the/DT knowledge/NN acquisition/NN efficiently/RB removes/VBZ the/DT traditional/JJ knowledge/NN acquisition/NN bottleneck/NN of/IN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ./.
