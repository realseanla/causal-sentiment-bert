This/DT paper/NN offers/VBZ an/DT approach/NN to/IN extensible/JJ knowledge/NN representation/NN and/CC reasoning/NN for/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN formalisms/NNS known/VBN as/IN Description/NN Logics/NNS ./.
The/DT approach/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN adding/VBG new/JJ concept/NN constructors/NNS ,/, and/CC includes/VBZ a/DT heuristic/NN methodology/NN for/IN specifying/VBG the/DT desired/VBN extensions/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT modularized/VBN software/NN architecture/NN that/WDT supports/VBZ implementing/VBG extensions/NNS ./.
The/DT architecture/NN detailed/VBN here/RB falls/VBZ in/IN the/DT normalize/VB -/HYPH compared/VBN paradigm/NN ,/, and/CC supports/VBZ both/DT intentional/JJ reasoning/NN (/-LRB- subsumption/NN )/-RRB- involving/VBG concepts/NNS ,/, and/CC extensional/JJ reasoning/NN involving/VBG individuals/NNS after/IN incremental/JJ updates/NNS to/IN the/DT knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG approach/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO extend/VB the/DT reasoner/NN with/IN specialized/JJ notions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP motivated/VBN by/IN specific/JJ problems/NNS or/CC application/NN areas/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN reasoning/NN about/IN dates/NNS ,/, plans/NNS ,/, etc/FW ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, it/PRP provides/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO implement/VB constructors/NNS that/WDT are/VBP not/RB currently/RB yet/RB sufficiently/RB well/RB understood/VBN theoretically/RB ,/, but/CC are/VBP needed/VBN in/IN practice/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, for/IN constructors/NNS that/WDT are/VBP provably/RB hard/JJ to/TO reason/VB with/IN (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, ones/NNS whose/WP$ presence/NN would/MD lead/VB to/IN undecidability/NN )/-RRB- ,/, it/PRP allows/VBZ the/DT implementation/NN of/IN incomplete/JJ reasoners/NNS where/WRB the/DT incompleteness/NN is/VBZ tailored/VBN to/TO be/VB acceptable/JJ for/IN the/DT application/NN at/IN hand/NN ./.
