This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT combination/NN approach/NN to/TO improve/VB short/JJ utterance/NN speaker/NN recognition/NN (/-LRB- SUSR/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, where/WRB two/CD phonetic/JJ -/HYPH aware/JJ systems/NNS are/VBP combined/VBN together/RB :/: one/CD is/VBZ the/DT DNN/NN -/HYPH based/VBN i/NN -/HYPH vector/NN system/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ is/VBZ the/DT subregion/NN -/HYPH based/VBN GMM/NNP -/HYPH UBM/NNP system/NN proposed/VBN by/IN us/PRP recently/RB ./.
