Decision/NN making/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ component/NN in/IN a/DT speaker/NN verification/NN system/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT conventional/JJ GMM/NN -/HYPH UBM/NN architecture/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN is/VBZ usually/RB conducted/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT log/NN likelihood/NN ratio/NN of/IN the/DT test/NN utterance/NN against/IN the/DT GMM/NNP of/IN the/DT claimed/VBN speaker/NN and/CC the/DT UBM/NNP ./.
This/DT single/JJ -/HYPH score/NN decision/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ but/CC tends/VBZ to/TO be/VB sensitive/JJ to/IN the/DT complex/JJ variations/NNS in/IN speech/NN signals/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW text/NN content/NN ,/, channel/NN ,/, speaking/VBG style/NN ,/, etc./FW )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT decision/NN making/VBG approach/NN based/VBN on/IN multiple/JJ scores/NNS derived/VBN from/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN cohort/NN GMMs/NNS (/-LRB- cohort/NN scores/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
