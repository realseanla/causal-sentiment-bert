This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT solution/NN to/IN Autonomous/NNP Underwater/NNP Vehicles/NNPS (/-LRB- AUVs/NNS )/-RRB- large/JJ scale/NN route/NN planning/NN and/CC task/NN assignment/NN joint/JJ problem/NN ./.
Given/VBN a/DT set/NN of/IN constraints/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, time/NN )/-RRB- and/CC a/DT set/NN of/IN task/NN priority/NN values/NNS ,/, the/DT goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO find/VB the/DT optimal/JJ route/NN for/IN underwater/JJ mission/NN that/WDT maximizes/VBZ the/DT sum/NN of/IN the/DT priorities/NNS and/CC minimizes/VBZ the/DT total/JJ risk/NN percentage/NN while/IN meeting/VBG the/DT given/VBN constraints/NNS ./.
Making/VBG use/NN of/IN the/DT heuristic/NN nature/NN of/IN genetic/JJ and/CC swarm/JJ intelligence/NN algorithms/NNS in/IN solving/VBG NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ graph/NN problems/NNS ,/, Particle/NN Swarm/NN Optimization/NN (/-LRB- PSO/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Genetic/JJ Algorithm/NN (/-LRB- GA/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP employed/VBN to/TO find/VB the/DT optimum/JJ solution/NN ,/, where/WRB each/DT individual/NN in/IN the/DT population/NN is/VBZ a/DT candidate/NN solution/NN (/-LRB- route/NN )/-RRB- ./.
To/TO evaluate/VB the/DT robustness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN methods/NNS ,/, the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT all/DT PS/NNP and/CC GA/NNP algorithms/NNS are/VBP examined/VBN and/CC compared/VBN for/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN Monte/NNP Carlo/NNP runs/VBZ ./.
