Expert/NNP finding/NN is/VBZ an/DT information/NN retrieval/NN task/NN concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT search/NN for/IN the/DT most/RBS knowledgeable/JJ people/NNS ,/, in/IN some/DT topic/NN ,/, with/IN basis/NN on/IN documents/NNS describing/VBG peoples/NNS activities/NNS ./.
The/DT task/NN involves/VBZ taking/VBG a/DT user/NN query/NN as/IN input/NN and/CC returning/VBG a/DT list/NN of/IN people/NNS sorted/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ level/NN of/IN expertise/NN regarding/VBG the/DT user/NN query/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN for/IN combining/VBG multiple/JJ estimators/NNS of/IN expertise/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT multisensor/NN data/NNS fusion/NN framework/NN together/RB with/IN the/DT Dempster/NNP -/HYPH Shafer/NNP theory/NN of/IN evidence/NN and/CC Shannon/NNP 's/POS entropy/NN ./.
More/RBR specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP defined/VBD three/CD sensors/NNS which/WDT detect/VBP heterogeneous/JJ information/NN derived/VBN from/IN the/DT textual/JJ contents/NNS ,/, from/IN the/DT graph/NN structure/NN of/IN the/DT citation/NN patterns/NNS for/IN the/DT community/NN of/IN experts/NNS ,/, and/CC from/IN profile/NN information/NN about/IN the/DT academic/JJ experts/NNS ./.
Given/VBN the/DT evidences/NNS collected/VBN ,/, each/DT sensor/NN may/MD define/VB different/JJ candidates/NNS as/IN experts/NNS and/CC consequently/RB do/VBP not/RB agree/VB in/IN a/DT final/JJ ranking/NN decision/NN ./.
To/TO deal/VB with/IN these/DT conflicts/NNS ,/, we/PRP applied/VBD the/DT Dempster/NNP -/HYPH Shafer/NNP theory/NN of/IN evidence/NN combined/VBN with/IN Shannon/NNP 's/POS Entropy/NNP formula/NN to/IN fuse/NN this/DT information/NN and/CC come/VB up/RP with/IN a/DT more/RBR accurate/JJ and/CC reliable/JJ final/JJ ranking/NN list/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS made/VBD over/RP two/CD datasets/NNS of/IN academic/JJ publications/NNS from/IN the/DT Computer/NNP Science/NNP domain/NN attest/VB for/IN the/DT adequacy/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN over/IN the/DT traditional/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN approaches/NNS ./.
