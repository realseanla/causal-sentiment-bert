This/DT paper/NN reconsiders/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN the/DT absent/JJ -/HYPH minded/JJ driver/NN who/WP must/MD choose/VB between/IN alternatives/NNS with/IN different/JJ payoff/NN with/IN imperfect/JJ recall/NN and/CC varying/VBG degrees/NNS of/IN knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN ./.
The/DT classical/JJ absent/JJ -/HYPH minded/JJ driver/NN problem/NN represents/VBZ the/DT case/NN with/IN limited/JJ information/NN and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ bearing/VBG on/IN the/DT general/JJ area/NN of/IN communication/NN and/CC learning/NN ,/, social/JJ choice/NN ,/, mechanism/NN design/NN ,/, auctions/NNS ,/, theories/NNS of/IN knowledge/NN ,/, belief/NN ,/, and/CC rational/JJ agency/NN ./.
Within/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN extensive/JJ games/NNS ,/, this/DT problem/NN has/VBZ applications/NNS to/IN many/JJ artificial/JJ intelligence/NN scenarios/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ obvious/JJ that/IN the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT agent/NN improves/VBZ as/IN information/NN available/JJ increases/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN a/DT non-uniform/JJ assignment/NN strategy/NN for/IN successive/JJ choices/NNS does/VBZ better/JJR than/IN a/DT fixed/VBN probability/NN strategy/NN ./.
We/PRP consider/VBP both/DT classical/JJ and/CC quantum/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT superior/JJ performance/NN of/IN quantum/NN decisions/NNS with/IN access/NN to/IN entanglement/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB fairly/RB compared/VBN to/IN a/DT classical/JJ algorithm/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT cognitive/JJ systems/NNS of/IN agents/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN to/TO have/VB access/NN to/IN quantum/NN resources/NNS ,/, or/CC have/VBP a/DT quantum/NN mechanical/JJ basis/NN ,/, then/RB that/DT can/MD be/VB leveraged/VBN into/IN superior/JJ performance/NN ./.
