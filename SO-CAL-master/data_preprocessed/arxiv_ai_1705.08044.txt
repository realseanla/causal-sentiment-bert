The/DT design/NN and/CC analysis/NN of/IN communication/NN systems/NNS typically/RB rely/VBP on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN mathematical/JJ models/NNS that/WDT describe/VBP the/DT underlying/VBG communication/NN channel/NN ,/, which/WDT dictates/VBZ the/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT transmitted/VBN and/CC the/DT received/VBN signals/NNS ./.
