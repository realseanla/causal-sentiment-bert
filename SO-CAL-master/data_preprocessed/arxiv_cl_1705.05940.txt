This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ experiments/NNS illustrating/VBG how/WRB formal/JJ language/NN theory/NN can/MD shed/VB light/NN on/IN deep/JJ learning/NN ./.
We/PRP train/VBP naive/JJ Long/JJ Short/JJ -/HYPH Term/NN Memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- RNNs/NNS )/-RRB- on/IN six/CD formal/JJ languages/NNS drawn/VBN from/IN the/DT Strictly/RB Local/JJ (/-LRB- SL/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Strictly/RB Piecewise/NNP (/-LRB- SP/NN )/-RRB- classes/NNS ./.
