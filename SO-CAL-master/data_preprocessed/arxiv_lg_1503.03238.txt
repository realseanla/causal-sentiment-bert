Time/NNP -/HYPH series/NN classification/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ problem/NN for/IN the/DT data/NNS mining/NN community/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN application/NN domains/NNS involving/VBG time/NN -/HYPH series/NN data/NNS ./.
A/DT recent/JJ paradigm/NN ,/, called/VBN shapelets/NNS ,/, represents/VBZ patterns/NNS that/WDT are/VBP highly/RB predictive/JJ for/IN the/DT target/NN variable/NN ./.
Shapelets/NNS are/VBP discovered/VBN by/IN measuring/VBG the/DT prediction/NN accuracy/NN of/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN potential/NN (/-LRB- shapelet/NN )/-RRB- candidates/NNS ./.
The/DT candidates/NNS typically/RB consist/VBP of/IN all/PDT the/DT segments/NNS of/IN a/DT dataset/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, the/DT discovery/NN of/IN shapelets/NNS is/VBZ computationally/RB expensive/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ method/NN that/WDT avoids/VBZ measuring/VBG the/DT prediction/NN accuracy/NN of/IN similar/JJ candidates/NNS in/IN Euclidean/JJ distance/NN space/NN ,/, through/IN an/DT online/JJ clustering/NN pruning/NN technique/NN ./.
