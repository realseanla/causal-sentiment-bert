Recently/RB deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP received/VBN considerable/JJ attention/NN due/IN to/IN their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO extract/VB and/CC represent/VB high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN abstractions/NNS in/IN data/NNS sets/NNS ./.
Deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS such/JJ as/IN fully/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN and/CC convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN excellent/JJ performance/NN on/IN a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN recognition/NN and/CC classification/NN tasks/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, their/PRP$ hardware/NN implementations/NNS currently/RB suffer/VBP from/IN large/JJ silicon/NN area/NN and/CC high/JJ power/NN consumption/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT their/PRP$ high/JJ degree/NN of/IN complexity/NN ./.
The/DT power/NN //HYPH energy/NN consumption/NN of/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS is/VBZ dominated/VBN by/IN memory/NN accesses/VBZ ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN which/WDT occur/VBP in/IN fully/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN networks/NNS ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, they/PRP contain/VBP most/JJS of/IN the/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN parameters/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP sparsely/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN networks/NNS ,/, by/IN showing/VBG that/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN connections/NNS in/IN fully/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN networks/NNS can/MD be/VB reduced/VBN by/IN up/RB to/IN 90/CD percent/NN while/IN improving/VBG the/DT accuracy/NN performance/NN on/IN three/CD popular/JJ datasets/NNS (/-LRB- MNIST/NNP ,/, CIFAR10/NN and/CC SVHN/NN )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP then/RB propose/VB an/DT efficient/JJ hardware/NN architecture/NN based/VBN on/IN linear/JJ -/HYPH feedback/NN shift/NN registers/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT memory/NN requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN sparsely/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN networks/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN architecture/NN can/MD save/VB up/RP to/IN 90/CD percent/NN of/IN memory/NN compared/VBN to/IN the/DT conventional/JJ implementations/NNS of/IN fully/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, implementation/NN results/NNS show/VBP up/RP to/IN 84/CD percent/NN reduction/NN in/IN the/DT energy/NN consumption/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ neuron/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN sparsely/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN networks/NNS compared/VBN to/IN a/DT single/JJ neuron/NN of/IN fully/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
