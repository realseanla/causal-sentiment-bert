Online/RB -/HYPH learning/VBG research/NN has/VBZ mainly/RB been/VBN focusing/VBG on/IN minimizing/VBG one/CD objective/JJ function/NN ./.
In/IN many/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN applications/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, several/JJ objective/JJ functions/NNS have/VBP to/TO be/VB considered/VBN simultaneously/RB ./.
