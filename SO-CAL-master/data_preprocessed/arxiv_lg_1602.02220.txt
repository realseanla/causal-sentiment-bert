Dropout/NN has/VBZ been/VBN witnessed/VBN with/IN great/JJ success/NN in/IN training/NN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS by/IN independently/RB zeroing/VBG out/RP the/DT outputs/NNS of/IN neurons/NNS at/IN random/JJ ./.

To/TO tackle/VB the/DT issue/NN of/IN evolving/VBG distribution/NN of/IN neurons/NNS in/IN deep/JJ learning/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ adaptive/JJ dropout/NN (/-LRB- named/VBN \/SYM textbf/NN {/-LRB- evolutional/JJ dropout/NN }/-RRB- )/-RRB- that/WDT computes/VBZ the/DT sampling/NN probabilities/NNS on/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH fly/NN from/IN a/DT mini-batch/NN of/IN examples/NNS ./.
Empirical/JJ studies/NNS on/IN several/JJ benchmark/NN datasets/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN dropouts/NNS achieve/VBP not/RB only/RB much/JJ faster/JJR convergence/NN and/CC but/CC also/RB a/DT smaller/JJR testing/NN error/NN than/IN the/DT standard/JJ dropout/NN ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT CIFAR/NN -/HYPH 100/CD data/NNS ,/, the/DT evolutional/JJ dropout/NN achieves/VBZ relative/JJ improvements/NNS over/IN 10/CD \/SYM percent/NN on/IN the/DT prediction/NN performance/NN and/CC over/IN 50/CD \/SYM percent/NN on/IN the/DT convergence/NN speed/NN compared/VBN to/IN the/DT standard/JJ dropout/NN ./.
