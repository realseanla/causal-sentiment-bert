Until/IN recently/RB ,/, research/NN on/IN artificial/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS was/VBD largely/RB restricted/VBN to/IN systems/NNS with/IN only/RB two/CD types/NNS of/IN variable/NN :/: Neural/JJ activities/NNS that/WDT represent/VBP the/DT current/JJ or/CC recent/JJ input/NN and/CC weights/NNS that/WDT learn/VBP to/TO capture/VB regularities/NNS among/IN inputs/NNS ,/, outputs/NNS and/CC payoffs/NNS ./.
There/EX is/VBZ no/DT good/JJ reason/NN for/IN this/DT restriction/NN ./.
Synapses/NNS have/VBP dynamics/NNS at/IN many/JJ different/JJ time/NN -/HYPH scales/NNS and/CC this/DT suggests/VBZ that/IN artificial/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS might/MD benefit/VB from/IN variables/NNS that/WDT change/VBP slower/JJR than/IN activities/NNS but/CC much/JJ faster/JJR than/IN the/DT standard/JJ weights/NNS ./.
These/DT "/`` fast/JJ weights/NNS "/'' can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO store/VB temporary/JJ memories/NNS of/IN the/DT recent/JJ past/NN and/CC they/PRP provide/VBP a/DT neurally/RB plausible/JJ way/NN of/IN implementing/VBG the/DT type/NN of/IN attention/NN to/IN the/DT past/NN that/WDT has/VBZ recently/RB proved/VBN very/RB helpful/JJ in/IN sequence/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH sequence/NN models/NNS ./.
By/IN using/VBG fast/JJ weights/NNS we/PRP can/MD avoid/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO store/VB copies/NNS of/IN neural/JJ activity/NN patterns/NNS ./.
