In/IN many/JJ applications/NNS spanning/VBG from/IN sensor/NN to/IN social/JJ networks/NNS ,/, transportation/NN systems/NNS ,/, gene/NN regulatory/JJ networks/NNS or/CC big/JJ data/NNS ,/, the/DT signals/NNS of/IN interest/NN are/VBP defined/VBN over/IN the/DT vertices/NNS of/IN a/DT graph/NN ./.
The/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO propose/VB a/DT least/JJS mean/JJ square/NN (/-LRB- LMS/NN )/-RRB- strategy/NN for/IN adaptive/JJ estimation/NN of/IN signals/NNS defined/VBN over/IN graphs/NNS ./.
Assuming/VBG the/DT graph/NN signal/NN to/TO be/VB band/NN -/HYPH limited/VBN ,/, over/IN a/DT known/VBN bandwidth/NN ,/, the/DT method/NN enables/VBZ reconstruction/NN ,/, with/IN guaranteed/VBN performance/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN mean/JJ -/HYPH square/JJ error/NN ,/, and/CC tracking/VBG from/IN a/DT limited/JJ number/NN of/IN observations/NNS over/IN a/DT subset/NN of/IN vertices/NNS ./.
A/DT detailed/JJ mean/NN square/JJ analysis/NN provides/VBZ the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN ,/, and/CC leads/VBZ to/IN several/JJ insights/NNS for/IN designing/VBG useful/JJ sampling/NN strategies/NNS for/IN graph/NN signals/NNS ./.
Numerical/NNP results/VBZ validate/VBP our/PRP$ theoretical/JJ findings/NNS ,/, and/CC illustrate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, to/TO cope/VB with/IN the/DT case/NN where/WRB the/DT bandwidth/NN is/VBZ not/RB known/VBN beforehand/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN that/WDT performs/VBZ a/DT sparse/JJ online/JJ estimation/NN of/IN the/DT signal/NN support/NN in/IN the/DT (/-LRB- graph/NN )/-RRB- frequency/NN domain/NN ,/, which/WDT enables/VBZ online/JJ adaptation/NN of/IN the/DT graph/NN sampling/NN strategy/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN to/TO build/VB the/DT power/NN spatial/JJ density/NN cartography/NN of/IN a/DT given/VBN operational/JJ region/NN in/IN a/DT cognitive/JJ network/NN environment/NN ./.
