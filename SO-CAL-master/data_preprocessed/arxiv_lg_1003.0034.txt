We/PRP explore/VBP the/DT striking/JJ mathematical/JJ connections/NNS that/WDT exist/VBP between/IN market/NN scoring/NN rules/NNS ,/, cost/NN function/NN based/VBN prediction/NN markets/NNS ,/, and/CC no/DT -/HYPH regret/NN learning/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN any/DT cost/NN function/NN based/VBN prediction/NN market/NN can/MD be/VB interpreted/VBN as/IN an/DT algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT commonly/RB studied/VBN problem/NN of/IN learning/VBG from/IN expert/JJ advice/NN by/IN equating/VBG trades/NNS made/VBN in/IN the/DT market/NN with/IN losses/NNS observed/VBN by/IN the/DT learning/NN algorithm/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT loss/NN of/IN the/DT market/NN organizer/NN is/VBZ bounded/VBN ,/, this/DT bound/VBD can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO derive/VB an/DT O/NN (/-LRB- sqrt/NN (/-LRB- T/NN )/-RRB- )/-RRB- regret/NN bound/VBN for/IN the/DT corresponding/VBG learning/NN algorithm/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT class/NN of/IN markets/NNS with/IN convex/NN cost/NN functions/NNS exactly/RB corresponds/VBZ to/IN the/DT class/NN of/IN Follow/VB the/DT Regularized/NNP Leader/NNP learning/VBG algorithms/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT choice/NN of/IN a/DT cost/NN function/NN in/IN the/DT market/NN corresponding/VBG to/IN the/DT choice/NN of/IN a/DT regularizer/NN in/IN the/DT learning/NN problem/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP an/DT equivalence/NN between/IN market/NN scoring/NN rules/NNS and/CC prediction/NN markets/NNS with/IN convex/NN cost/NN functions/NNS ./.
This/DT implies/VBZ that/IN market/NN scoring/NN rules/NNS can/MD also/RB be/VB interpreted/VBN naturally/RB as/IN Follow/VB the/DT Regularized/NNP Leader/NNP algorithms/NNS ,/, and/CC may/MD be/VB of/IN independent/JJ interest/NN ./.
