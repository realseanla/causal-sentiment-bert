In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP learning/VBG problems/NNS for/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ data/NNS ./.
Previously/RB ,/, oblivious/JJ random/JJ projection/NN based/VBN approaches/NNS that/WDT project/VBP high/JJ dimensional/JJ features/NNS onto/IN a/DT random/JJ subspace/NN have/VBP been/VBN used/VBN in/IN practice/NN for/IN tackling/VBG high/JJ -/HYPH dimensionality/NN challenge/NN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN ./.
Recently/RB ,/, various/JJ non-oblivious/JJ randomized/JJ reduction/NN methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN developed/VBN and/CC deployed/VBN for/IN solving/VBG many/JJ numerical/JJ problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN matrix/NN product/NN approximation/NN ,/, low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN matrix/NN approximation/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.
However/RB ,/, they/PRP are/VBP less/RBR explored/VBN for/IN the/DT machine/NN learning/NN tasks/NNS ,/, e.g./FW ,/, classification/NN ./.
More/JJR seriously/RB ,/, the/DT theoretical/JJ analysis/NN of/IN excess/JJ risk/NN bounds/NNS for/IN risk/NN minimization/NN ,/, an/DT important/JJ measure/NN of/IN generalization/NN performance/NN ,/, has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN established/VBN for/IN non-oblivious/JJ randomized/JJ reduction/NN methods/NNS ./.
It/PRP therefore/RB remains/VBZ an/DT open/JJ problem/NN what/WP is/VBZ the/DT benefit/NN of/IN using/VBG them/PRP over/IN previous/JJ oblivious/JJ random/JJ projection/NN based/VBN approaches/NNS ./.
To/TO tackle/VB these/DT challenges/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT algorithmic/JJ framework/NN for/IN employing/VBG non-oblivious/JJ randomized/JJ reduction/NN method/NN for/IN general/JJ empirical/JJ risk/NN minimizing/VBG in/IN machine/NN learning/NN tasks/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT original/JJ high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ features/NNS are/VBP projected/VBN onto/IN a/DT random/JJ subspace/NN that/WDT is/VBZ derived/VBN from/IN the/DT data/NNS with/IN a/DT small/JJ matrix/NN approximation/NN error/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB derive/VBP the/DT first/JJ excess/JJ risk/NN bound/VBN for/IN the/DT proposed/VBN non-oblivious/JJ randomized/JJ reduction/NN approach/NN without/IN requiring/VBG strong/JJ assumptions/NNS on/IN the/DT training/NN data/NNS ./.
The/DT established/VBN excess/JJ risk/NN bound/VBN exhibits/VBZ that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN provides/VBZ much/RB better/JJR generalization/NN performance/NN and/CC it/PRP also/RB sheds/VBZ more/JJR insights/NNS about/IN different/JJ randomized/JJ reduction/NN approaches/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP conduct/VBP extensive/JJ experiments/NNS on/IN both/DT synthetic/JJ and/CC real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN benchmark/NN datasets/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ dimension/NN scales/NNS to/IN $/$ O/UH (/-LRB- 10/CD ^/SYM 7/CD )/-RRB- $/$ ,/, to/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT efficacy/NN of/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN approach/NN ./.
