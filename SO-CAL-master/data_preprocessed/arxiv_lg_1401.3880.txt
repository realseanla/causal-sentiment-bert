In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP apply/VBP Conformal/JJ Prediction/NN (/-LRB- CP/NN )/-RRB- to/IN the/DT k/NN -/HYPH Nearest/JJS Neighbours/NNS Regression/NN (/-LRB- k/CD -/SYM NNR/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN and/CC propose/VB ways/NNS of/IN extending/VBG the/DT typical/JJ nonconformity/NN measure/NN used/VBN for/IN regression/NN so/RB far/RB ./.
Unlike/IN traditional/JJ regression/NN methods/NNS which/WDT produce/VBP point/NN predictions/NNS ,/, Conformal/JJ Predictors/NNS output/NN predictive/JJ regions/NNS that/WDT satisfy/VBP a/DT given/VBN confidence/NN level/NN ./.
The/DT regions/NNS produced/VBN by/IN any/DT Conformal/JJ Predictor/NN are/VBP automatically/RB valid/JJ ,/, however/RB their/PRP$ tightness/NN and/CC therefore/RB usefulness/NN depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT nonconformity/NN measure/NN used/VBN by/IN each/DT CP/NN ./.
In/IN effect/NN a/DT nonconformity/NN measure/NN evaluates/VBZ how/WRB strange/JJ a/DT given/VBN example/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN to/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN other/JJ examples/NNS based/VBN on/IN some/DT traditional/JJ machine/NN learning/VBG algorithm/NN ./.
We/PRP define/VBP six/CD novel/JJ nonconformity/NN measures/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT k/NN -/HYPH Nearest/JJS Neighbours/NNPS Regression/NNP algorithm/NN and/CC develop/VB the/DT corresponding/VBG CPs/NNS following/VBG both/CC the/DT original/JJ (/-LRB- transductive/JJ )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT inductive/JJ CP/NN approaches/NNS ./.
