Real/JJ data/NNS often/RB contains/VBZ a/DT mixture/NN of/IN discrete/JJ and/CC continuous/JJ variables/NNS ,/, but/CC many/JJ Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN and/CC inference/NN algorithms/NNS assume/VBP all/DT random/JJ variables/NNS are/VBP discrete/JJ ./.
Continuous/JJ variables/NNS are/VBP often/RB discretized/VBN ,/, but/CC the/DT choice/NN of/IN discretization/NN policy/NN has/VBZ significant/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT accuracy/NN ,/, speed/NN ,/, and/CC interpretability/NN of/IN the/DT resulting/VBG models/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT principled/JJ Bayesian/JJ discretization/NN method/NN for/IN continuous/JJ variables/NNS in/IN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS with/IN quadratic/JJ complexity/NN instead/RB of/IN the/DT cubic/JJ complexity/NN of/IN other/JJ standard/JJ techniques/NNS ./.
Empirical/JJ demonstrations/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ superior/JJ to/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, this/DT paper/NN shows/VBZ how/WRB to/TO incorporate/VB existing/VBG methods/NNS into/IN the/DT structure/NN learning/NN process/NN to/IN discretize/NN all/DT continuous/JJ variables/NNS and/CC simultaneously/RB learn/VB Bayesian/JJ network/NN structures/NNS ./.
