This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN privacy/NN preservation/NN if/IN the/DT query/NN returns/VBZ the/DT histogram/NN of/IN rankings/NNS ./.
The/DT framework/NN of/IN differential/JJ privacy/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/IN rank/NN aggregation/NN ./.
The/DT error/NN probability/NN of/IN the/DT aggregated/VBN ranking/NN is/VBZ analyzed/VBN as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN noise/NN added/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB differential/JJ privacy/NN ./.
Upper/NNP bounds/NNS on/IN the/DT error/NN rates/NNS for/IN any/DT positional/JJ ranking/NN rule/NN are/VBP derived/VBN under/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN profiles/NNS are/VBP uniformly/RB distributed/VBN ./.
