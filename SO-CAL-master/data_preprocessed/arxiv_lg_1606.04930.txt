Our/PRP$ goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO build/VB a/DT generative/JJ model/NN from/IN a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN architecture/NN to/TO try/VB to/TO create/VB music/NN that/WDT has/VBZ both/DT harmony/NN and/CC melody/NN and/CC is/VBZ passable/JJ as/IN music/NN composed/VBN by/IN humans/NNS ./.
Previous/JJ work/NN in/IN music/NN generation/NN has/VBZ mainly/RB been/VBN focused/VBN on/IN creating/VBG a/DT single/JJ melody/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN work/NN based/VBN off/IN of/IN Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS combined/VBN with/IN Restricted/VBN Boltzmann/NNP Machines/NNPS (/-LRB- RNN/NN -/HYPH RBM/NN )/-RRB- and/CC other/JJ similar/JJ recurrent/JJ energy/NN based/VBN models/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ to/TO perform/VB end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN learning/NN and/CC generation/NN with/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ nets/NNS alone/RB ./.
