Over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, symmetric/JJ positive/JJ definite/JJ (/-LRB- SPD/NN )/-RRB- matrices/NNS have/VBP been/VBN receiving/VBG considerable/JJ attention/NN from/IN computer/NN vision/NN community/NN ./.
Though/IN various/JJ distance/NN measures/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN in/IN the/DT past/NN for/IN comparing/VBG SPD/NN matrices/NNS ,/, the/DT two/CD most/RBS widely/RB -/HYPH used/VBN measures/NNS are/VBP affine/JJ -/HYPH invariant/JJ distance/NN and/CC log/NN -/HYPH Euclidean/JJ distance/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ because/IN these/DT two/CD measures/NNS are/VBP true/JJ geodesic/JJ distances/NNS induced/VBN by/IN Riemannian/NNP geometry/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN the/DT log/NN -/HYPH Euclidean/JJ Riemannian/JJ geometry/NN and/CC propose/VB a/DT data/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN approach/NN for/IN learning/VBG Riemannian/JJ metrics/NNS //, geodesic/JJ distances/NNS for/IN SPD/NN matrices/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT geodesic/JJ distance/NN learned/VBN using/VBG the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN performs/VBZ better/JJR than/IN various/JJ existing/VBG distance/NN measures/NNS when/WRB evaluated/VBN on/IN face/NN matching/NN and/CC clustering/NN tasks/NNS ./.
