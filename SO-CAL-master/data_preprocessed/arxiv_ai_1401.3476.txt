As/IN fragments/NNS of/IN first/JJ -/HYPH order/NN logic/NN ,/, Description/NN logics/NNS (/-LRB- DLs/NNS )/-RRB- do/VBP not/RB provide/VB nonmonotonic/JJ features/NNS such/JJ as/IN defeasible/JJ inheritance/NN and/CC default/NN rules/NNS ./.
Since/IN many/JJ applications/NNS would/MD benefit/VB from/IN the/DT availability/NN of/IN such/JJ features/NNS ,/, several/JJ families/NNS of/IN nonmonotonic/JJ DLs/NNS have/VBP been/VBN developed/VBN that/WDT are/VBP mostly/RB based/VBN on/IN default/NN logic/NN and/CC autoepistemic/JJ logic/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP circumscription/NN as/IN an/DT interesting/JJ alternative/JJ approach/NN to/IN nonmonotonic/JJ DLs/NNS that/WDT ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, supports/VBZ defeasible/JJ inheritance/NN in/IN a/DT natural/JJ way/NN ./.
We/PRP study/VBP DLs/NNS extended/VBN with/IN circumscription/NN under/IN different/JJ language/NN restrictions/NNS and/CC under/IN different/JJ constraints/NNS on/IN the/DT sets/NNS of/IN minimized/VBN ,/, fixed/VBN ,/, and/CC varying/VBG predicates/NNS ,/, and/CC pinpoint/VB the/DT exact/JJ computational/JJ complexity/NN of/IN reasoning/NN for/IN DLs/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN ALC/NNP to/IN ALCIO/NNP and/CC ALCQO/NNP ./.
When/WRB the/DT minimized/VBN and/CC fixed/VBN predicates/NNS include/VBP only/RB concept/NN names/NNS but/CC no/DT role/NN names/NNS ,/, then/RB reasoning/NN is/VBZ complete/JJ for/IN NExpTime/NNP ^/SYM NP/NNP ./.
It/PRP becomes/VBZ complete/JJ for/IN NP/NNP ^/SYM NExpTime/NNP when/WRB the/DT number/NN of/IN minimized/VBN and/CC fixed/VBN predicates/NNS is/VBZ bounded/VBN by/IN a/DT constant/JJ ./.
If/IN roles/NNS can/MD be/VB minimized/VBN or/CC fixed/VBN ,/, then/RB complexity/NN ranges/VBZ from/IN NExpTime/NNP ^/SYM NP/NNP to/IN undecidability/NN ./.
