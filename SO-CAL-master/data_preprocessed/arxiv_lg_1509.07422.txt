A/DT framework/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN for/IN solving/VBG a/DT sequence/NN of/IN slowly/RB changing/VBG optimization/NN problems/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT arising/VBG in/IN regression/NN and/CC classification/NN applications/NNS ,/, using/VBG optimization/NN algorithms/NNS such/JJ as/IN stochastic/JJ gradient/NN descent/NN (/-LRB- SGD/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT optimization/NN problems/NNS change/VBP slowly/RB in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN the/DT minimizers/NNS change/VBP at/IN either/CC a/DT fixed/VBN or/CC bounded/VBN rate/NN ./.
A/DT method/NN based/VBN on/IN estimates/NNS of/IN the/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT minimizers/NNS and/CC properties/NNS of/IN the/DT optimization/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN for/IN adaptively/RB selecting/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN samples/NNS needed/VBN from/IN the/DT distributions/NNS underlying/VBG each/DT problem/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT excess/JJ risk/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, the/DT expected/VBN gap/NN between/IN the/DT loss/NN achieved/VBN by/IN the/DT approximate/JJ minimizer/NN produced/VBN by/IN the/DT optimization/NN algorithm/NN and/CC the/DT exact/JJ minimizer/NN ,/, does/VBZ not/RB exceed/VB a/DT target/NN level/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS with/IN synthetic/JJ and/CC real/JJ data/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO confirm/VB that/IN this/DT approach/NN performs/VBZ well/RB ./.
