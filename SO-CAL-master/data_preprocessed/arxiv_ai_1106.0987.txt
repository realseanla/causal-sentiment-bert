The/DT structure/NN representation/NN of/IN data/NNS distribution/NN plays/VBZ an/DT important/JJ role/NN in/IN understanding/VBG the/DT underlying/JJ mechanism/NN of/IN generating/VBG data/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP nearest/JJS prime/JJ simplicial/JJ complex/JJ approaches/NNS (/-LRB- NSC/NNP )/-RRB- by/IN utilizing/VBG persistent/JJ homology/NN to/TO capture/VB such/JJ structures/NNS ./.
Assuming/VBG that/IN each/DT class/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN with/IN a/DT prime/JJ simplicial/JJ complex/NN ,/, we/PRP classify/VBP unlabeled/JJ samples/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT nearest/JJS projection/NN distances/NNS from/IN the/DT samples/NNS to/IN the/DT simplicial/JJ complexes/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB extend/VBP the/DT extrapolation/NN ability/NN of/IN these/DT complexes/NNS with/IN a/DT projection/NN constraint/NN term/NN ./.
