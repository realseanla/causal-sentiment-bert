In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP aim/VBP at/IN developing/VBG an/DT extractive/JJ summarizer/NN in/IN the/DT multi-document/JJ setting/NN ./.
We/PRP implement/VBP a/DT rank/NN based/VBN sentence/NN selection/NN using/VBG continuous/JJ vector/NN representations/NNS along/IN with/IN key/JJ -/HYPH phrases/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT model/NN to/TO tackle/VB summary/NN coherence/NN for/IN increasing/VBG readability/NN ./.
We/PRP conduct/VBP experiments/NNS on/IN the/DT Document/NN Understanding/VBG Conference/NN (/-LRB- DUC/NNP )/-RRB- 2004/CD datasets/NNS using/VBG ROUGE/NN toolkit/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT methods/NNS bring/VBP significant/JJ improvements/NNS over/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN methods/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN informativity/NN and/CC coherence/NN ./.
