Constraints/NNS that/WDT may/MD be/VB obtained/VBN by/IN composition/NN from/IN simpler/JJR constraints/NNS are/VBP present/JJ ,/, in/IN some/DT way/NN or/CC another/DT ,/, in/IN almost/RB every/DT constraint/NN program/NN ./.
The/DT decomposition/NN of/IN such/JJ constraints/NNS is/VBZ a/DT standard/JJ technique/NN for/IN obtaining/VBG an/DT adequate/JJ propagation/NN algorithm/NN from/IN a/DT combination/NN of/IN propagators/NNS designed/VBN for/IN simpler/JJR constraints/NNS ./.
The/DT decomposition/NN approach/NN is/VBZ appealing/VBG in/IN several/JJ ways/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB because/IN creating/VBG a/DT specific/JJ propagator/NN for/IN every/DT constraint/NN is/VBZ clearly/RB infeasible/JJ since/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN constraints/NNS is/VBZ infinite/JJ ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, because/IN designing/VBG a/DT propagation/NN algorithm/NN for/IN complex/JJ constraints/NNS can/MD be/VB very/RB challenging/JJ ./.
Finally/RB ,/, reusing/VBG existing/VBG propagators/NNS allows/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT size/NN of/IN code/NN to/TO be/VB developed/VBN and/CC maintained/VBN ./.
Traditionally/RB ,/, constraint/NN solvers/NNS automatically/RB decompose/VBP constraints/NNS into/IN simpler/JJR ones/NNS using/VBG additional/JJ auxiliary/JJ variables/NNS and/CC propagators/NNS ,/, or/CC expect/VB the/DT users/NNS to/TO perform/VB such/JJ decomposition/NN themselves/PRP ,/, eventually/RB leading/VBG to/IN the/DT same/JJ propagation/NN model/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP explore/VBP views/NNS ,/, an/DT alternative/JJ way/NN to/TO create/VB efficient/JJ propagators/NNS for/IN such/JJ constraints/NNS in/IN a/DT modular/JJ ,/, simple/JJ and/CC correct/JJ way/NN ,/, which/WDT avoids/VBZ the/DT introduction/NN of/IN auxiliary/JJ variables/NNS and/CC propagators/NNS ./.
