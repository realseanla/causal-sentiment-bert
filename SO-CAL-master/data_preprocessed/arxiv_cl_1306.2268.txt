Knowledge/NN Representation/NN (/-LRB- KR/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ traditionally/RB based/VBN on/IN the/DT logic/NN of/IN facts/NNS ,/, expressed/VBN in/IN boolean/JJ logic/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, facts/NNS about/IN an/DT agent/NN can/MD also/RB be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN accomplished/JJ tasks/NNS by/IN the/DT agent/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/IN KR/NNP :/: the/DT notion/NN of/IN task/NN logical/JJ KR/NN based/VBN on/IN Computability/NNP Logic/NNP ./.
This/DT notion/NN allows/VBZ the/DT user/NN to/TO represent/VB both/DT accomplished/JJ tasks/NNS and/CC accomplishable/JJ tasks/NNS by/IN the/DT agent/NN ./.
This/DT notion/NN allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO build/VB sophisticated/JJ KRs/NNS about/RB many/JJ interesting/JJ agents/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP not/RB been/VBN supported/VBN by/IN previous/JJ logical/JJ languages/NNS ./.
