When/WRB human/JJ agents/NNS come/VBN together/RB to/TO make/VB decisions/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB the/DT case/NN that/IN one/CD human/JJ agent/NN has/VBZ more/JJR information/NN than/IN the/DT other/JJ and/CC this/DT phenomenon/NN is/VBZ called/VBN information/NN asymmetry/NN and/CC this/DT distorts/VBZ the/DT market/NN ./.
Often/RB if/IN one/CD human/JJ agent/NN intends/VBZ to/TO manipulate/VB a/DT decision/NN in/IN its/PRP$ favor/NN the/DT human/JJ agent/NN can/MD signal/VB wrong/JJ or/CC right/JJ information/NN ./.
Alternatively/RB ,/, one/CD human/JJ agent/NN can/MD screen/VB for/IN information/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT impact/NN of/IN asymmetric/JJ information/NN on/IN decisions/NNS ./.
With/IN the/DT advent/NN of/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN ,/, signaling/NN and/CC screening/NN have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN easier/JJR ./.
This/DT chapter/NN studies/NNS the/DT impact/NN of/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN on/IN the/DT theory/NN of/IN asymmetric/JJ information/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ surmised/VBN that/IN artificial/JJ intelligent/JJ agents/NNS reduce/VBP the/DT degree/NN of/IN information/NN asymmetry/NN and/CC thus/RB the/DT market/NN where/WRB these/DT agents/NNS are/VBP deployed/VBN become/VBN more/RBR efficient/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB postulated/VBN that/IN the/DT more/JJR artificial/JJ intelligent/JJ agents/NNS there/EX are/VBP deployed/VBN in/IN the/DT market/NN the/DT less/JJR is/VBZ the/DT volume/NN of/IN trades/NNS in/IN the/DT market/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ because/IN for/IN trade/NN to/TO happen/VB the/DT asymmetry/NN of/IN information/NN on/IN goods/NNS and/CC services/NNS to/TO be/VB traded/VBN should/MD exist/VB ./.
