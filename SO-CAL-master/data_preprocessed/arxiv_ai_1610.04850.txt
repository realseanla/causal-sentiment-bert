Cold/JJ start/NN problem/NN in/IN Collaborative/JJ Filtering/NN can/MD be/VB solved/VBN by/IN asking/VBG new/JJ users/NNS to/IN rate/NN a/DT small/JJ seed/NN set/NN of/IN representative/JJ items/NNS or/CC by/IN asking/VBG representative/JJ users/NNS to/IN rate/NN a/DT new/JJ item/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS successful/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, called/VBN Representative/NNP Based/VBN Matrix/NNP Factorization/NNP ,/, is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN Maxvol/NNP algorithm/NN ./.
