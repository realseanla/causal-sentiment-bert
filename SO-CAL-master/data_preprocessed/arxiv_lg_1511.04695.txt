We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN decomposition/NN of/IN incomplete/JJ multiway/NN tensors/NNS ./.
Since/IN many/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN data/NNS lie/VBP on/IN an/DT intrinsically/RB low/JJ dimensional/JJ subspace/NN ,/, tensor/NN low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN decomposition/NN with/IN missing/VBG entries/NNS has/VBZ applications/NNS in/IN many/JJ data/NNS analysis/NN problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN recommender/NN systems/NNS and/CC image/NN inpainting/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN Tucker/NNP decomposition/NN which/WDT represents/VBZ an/DT Nth/JJ -/HYPH order/NN tensor/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN N/NN factor/NN matrices/NNS and/CC a/DT core/NN tensor/NN via/IN multilinear/NN operations/NNS ./.
To/TO exploit/VB the/DT underlying/VBG multilinear/NN low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN structure/NN in/IN high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ datasets/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT group/NN -/HYPH based/VBN log/NN -/HYPH sum/NN penalty/NN functional/JJ to/IN place/NN structural/JJ sparsity/NN over/IN the/DT core/NN tensor/NN ,/, which/WDT leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT compact/JJ representation/NN with/IN smallest/JJS core/NN tensor/NN ./.
The/DT method/NN for/IN Tucker/NNP decomposition/NN is/VBZ developed/VBN by/IN iteratively/RB minimizing/VBG a/DT surrogate/JJ function/NN that/WDT majorizes/VBZ the/DT original/JJ objective/NN function/NN ,/, which/WDT results/VBZ in/IN an/DT iterative/JJ reweighted/JJ process/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, to/TO reduce/VB the/DT computational/JJ complexity/NN ,/, an/DT over-relaxed/JJ monotone/JJ fast/JJ iterative/JJ shrinkage/NN -/HYPH thresholding/VBG technique/NN is/VBZ adapted/VBN and/CC embedded/VBN in/IN the/DT iterative/JJ reweighted/JJ process/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO determine/VB the/DT model/NN complexity/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW multilinear/FW rank/NN )/-RRB- in/IN an/DT automatic/JJ way/NN ./.
Simulation/NNP results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN offers/VBZ competitive/JJ performance/NN compared/VBN with/IN other/JJ existing/VBG algorithms/NNS ./.
