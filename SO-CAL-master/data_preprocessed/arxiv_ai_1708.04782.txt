This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ SC2LE/NN (/-LRB- StarCraft/NN II/CD Learning/NN Environment/NN )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT reinforcement/NN learning/VBG environment/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT StarCraft/NNP II/NNP game/NN ./.
This/DT domain/NN poses/VBZ a/DT new/JJ grand/JJ challenge/NN for/IN reinforcement/NN learning/NN ,/, representing/VBG a/DT more/RBR difficult/JJ class/NN of/IN problems/NNS than/IN considered/VBN in/IN most/JJS prior/JJ work/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ a/DT multi-agent/JJ problem/NN with/IN multiple/JJ players/NNS interacting/VBG ;/: there/EX is/VBZ imperfect/JJ information/NN due/IN to/IN a/DT partially/RB observed/VBN map/NN ;/: it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT large/JJ action/NN space/NN involving/VBG the/DT selection/NN and/CC control/NN of/IN hundreds/NNS of/IN units/NNS ;/: it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT large/JJ state/NN space/NN that/WDT must/MD be/VB observed/VBN solely/RB from/IN raw/JJ input/NN feature/NN planes/NNS ;/: and/CC it/PRP has/VBZ delayed/VBN credit/NN assignment/NN requiring/VBG long/RB -/HYPH term/NN strategies/NNS over/IN thousands/NNS of/IN steps/NNS ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP the/DT observation/NN ,/, action/NN ,/, and/CC reward/VB specification/NN for/IN the/DT StarCraft/NNP II/NNP domain/NN and/CC provide/VB an/DT open/JJ source/NN Python/NN -/HYPH based/VBN interface/NN for/IN communicating/VBG with/IN the/DT game/NN engine/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN to/IN the/DT main/JJ game/NN maps/NNS ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP a/DT suite/NN of/IN mini-games/NNS focusing/VBG on/IN different/JJ elements/NNS of/IN StarCraft/NNP II/NNP gameplay/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT main/JJ game/NN maps/NNS ,/, we/PRP also/RB provide/VBP an/DT accompanying/JJ dataset/NN of/IN game/NN replay/NN data/NNS from/IN human/JJ expert/NN players/NNS ./.
We/PRP give/VBP initial/JJ baseline/NN results/NNS for/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS trained/VBN from/IN this/DT data/NN to/TO predict/VB game/NN outcomes/NNS and/CC player/NN actions/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP initial/JJ baseline/NN results/NNS for/IN canonical/JJ deep/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG agents/NNS applied/VBD to/IN the/DT StarCraft/NNP II/NNP domain/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT mini-games/NNS ,/, these/DT agents/NNS learn/VBP to/TO achieve/VB a/DT level/NN of/IN play/NN that/WDT is/VBZ comparable/JJ to/IN a/DT novice/NN player/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, when/WRB trained/VBN on/IN the/DT main/JJ game/NN ,/, these/DT agents/NNS are/VBP unable/JJ to/TO make/VB significant/JJ progress/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, SC2LE/NN offers/VBZ a/DT new/JJ and/CC challenging/JJ environment/NN for/IN exploring/VBG deep/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG algorithms/NNS and/CC architectures/NNS ./.
