In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ vehicle/NN trajectory/NN prediction/NN framework/NN based/VBN on/IN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN ./.
Basically/RB ,/, the/DT characteristic/NN of/IN the/DT vehicle/NN 's/POS trajectory/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN that/DT of/IN regular/JJ moving/JJ objects/NNS since/IN it/PRP is/VBZ affected/VBN by/IN various/JJ latent/JJ factors/NNS including/VBG road/NN structure/NN ,/, traffic/NN rules/NNS ,/, and/CC driver/NN 's/POS intention/NN ./.
Previous/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN approaches/NNS use/VBP sophisticated/JJ vehicle/NN behavior/NN model/NN describing/VBG these/DT factors/NNS and/CC derive/VBP the/DT complex/JJ trajectory/NN prediction/NN algorithm/NN ,/, which/WDT requires/VBZ a/DT system/NN designer/NN to/TO conduct/VB intensive/JJ model/NN optimization/NN for/IN practical/JJ use/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ data/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN and/CC simple/JJ to/TO use/VB in/IN that/IN it/PRP learns/VBZ complex/JJ behavior/NN of/IN the/DT vehicles/NNS from/IN the/DT massive/JJ amount/NN of/IN trajectory/NN data/NNS through/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN model/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN trajectory/NN prediction/NN method/NN employs/VBZ the/DT recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN called/VBN long/RB short/JJ -/HYPH term/NN memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- to/TO analyze/VB the/DT temporal/JJ behavior/NN and/CC predict/VB the/DT future/JJ coordinate/NN of/IN the/DT surrounding/VBG vehicles/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN scheme/NN feeds/VBZ the/DT sequence/NN of/IN vehicles/NNS '/POS coordinates/NNS obtained/VBN from/IN sensor/NN measurements/NNS to/IN the/DT LSTM/NNP and/CC produces/VBZ the/DT probabilistic/JJ information/NN on/IN the/DT future/JJ location/NN of/IN the/DT vehicles/NNS over/IN occupancy/NN grid/NN map/NN ./.
The/DT experiments/NNS conducted/VBN using/VBG the/DT data/NNS collected/VBN from/IN highway/NN driving/VBG show/NN that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN can/MD produce/VB reasonably/RB good/JJ estimate/NN of/IN future/JJ trajectory/NN ./.
