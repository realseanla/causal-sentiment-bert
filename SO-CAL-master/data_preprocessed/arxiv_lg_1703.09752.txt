Intrusion/NN detection/NN for/IN computer/NN network/NN systems/NNS becomes/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS critical/JJ tasks/NNS for/IN network/NN administrators/NNS today/NN ./.

Besides/RB ,/, anomaly/NN detection/NN in/IN network/NN security/NN is/VBZ aim/NN to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN illegal/JJ or/CC malicious/JJ events/NNS and/CC normal/JJ behavior/NN of/IN network/NN systems/NNS ./.
Anomaly/NNP detection/NN can/MD be/VB considered/VBN as/IN a/DT classification/NN problem/NN where/WRB it/PRP builds/VBZ models/NNS of/IN normal/JJ network/NN behavior/NN ,/, which/WDT it/PRP uses/VBZ to/TO detect/VB new/JJ patterns/NNS that/WDT significantly/RB deviate/VBP from/IN the/DT model/NN ./.

Normally/RB a/DT Long/JJ Short/JJ Term/NN Memory/NN Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NNP RNN/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ trained/VBN only/RB on/IN normal/JJ data/NNS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN predicting/VBG several/JJ time/NN steps/NNS ahead/RB of/IN an/DT input/NN ./.

The/DT prediction/NN errors/NNS from/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN the/DT latest/JJS time/NN steps/NNS above/IN a/DT threshold/NN will/MD indicate/VB a/DT collective/JJ anomaly/NN ./.
