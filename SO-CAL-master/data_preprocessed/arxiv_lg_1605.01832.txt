Cross-graph/JJ Relational/JJ Learning/NN (/-LRB- CGRL/NN )/-RRB- refers/VBZ to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN predicting/VBG the/DT strengths/NNS or/CC labels/NNS of/IN multi-relational/JJ tuples/NNS of/IN heterogeneous/JJ object/NN types/NNS ,/, through/IN the/DT joint/JJ inference/NN over/IN multiple/JJ graphs/NNS which/WDT specify/VBP the/DT internal/JJ connections/NNS among/IN each/DT type/NN of/IN objects/NNS ./.
CGRL/NN is/VBZ an/DT open/JJ challenge/NN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT daunting/JJ number/NN of/IN all/DT possible/JJ tuples/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN when/WRB the/DT numbers/NNS of/IN nodes/NNS in/IN multiple/JJ graphs/NNS are/VBP large/JJ ,/, and/CC because/IN the/DT labeled/VBN training/NN instances/NNS are/VBP extremely/RB sparse/JJ as/IN typical/JJ ./.
Existing/VBG methods/NNS such/JJ as/IN tensor/NN factorization/NN or/CC tensor/NN -/HYPH kernel/NN machines/NNS do/VBP not/RB work/VB well/RB because/IN of/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN convex/NN formulation/NN for/IN the/DT optimization/NN of/IN CGRL/NN models/NNS ,/, the/DT poor/JJ scalability/NN of/IN the/DT algorithms/NNS in/IN handling/VBG combinatorial/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN tuples/NNS ,/, and/CC //HYPH or/CC the/DT non-transductive/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT learning/NN methods/NNS which/WDT limits/VBZ their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO leverage/VB unlabeled/JJ data/NNS in/IN training/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ framework/NN which/WDT formulates/VBZ CGRL/NN as/IN a/DT convex/NN optimization/NN problem/NN ,/, enables/VBZ transductive/JJ learning/NN using/VBG both/CC labeled/VBN and/CC unlabeled/JJ tuples/NNS ,/, and/CC offers/VBZ a/DT scalable/JJ algorithm/NN that/WDT guarantees/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ solution/NN and/CC enjoys/VBZ a/DT linear/JJ time/NN complexity/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT sizes/NNS of/IN input/NN graphs/NNS ./.
