Sparse/JJ representation/NN based/VBN classification/NN (/-LRB- SRC/NN )/-RRB- has/VBZ been/VBN proved/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT simple/JJ ,/, effective/JJ and/CC robust/JJ solution/NN to/TO face/VB recognition/NN ./.
As/IN it/PRP gets/VBZ popular/JJ ,/, doubts/NNS on/IN the/DT necessity/NN of/IN enforcing/VBG sparsity/NN starts/VBZ coming/VBG up/RP ,/, and/CC primary/JJ experimental/JJ results/NNS showed/VBD that/IN simply/RB changing/VBG the/DT $/$ l_1/CD $/$ -/HYPH norm/NN based/VBN regularization/NN to/IN the/DT computationally/RB much/RB more/RBR efficient/JJ $/$ l_2/CD $/$ -/HYPH norm/NN based/VBN non-sparse/JJ version/NN would/MD lead/VB to/IN a/DT similar/JJ or/CC even/RB better/JJR performance/NN ./.
