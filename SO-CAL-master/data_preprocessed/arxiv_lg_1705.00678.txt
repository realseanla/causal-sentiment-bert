Many/JJ similarity/NN -/HYPH based/VBN clustering/NN methods/NNS work/VBP in/IN two/CD separate/JJ steps/NNS including/VBG similarity/NN matrix/NN computation/NN and/CC subsequent/JJ spectral/JJ clustering/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, similarity/NN measurement/NN is/VBZ challenging/JJ because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB impacted/VBN by/IN many/JJ factors/NNS ,/, e.g./FW ,/, the/DT choice/NN of/IN similarity/NN metric/JJ ,/, neighborhood/NN size/NN ,/, scale/NN of/IN data/NNS ,/, noise/NN and/CC outliers/NNS ./.
