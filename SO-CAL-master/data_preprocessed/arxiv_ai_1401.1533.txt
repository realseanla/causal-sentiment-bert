In/IN this/DT work/NN I/PRP propose/VBP the/DT conjecture/NN that/WDT ,/, within/IN a/DT cognitive/JJ system/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO represent/VB only/RB the/DT structure/NN of/IN objects/NNS and/CC phenomena/NNS of/IN the/DT external/JJ reality/NN ./.
I/PRP suggest/VBP a/DT methodology/NN to/TO handle/VB the/DT concepts/NNS of/IN structure/NN and/CC scheme/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO carry/VB out/RP on/IN them/PRP operations/NNS of/IN structural/JJ analysis/NN ./.

With/IN these/DT tools/NNS ,/, I/PRP suggest/VBP a/DT definition/NN for/IN the/DT concepts/NNS of/IN rules/NNS and/CC emergent/JJ phenomena/NNS ./.
I/PRP analyze/VBP some/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN rule/NN and/CC I/PRP propose/VBP to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN operational/JJ and/CC associative/JJ rules/NNS ./.
