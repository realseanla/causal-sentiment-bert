Predicting/NNP the/DT subcellular/JJ localization/NN of/IN proteins/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ and/CC challenging/JJ problem/NN ./.
Traditional/JJ experimental/JJ approaches/NNS are/VBP often/RB expensive/JJ and/CC time/NN -/HYPH consuming/VBG ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, a/DT growing/VBG number/NN of/IN research/NN efforts/NNS employ/VBP a/DT series/NN of/IN machine/NN learning/NN approaches/VBZ to/TO predict/VB the/DT subcellular/JJ location/NN of/IN proteins/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP two/CD main/JJ challenges/NNS among/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN prediction/NN methods/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT existing/VBG techniques/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO deal/VB with/IN multi-class/NN rather/RB than/IN multi-label/JJ classification/NN ,/, which/WDT ignores/VBZ connections/NNS between/IN multiple/JJ labels/NNS ./.
In/IN reality/NN ,/, multiple/JJ locations/NNS of/IN particular/JJ proteins/NN implies/VBZ that/IN there/EX are/VBP vital/JJ and/CC unique/JJ biological/JJ significances/NNS that/WDT deserve/VBP special/JJ focus/NN and/CC can/MD not/RB be/VB ignored/VBN ./.
Second/RB ,/, techniques/NNS for/IN handling/VBG imbalanced/JJ data/NNS in/IN multi-label/JJ classification/NN problems/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ ,/, but/CC never/RB employed/VBN ./.
For/IN solving/VBG these/DT two/CD issues/NNS ,/, we/PRP have/VBP developed/VBN an/DT ensemble/NN multi-label/JJ classifier/NN called/VBN HPSLPred/NNP ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB applied/VBN for/IN multi-label/JJ classification/NN with/IN an/DT imbalanced/JJ protein/NN source/NN ./.
For/IN convenience/NN ,/, a/DT user/NN -/HYPH friendly/JJ webserver/NN has/VBZ been/VBN established/VBN at/IN
