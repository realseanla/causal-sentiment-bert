Philosophers/NNS writing/VBG about/IN the/DT ravens/NNS paradox/NN often/RB note/VBP that/IN Nicod/NNP 's/POS Condition/NNP (/-LRB- NC/NN )/-RRB- holds/VBZ given/VBN some/DT set/NN of/IN background/NN information/NN ,/, and/CC fails/VBZ to/TO hold/VB against/IN others/NNS ,/, but/CC rarely/RB go/VB any/DT further/JJ ./.
That/DT is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ usually/RB not/RB explored/VBN which/WDT background/NN information/NN makes/VBZ NC/NN true/JJ or/CC false/JJ ./.
The/DT present/JJ paper/NN aims/VBZ to/TO fill/VB this/DT gap/NN ./.
For/IN us/PRP ,/, "/'' (/-LRB- objective/NN )/-RRB- background/NN knowledge/NN "/'' is/VBZ restricted/VBN to/IN information/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB expressed/VBN as/IN probability/NN events/NNS ./.
Any/DT other/JJ configuration/NN is/VBZ regarded/VBN as/IN being/VBG subjective/JJ and/CC a/DT property/NN of/IN the/DT a/FW priori/FW probability/NN distribution/NN ./.
We/PRP study/VBP NC/NN in/IN two/CD specific/JJ settings/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT first/JJ case/NN ,/, a/DT complete/JJ description/NN of/IN some/DT individuals/NNS is/VBZ known/VBN ,/, e.g./FW one/CD knows/VBZ of/IN each/DT of/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN individuals/NNS whether/IN they/PRP are/VBP black/JJ and/CC whether/IN they/PRP are/VBP ravens/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT second/JJ case/NN ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN individuals/NNS having/VBG a/DT particular/JJ property/NN is/VBZ given/VBN ,/, e.g./FW one/CD knows/VBZ how/WRB many/JJ ravens/NNS or/CC how/WRB many/JJ black/JJ things/NNS there/EX are/VBP (/-LRB- in/IN the/DT relevant/JJ population/NN )/-RRB- ./.
While/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT most/RBS famous/JJ answers/NNS to/IN the/DT paradox/NN are/VBP measure/NN -/HYPH dependent/JJ ,/, our/PRP$ discussion/NN is/VBZ not/RB restricted/VBN to/IN any/DT particular/JJ probability/NN measure/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ most/RBS interesting/JJ result/NN is/VBZ that/IN in/IN the/DT second/JJ setting/NN ,/, NC/NN violates/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ kind/NN of/IN inductive/JJ inference/NN (/-LRB- namely/RB projectability/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Since/IN relative/JJ to/IN NC/NN ,/, this/DT latter/JJ rule/NN is/VBZ more/RBR closely/RB related/JJ to/IN ,/, and/CC more/RBR directly/RB justified/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ intuitive/JJ notion/NN of/IN inductive/JJ reasoning/NN ,/, this/DT tension/NN makes/VBZ a/DT case/NN against/IN the/DT plausibility/NN of/IN NC/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT informal/JJ representation/NN of/IN NC/NN may/MD seem/VB to/TO be/VB intuitively/RB plausible/JJ because/IN it/PRP can/MD easily/RB be/VB mistaken/JJ for/IN reasoning/NN by/IN analogy/NN ./.
