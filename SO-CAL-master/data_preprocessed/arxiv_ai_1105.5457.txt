STAN/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Graphplan/NNP -/HYPH based/VBN planner/NN ,/, so/RB -/HYPH called/VBN because/IN it/PRP uses/VBZ a/DT variety/NN of/IN STate/NN ANalysis/NN techniques/NNS to/TO enhance/VB its/PRP$ performance/NN ./.
STAN/NNP competed/VBD in/IN the/DT AIPS/NN -/HYPH 98/CD planning/NN competition/NN where/WRB it/PRP compared/VBD well/RB with/IN the/DT other/JJ competitors/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN speed/NN ,/, finding/VBG solutions/NNS fastest/JJS to/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT problems/NNS posed/VBD ./.
Although/IN the/DT domain/NN analysis/NN techniques/NNS STAN/NNP exploits/NNS are/VBP an/DT important/JJ factor/NN in/IN its/PRP$ overall/JJ performance/NN ,/, we/PRP believe/VBP that/IN the/DT speed/NN at/IN which/WDT STAN/NNP solved/VBD the/DT competition/NN problems/NNS is/VBZ largely/RB due/IN to/IN the/DT implementation/NN of/IN its/PRP$ plan/NN graph/NN ./.
The/DT implementation/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN two/CD insights/NNS :/: that/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT graph/NN construction/NN operations/NNS can/MD be/VB implemented/VBN as/IN bit/NN -/HYPH level/NN logical/JJ operations/NNS on/IN bit/NN vectors/NNS ,/, and/CC that/IN the/DT graph/NN should/MD not/RB be/VB explicitly/RB constructed/VBN beyond/IN the/DT fix/NN point/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ the/DT implementation/NN of/IN STAN/NNP 's/POS plan/NN graph/NN and/CC provides/VBZ experimental/JJ results/NNS which/WDT demonstrate/VBP the/DT circumstances/NNS under/IN which/WDT advantages/NNS can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN from/IN using/VBG this/DT implementation/NN ./.
