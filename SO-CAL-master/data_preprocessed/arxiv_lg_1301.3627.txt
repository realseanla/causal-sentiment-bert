A/DT key/JJ characteristic/NN of/IN work/NN on/IN deep/JJ learning/NN and/CC neural/JJ networks/NNS in/IN general/JJ is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP relies/VBZ on/IN representations/NNS of/IN the/DT input/NN that/WDT support/VBP generalization/NN ,/, robust/JJ inference/NN ,/, domain/NN adaptation/NN and/CC other/JJ desirable/JJ functionalities/NNS ./.
Much/JJ recent/JJ progress/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN has/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN efficient/JJ and/CC effective/JJ methods/NNS for/IN computing/VBG representations/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT alternative/JJ method/NN that/WDT is/VBZ more/RBR efficient/JJ than/IN prior/JJ work/NN and/CC produces/VBZ representations/NNS that/WDT have/VBP a/DT property/NN we/PRP call/VBP focality/NN --/: a/DT property/NN we/PRP hypothesize/VBP to/TO be/VB important/JJ for/IN neural/JJ network/NN representations/NNS ./.
The/DT method/NN consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT simple/JJ application/NN of/IN two/CD consecutive/JJ SVDs/NNS and/CC is/VBZ inspired/VBN by/IN Anandkumar/NNP (/-LRB- 2012/CD )/-RRB- ./.
