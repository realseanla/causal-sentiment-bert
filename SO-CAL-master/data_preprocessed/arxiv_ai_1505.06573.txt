The/DT article/NN is/VBZ devoted/VBN to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN inconsistency/NN in/IN the/DT pairwise/JJ comparisons/NNS based/VBN prioritization/NN methodology/NN ./.
The/DT issue/NN of/IN "/`` inconsistency/NN "/'' in/IN this/DT context/NN has/VBZ gained/VBN much/JJ attention/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.
The/DT literature/NN provides/VBZ us/PRP with/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN different/JJ "/`` inconsistency/NN "/'' indices/NNS suggested/VBD for/IN measuring/VBG the/DT inconsistency/NN of/IN the/DT pairwise/JJ comparison/NN matrix/NN (/-LRB- PCM/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT latter/JJ is/VBZ understood/VBN as/IN a/DT deviation/NN of/IN the/DT PCM/NN from/IN the/DT consistent/JJ case/NN -/HYPH a/DT notion/NN that/IN is/VBZ formally/RB well/RB -/HYPH defined/VBN in/IN this/DT theory/NN ./.
However/RB the/DT usage/NN of/IN the/DT indices/NNS is/VBZ justified/VBN only/RB by/IN some/DT heuristics/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ still/RB unclear/JJ what/WP they/PRP really/RB "/`` measure/VB "/'' ./.
What/WP is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR important/JJ and/CC still/RB not/RB known/VBN is/VBZ the/DT relationship/NN between/IN their/PRP$ values/NNS and/CC the/DT "/`` consistency/NN "/'' of/IN the/DT decision/NN maker/NN 's/POS judgments/NNS on/IN one/CD hand/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT prioritization/NN results/VBZ upon/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP examples/NNS showing/VBG that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN these/DT three/CD following/VBG tasks/NNS :/: the/DT "/`` measuring/VBG "/'' of/IN the/DT "/`` PCM/NN inconsistency/NN "/'' and/CC the/DT PCM/NN -/HYPH based/VBN "/`` measuring/VBG "/'' of/IN the/DT consistency/NN of/IN decision/NN maker/NN 's/POS judgments/NNS and/CC ,/, finally/RB ,/, the/DT "/`` measuring/VBG "/'' of/IN the/DT usefulness/NN of/IN the/DT PCM/NN as/IN a/DT source/NN of/IN information/NN for/IN estimation/NN of/IN the/DT riority/NN vector/NN (/-LRB- PV/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Next/RB we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN the/DT third/JJ one/CD ,/, which/WDT seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ one/NN in/IN Multi-Criteria/NNP Decision/NN Making/VBG ./.
With/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN Monte/NNP Carlo/NNP experiments/NNS ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN various/JJ inconsistency/NN indices/NNS as/IN indicators/NNS of/IN the/DT final/JJ PV/NN estimation/NN quality/NN ./.
The/DT presented/VBN results/NNS allow/VBP a/DT deeper/JJR understanding/NN of/IN the/DT information/NN contained/VBN in/IN these/DT indices/NNS and/CC help/VB in/IN choosing/VBG a/DT proper/JJ one/NN in/IN a/DT given/VBN situation/NN ./.
They/PRP also/RB enable/VBP us/PRP to/TO develop/VB a/DT new/JJ inconsistency/NN characteristic/JJ and/CC ,/, based/VBN on/IN it/PRP ,/, to/TO propose/VB the/DT PCM/NN acceptance/NN approach/NN that/WDT is/VBZ supported/VBN by/IN the/DT lassical/JJ statistical/JJ methodology/NN ./.
