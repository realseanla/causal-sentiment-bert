This/DT paper/NN develops/VBZ the/DT idea/NN of/IN membership/NN function/NN assignment/NN for/IN OWL/NN (/-LRB- Web/NN Ontology/NNP Language/NNP )/-RRB- ontology/NN elements/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO subsequently/RB generate/VB fuzzy/JJ rules/NNS from/IN this/DT ontology/NN ./.
The/DT task/NN of/IN membership/NN function/NN assignment/NN for/IN OWL/NN ontology/NN elements/NNS had/VBD already/RB been/VBN partially/RB described/VBN ,/, but/CC this/DT concerned/VBN the/DT case/NN ,/, when/WRB several/JJ OWL/NN ontologies/NNS of/IN the/DT same/JJ domain/NN were/VBD available/JJ ,/, and/CC they/PRP were/VBD merged/VBN into/IN a/DT single/JJ ontology/NN ./.
The/DT purpose/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO present/VB the/DT way/NN of/IN membership/NN function/NN assignment/NN for/IN OWL/NN ontology/NN elements/NNS in/IN the/DT case/NN ,/, when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ the/DT only/RB one/CD available/JJ ontology/NN ./.
Fuzzy/JJ rules/NNS ,/, generated/VBN from/IN the/DT OWL/NN ontology/NN ,/, are/VBP necessary/JJ for/IN supplement/NN of/IN the/DT SWES/NNP (/-LRB- Semantic/JJ Web/NN Expert/NNP System/NNP )/-RRB- knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
SWES/NNP is/VBZ an/DT expert/NN system/NN ,/, which/WDT will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO extract/VB knowledge/NN from/IN OWL/NN ontologies/NNS ,/, found/VBN in/IN the/DT Web/NN ,/, and/CC will/MD serve/VB as/IN a/DT universal/JJ expert/NN for/IN the/DT user/NN ./.
