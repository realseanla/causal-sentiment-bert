This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ how/WRB a/DT recursive/JJ neural/JJ network/NN model/NN can/MD automatically/RB leave/VB out/RP useless/JJ information/NN and/CC emphasize/VBP important/JJ evidence/NN ,/, in/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, to/TO perform/VB "/`` weight/NN tuning/NN "/'' for/IN higher/JJR -/HYPH level/NN representation/NN acquisition/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP two/CD models/NNS ,/, Weighted/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- WNN/NN )/-RRB- and/CC Binary/JJ -/HYPH Expectation/NN Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- BENN/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT automatically/RB control/VBP how/WRB much/JJ one/CD specific/JJ unit/NN contributes/VBZ to/IN the/DT higher/JJR -/HYPH level/NN representation/NN ./.
