Human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN interaction/NN can/MD be/VB divided/VBN into/IN two/CD categories/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT physical/JJ distance/NN between/IN the/DT human/JJ and/CC robot/NN :/: remote/JJ and/CC proximal/JJ ./.
In/IN proximal/JJ interaction/NN ,/, the/DT human/JJ and/CC robot/NN often/RB engage/VBP in/IN close/JJ coordination/NN ;/: in/IN remote/JJ interaction/NN ,/, the/DT human/JJ and/CC robot/NN are/VBP less/RBR coupled/VBN due/IN to/IN communication/NN constraints/NNS ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, providing/VBG automation/NN for/IN the/DT robot/NN in/IN remote/JJ interaction/NN becomes/VBZ more/RBR important/JJ ./.
Thus/RB far/RB ,/, human/JJ factor/NN studies/NNS on/IN automation/NN in/IN remote/JJ human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN interaction/NN have/VBP been/VBN restricted/VBN to/IN various/JJ forms/NNS of/IN supervision/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT robot/NN is/VBZ essentially/RB being/VBG used/VBN as/IN a/DT smart/JJ mobile/JJ manipulation/NN platform/NN with/IN sensing/VBG capabilities/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT incorporation/NN of/IN general/JJ planning/NN capability/NN into/IN the/DT robot/NN to/TO facilitate/VB peer/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH peer/NN human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN teaming/VBG ,/, in/IN which/WDT the/DT human/JJ and/CC robot/NN are/VBP viewed/VBN as/IN teammates/NNS that/WDT are/VBP physically/RB separated/VBN ./.
The/DT human/JJ and/CC robot/NN share/VBP the/DT same/JJ global/JJ goal/NN and/CC collaborate/VB to/TO achieve/VB it/PRP ./.
Note/VB that/IN humans/NNS may/MD feel/VB uncomfortable/JJ at/IN such/JJ robot/NN autonomy/NN ,/, which/WDT can/MD potentially/RB reduce/VB teaming/VBG performance/NN ./.
One/CD important/JJ difference/NN between/IN peer/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH peer/NN teaming/VBG and/CC supervised/VBD teaming/VBG is/VBZ that/IN an/DT autonomous/JJ robot/NN in/IN peer/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH peer/NN teaming/VBG can/MD achieve/VB the/DT goal/NN alone/RB when/WRB the/DT task/NN information/NN is/VBZ completely/RB specified/VBN ./.
However/RB ,/, incompleteness/NN often/RB exists/VBZ ,/, which/WDT implies/VBZ information/NN asymmetry/NN ./.
While/IN information/NN asymmetry/NN can/MD be/VB desirable/JJ sometimes/RB ,/, it/PRP may/MD also/RB lead/VB to/IN the/DT robot/NN choosing/VBG improper/JJ actions/NNS that/WDT negatively/RB influence/VBP the/DT teaming/VBG performance/NN ./.
We/PRP aim/VBP to/TO investigate/VB the/DT various/JJ trade/NN -/HYPH offs/NNS ,/, e.g./FW ,/, mental/JJ workload/NN and/CC situation/NN awareness/NN ,/, between/IN these/DT two/CD types/NNS of/IN remote/JJ human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN teaming/VBG ./.
