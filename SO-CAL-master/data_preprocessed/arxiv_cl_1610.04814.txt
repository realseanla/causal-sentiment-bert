In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT simple/JJ text/NN categorization/NN method/NN using/VBG term/NN -/HYPH class/NN relevance/NN measures/NNS is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
Initially/RB ,/, text/NN documents/NNS are/VBP processed/VBN to/TO extract/VB significant/JJ terms/NNS present/JJ in/IN them/PRP ./.
For/IN every/DT term/NN extracted/VBN from/IN a/DT document/NN ,/, we/PRP compute/VBP its/PRP$ importance/NN in/IN preserving/VBG the/DT content/NN of/IN a/DT class/NN through/IN a/DT novel/JJ term/NN -/HYPH weighting/NN scheme/NN known/VBN as/IN Term_Class/NN Relevance/NN (/-LRB- TCR/NN )/-RRB- measure/NN proposed/VBN by/IN Guru/NNP and/CC Suhil/NNP (/-LRB- 2015/CD )/-RRB- [/-LRB- 1/CD ]/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, for/IN every/DT term/NN ,/, its/PRP$ relevance/NN for/IN all/PDT the/DT classes/NNS present/VBP in/IN the/DT corpus/NN is/VBZ computed/VBN and/CC stored/VBN in/IN the/DT knowledgebase/NN ./.
During/IN testing/NN ,/, the/DT terms/NNS present/VBP in/IN the/DT test/NN document/NN are/VBP extracted/VBN and/CC the/DT term/NN -/HYPH class/NN relevance/NN of/IN each/DT term/NN is/VBZ obtained/VBN from/IN the/DT stored/VBN knowledgebase/NN ./.
To/TO achieve/VB quick/JJ search/NN of/IN term/NN weights/NNS ,/, Btree/NNP indexing/NN data/NNS structure/NN has/VBZ been/VBN adapted/VBN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT class/NN which/WDT receives/VBZ maximum/JJ support/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN term/NN -/HYPH class/NN relevance/NN is/VBZ decided/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT class/NN of/IN the/DT given/VBN test/NN document/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN works/VBZ in/IN logarithmic/JJ complexity/NN in/IN testing/NN time/NN and/CC simple/JJ to/TO implement/VB when/WRB compared/VBN to/IN any/DT other/JJ text/NN categorization/NN techniques/NNS available/JJ in/IN literature/NN ./.
