This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN merging/VBG uncertain/JJ information/NN in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN possibilistic/JJ logic/NN ./.
It/PRP presents/VBZ several/JJ syntactic/JJ combination/NN rules/NNS to/TO merge/VB possibilistic/JJ knowledge/NN bases/NNS ,/, provided/VBN by/IN different/JJ sources/NNS ,/, into/IN a/DT new/JJ possibilistic/JJ knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
These/DT combination/NN rules/NNS are/VBP first/JJ described/VBN at/IN the/DT meta/NN -/HYPH level/NN outside/IN the/DT language/NN of/IN possibilistic/JJ logic/NN ./.
Next/RB ,/, an/DT extension/NN of/IN possibilistic/JJ logic/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT combination/NN rules/NNS are/VBP inside/IN the/DT language/NN ,/, is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
A/DT proof/NN system/NN in/IN a/DT sequent/NN form/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ sound/JJ and/CC complete/JJ with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT possibilistic/JJ logic/NN semantics/NNS ,/, is/VBZ given/VBN ./.
