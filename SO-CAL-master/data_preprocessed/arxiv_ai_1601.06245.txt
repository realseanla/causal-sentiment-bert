A/DT Persuasive/NNP Teachable/NNP Agent/NNP (/-LRB- PTA/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT special/JJ type/NN of/IN Teachable/NNP Agent/NNP which/WDT incorporates/VBZ a/DT persuasion/NN theory/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO provide/VB persuasive/JJ and/CC more/RBR personalized/JJ feedback/NN to/IN the/DT student/NN ./.
By/IN employing/VBG the/DT persuasion/NN techniques/NNS ,/, the/DT PTA/NN seeks/VBZ to/TO maintain/VB the/DT student/NN in/IN a/DT high/JJ motivation/NN and/CC high/JJ ability/NN state/NN in/IN which/WDT he/PRP or/CC she/PRP has/VBZ higher/JJR cognitive/JJ ability/NN and/CC his/PRP$ or/CC her/PRP$ changes/NNS in/IN attitudes/NNS are/VBP more/RBR persistent/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT existing/VBG model/NN of/IN the/DT PTA/NN still/RB has/VBZ a/DT few/JJ limitations/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT existing/VBG PTA/NN model/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN modelling/VBG the/DT PTA/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO persuade/VB ,/, while/IN does/VBZ not/RB model/VB its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO be/VB taught/VBN by/IN the/DT student/NN and/CC to/TO practice/VB the/DT knowledge/NN it/PRP has/VBZ learnt/VBN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT quantitative/JJ model/NN for/IN computational/JJ processes/NNS in/IN the/DT PTA/NN has/VBZ low/JJ reusability/NN ./.
Thirdly/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ still/RB a/DT gap/NN between/IN theoretical/JJ models/NNS and/CC practical/JJ implementation/NN of/IN the/DT PTA/NN ./.
