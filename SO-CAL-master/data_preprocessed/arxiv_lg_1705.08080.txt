A/DT crucial/JJ capability/NN of/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN intelligent/JJ agents/NNS is/VBZ their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO plan/VB a/DT sequence/NN of/IN actions/NNS to/TO achieve/VB their/PRP$ goals/NNS in/IN the/DT visual/JJ world/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN visual/JJ semantic/JJ planning/NN :/: the/DT task/NN of/IN predicting/VBG a/DT sequence/NN of/IN actions/NNS from/IN visual/JJ observations/NNS that/WDT transform/VBP a/DT dynamic/JJ environment/NN from/IN an/DT initial/JJ state/NN to/IN a/DT goal/NN state/NN ./.
Doing/VBG so/RB entails/VBZ knowledge/NN about/IN objects/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ affordances/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN actions/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ preconditions/NNS and/CC effects/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP learning/VBG these/DT through/IN interacting/VBG with/IN a/DT visual/JJ and/CC dynamic/JJ environment/NN ./.
