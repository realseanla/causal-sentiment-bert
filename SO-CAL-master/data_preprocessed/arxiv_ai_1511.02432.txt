To/TO improve/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT fuzzy/JJ identification/NN ,/, a/DT structure/NN identification/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN moving/VBG rate/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN for/IN T/NN -/HYPH S/NN fuzzy/JJ model/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ called/VBN "/`` T/NN -/HYPH S/NN modeling/NN (/-LRB- or/CC T/NN -/HYPH S/NN fuzzy/JJ identification/NN method/NN )/-RRB- based/VBN on/IN moving/VBG rate/NN "/'' ./.
First/RB ,/, to/TO improve/VB the/DT shortcomings/NNS of/IN existing/VBG fuzzy/JJ reasoning/NN methods/NNS based/VBN on/IN matching/VBG degree/NN ,/, the/DT moving/VBG rates/NNS for/IN s/NN -/HYPH type/NN ,/, z/NN -/HYPH type/NN and/CC trapezoidal/JJ membership/NN functions/NNS of/IN T/NN -/HYPH S/NN fuzzy/JJ model/NN were/VBD defined/VBN ./.
Then/RB ,/, the/DT differences/NNS between/IN proposed/VBN moving/VBG rate/NN and/CC existing/VBG matching/VBG degree/NN were/VBD explained/VBN ./.
Next/RB ,/, the/DT identification/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN moving/VBG rate/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN for/IN T/NN -/HYPH S/NN model/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN identification/NN method/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/IN the/DT fuzzy/JJ modeling/NN for/IN the/DT precipitation/NN forecast/NN and/CC security/NN situation/NN prediction/NN ./.
Test/NN results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN significantly/RB improves/VBZ the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ identification/NN ./.
