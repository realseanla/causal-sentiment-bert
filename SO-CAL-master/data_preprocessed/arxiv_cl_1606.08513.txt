This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ dataset/NN to/IN benchmark/NN selection/NN -/HYPH based/VBN question/NN answering/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ dataset/NN contains/VBZ contexts/NNS drawn/VBN from/IN the/DT ten/CD most/RBS prevalent/JJ topics/NNS in/IN the/DT English/NNP Wikipedia/NNP ./.
For/IN the/DT generation/NN of/IN a/DT large/JJ ,/, diverse/JJ ,/, and/CC challenging/JJ dataset/NN ,/, a/DT new/JJ annotation/NN scheme/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
Our/PRP$ annotation/NN scheme/NN involves/VBZ a/DT series/NN of/IN crowdsourcing/VBG tasks/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB easily/RB followed/VBN by/IN any/DT researcher/NN ./.
Several/JJ systems/NNS are/VBP compared/VBN on/IN the/DT tasks/NNS of/IN answer/NN sentence/NN selection/NN and/CC answer/NN triggering/VBG ,/, providing/VBG strong/JJ baseline/NN results/NNS for/IN future/JJ work/NN to/TO improve/VB upon/IN ./.
We/PRP hope/VBP that/IN providing/VBG a/DT large/JJ corpus/NN will/MD enable/VB researchers/NNS to/TO work/VB towards/IN more/JJR effective/JJ open/JJ -/HYPH domain/NN question/NN answering/VBG ./.
