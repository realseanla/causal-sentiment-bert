In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ framework/NN to/TO train/VB an/DT Echo/NNP State/NNP Network/NNP to/TO predict/VB real/JJ valued/VBN time/NN -/HYPH series/NN ./.
The/DT method/NN consists/VBZ in/IN projecting/VBG the/DT output/NN of/IN the/DT internal/JJ layer/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN on/IN a/DT space/NN with/IN lower/JJR dimensionality/NN ,/, before/IN training/VBG the/DT output/NN layer/NN to/TO learn/VB the/DT target/NN task/NN ./.
Notably/RB ,/, we/PRP enforce/VBP a/DT regularization/NN constraint/NN that/WDT leads/VBZ to/IN better/JJR generalization/NN capabilities/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT performances/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN on/IN several/JJ benchmark/NN tests/NNS ,/, using/VBG different/JJ techniques/NNS to/TO train/VB the/DT readout/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ,/, achieving/VBG superior/JJ predictive/JJ performance/NN when/WRB using/VBG the/DT proposed/VBN framework/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP an/DT insight/NN on/IN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT implemented/VBN mechanics/NNS through/IN a/DT visualization/NN of/IN the/DT trajectory/NN in/IN the/DT phase/NN space/NN and/CC relying/VBG on/IN the/DT methodologies/NNS of/IN nonlinear/JJ time/NN -/HYPH series/NN analysis/NN ./.
By/IN applying/VBG our/PRP$ method/NN on/RB well/RB known/JJ chaotic/JJ systems/NNS ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP evidence/NN that/IN the/DT lower/JJR dimensional/JJ embedding/NN retains/VBZ the/DT dynamical/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT underlying/VBG system/NN better/JJR than/IN the/DT full/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ internal/JJ states/NNS of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
