The/DT Internet/NN of/IN Things/NNS is/VBZ arriving/VBG to/IN our/PRP$ homes/NNS or/CC cities/NNS through/IN fields/NNS already/RB known/VBN like/IN Smart/NNP Homes/NNPS ,/, Smart/NNP Cities/NNPS ,/, or/CC Smart/NNP Towns/NNP ./.
The/DT monitoring/NN of/IN environmental/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN cities/NNS can/MD help/VB to/TO adapt/VB the/DT indoor/JJ locations/NNS of/IN the/DT cities/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO be/VB more/RBR comfortable/JJ for/IN people/NNS who/WP stay/VBP there/RB ./.
A/DT way/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT indoor/JJ conditions/NNS is/VBZ an/DT efficient/JJ temperature/NN control/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, it/PRP depends/VBZ on/IN many/JJ factors/NNS like/IN the/DT different/JJ combinations/NNS of/IN outdoor/JJ temperature/NN and/CC humidity/NN ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, adjusting/VBG the/DT indoor/JJ temperature/NN is/VBZ not/RB setting/VBG a/DT value/NN according/VBG to/IN other/JJ value/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP many/JJ more/JJR factors/NNS to/TO take/VB into/IN consideration/NN ,/, hence/RB the/DT traditional/JJ logic/NN based/VBN in/IN binary/JJ states/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN ./.

Fuzzy/JJ logic/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO interpret/VB many/JJ states/NNS ,/, more/JJR than/IN two/CD states/NNS ,/, giving/VBG to/IN computers/NNS the/DT capacity/NN to/TO react/VB in/IN a/DT similar/JJ way/NN to/IN people/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP will/MD propose/VB a/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/TO control/VB the/DT temperature/NN using/VBG the/DT Internet/NN of/IN Things/NNS together/RB its/PRP$ platforms/NNS and/CC fuzzy/JJ logic/NN regarding/VBG not/RB only/RB the/DT indoor/JJ temperature/NN but/CC also/RB the/DT outdoor/JJ temperature/NN and/CC humidity/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO save/VB energy/NN and/CC to/TO set/VB a/DT more/RBR comfortable/JJ environment/NN for/IN their/PRP$ users/NNS ./.
