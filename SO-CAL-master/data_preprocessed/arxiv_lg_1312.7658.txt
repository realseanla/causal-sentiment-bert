Approachability/NN theory/NN ,/, introduced/VBN by/IN Blackwell/JJ (/-LRB- 1956/CD )/-RRB- ,/, provides/VBZ fundamental/JJ results/NNS on/IN repeated/VBN games/NNS with/IN vector/NN -/HYPH valued/VBN payoffs/NNS ,/, and/CC has/VBZ been/VBN usefully/RB applied/VBN since/IN in/IN the/DT theory/NN of/IN learning/NN in/IN games/NNS and/CC to/IN learning/VBG algorithms/NNS in/IN the/DT online/JJ adversarial/JJ setup/NN ./.
Given/VBN a/DT repeated/VBN game/NN with/IN vector/NN payoffs/NNS ,/, a/DT target/NN set/VBD $/$ S$/CD is/VBZ approachable/JJ by/IN a/DT certain/JJ player/NN (/-LRB- the/DT agent/NN )/-RRB- if/IN he/PRP can/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT average/JJ payoff/NN vector/NN converges/VBZ to/IN that/DT set/VBN no/RB matter/RB what/WP his/PRP$ adversary/NN opponent/NN does/VBZ ./.
Blackwell/JJ provided/VBN two/CD equivalent/JJ sets/NNS of/IN conditions/NNS for/IN a/DT convex/NN set/VBN to/TO be/VB approachable/JJ ./.
The/DT first/JJ (/-LRB- primary/JJ )/-RRB- condition/NN is/VBZ a/DT geometric/JJ separation/NN condition/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT second/JJ (/-LRB- dual/JJ )/-RRB- condition/NN requires/VBZ that/IN the/DT set/NN be/VB {/-LRB- \/SYM em/PRP non-excludable/JJ }/-RRB- ,/, namely/RB that/DT for/IN every/DT mixed/JJ action/NN of/IN the/DT opponent/NN there/RB exists/VBZ a/DT mixed/JJ action/NN of/IN the/DT agent/NN (/-LRB- a/DT {/-LRB- \/SYM em/PRP response/NN }/-RRB- )/-RRB- such/JJ that/IN the/DT resulting/VBG payoff/NN vector/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN $/$ S$/CD ./.
Existing/VBG approachability/NN algorithms/NNS rely/VBP on/IN the/DT primal/JJ condition/NN and/CC essentially/RB require/VBP to/IN compute/VB at/IN each/DT stage/NN a/DT projection/NN direction/NN from/IN a/DT given/VBN point/NN to/IN $/$ S$/CD ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP an/DT approachability/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT relies/VBZ on/IN Blackwell/NNP 's/POS {/-LRB- \/SYM em/PRP dual/JJ }/-RRB- condition/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, rather/RB than/IN projection/NN ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN relies/VBZ on/IN computation/NN of/IN the/DT response/NN to/IN a/DT certain/JJ action/NN of/IN the/DT opponent/NN at/IN each/DT stage/NN ./.
The/DT utility/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN is/VBZ demonstrated/VBN by/IN applying/VBG it/PRP to/IN certain/JJ generalizations/NNS of/IN the/DT classical/JJ regret/NN minimization/NN problem/NN ,/, which/WDT include/VBP regret/NN minimization/NN with/IN side/NN constraints/NNS and/CC regret/NN minimization/NN for/IN global/JJ cost/NN functions/NNS ./.
In/IN these/DT problems/NNS ,/, computation/NN of/IN the/DT required/VBN projections/NNS is/VBZ generally/RB complex/JJ but/CC a/DT response/NN is/VBZ readily/RB obtainable/JJ ./.
