Building/NN recommendation/NN algorithms/NNS is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS challenging/JJ tasks/NNS in/IN Machine/NN Learning/NN ./.
Although/IN there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN significant/JJ progress/NN in/IN building/VBG recommendation/NN systems/NNS when/WRB explicit/JJ feedback/NN is/VBZ available/JJ from/IN the/DT users/NNS in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN rating/NN or/CC text/NN ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT applications/NNS do/VBP not/RB receive/VB such/JJ feedback/NN ./.
Here/RB we/PRP consider/VBP the/DT recommendation/NN task/NN where/WRB the/DT available/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ the/DT record/NN of/IN the/DT items/NNS selected/VBN by/IN different/JJ users/NNS over/IN time/NN for/IN subscription/NN or/CC purchase/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ known/VBN as/IN implicit/JJ feedback/NN recommendation/NN ./.
Such/JJ data/NNS are/VBP usually/RB available/JJ as/IN large/JJ amount/NN of/IN user/NN logs/NNS stored/VBN over/IN massively/RB distributed/VBN storage/NN systems/NNS such/JJ as/IN Hadoop/NNP ./.
