Smoothed/VBN analysis/NN is/VBZ a/DT framework/NN for/IN analyzing/VBG the/DT complexity/NN of/IN an/DT algorithm/NN ,/, acting/VBG as/IN a/DT bridge/NN between/IN average/JJ and/CC worst/JJS -/HYPH case/NN behaviour/NN ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, Quicksort/NNP and/CC the/DT Simplex/NNP algorithm/NN are/VBP widely/RB used/VBN in/IN practical/JJ applications/NNS ,/, despite/IN their/PRP$ heavy/JJ worst/JJS -/HYPH case/NN complexity/NN ./.
Smoothed/VBN complexity/NN aims/VBZ to/TO better/RBR characterize/VB such/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
Existing/VBG theoretical/JJ bounds/NNS for/IN the/DT smoothed/VBN complexity/NN of/IN sorting/VBG algorithms/NNS are/VBP still/RB quite/RB weak/JJ ./.
