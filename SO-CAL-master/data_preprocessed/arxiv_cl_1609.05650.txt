In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ Vector/NNP Space/NNP Model/NNP (/-LRB- VSM/NNP )/-RRB- of/IN speech/NN utterances/NNS for/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN spoken/VBN dialect/NN identification/NN ./.
Generally/RB ,/, DID/VBD systems/NNS are/VBP built/VBN using/VBG two/CD sets/NNS of/IN features/NNS that/WDT are/VBP extracted/VBN from/IN speech/NN utterances/NNS ;/: acoustic/JJ and/CC phonetic/JJ ./.
The/DT acoustic/JJ and/CC phonetic/JJ features/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO form/VB vector/NN representations/NNS of/IN speech/NN utterances/NNS in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO encode/VB information/NN about/IN the/DT spoken/VBN dialects/NNS ./.
The/DT Phonotactic/JJ and/CC Acoustic/JJ VSMs/NNS ,/, thus/RB formed/VBN ,/, are/VBP used/VBN for/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN DID/VBN ./.
The/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO construct/VB a/DT single/JJ VSM/NN that/WDT encodes/VBZ information/NN about/IN spoken/VBN dialects/NNS from/IN both/CC the/DT Phonotactic/JJ and/CC Acoustic/JJ VSMs/NNS ./.
Given/VBN the/DT two/CD views/NNS of/IN the/DT data/NNS ,/, we/PRP make/VBP use/NN of/IN a/DT well/RB known/VBN multi-view/JJ dimensionality/NN reduction/NN technique/NN known/VBN as/IN Canonical/JJ Correlation/NN Analysis/NN (/-LRB- CCA/NN )/-RRB- ,/, to/TO form/VB a/DT single/JJ vector/NN representation/NN for/IN each/DT speech/NN utterance/NN that/WDT encodes/VBZ dialect/NN specific/JJ discriminative/JJ information/NN from/IN both/CC the/DT phonetic/JJ and/CC acoustic/JJ representations/NNS ./.
We/PRP refer/VBP to/IN this/DT approach/NN as/IN feature/NN space/NN combination/NN approach/NN and/CC show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ CCA/NN based/VBN feature/NN vector/NN representation/NN performs/VBZ better/JJR on/IN the/DT Arabic/NNP DID/VBD task/NN than/IN the/DT phonetic/JJ and/CC acoustic/JJ feature/NN representations/NNS used/VBN alone/RB ./.
We/PRP also/RB present/VBP the/DT feature/NN space/NN combination/NN approach/NN as/IN a/DT viable/JJ alternative/NN to/IN the/DT model/NN based/VBN combination/NN approach/NN ,/, where/WRB two/CD DID/VBD systems/NNS are/VBP built/VBN using/VBG the/DT two/CD VSMs/NNS (/-LRB- Phonotactic/JJ and/CC Acoustic/JJ )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT final/JJ prediction/NN score/NN is/VBZ the/DT output/NN score/NN combination/NN from/IN the/DT two/CD systems/NNS ./.
