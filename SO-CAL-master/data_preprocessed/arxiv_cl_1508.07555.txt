In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, an/DT event/NN network/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN for/IN exploring/VBG open/JJ information/NN ,/, where/WRB linguistic/JJ units/NNS about/IN an/DT event/NN are/VBP organized/VBN for/IN analysing/VBG ./.
The/DT process/NN is/VBZ divided/VBN into/IN three/CD steps/NNS :/: document/NN event/NN detection/NN ,/, event/NN network/NN construction/NN and/CC event/NN network/NN analysis/NN ./.
First/RB ,/, by/IN implementing/VBG event/NN detection/NN or/CC tracking/NN ,/, documents/NNS are/VBP retrospectively/RB (/-LRB- or/CC on/IN -/HYPH line/NN )/-RRB- organized/VBN into/IN document/NN events/NNS ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, for/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT document/NN event/NN ,/, linguistic/JJ units/NNS are/VBP extracted/VBN and/CC combined/VBN into/IN event/NN networks/NNS ./.
Thirdly/RB ,/, various/JJ analytic/JJ methods/NNS are/VBP proposed/VBN for/IN event/NN network/NN analysis/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ application/NN methodologies/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN for/IN exploring/VBG open/JJ information/NN ./.
