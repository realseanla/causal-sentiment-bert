Truncated/VBN Backpropagation/NNP Through/IN Time/NNP (/-LRB- truncated/VBN BPTT/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT widespread/JJ method/NN for/IN learning/VBG recurrent/JJ computational/JJ graphs/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, truncation/NN favors/VBZ short/JJ -/HYPH term/NN dependencies/NNS :/: the/DT gradient/NN estimate/NN of/IN truncated/VBN BPTT/NN is/VBZ biased/VBN ,/, so/IN that/IN it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB benefit/VB from/IN the/DT convergence/NN guarantees/NNS from/IN stochastic/JJ gradient/NN theory/NN ./.
