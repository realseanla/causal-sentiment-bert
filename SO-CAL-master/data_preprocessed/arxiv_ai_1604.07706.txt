We/PRP provide/VBP two/CD distributed/VBN confidence/NN ball/NN algorithms/NNS for/IN solving/VBG linear/JJ bandit/NN problems/NNS in/IN peer/NN to/IN peer/NN networks/NNS with/IN limited/JJ communication/NN capabilities/NNS ./.
For/IN the/DT first/JJ ,/, we/PRP assume/VBP that/IN all/PDT the/DT peers/NNS are/VBP solving/VBG the/DT same/JJ linear/JJ bandit/NN problem/NN ,/, and/CC prove/VB that/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN achieves/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ asymptotic/JJ regret/NN rate/NN of/IN any/DT centralised/JJ algorithm/NN that/WDT can/MD instantly/RB communicate/VB information/NN between/IN the/DT peers/NNS ./.
For/IN the/DT second/JJ ,/, we/PRP assume/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP clusters/NNS of/IN peers/NNS solving/VBG the/DT same/JJ bandit/NN problem/NN within/IN each/DT cluster/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN discovers/VBZ these/DT clusters/NNS ,/, while/IN achieving/VBG the/DT optimal/JJ asymptotic/JJ regret/NN rate/NN within/IN each/DT one/CD ./.
Through/IN experiments/NNS on/IN several/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN datasets/NNS ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN proposed/VBN algorithms/NNS compared/VBN to/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN ./.
