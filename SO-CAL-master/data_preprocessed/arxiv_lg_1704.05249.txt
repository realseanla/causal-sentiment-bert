To/TO manage/VB and/CC maintain/VB large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN cellular/JJ networks/NNS ,/, operators/NNS need/VBP to/TO know/VB which/WDT sectors/NNS underperform/VBP at/IN any/DT given/VBN time/NN ./.
For/IN this/DT purpose/NN ,/, they/PRP use/VBP the/DT so/RB -/HYPH called/VBN hot/JJ spot/NN score/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT combination/NN of/IN multiple/JJ network/NN measurements/NNS and/CC reflects/VBZ the/DT instantaneous/JJ overall/JJ performance/NN of/IN individual/JJ sectors/NNS ./.
While/IN operators/NNS have/VBP a/DT good/JJ understanding/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ performance/NN of/IN a/DT network/NN and/CC its/PRP$ overall/JJ trend/NN ,/, forecasting/VBG the/DT performance/NN of/IN each/DT sector/NN over/IN time/NN is/VBZ a/DT challenging/JJ task/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP is/VBZ affected/VBN by/IN both/DT regular/JJ and/CC non-regular/JJ events/NNS ,/, triggered/VBN by/IN human/JJ behavior/NN and/CC hardware/NN failures/NNS ./.
