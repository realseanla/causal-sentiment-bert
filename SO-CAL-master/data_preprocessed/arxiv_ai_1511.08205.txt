There/EX are/VBP many/JJ complex/JJ combinatorial/JJ problems/NNS which/WDT involve/VBP searching/VBG for/IN an/DT undirected/JJ graph/NN satisfying/VBG given/VBN constraints/NNS ./.
Such/JJ problems/NNS are/VBP often/RB highly/RB challenging/JJ because/IN of/IN the/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN isomorphic/JJ representations/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ solutions/NNS ./.

Enumerating/VBG with/IN these/DT symmetry/NN breaks/VBZ generates/VBZ all/DT and/CC only/RB non-isomorphic/JJ solutions/NNS ./.
For/IN small/JJ search/NN problems/NNS ,/, with/IN up/RB to/IN $/$ 10/CD $/$ vertices/NNS ,/, we/PRP compute/VBP instance/NN independent/JJ symmetry/NN breaking/VBG constraints/NNS ./.
For/IN small/JJ search/NN problems/NNS with/IN a/DT larger/JJR number/NN of/IN vertices/NNS we/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT computation/NN of/IN instance/NN dependent/JJ constraints/NNS which/WDT are/VBP complete/JJ ./.
