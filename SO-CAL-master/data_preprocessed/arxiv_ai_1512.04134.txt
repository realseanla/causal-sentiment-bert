Microsoft/NNP Kinect/NNP camera/NN and/CC its/PRP$ skeletal/JJ tracking/NN capabilities/NNS have/VBP been/VBN embraced/VBN by/IN many/JJ researchers/NNS and/CC commercial/JJ developers/NNS in/IN various/JJ applications/NNS of/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN human/JJ movement/NN analysis/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT human/JJ kinematic/JJ motion/NN data/NNS in/IN the/DT first/JJ and/CC second/JJ generation/NN of/IN the/DT Kinect/NNP system/NN ,/, and/CC compare/VB the/DT results/NNS with/IN an/DT optical/JJ motion/NN capture/NN system/NN ./.
We/PRP collected/VBD motion/NN data/NNS in/IN 12/CD exercises/NNS for/IN 10/CD different/JJ subjects/NNS and/CC from/IN three/CD different/JJ viewpoints/NNS ./.
We/PRP report/VBP on/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT joint/JJ localization/NN and/CC bone/NN length/NN estimation/NN of/IN Kinect/NNP skeletons/NNS in/IN comparison/NN to/IN the/DT motion/NN capture/NN ./.
