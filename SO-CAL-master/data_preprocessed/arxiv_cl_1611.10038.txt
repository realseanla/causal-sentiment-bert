A/DT patent/NN is/VBZ a/DT property/NN right/NN for/IN an/DT invention/NN granted/VBN by/IN the/DT government/NN to/IN the/DT inventor/NN ./.
An/DT invention/NN is/VBZ a/DT solution/NN to/IN a/DT specific/JJ technological/JJ problem/NN ./.
So/RB patents/NNS often/RB have/VBP a/DT high/JJ concentration/NN of/IN scientific/JJ and/CC technical/JJ terms/NNS that/WDT are/VBP rare/JJ in/IN everyday/JJ language/NN ./.
The/DT Chinese/JJ word/NN segmentation/NN model/NN trained/VBN on/IN currently/RB available/JJ everyday/JJ language/NN data/NNS sets/VBZ performs/VBZ poorly/RB because/IN it/PRP can/MD not/RB effectively/RB recognize/VB these/DT scientific/JJ and/CC technical/JJ terms/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP describe/VBP a/DT pragmatic/JJ approach/NN to/IN Chinese/JJ word/NN segmentation/NN on/IN patents/NNS where/WRB we/PRP train/VBP a/DT character/NN -/HYPH based/VBN semi-supervised/JJ sequence/NN labeling/NN model/NN by/IN extracting/VBG features/NNS from/IN a/DT manually/RB segmented/JJ corpus/NN of/IN 142/CD patents/NNS ,/, enhanced/VBN with/IN information/NN extracted/VBN from/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ TreeBank/NNP ./.
Experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN our/PRP$ model/NN reached/VBD 95.08/CD percent/NN (/-LRB- F1/NN score/NN )/-RRB- on/IN a/DT held/VBN -/HYPH out/RP test/NN set/NN and/CC 96.59/CD percent/NN on/IN development/NN set/NN ,/, compared/VBN with/IN an/DT F1/NN score/NN of/IN 91.48/CD percent/NN on/IN development/NN set/NN if/IN the/DT model/NN is/VBZ trained/VBN on/IN the/DT Chinese/JJ TreeBank/NNP ./.
We/PRP also/RB experimented/VBD with/IN some/DT existing/VBG domain/NN adaptation/NN techniques/NNS ,/, the/DT results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN target/NN domain/NN data/NNS and/CC the/DT selected/VBN features/NNS impact/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT domain/NN adaptation/NN techniques/NNS ./.
