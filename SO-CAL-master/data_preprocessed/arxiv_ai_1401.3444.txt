Making/VBG a/DT decision/NN is/VBZ often/RB a/DT matter/NN of/IN listing/VBG and/CC comparing/VBG positive/JJ and/CC negative/JJ arguments/NNS ./.
In/IN such/JJ cases/NNS ,/, the/DT evaluation/NN scale/NN for/IN decisions/NNS should/MD be/VB considered/VBN bipolar/JJ ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, negative/JJ and/CC positive/JJ values/NNS should/MD be/VB explicitly/RB distinguished/JJ ./.
