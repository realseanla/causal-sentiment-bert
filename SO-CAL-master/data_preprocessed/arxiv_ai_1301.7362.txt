The/DT monitoring/NN and/CC control/NN of/IN any/DT dynamic/JJ system/NN depends/VBZ crucially/RB on/IN the/DT ability/NN to/TO reason/VB about/IN its/PRP$ current/JJ status/NN and/CC its/PRP$ future/JJ trajectory/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN a/DT stochastic/JJ system/NN ,/, these/DT tasks/NNS typically/RB involve/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN a/DT belief/NN state/NN -/HYPH a/DT probability/NN distribution/NN over/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT process/NN at/IN a/DT given/VBN point/NN in/IN time/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT state/NN spaces/NNS of/IN complex/JJ processes/NNS are/VBP very/RB large/JJ ,/, making/VBG an/DT explicit/JJ representation/NN of/IN a/DT belief/NN state/NN intractable/JJ ./.
