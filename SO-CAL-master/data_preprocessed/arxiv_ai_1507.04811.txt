Real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN bidding/NN (/-LRB- RTB/NN )/-RRB- has/VBZ become/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT largest/JJS online/JJ advertising/NN markets/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
Today/NN the/DT bid/NN price/NN per/IN ad/NN impression/NN is/VBZ typically/RB decided/VBN by/IN the/DT expected/VBN value/NN of/IN how/WRB it/PRP can/MD lead/VB to/IN a/DT desired/VBN action/NN event/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, registering/VBG an/DT account/NN or/CC placing/VBG a/DT purchase/NN order/NN )/-RRB- to/IN the/DT advertiser/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT industry/NN standard/JJ approach/NN to/TO decide/VB the/DT bid/NN price/NN does/VBZ not/RB consider/VB the/DT actual/JJ effect/NN of/IN the/DT ad/NN shown/VBN to/IN the/DT user/NN ,/, which/WDT should/MD be/VB measured/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT performance/NN lift/NN among/IN users/NNS who/WP have/VBP been/VBN or/CC have/VBP not/RB been/VBN exposed/VBN to/IN a/DT certain/JJ treatment/NN of/IN ads/NNS ./.

We/PRP also/RB discuss/VBP the/DT relationship/NN between/IN attribution/NN models/NNS and/CC bidding/NN strategies/NNS ./.
