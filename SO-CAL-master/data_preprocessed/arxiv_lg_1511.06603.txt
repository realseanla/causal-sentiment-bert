Particle/NN Filter/NN algorithm/NN (/-LRB- PF/NN )/-RRB- suffers/VBZ from/IN some/DT problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN the/DT loss/NN of/IN particle/NN diversity/NN ,/, the/DT need/NN for/IN large/JJ number/NN of/IN particles/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT costly/JJ selection/NN of/IN the/DT importance/NN density/NN functions/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT novel/JJ Exponential/JJ Natural/JJ Particle/NN Filter/NN (/-LRB- xNPF/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ introduced/VBN to/TO solve/VB the/DT above/JJ problems/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT approach/NN ,/, a/DT state/NN transitional/JJ probability/NN with/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN natural/JJ gradient/NN learning/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN which/WDT balances/NNS exploration/NN and/CC exploitation/NN more/RBR robustly/RB ./.
The/DT results/NNS show/VBP that/IN xNPF/NN converges/VBZ much/RB closer/JJR to/IN the/DT true/JJ target/NN states/NNS than/IN the/DT other/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN particle/NN filter/NN ./.
