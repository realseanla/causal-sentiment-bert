Attribute/VB reduction/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ topics/NNS in/IN rough/JJ set/NN theory/NN ./.
Heuristic/JJ attribute/NN reduction/NN algorithms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN to/TO solve/VB the/DT attribute/NN reduction/NN problem/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ generally/RB known/VBN that/IN fitness/NN functions/NNS play/VBP a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN developing/VBG heuristic/NN attribute/NN reduction/NN algorithms/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ partly/RB due/JJ to/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN there/EX are/VBP no/DT monotonic/JJ fitness/NN functions/VBZ that/DT are/VBP used/VBN to/TO design/VB heuristic/NN attribute/NN reduction/NN algorithms/NNS in/IN probabilistic/JJ rough/JJ set/NN model/NN ./.
