In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP whether/IN "/`` big/JJ -/HYPH data/NN "/'' is/VBZ more/RBR valuable/JJ than/IN "/`` precise/JJ "/'' data/NNS for/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN energy/NN disaggregation/NN :/: the/DT process/NN of/IN breaking/VBG down/RP aggregate/NN energy/NN usage/NN on/IN a/DT per/IN -/HYPH appliance/NN basis/NN ./.
Existing/VBG techniques/NNS for/IN disaggregation/NN rely/VBP on/IN energy/NN metering/NN at/IN a/DT resolution/NN of/IN 1/CD minute/NN or/CC higher/JJR ,/, but/CC most/JJS power/NN meters/NNS today/NN only/RB provide/VBP a/DT reading/NN once/IN per/IN month/NN ,/, and/CC at/IN most/RBS once/RB every/DT 15/CD minutes/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ technique/NN called/VBN Neighbourhood/NNP NILM/NN that/WDT leverages/VBZ data/NNS from/IN '/`` neighbouring/VBG '/'' homes/NNS to/TO disaggregate/VB energy/NN given/VBN only/RB a/DT single/JJ energy/NN reading/NN per/IN month/NN ./.
The/DT key/JJ intuition/NN behind/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ that/IN '/`` similar/JJ '/'' homes/NNS have/VBP '/`` similar/JJ '/'' energy/NN consumption/NN on/IN a/DT per/IN -/HYPH appliance/NN basis/NN ./.
Neighbourhood/NNP NILM/NNP matches/VBZ every/DT home/NN with/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN '/`` neighbours/NNS '/'' that/WDT have/VBP direct/JJ submetering/NN infrastructure/NN ,/, i.e./FW power/NN meters/NNS on/IN individual/JJ circuits/NNS or/CC loads/NNS ./.
Many/JJ such/JJ homes/NNS already/RB exist/VBP ./.
Then/RB ,/, it/PRP estimates/VBZ the/DT appliance/NN -/HYPH level/NN energy/NN consumption/NN of/IN the/DT target/NN home/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT average/NN of/IN its/PRP$ K/NN neighbours/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP this/DT approach/NN using/VBG 25/CD homes/NNS and/CC results/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN gives/VBZ comparable/JJ or/CC better/JJR disaggregation/NN in/IN comparison/NN to/IN state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN accuracy/NN reported/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN that/WDT depend/VBP on/IN manual/JJ model/NN training/NN ,/, high/JJ frequency/NN power/NN metering/NN ,/, or/CC both/DT ./.
Results/NNS show/VBP that/IN Neighbourhood/NNP NILM/NNP can/MD achieve/VB 83/CD percent/NN and/CC 79/CD percent/NN accuracy/NN disaggregating/VBG fridge/NN and/CC heating/NN //HYPH cooling/NN loads/NNS ,/, compared/VBN to/IN 74/CD percent/NN and/CC 73/CD percent/NN for/IN a/DT technique/NN called/VBN FHMM/NNP ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP achieves/VBZ up/RP to/IN 64/CD percent/NN accuracy/NN on/IN washing/VBG machine/NN ,/, dryer/NN ,/, dishwasher/NN ,/, and/CC lighting/NN loads/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ higher/JJR than/IN previously/RB reported/VBN results/NNS ./.
Many/JJ existing/VBG techniques/NNS are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO disaggregate/VB these/DT loads/NNS at/IN all/DT ./.
These/DT results/NNS indicate/VBP a/DT potentially/RB substantial/JJ advantage/NN to/IN installing/VBG submetering/VBG infrastructure/NN in/IN a/DT select/JJ few/JJ homes/NNS rather/RB than/IN installing/VBG new/JJ high/JJ -/HYPH frequency/NN smart/JJ metering/NN infrastructure/NN in/IN all/DT homes/NNS ./.
