Authorship/NN attribution/NN is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN task/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN widely/RB studied/VBN ,/, often/RB by/IN considering/VBG small/JJ order/NN statistics/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP explore/VBP a/DT complex/JJ network/NN approach/NN to/TO assign/VB the/DT authorship/NN of/IN texts/NNS based/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ mesoscopic/JJ representation/NN ,/, in/IN an/DT attempt/NN to/TO capture/VB the/DT flow/NN of/IN the/DT narrative/NN ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, as/IN reported/VBN in/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, such/PDT an/DT approach/NN allowed/VBD the/DT identification/NN of/IN the/DT dominant/JJ narrative/NN structure/NN of/IN the/DT studied/VBN authors/NNS ./.
This/DT has/VBZ been/VBN achieved/VBN due/IN to/IN the/DT ability/NN of/IN the/DT mesoscopic/JJ approach/NN to/TO take/VB into/IN account/NN relationships/NNS between/IN different/JJ ,/, not/RB necessarily/RB adjacent/JJ ,/, parts/NNS of/IN the/DT text/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO capture/VB the/DT story/NN flow/NN ./.
The/DT potential/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN has/VBZ been/VBN illustrated/VBN through/IN principal/JJ component/NN analysis/NN ,/, a/DT comparison/NN with/IN the/DT chance/NN baseline/NN method/NN ,/, and/CC network/NN visualization/NN ./.
Such/JJ visualizations/NNS reveal/VBP individual/JJ characteristics/NNS of/IN the/DT authors/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB understood/VBN as/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN calligraphy/NN ./.
