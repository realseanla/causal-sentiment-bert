Enhancing/VBG the/DT robustness/NN and/CC accuracy/NN of/IN time/NN series/NN forecasting/NN models/NNS is/VBZ an/DT active/JJ area/NN of/IN research/NN ./.
Recently/RB ,/, Artificial/NNP Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- ANNs/NNS )/-RRB- have/VBP found/VBN extensive/JJ applications/NNS in/IN many/JJ practical/JJ forecasting/NN problems/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT standard/JJ backpropagation/NN ANN/NN training/NN algorithm/NN has/VBZ some/DT critical/JJ issues/NNS ,/, e.g./FW it/PRP has/VBZ a/DT slow/JJ convergence/NN rate/NN and/CC often/RB converges/VBZ to/IN a/DT local/JJ minimum/NN ,/, the/DT complex/JJ pattern/NN of/IN error/NN surfaces/NNS ,/, lack/NN of/IN proper/JJ training/NN parameters/NNS selection/NN methods/NNS ,/, etc/FW ./.
To/TO overcome/VB these/DT drawbacks/NNS ,/, various/JJ improved/JJ training/NN methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN developed/VBN in/IN literature/NN ;/: but/CC ,/, still/RB none/NN of/IN them/PRP can/MD be/VB guaranteed/VBN as/IN the/DT best/JJS for/IN all/DT problems/NNS ./.
