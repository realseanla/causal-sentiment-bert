In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP to/TO use/VB deep/JJ policy/NN networks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP trained/VBN with/IN an/DT advantage/NN actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN method/NN for/IN statistically/RB optimised/JJ dialogue/NN systems/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN ,/, on/IN summary/NN state/NN and/CC action/NN spaces/NNS ,/, deep/JJ Reinforcement/NN Learning/NN (/-LRB- RL/NN )/-RRB- outperforms/VBZ Gaussian/JJ Processes/NNS methods/NNS ./.
Summary/JJ state/NN and/CC action/NN spaces/NNS lead/VBP to/IN good/JJ performance/NN but/CC require/VBP pre-engineering/JJ effort/NN ,/, RL/NNP knowledge/NN ,/, and/CC domain/NN expertise/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO remove/VB the/DT need/NN to/TO define/VB such/JJ summary/NN spaces/NNS ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN deep/JJ RL/NN can/MD also/RB be/VB trained/VBN efficiently/RB on/IN the/DT original/JJ state/NN and/CC action/NN spaces/NNS ./.
Dialogue/NN systems/NNS based/VBN on/IN partially/RB observable/JJ Markov/NNP decision/NN processes/NNS are/VBP known/VBN to/TO require/VB many/JJ dialogues/NNS to/TO train/VB ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ them/PRP unappealing/JJ for/IN practical/JJ deployment/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN a/DT deep/JJ RL/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN an/DT actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN architecture/NN can/MD exploit/VB a/DT small/JJ amount/NN of/IN data/NNS very/RB efficiently/RB ./.
Indeed/RB ,/, with/IN only/RB a/DT few/JJ hundred/CD dialogues/NNS collected/VBN with/IN a/DT handcrafted/JJ policy/NN ,/, the/DT actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN deep/JJ learner/NN is/VBZ considerably/RB bootstrapped/VBN from/IN a/DT combination/NN of/IN supervised/JJ and/CC batch/NN RL/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, convergence/NN to/IN an/DT optimal/JJ policy/NN is/VBZ significantly/RB sped/VBN up/RP compared/VBN to/IN other/JJ deep/JJ RL/NN methods/NNS initialized/VBN on/IN the/DT data/NNS with/IN batch/NN RL/NN ./.
All/DT experiments/NNS are/VBP performed/VBN on/IN a/DT restaurant/NN domain/NN derived/VBN from/IN the/DT Dialogue/NN State/NN Tracking/NNP Challenge/NNP 2/CD (/-LRB- DSTC2/NN )/-RRB- dataset/NN ./.
