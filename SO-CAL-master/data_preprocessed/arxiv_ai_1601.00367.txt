The/DT BusPlus/NNP project/NN aims/VBZ at/IN improving/VBG the/DT off/NN -/HYPH peak/NN hours/NNS public/JJ transit/NN service/NN in/IN Canberra/NNP ,/, Australia/NNP ./.
To/TO address/VB the/DT difficulty/NN of/IN covering/VBG a/DT large/JJ geographic/JJ area/NN ,/, BusPlus/NNP proposes/VBZ a/DT hub/NN and/CC shuttle/NN model/NN consisting/VBG of/IN a/DT combination/NN of/IN a/DT few/JJ high/JJ -/HYPH frequency/NN bus/NN routes/NNS between/IN key/JJ hubs/NNS and/CC a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN shuttles/NNS that/WDT bring/VBP passengers/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ origin/NN to/IN the/DT closest/JJS hub/NN and/CC take/VB them/PRP from/IN their/PRP$ last/JJ bus/NN stop/VB to/IN their/PRP$ destination/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN the/DT design/NN of/IN bus/NN network/NN and/CC proposes/VBZ an/DT efficient/JJ solving/NN method/NN to/IN this/DT multimodal/JJ network/NN design/NN problem/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT Benders/NNPS decomposition/NN method/NN ./.
Starting/VBG from/IN a/DT MIP/NN formulation/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ,/, the/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT Benders/NNP decomposition/NN approach/NN using/VBG dedicated/JJ solution/NN techniques/NNS for/IN solving/VBG independent/JJ sub-problems/NNS ,/, Pareto/NN optimal/JJ cuts/NNS ,/, cut/VBD bundling/VBG ,/, and/CC core/NN point/NN update/NN ./.
Computational/JJ results/NNS on/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN data/NNS from/IN Canberra/NNP 's/POS public/JJ transit/NN system/NN justify/VB the/DT design/NN choices/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN the/DT approach/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT MIP/NN formulation/NN by/IN two/CD orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN ./.
