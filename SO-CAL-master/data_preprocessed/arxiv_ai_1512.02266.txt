Sensitivity/NN methods/NNS for/IN the/DT analysis/NN of/IN the/DT outputs/NNS of/IN discrete/JJ Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN extensively/RB studied/VBN and/CC implemented/VBN in/IN different/JJ software/NN packages/NNS ./.
These/DT methods/NNS usually/RB focus/VBP on/IN the/DT study/NN of/IN sensitivity/NN functions/NNS and/CC on/IN the/DT impact/NN of/IN a/DT parameter/NN change/NN to/IN the/DT Chan/NNP -/HYPH Darwiche/NNP distance/NN ./.
Although/IN not/RB fully/RB recognized/VBN ,/, the/DT majority/NN of/IN these/DT results/NNS heavily/RB rely/VBP on/IN the/DT multilinear/JJ structure/NN of/IN atomic/JJ probabilities/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT conditional/JJ probability/NN parameters/NNS associated/VBN with/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN network/NN ./.
By/IN defining/VBG a/DT statistical/JJ model/NN through/IN the/DT polynomial/JJ expression/NN of/IN its/PRP$ associated/JJ defining/VBG conditional/JJ probabilities/NNS ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT unifying/JJ approach/NN to/IN sensitivity/NN methods/NNS applicable/JJ to/IN a/DT large/JJ suite/NN of/IN models/NNS including/VBG extensions/NNS of/IN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ,/, for/IN instance/NN context/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ and/CC dynamic/JJ ones/NNS ,/, and/CC chain/NN event/NN graphs/NNS ./.
By/IN then/RB focusing/VBG on/IN models/NNS whose/WP$ defining/VBG polynomial/JJ is/VBZ multilinear/NN ,/, our/PRP$ algebraic/JJ approach/NN enables/VBZ us/PRP to/TO prove/VB that/IN the/DT Chan/NNP -/HYPH Darwiche/NNP distance/NN is/VBZ minimized/VBN for/IN a/DT certain/JJ class/NN of/IN multi-parameter/JJ contemporaneous/JJ variations/NNS when/WRB parameters/NNS are/VBP proportionally/RB covaried/VBN ./.
