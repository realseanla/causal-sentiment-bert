As/IN a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ problem/NN ,/, the/DT Three/CD -/HYPH Index/NN Assignment/NN Problem/NNP (/-LRB- AP3/NN )/-RRB- has/VBZ attracted/VBN lots/NNS of/IN research/NN efforts/NNS for/IN developing/VBG heuristics/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, existing/VBG heuristics/NNS either/CC obtain/VB less/RBR competitive/JJ solutions/NNS or/CC consume/VB too/RB much/JJ time/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT new/JJ heuristic/NN named/VBN Approximate/JJ Muscle/NN guided/VBN Beam/NNP Search/NNP (/-LRB- AMBS/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ developed/VBN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT good/JJ trade/NN -/HYPH off/NN between/IN solution/NN quality/NN and/CC running/NN time/NN ./.
By/IN combining/VBG the/DT approximate/JJ muscle/NN with/IN beam/NN search/NN ,/, the/DT solution/NN space/NN size/NN can/MD be/VB significantly/RB decreased/VBN ,/, thus/RB the/DT time/NN for/IN searching/VBG the/DT solution/NN can/MD be/VB sharply/RB reduced/VBN ./.
