The/DT success/NN of/IN any/DT machine/NN learning/NN system/NN depends/VBZ critically/RB on/IN effective/JJ representations/NNS of/IN data/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ desirable/JJ that/IN a/DT representation/NN scheme/NN uncovers/VBZ the/DT parts/NNS -/HYPH based/VBN ,/, additive/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
Of/IN current/JJ representation/NN learning/VBG schemes/NNS ,/, restricted/VBN Boltzmann/NNP machines/NNS (/-LRB- RBMs/NNS )/-RRB- have/VBP proved/VBN to/TO be/VB highly/RB effective/JJ in/IN unsupervised/JJ settings/NNS ./.

We/PRP enhance/VBP such/JJ capacity/NN of/IN RBMs/NNS by/IN introducing/VBG nonnegativity/NN into/IN the/DT model/NN weights/NNS ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN a/DT variant/NN called/VBN nonnegative/JJ restricted/JJ Boltzmann/JJ machine/NN (/-LRB- NRBM/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT NRBM/NNP produces/VBZ not/RB only/RB controllable/JJ decomposition/NN of/IN data/NNS into/IN interpretable/JJ parts/NNS but/CC also/RB offers/VBZ a/DT way/NN to/TO estimate/VB the/DT intrinsic/JJ nonlinear/JJ dimensionality/NN of/IN data/NNS ,/, and/CC helps/VBZ to/TO stabilize/VB linear/JJ predictive/JJ models/NNS ./.

The/DT decomposition/NN quality/NN on/IN images/NNS is/VBZ comparable/JJ with/IN or/CC better/JJR than/IN what/WP produced/VBN by/IN the/DT nonnegative/JJ matrix/NN factorization/NN (/-LRB- NMF/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC the/DT thematic/JJ features/NNS uncovered/VBN from/IN text/NN are/VBP qualitatively/RB interpretable/JJ in/IN a/DT similar/JJ manner/NN to/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT latent/JJ Dirichlet/NNP allocation/NN (/-LRB- LDA/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT stability/NN performance/NN of/IN feature/NN selection/NN on/IN medical/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN RBM/NNP and/CC competitive/JJ with/IN NMF/NN ./.
