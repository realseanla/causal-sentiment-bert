We/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT generation/NN of/IN new/JJ concepts/NNS from/IN combinations/NNS of/IN properties/NNS as/IN an/DT artificial/JJ language/NN develops/VBZ ./.
To/TO do/VB so/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP developed/VBN a/DT new/JJ framework/NN for/IN conjunctive/JJ concept/NN combination/NN ./.
This/DT framework/NN gives/VBZ a/DT semantic/JJ grounding/NN to/IN the/DT weighted/JJ sum/NN approach/NN to/IN concept/NN combination/NN seen/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
We/PRP implement/VBP the/DT framework/NN in/IN a/DT multi-agent/JJ simulation/NN of/IN language/NN evolution/NN and/CC show/VBP that/IN shared/VBN combination/NN weights/NNS emerge/VBP ./.
The/DT expected/VBN value/NN and/CC the/DT variance/NN of/IN these/DT weights/NNS across/IN agents/NNS may/MD be/VB predicted/VBN from/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN elements/NNS in/IN the/DT conceptual/JJ space/NN ,/, as/IN determined/VBN by/IN the/DT underlying/JJ environment/NN ,/, together/RB with/IN the/DT rate/NN at/IN which/WDT agents/NNS adopt/VBP others/NNS '/POS concepts/NNS ./.
When/WRB this/DT rate/NN is/VBZ smaller/JJR ,/, the/DT agents/NNS are/VBP able/JJ to/TO converge/VB to/IN weights/NNS with/IN lower/JJR variance/NN ./.
