Rough/JJ set/NN theory/NN ,/, a/DT mathematical/JJ tool/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN vague/JJ concepts/NNS ,/, has/VBZ originally/RB described/VBN the/DT indiscernibility/NN of/IN elements/NNS by/IN equivalence/NN relations/NNS ./.
Covering/NNP rough/JJ sets/NNS are/VBP a/DT natural/JJ extension/NN of/IN classical/JJ rough/JJ sets/NNS by/IN relaxing/VBG the/DT partitions/NNS arising/VBG from/IN equivalence/NN relations/NNS to/IN covers/NNS ./.
Recently/RB ,/, some/DT topological/JJ concepts/NNS such/JJ as/IN neighborhood/NN have/VBP been/VBN applied/VBN to/IN covering/VBG rough/JJ sets/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP further/RB investigate/VB the/DT covering/VBG rough/JJ sets/NNS based/VBN on/IN neighborhoods/NNS by/IN approximation/NN operations/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT upper/JJ approximation/NN based/VBN on/IN neighborhoods/NNS can/MD be/VB defined/VBN equivalently/RB without/IN using/VBG neighborhoods/NNS ./.
To/TO analyze/VB the/DT covers/NNS themselves/PRP ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP unary/JJ and/CC composition/NN operations/NNS on/IN covers/NNS ./.
A/DT notion/NN of/IN homomorphism/NN is/VBZ provided/VBN to/TO relate/VB two/CD covering/VBG approximation/NN spaces/NNS ./.
