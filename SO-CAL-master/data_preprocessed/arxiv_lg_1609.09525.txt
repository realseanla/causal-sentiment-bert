This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT structurally/RB -/HYPH constrained/VBN sparse/JJ decomposition/NN of/IN multi-dimensional/JJ signals/NNS onto/IN overcomplete/JJ families/NNS of/IN vectors/NNS ,/, called/VBN dictionaries/NNS ./.
The/DT contribution/NN of/IN the/DT paper/NN is/VBZ threefold/RB ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, a/DT generic/JJ spatio/JJ -/HYPH temporal/JJ regularization/NN term/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN and/CC used/VBN together/RB with/IN the/DT standard/JJ $/$ \/CD ell_1/CD $/$ regularization/CD term/NN to/TO enforce/VB a/DT sparse/JJ decomposition/NN preserving/VBG the/DT spatio/JJ -/HYPH temporal/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT signal/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, an/DT optimization/NN algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT split/NN Bregman/NNP approach/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN to/TO handle/VB the/DT associated/VBN optimization/NN problem/NN ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ convergence/NN is/VBZ analyzed/VBN ./.
Our/PRP$ well/NN -/HYPH founded/VBN approach/NN yields/NNS same/JJ accuracy/NN as/IN the/DT other/JJ algorithms/NNS at/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN ,/, with/IN significant/JJ gains/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN convergence/NN speed/NN ./.
Thirdly/RB ,/, the/DT empirical/JJ validation/NN of/IN the/DT approach/NN on/IN artificial/JJ and/CC real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN problems/NNS demonstrates/VBZ the/DT generality/NN and/CC effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT method/NN ./.
On/IN artificial/JJ problems/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN regularization/NN subsumes/VBZ the/DT Total/JJ Variation/NN minimization/NN and/CC recovers/VBZ the/DT expected/VBN decomposition/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN problem/NN of/IN electro/NN -/HYPH encephalography/NN brainwave/NN decomposition/NN ,/, the/DT approach/NN outperforms/VBZ similar/JJ approaches/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN P300/NN evoked/VBN potentials/NNS detection/NN ,/, using/VBG structured/JJ spatial/JJ priors/NNS to/TO guide/VB the/DT decomposition/NN ./.
