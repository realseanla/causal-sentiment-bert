Hyperplane/NN hashing/VBG aims/NNS at/IN rapidly/RB searching/VBG nearest/JJS points/NNS to/IN a/DT hyperplane/NN ,/, and/CC has/VBZ shown/VBN practical/JJ impact/NN in/IN scaling/VBG up/RP active/JJ learning/NN with/IN SVMs/NNS ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT existing/VBG randomized/JJ methods/NNS need/VBP long/JJ hash/NN codes/NNS to/TO achieve/VB reasonable/JJ search/NN accuracy/NN and/CC thus/RB suffer/VB from/IN reduced/VBN search/NN speed/NN and/CC large/JJ memory/NN overhead/NN ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, this/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ hyperplane/NN hashing/VBG technique/NN which/WDT yields/VBZ compact/JJ hash/NN codes/NNS ./.
The/DT key/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ the/DT bilinear/NN form/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN hash/NN functions/NNS ,/, which/WDT leads/VBZ to/IN higher/JJR collision/NN probability/NN than/IN the/DT existing/VBG hyperplane/NN hash/NN functions/VBZ when/WRB using/VBG random/JJ projections/NNS ./.
To/TO further/RB increase/VB the/DT performance/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT learning/NN based/VBN framework/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT bilinear/NN functions/NNS are/VBP directly/RB learned/VBN from/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
This/DT results/VBZ in/IN short/JJ yet/CC discriminative/JJ codes/NNS ,/, and/CC also/RB boosts/VBZ the/DT search/NN performance/NN over/IN the/DT random/JJ projection/NN based/VBN solutions/NNS ./.
Large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN active/JJ learning/NN experiments/NNS carried/VBD out/RP on/IN two/CD datasets/NNS with/IN up/RB to/IN one/CD million/CD samples/NNS demonstrate/VBP the/DT overall/JJ superiority/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN ./.
