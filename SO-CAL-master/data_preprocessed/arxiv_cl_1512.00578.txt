By/IN automatically/RB recognize/VB argument/NN component/NN ,/, essay/NN writers/NNS can/MD do/VB some/DT inspections/NNS to/IN texts/NNS that/IN they/PRP have/VBP written/VBN ./.
It/PRP will/MD assist/VB essay/NN scoring/NN process/NN objectively/RB and/CC precisely/RB because/IN essay/NN grader/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO see/VB how/WRB well/RB the/DT argument/NN components/NNS are/VBP constructed/VBN ./.
