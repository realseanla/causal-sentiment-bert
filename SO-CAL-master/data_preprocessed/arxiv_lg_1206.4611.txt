This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ the/DT multi-task/VB learning/NN problem/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT setting/NN where/WRB some/DT relevant/JJ features/NNS could/MD be/VB shared/VBN across/IN few/JJ related/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT existing/VBG methods/NNS assume/VBP the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT given/VBN tasks/NNS are/VBP related/VBN or/CC share/VB a/DT common/JJ feature/NN space/NN to/TO be/VB known/VBN apriori/FW ./.
In/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN applications/NNS however/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ desirable/JJ to/TO automatically/RB discover/VB the/DT groups/NNS of/IN related/JJ tasks/NNS that/WDT share/VBP a/DT feature/NN space/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP aim/VBP at/IN searching/VBG the/DT exponentially/RB large/JJ space/NN of/IN all/DT possible/JJ groups/NNS of/IN tasks/NNS that/WDT may/MD share/VB a/DT feature/NN space/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ contribution/NN is/VBZ a/DT convex/NN formulation/NN that/WDT employs/VBZ a/DT graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN regularizer/NN and/CC simultaneously/RB discovers/VBZ few/JJ groups/NNS of/IN related/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, having/VBG close/JJ -/HYPH by/IN task/NN parameters/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT feature/NN space/NN shared/VBD within/IN each/DT group/NN ./.
The/DT regularizer/NN encodes/VBZ an/DT important/JJ structure/NN among/IN the/DT groups/NNS of/IN tasks/NNS leading/VBG to/IN an/DT efficient/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN solving/VBG it/PRP :/: if/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT feature/NN space/NN under/IN which/WDT a/DT group/NN of/IN tasks/NNS has/VBZ close/RB -/HYPH by/IN task/NN parameters/NNS ,/, then/RB there/RB does/VBZ not/RB exist/VB such/PDT a/DT feature/NN space/NN for/IN any/DT of/IN its/PRP$ supersets/NNS ./.
An/DT efficient/JJ active/JJ set/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT exploits/VBZ this/DT simplification/NN and/CC performs/VBZ a/DT clever/JJ search/NN in/IN the/DT exponentially/RB large/JJ space/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ guaranteed/VBN to/TO solve/VB the/DT proposed/VBN formulation/NN (/-LRB- within/IN some/DT precision/NN )/-RRB- in/IN a/DT time/NN polynomial/JJ in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN groups/NNS of/IN related/JJ tasks/NNS discovered/VBN ./.
