Using/VBG the/DT recently/RB introduced/VBN universal/JJ computing/NN model/NN ,/, called/VBN orchestrated/VBN machine/NN ,/, that/IN represents/VBZ computations/NNS in/IN a/DT dissipative/JJ environment/NN ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP a/DT new/JJ kind/NN of/IN interpretation/NN of/IN Turing/NNP 's/POS Imitation/NNP Game/NNP ./.
In/IN addition/NN we/PRP raise/VBP the/DT question/NN whether/IN the/DT intelligence/NN may/MD show/VB fractal/JJ properties/NNS ./.
Then/RB we/PRP sketch/VBP a/DT vision/NN of/IN what/WP robotic/JJ cars/NNS are/VBP going/VBG to/TO do/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
Finally/RB we/PRP give/VBP the/DT specification/NN of/IN an/DT artificial/JJ life/NN game/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN orchestrated/VBN machines/NNS ./.
The/DT purpose/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO start/VB the/DT search/NN for/IN possible/JJ relationships/NNS between/IN these/DT different/JJ topics/NNS ./.
