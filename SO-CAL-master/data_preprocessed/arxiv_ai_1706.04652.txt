We/PRP want/VBP to/TO build/VB robots/NNS that/WDT are/VBP useful/JJ in/IN unstructured/JJ real/JJ world/NN applications/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN doing/VBG work/NN in/IN the/DT household/NN ./.
Grasping/NN in/IN particular/JJ is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ skill/NN in/IN this/DT domain/NN ,/, yet/CC it/PRP remains/VBZ a/DT challenge/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT key/JJ hurdles/NNS is/VBZ handling/VBG unexpected/JJ changes/NNS or/CC motion/NN in/IN the/DT objects/NNS being/VBG grasped/VBN and/CC kinematic/JJ noise/NN or/CC other/JJ errors/NNS in/IN the/DT robot/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ an/DT approach/NN to/IN learning/VBG a/DT closed/JJ -/HYPH loop/NN controller/NN for/IN robotic/JJ grasping/VBG that/DT dynamically/RB guides/VBZ the/DT gripper/NN to/IN the/DT object/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP a/DT wrist/NN -/HYPH mounted/VBN sensor/NN to/TO acquire/VB depth/NN images/NNS in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT gripper/NN and/CC train/VB a/DT convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN that/WDT directly/RB learns/VBZ the/DT value/NN function/NN for/IN grasp/NN pose/VBP candidates/NNS ./.
