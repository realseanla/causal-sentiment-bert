As/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT complete/JJ software/NN stack/NN for/IN autonomous/JJ driving/NN ,/, NVIDIA/NNP has/VBZ created/VBN a/DT neural/JJ -/HYPH network/NN -/HYPH based/VBN system/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN PilotNet/NNP ,/, which/WDT outputs/NNS steering/NN angles/NNS given/VBN images/NNS of/IN the/DT road/NN ahead/RB ./.
PilotNet/NNP is/VBZ trained/VBN using/VBG road/NN images/NNS paired/VBN with/IN the/DT steering/NN angles/NNS generated/VBN by/IN a/DT human/JJ driving/NN a/DT data/NN -/HYPH collection/NN car/NN ./.
It/PRP derives/VBZ the/DT necessary/JJ domain/NN knowledge/NN by/IN observing/VBG human/JJ drivers/NNS ./.
