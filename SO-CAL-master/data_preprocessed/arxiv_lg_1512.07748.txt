This/DT paper/NN discusses/VBZ real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN alignment/NN of/IN audio/JJ signals/NNS of/IN music/NN performance/NN to/IN the/DT corresponding/VBG score/NN (/-LRB- a.k.a./RB score/NN following/VBG )/-RRB- which/WDT can/MD handle/VB tempo/NN changes/NNS ,/, errors/NNS and/CC arbitrary/JJ repeats/NNS and/CC //HYPH or/CC skips/VBZ (/-LRB- repeats/NNS //, skips/VBZ )/-RRB- in/IN performances/NNS ./.
This/DT type/NN of/IN score/NN following/VBG is/VBZ particularly/RB useful/JJ in/IN automatic/JJ accompaniment/NN for/IN practices/NNS and/CC rehearsals/NNS ,/, where/WRB errors/NNS and/CC repeats/NNS //, skips/VBZ are/VBP often/RB made/VBN ./.
Simple/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN the/DT algorithms/NNS previously/RB proposed/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN are/VBP not/RB applicable/JJ in/IN these/DT situations/NNS for/IN scores/NNS of/IN practical/JJ length/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN large/JJ computational/JJ complexity/NN ./.
To/TO cope/VB with/IN this/DT problem/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP two/CD hidden/JJ Markov/NNP models/NNS of/IN monophonic/JJ performance/NN with/IN errors/NNS and/CC arbitrary/JJ repeats/NNS //, skips/VBZ ,/, and/CC derive/VBP efficient/JJ score/NN -/HYPH following/VBG algorithms/NNS with/IN an/DT assumption/NN that/IN the/DT prior/JJ probability/NN distributions/NNS of/IN score/NN positions/NNS before/RB and/CC after/IN repeats/NNS //, skips/VBZ are/VBP independent/JJ from/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
We/PRP confirmed/VBD real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN operation/NN of/IN the/DT algorithms/NNS with/IN music/NN scores/NNS of/IN practical/JJ length/NN (/-LRB- around/IN 10000/CD notes/NNS )/-RRB- on/IN a/DT modern/JJ laptop/NN and/CC their/PRP$ tracking/NN ability/NN to/TO the/DT input/NN performance/NN within/IN 0.7/CD s/NN on/IN average/JJ after/IN repeats/NNS //, skips/VBZ in/IN clarinet/NN performance/NN data/NNS ./.
Further/JJ improvements/NNS and/CC extension/NN for/IN polyphonic/JJ signals/NNS are/VBP also/RB discussed/VBN ./.
