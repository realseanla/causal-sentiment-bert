Assessing/VBG network/NN security/NN is/VBZ a/DT complex/JJ and/CC difficult/JJ task/NN ./.
Attack/NN graphs/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN as/IN a/DT tool/NN to/TO help/VB network/NN administrators/NNS understand/VBP the/DT potential/JJ weaknesses/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ network/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, a/DT problem/NN has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN addressed/VBN by/IN previous/JJ work/NN on/IN this/DT subject/NN ;/: namely/RB ,/, how/WRB to/TO actually/RB execute/VB and/CC validate/VB the/DT attack/NN paths/NNS resulting/VBG from/IN the/DT analysis/NN of/IN the/DT attack/NN graph/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT complete/JJ PDDL/NN representation/NN of/IN an/DT attack/NN model/NN ,/, and/CC an/DT implementation/NN that/WDT integrates/VBZ a/DT planner/NN into/IN a/DT penetration/NN testing/NN tool/NN ./.
