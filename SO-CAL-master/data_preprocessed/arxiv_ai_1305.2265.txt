Parameter/NN tuning/NN is/VBZ recognized/VBN today/NN as/IN a/DT crucial/JJ ingredient/NN when/WRB tackling/VBG an/DT optimization/NN problem/NN ./.
Several/JJ meta/NN -/HYPH optimization/NN methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJS parameter/NN set/NN for/IN a/DT given/VBN optimization/NN algorithm/NN and/CC (/-LRB- set/NN of/IN )/-RRB- problem/NN instances/NNS ./.
When/WRB the/DT objective/NN of/IN the/DT optimization/NN is/VBZ some/DT scalar/JJ quality/NN of/IN the/DT solution/NN given/VBN by/IN the/DT target/NN algorithm/NN ,/, this/DT quality/NN is/VBZ also/RB used/VBN as/IN the/DT basis/NN for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN parameter/NN sets/NNS ./.
But/CC in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN multi-objective/JJ optimization/NN by/IN aggregation/NN ,/, the/DT set/NN of/IN solutions/NNS is/VBZ given/VBN by/IN several/JJ single/JJ -/HYPH objective/JJ runs/NNS with/IN different/JJ weights/NNS on/IN the/DT objectives/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP turns/VBZ out/RP that/IN the/DT hypervolume/NN of/IN the/DT final/JJ population/NN of/IN each/DT single/JJ -/HYPH objective/JJ run/NN might/MD be/VB a/DT better/JJR indicator/NN of/IN the/DT global/JJ performance/NN of/IN the/DT aggregation/NN method/NN than/IN the/DT best/JJS fitness/NN in/IN its/PRP$ population/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN discusses/VBZ this/DT issue/NN on/IN a/DT case/NN study/NN in/IN multi-objective/JJ temporal/JJ planning/NN using/VBG the/DT evolutionary/JJ planner/NN DaE/NN -/HYPH YAHSP/NN and/CC the/DT meta/NN -/HYPH optimizer/NN ParamILS/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS clearly/RB show/VBP how/WRB ParamILS/NN makes/VBZ a/DT difference/NN between/IN both/DT approaches/NNS ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP that/IN indeed/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, using/VBG the/DT hypervolume/NN indicator/NN as/IN ParamILS/NN target/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS choice/NN ./.
