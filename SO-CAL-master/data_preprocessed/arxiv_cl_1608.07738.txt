In/IN Distributional/NNP Semantic/NNP Models/NNPS (/-LRB- DSMs/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, Vector/NNP Cosine/NNP is/VBZ widely/RB used/VBN to/TO estimate/VB similarity/NN between/IN word/NN vectors/NNS ,/, although/IN this/DT measure/NN was/VBD noticed/VBN to/TO suffer/VB from/IN several/JJ shortcomings/NNS ./.
