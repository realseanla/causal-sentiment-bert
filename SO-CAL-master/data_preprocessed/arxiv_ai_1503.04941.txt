A/DT system/NN with/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN usually/RB relies/VBZ on/IN symbol/NN manipulation/NN ,/, at/IN least/RBS partly/RB and/CC implicitly/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT interpretation/NN of/IN the/DT symbols/NNS -/: what/WP they/PRP represent/VBP and/CC what/WP they/PRP are/VBP about/RB -/, is/VBZ ultimately/RB left/VBN to/IN humans/NNS ,/, as/IN designers/NNS and/CC users/NNS of/IN the/DT system/NN ./.
How/WRB symbols/NNS can/MD acquire/VB meaning/VBG for/IN the/DT system/NN itself/PRP ,/, independent/JJ of/IN external/JJ interpretation/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT unsolved/JJ problem/NN ./.
Some/DT grounding/NN of/IN symbols/NNS can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN by/IN embodiment/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, by/IN causally/RB connecting/VBG symbols/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC sub-symbolic/JJ variables/NNS )/-RRB- to/IN the/DT physical/JJ environment/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN in/IN a/DT robot/NN with/IN sensors/NNS and/CC effectors/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, a/DT causal/JJ connection/NN as/IN such/JJ does/VBZ not/RB produce/VB representation/NN and/CC aboutness/NN of/IN the/DT kind/NN that/WDT symbols/NNS have/VBP for/IN humans/NNS ./.
Here/RB I/PRP present/VBP a/DT theory/NN that/IN explains/VBZ how/WRB humans/NNS and/CC other/JJ living/VBG organisms/NNS have/VBP acquired/VBN the/DT capability/NN to/TO have/VB symbols/NNS and/CC sub-symbolic/JJ variables/NNS that/WDT represent/VBP ,/, refer/VBP to/IN ,/, and/CC are/VBP about/IN something/NN else/RB ./.
The/DT theory/NN shows/VBZ how/WRB reference/NN can/MD be/VB to/IN physical/JJ objects/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB to/IN abstract/JJ objects/NNS ,/, and/CC even/RB how/WRB it/PRP can/MD be/VB misguided/JJ (/-LRB- errors/NNS in/IN reference/NN )/-RRB- or/CC be/VB about/RB non-existing/JJ objects/NNS ./.
I/PRP subsequently/RB abstract/JJ the/DT primary/JJ components/NNS of/IN the/DT theory/NN from/IN their/PRP$ biological/JJ context/NN ,/, and/CC discuss/VB how/WRB and/CC under/IN what/WDT conditions/NNS the/DT theory/NN could/MD be/VB implemented/VBN in/IN artificial/JJ agents/NNS ./.
A/DT major/JJ component/NN of/IN the/DT theory/NN is/VBZ the/DT strong/JJ nonlinearity/NN associated/VBN with/IN (/-LRB- potentially/RB unlimited/JJ )/-RRB- self/NN -/HYPH reproduction/NN ./.
The/DT latter/JJ is/VBZ likely/JJ not/RB acceptable/JJ in/IN artificial/JJ systems/NNS ./.
It/PRP remains/VBZ unclear/JJ if/IN goals/NNS other/JJ than/IN those/DT inherently/RB serving/VBG self/NN -/HYPH reproduction/NN can/MD have/VB aboutness/NN and/CC if/IN such/JJ goals/NNS could/MD be/VB stabilized/VBN ./.
