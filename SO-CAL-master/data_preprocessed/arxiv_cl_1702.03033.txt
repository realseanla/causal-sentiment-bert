In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP enhance/VBP the/DT traditional/JJ confusion/NN network/NN system/NN combination/NN approach/NN with/IN an/DT additional/JJ model/NN trained/VBN by/IN a/DT neural/JJ network/NN ./.
This/DT work/NN is/VBZ motivated/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT commonly/RB used/VBN binary/JJ system/NN voting/NN models/NNS only/RB assign/VBP each/DT input/NN system/NN a/DT global/JJ weight/NN which/WDT is/VBZ responsible/JJ for/IN the/DT global/JJ impact/NN of/IN each/DT input/NN system/NN on/IN all/DT translations/NNS ./.
This/DT prevents/VBZ individual/JJ systems/NNS with/IN low/JJ system/NN weights/NNS from/IN having/VBG influence/NN on/IN the/DT system/NN combination/NN output/NN ,/, although/IN in/IN some/DT situations/NNS this/DT could/MD be/VB helpful/JJ ./.
Further/RB ,/, words/NNS which/WDT have/VBP only/RB been/VBN seen/VBN by/IN one/CD or/CC few/JJ systems/NNS rarely/RB have/VBP a/DT chance/NN of/IN being/VBG present/JJ in/IN the/DT combined/JJ output/NN ./.
We/PRP train/VBP a/DT local/JJ system/NN voting/VBG model/NN by/IN a/DT neural/JJ network/NN which/WDT is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT words/NNS themselves/PRP and/CC the/DT combinatorial/JJ occurrences/NNS of/IN the/DT different/JJ system/NN outputs/NNS ./.
This/DT gives/VBZ system/NN combination/NN the/DT option/NN to/TO prefer/VB other/JJ systems/NNS at/IN different/JJ word/NN positions/NNS even/RB for/IN the/DT same/JJ sentence/NN ./.
