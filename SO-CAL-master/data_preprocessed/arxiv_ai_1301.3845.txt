This/DT paper/NN analyzes/VBZ independence/NN concepts/NNS for/IN sets/NNS of/IN probability/NN measures/NNS associated/VBN with/IN directed/VBN acyclic/JJ graphs/NNS ./.
The/DT paper/NN shows/VBZ that/IN epistemic/JJ independence/NN and/CC the/DT standard/JJ Markov/NNP condition/NN violate/VBP desirable/JJ separation/NN properties/NNS ./.
The/DT adoption/NN of/IN a/DT contraction/NN condition/NN leads/VBZ to/IN d/NN -/HYPH separation/NN but/CC still/RB fails/VBZ to/TO guarantee/VB a/DT belief/NN separation/NN property/NN ./.
To/TO overcome/VB this/DT unsatisfactory/JJ situation/NN ,/, a/DT strong/JJ Markov/NNP condition/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ,/, based/VBN on/IN epistemic/JJ independence/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ result/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT strong/JJ Markov/NNP condition/NN leads/VBZ to/IN strong/JJ independence/NN and/CC does/VBZ enforce/VB separation/NN properties/NNS ;/: this/DT result/NN implies/VBZ that/IN (/-LRB- 1/CD )/-RRB- separation/NN properties/NNS of/IN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS do/VBP extend/VB to/IN epistemic/JJ independence/NN and/CC sets/NNS of/IN probability/NN measures/NNS ,/, and/CC (/-LRB- 2/LS )/-RRB- strong/JJ independence/NN has/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ justification/NN based/VBN on/IN epistemic/JJ independence/NN and/CC the/DT strong/JJ Markov/NNP condition/NN ./.
