This/DT paper/NN concerns/VBZ the/DT probabilistic/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN actions/NNS in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN unmeasured/JJ variables/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT identification/NN of/IN causal/JJ effect/NN between/IN a/DT singleton/NN variable/JJ X/NN and/CC a/DT set/NN of/IN variables/NNS Y/NN can/MD be/VB accomplished/VBN systematically/RB ,/, in/IN time/NN polynomial/JJ in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN variables/NNS in/IN the/DT graph/NN ./.
When/WRB the/DT causal/JJ effect/NN is/VBZ identifiable/JJ ,/, a/DT closed/JJ -/HYPH form/NN expression/NN can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN for/IN the/DT probability/NN that/IN the/DT action/NN will/MD achieve/VB a/DT specified/VBN goal/NN ,/, or/CC a/DT set/NN of/IN goals/NNS ./.
