The/DT present/JJ study/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT method/NN for/IN improving/VBG the/DT classification/NN performance/NN of/IN imbalanced/JJ multiclass/NN data/NN streams/NNS from/IN wireless/JJ body/NN worn/VBN sensors/NNS ./.
Data/NNS imbalance/NN is/VBZ an/DT inherent/JJ problem/NN in/IN activity/NN recognition/NN caused/VBN by/IN the/DT irregular/JJ time/NN distribution/NN of/IN activities/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP sequential/JJ and/CC dependent/JJ on/IN previous/JJ movements/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP conditional/JJ random/JJ fields/NNS (/-LRB- CRF/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT graphical/JJ model/NN for/IN structured/JJ classification/NN ,/, to/TO take/VB advantage/NN of/IN dependencies/NNS between/IN activities/NNS in/IN a/DT sequence/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, CRFs/NNS do/VBP not/RB consider/VB the/DT negative/JJ effects/NNS of/IN class/NN imbalance/NN during/IN training/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT class-wise/JJ dynamically/RB weighted/JJ CRF/NNP (/-LRB- dWCRF/NN )/-RRB- where/WRB weights/NNS are/VBP automatically/RB determined/VBN during/IN training/NN by/IN maximizing/VBG the/DT expected/VBN overall/JJ F/NN -/HYPH score/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS based/VBN on/IN three/CD case/NN studies/NNS from/IN a/DT healthcare/NN application/NN using/VBG a/DT batteryless/JJ body/NN worn/JJ sensor/NN ,/, demonstrate/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN ,/, in/IN general/JJ ,/, improves/VBZ overall/JJ and/CC minority/NN class/NN F/NN -/HYPH score/NN when/WRB compared/VBN to/IN other/JJ CRF/NNP based/VBN classifiers/NNS and/CC achieves/VBZ similar/JJ or/CC better/JJR overall/JJ and/CC class-wise/JJ performance/NN when/WRB compared/VBN to/IN SVM/NNP based/VBN classifiers/NNS under/IN conditions/NNS of/IN limited/JJ training/NN data/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB confirm/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN using/VBG an/DT additional/JJ battery/NN powered/VBN body/NN worn/JJ sensor/NN dataset/NN ,/, achieving/VBG similar/JJ results/NNS in/IN cases/NNS of/IN high/JJ class/NN imbalance/NN ./.
