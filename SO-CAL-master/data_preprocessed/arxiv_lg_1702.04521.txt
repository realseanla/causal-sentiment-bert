Neural/JJ language/NN models/NNS predict/VBP the/DT next/JJ token/NN using/VBG a/DT latent/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT immediate/JJ token/JJ history/NN ./.
Recently/RB ,/, various/JJ methods/NNS for/IN augmenting/VBG neural/JJ language/NN models/NNS with/IN an/DT attention/NN mechanism/NN over/IN a/DT differentiable/JJ memory/NN have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN ./.
For/IN predicting/VBG the/DT next/JJ token/NN ,/, these/DT models/NNS query/VBP information/NN from/IN a/DT memory/NN of/IN the/DT recent/JJ history/NN which/WDT can/MD facilitate/VB learning/VBG mid/JJ -/HYPH and/CC long/JJ -/HYPH range/NN dependencies/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, conventional/JJ attention/NN mechanisms/NNS used/VBN in/IN memory/NN -/HYPH augmented/VBN neural/JJ language/NN models/NNS produce/VBP a/DT single/JJ output/NN vector/NN per/IN time/NN step/NN ./.
This/DT vector/NN is/VBZ used/VBN both/DT for/IN predicting/VBG the/DT next/JJ token/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN for/IN the/DT key/NN and/CC value/NN of/IN a/DT differentiable/JJ memory/NN of/IN a/DT token/JJ history/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT neural/JJ language/NN model/NN with/IN a/DT key/JJ -/HYPH value/NN attention/NN mechanism/NN that/WDT outputs/NNS separate/VBP representations/NNS for/IN the/DT key/NN and/CC value/NN of/IN a/DT differentiable/JJ memory/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN for/IN encoding/VBG the/DT next/JJ -/HYPH word/NN distribution/NN ./.
This/DT model/NN outperforms/VBZ existing/VBG memory/NN -/HYPH augmented/VBN neural/JJ language/NN models/NNS on/IN two/CD corpora/NNS ./.
Yet/RB ,/, we/PRP found/VBD that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN mainly/RB utilizes/VBZ a/DT memory/NN of/IN the/DT five/CD most/RBS recent/JJ output/NN representations/NNS ./.
This/DT led/VBD to/IN the/DT unexpected/JJ main/JJ finding/NN that/IN a/DT much/JJ simpler/JJR model/NN based/VBN only/RB on/IN the/DT concatenation/NN of/IN recent/JJ output/NN representations/NNS from/IN previous/JJ time/NN steps/NNS is/VBZ on/IN par/NN with/IN more/JJR sophisticated/JJ memory/NN -/HYPH augmented/VBN neural/JJ language/NN models/NNS ./.
