In/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN ,/, representation/NN learning/NN has/VBZ emerged/VBN as/IN a/DT newly/RB active/JJ research/NN subject/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ excellent/JJ performance/NN in/IN many/JJ applications/NNS ./.
Learning/VBG representations/NNS of/IN words/NNS is/VBZ a/DT pioneering/JJ study/NN in/IN this/DT school/NN of/IN research/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, paragraph/NN (/-LRB- or/CC sentence/NN and/CC document/NN )/-RRB- embedding/NN learning/NN is/VBZ more/RBR suitable/JJ //HYPH reasonable/JJ for/IN some/DT tasks/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN sentiment/NN classification/NN and/CC document/NN summarization/NN ./.
Nevertheless/RB ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP are/VBP aware/JJ ,/, there/EX is/VBZ relatively/RB less/JJR work/NN focusing/VBG on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN unsupervised/JJ paragraph/NN embedding/NN methods/NNS ./.
Classic/JJ paragraph/NN embedding/NN methods/NNS infer/VBP the/DT representation/NN of/IN a/DT given/VBN paragraph/NN by/IN considering/VBG all/DT of/IN the/DT words/NNS occurring/VBG in/IN the/DT paragraph/NN ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, those/DT stop/VB or/CC function/VB words/NNS that/WDT occur/VBP frequently/RB may/MD mislead/VB the/DT embedding/NN learning/NN process/NN to/TO produce/VB a/DT misty/JJ paragraph/NN representation/NN ./.
Motivated/VBN by/IN these/DT observations/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ major/JJ contributions/NNS in/IN this/DT paper/NN are/VBP twofold/JJ ./.
First/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ unsupervised/JJ paragraph/NN embedding/NN method/NN ,/, named/VBN the/DT essence/NN vector/NN (/-LRB- EV/NNP )/-RRB- model/NN ,/, which/WDT aims/VBZ at/IN not/RB only/RB distilling/VBG the/DT most/RBS representative/JJ information/NN from/IN a/DT paragraph/NN but/CC also/RB excluding/VBG the/DT general/JJ background/NN information/NN to/TO produce/VB a/DT more/RBR informative/JJ low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ vector/NN representation/NN for/IN the/DT paragraph/NN ./.
Second/RB ,/, in/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT increasing/VBG importance/NN of/IN spoken/VBN content/NN processing/NN ,/, an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT EV/NNP model/NN ,/, named/VBN the/DT denoising/NN essence/NN vector/NN (/-LRB- D/NNP -/HYPH EV/NNP )/-RRB- model/NN ,/, is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
The/DT D/NNP -/HYPH EV/NNP model/NN not/RB only/RB inherits/VBZ the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN the/DT EV/NNP model/NN but/CC also/RB can/MD infer/VB a/DT more/RBR robust/JJ representation/NN for/IN a/DT given/VBN spoken/VBN paragraph/NN against/IN imperfect/JJ speech/NN recognition/NN ./.
