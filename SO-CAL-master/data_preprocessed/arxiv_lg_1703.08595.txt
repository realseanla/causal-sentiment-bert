Large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- have/VBP been/VBN successfully/RB used/VBN in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN tasks/NNS from/IN image/NN recognition/NN to/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP trained/VBN using/VBG large/JJ training/NN sets/NNS on/IN large/JJ models/NNS ,/, making/VBG them/PRP computationally/RB and/CC memory/NN intensive/JJ ./.
