Markov/NNP Logic/NNP Networks/NNP (/-LRB- MLN/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Probabilistic/NNP Soft/NNP Logic/NNP (/-LRB- PSL/NNP )/-RRB- are/VBP widely/RB applied/VBN formalisms/NNS in/IN Statistical/JJ Relational/JJ Learning/NN ,/, an/DT emerging/VBG area/NN in/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ concerned/VBN with/IN combining/VBG logical/JJ and/CC statistical/JJ AI/NN ./.
Despite/IN their/PRP$ resemblance/NN ,/, the/DT relationship/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN formally/RB stated/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP describe/VBP the/DT precise/JJ semantic/JJ relationship/NN between/IN them/PRP from/IN a/DT logical/JJ perspective/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ facilitated/VBN by/IN first/JJ extending/VBG fuzzy/JJ logic/NN to/TO allow/VB weights/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB also/RB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT generalization/NN of/IN PSL/NNP ,/, and/CC then/RB relate/VB that/IN generalization/NN to/IN MLN/NNP ./.
We/PRP observe/VBP that/IN the/DT relationship/NN between/IN PSL/NNP and/CC MLN/NNP is/VBZ analogous/JJ to/IN the/DT known/JJ relationship/NN between/IN fuzzy/JJ logic/NN and/CC Boolean/JJ logic/NN ,/, and/CC furthermore/RB the/DT weight/NN scheme/NN of/IN PSL/NNP is/VBZ essentially/RB a/DT generalization/NN of/IN the/DT weight/NN scheme/NN of/IN MLN/NNP for/IN the/DT many/JJ -/HYPH valued/VBN setting/NN ./.
