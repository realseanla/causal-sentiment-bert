This/DT thesis/NN describes/VBZ the/DT design/NN and/CC implementation/NN of/IN a/DT smile/NN detector/NN based/VBN on/IN deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
It/PRP starts/VBZ with/IN a/DT summary/NN of/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, the/DT difficulties/NNS of/IN training/VBG them/PRP and/CC new/JJ training/NN methods/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN Restricted/JJ Boltzmann/NNP Machines/NNPS or/CC autoencoders/NNS ./.
