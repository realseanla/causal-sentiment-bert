Since/IN the/DT BOSS/NN competition/NN ,/, in/IN 2010/CD ,/, most/JJS steganalysis/NN approaches/NNS use/VBP a/DT learning/NN methodology/NN involving/VBG two/CD steps/NNS :/: feature/NN extraction/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT Rich/NNP Models/NNPS (/-LRB- RM/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, for/IN the/DT image/NN representation/NN ,/, and/CC use/NN of/IN the/DT Ensemble/NNP Classifier/NNP (/-LRB- EC/NNP )/-RRB- for/IN the/DT learning/NN step/NN ./.
In/IN 2015/CD ,/, Qian/NNP et/FW al./FW have/VBP shown/VBN that/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN a/DT deep/JJ learning/NN approach/NN that/WDT jointly/RB learns/VBZ and/CC computes/VBZ the/DT features/NNS ,/, is/VBZ very/RB promising/JJ for/IN the/DT steganalysis/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP follow/VBP -/HYPH up/RP the/DT study/NN of/IN Qian/NNP et/FW al./FW ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN ,/, due/IN to/IN intrinsic/JJ joint/JJ minimization/NN ,/, the/DT results/NNS obtained/VBN from/IN a/DT Convolutional/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- or/CC a/DT Fully/RB Connected/VBN Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- FNN/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, if/IN well/RB parameterized/JJ ,/, surpass/VB the/DT conventional/JJ use/NN of/IN a/DT RM/NN with/IN an/DT EC/NNP ./.
