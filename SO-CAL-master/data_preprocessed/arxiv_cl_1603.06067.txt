We/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ method/NN for/IN jointly/RB learning/VBG compositional/JJ and/CC non-compositional/JJ phrase/NN embeddings/NNS by/IN adaptively/RB weighting/NN both/DT types/NNS of/IN embeddings/NNS using/VBG a/DT compositionality/NN scoring/VBG function/NN ./.
The/DT scoring/NN function/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO quantify/VB the/DT level/NN of/IN compositionality/NN of/IN each/DT phrase/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT parameters/NNS of/IN the/DT function/NN are/VBP jointly/RB optimized/VBN with/IN the/DT objective/NN for/IN learning/VBG phrase/NN embeddings/NNS ./.
In/IN experiments/NNS ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP the/DT adaptive/JJ joint/NN learning/NN method/NN to/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN learning/VBG embeddings/NNS of/IN transitive/JJ verb/VB phrases/NNS ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN the/DT compositionality/NN scores/NNS have/VBP strong/JJ correlation/NN with/IN human/JJ ratings/NNS for/IN verb/VB -/HYPH object/NN compositionality/NN ,/, substantially/RB outperforming/VBG the/DT previous/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, our/PRP$ embeddings/NNS improve/VB upon/IN the/DT previous/JJ best/JJS model/NN on/IN a/DT transitive/JJ verb/VB disambiguation/NN task/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB show/VBP that/IN a/DT simple/JJ ensemble/NN technique/NN further/RB improves/VBZ the/DT results/NNS for/IN both/DT tasks/NNS ./.
