Robust/JJ Principal/NN Component/NN Analysis/NN (/-LRB- RPCA/NN )/-RRB- via/IN rank/NN minimization/NN is/VBZ a/DT powerful/JJ tool/NN for/IN recovering/VBG underlying/VBG low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN structure/NN of/IN clean/JJ data/NNS corrupted/VBN with/IN sparse/JJ noise/NN //HYPH outliers/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ low/JJ -/HYPH level/NN vision/NN problems/NNS ,/, not/RB only/RB it/PRP is/VBZ known/VBN that/IN the/DT underlying/JJ structure/NN of/IN clean/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT exact/JJ rank/NN of/IN clean/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ also/RB known/VBN ./.
Yet/RB ,/, when/WRB applying/VBG conventional/JJ rank/NN minimization/NN for/IN those/DT problems/NNS ,/, the/DT objective/JJ function/NN is/VBZ formulated/VBN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB fully/RB utilize/VB a/FW priori/FW target/NN rank/NN information/NN about/IN the/DT problems/NNS ./.
This/DT observation/NN motivates/VBZ us/PRP to/TO investigate/VB whether/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT better/JJR alternative/NN solution/NN when/WRB using/VBG rank/NN minimization/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, instead/RB of/IN minimizing/VBG the/DT nuclear/JJ norm/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP to/TO minimize/VB the/DT partial/JJ sum/NN of/IN singular/JJ values/NNS ,/, which/WDT implicitly/RB encourages/VBZ the/DT target/NN rank/NN constraint/NN in/IN rank/NN minimization/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ analyses/NNS show/VBP that/IN ,/, when/WRB the/DT number/NN of/IN samples/NNS is/VBZ deficient/JJ ,/, our/PRP$ approach/NN leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT higher/JJR success/NN rate/NN than/IN conventional/JJ rank/NN minimization/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT solutions/NNS obtained/VBN by/IN the/DT two/CD approaches/NNS are/VBP almost/RB identical/JJ when/WRB the/DT number/NN of/IN samples/NNS is/VBZ more/JJR than/IN sufficient/JJ ./.
We/PRP apply/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN to/IN various/JJ low/JJ -/HYPH level/NN vision/NN problems/NNS ,/, e.g./FW high/JJ dynamic/JJ range/NN imaging/NN ,/, motion/NN edge/NN detection/NN ,/, photometric/JJ stereo/NN ,/, image/NN alignment/NN and/CC recovery/NN ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ results/NNS outperform/VBP those/DT obtained/VBN by/IN the/DT conventional/JJ nuclear/JJ norm/NN rank/NN minimization/NN method/NN ./.
