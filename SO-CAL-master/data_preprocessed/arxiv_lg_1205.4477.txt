Discovering/VBG frequent/JJ episodes/NNS over/IN event/NN sequences/NNS is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ data/NNS mining/NN task/NN ./.
In/IN many/JJ applications/NNS ,/, events/NNS constituting/VBG the/DT data/NNS sequence/NN arrive/VBP as/IN a/DT stream/NN ,/, at/IN furious/JJ rates/NNS ,/, and/CC recent/JJ trends/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC frequent/JJ episodes/NNS )/-RRB- can/MD change/VB and/CC drift/VB due/IN to/IN the/DT dynamical/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT underlying/VBG event/NN generation/NN process/NN ./.
The/DT ability/NN to/TO detect/VB and/CC track/VB such/PDT the/DT changing/VBG sets/NNS of/IN frequent/JJ episodes/NNS can/MD be/VB valuable/JJ in/IN many/JJ application/NN scenarios/NNS ./.
Current/JJ methods/NNS for/IN frequent/JJ episode/NN discovery/NN are/VBP typically/RB multipass/JJ algorithms/NNS ,/, making/VBG them/PRP unsuitable/JJ in/IN the/DT streaming/NN context/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ streaming/NN algorithm/NN for/IN discovering/VBG frequent/JJ episodes/NNS over/IN a/DT window/NN of/IN recent/JJ events/NNS in/IN the/DT stream/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ algorithm/NN processes/NNS events/NNS as/IN they/PRP arrive/VBP ,/, one/CD batch/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN ,/, while/IN discovering/VBG the/DT top/JJ frequent/JJ episodes/NNS over/IN a/DT window/NN consisting/VBG of/IN several/JJ batches/NNS in/IN the/DT immediate/JJ past/NN ./.
We/PRP derive/VBP approximation/NN guarantees/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN under/IN the/DT condition/NN that/WDT frequent/JJ episodes/NNS are/VBP approximately/RB well/RB -/HYPH separated/VBN from/IN infrequent/JJ ones/NNS in/IN every/DT batch/NN of/IN the/DT window/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP extensive/JJ experimental/JJ evaluations/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN on/IN both/DT real/JJ and/CC synthetic/JJ data/NNS ./.
