Recent/JJ results/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN that/IN the/DT MCTS/NNP algorithm/NN (/-LRB- a/DT new/JJ ,/, adaptive/JJ ,/, randomized/JJ optimization/NN algorithm/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ effective/JJ in/IN a/DT remarkably/RB diverse/JJ set/NN of/IN applications/NNS in/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP ,/, Operations/NNP Research/NNP ,/, and/CC High/NNP Energy/NNP Physics/NNP ./.
MCTS/NNP can/MD find/VB good/JJ solutions/NNS without/IN domain/NN dependent/JJ heuristics/NNS ,/, using/VBG the/DT UCT/NNP formula/NN to/TO balance/VB exploitation/NN and/CC exploration/NN ./.
