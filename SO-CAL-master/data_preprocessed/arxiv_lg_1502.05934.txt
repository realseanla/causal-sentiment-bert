We/PRP study/VBP the/DT classic/JJ online/JJ learning/NN problem/NN of/IN predicting/VBG with/IN expert/NN advice/NN ,/, and/CC propose/VB a/DT truly/RB parameter/NN -/HYPH free/JJ and/CC adaptive/JJ algorithm/NN that/WDT achieves/VBZ several/JJ objectives/NNS simultaneously/RB without/IN using/VBG any/DT prior/JJ information/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ component/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ an/DT improved/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT NormalHedge.DT/NN algorithm/NN (/-LRB- Luo/NNP and/CC Schapire/NNP ,/, 2014/CD )/-RRB- ,/, called/VBN AdaNormalHedge/NNP ./.
On/IN one/CD hand/NN ,/, this/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN ensures/VBZ small/JJ regret/NN when/WRB the/DT competitor/NN has/VBZ small/JJ loss/NN and/CC almost/RB constant/JJ regret/NN when/WRB the/DT losses/NNS are/VBP stochastic/JJ ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO compete/VB with/IN any/DT convex/NN combination/NN of/IN the/DT experts/NNS simultaneously/RB ,/, with/IN a/DT regret/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT relative/JJ entropy/NN of/IN the/DT prior/JJ and/CC the/DT competitor/NN ./.
