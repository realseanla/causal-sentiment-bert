Consider/VB a/DT requester/NN who/WP wishes/VBZ to/IN crowdsource/NN a/DT series/NN of/IN identical/JJ binary/JJ labeling/NN tasks/NNS from/IN a/DT pool/NN of/IN workers/NNS so/IN as/IN to/TO achieve/VB an/DT assured/VBN accuracy/NN for/IN each/DT task/NN ,/, in/IN a/DT cost/NN optimal/JJ way/NN ./.
The/DT workers/NNS are/VBP heterogeneous/JJ with/IN unknown/JJ but/CC fixed/JJ qualities/NNS and/CC moreover/RB their/PRP$ costs/NNS are/VBP private/JJ ./.
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ to/TO select/VB an/DT optimal/JJ subset/NN of/IN the/DT workers/NNS to/TO work/VB on/IN each/DT task/NN so/IN that/IN the/DT outcome/NN obtained/VBN from/IN aggregating/VBG labels/NNS from/IN them/PRP guarantees/VBZ a/DT target/NN accuracy/NN ./.
This/DT problem/NN is/VBZ challenging/JJ because/IN the/DT requester/NN not/RB only/RB has/VBZ to/TO learn/VB the/DT qualities/NNS of/IN the/DT workers/NNS but/CC also/RB elicit/VBP their/PRP$ true/JJ costs/NNS ./.

We/PRP derive/VBP an/DT upper/JJ bound/VBN on/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN exploration/NN steps/NNS which/WDT depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT target/NN accuracy/NN and/CC true/JJ qualities/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ CCB/NN -/HYPH S/NN algorithm/NN produces/VBZ an/DT ex-post/NN monotone/JJ allocation/NN rule/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB transformed/VBN into/IN an/DT ex-post/NN incentive/NN compatible/JJ and/CC ex-post/JJ individually/RB rational/JJ mechanism/NN that/WDT learns/VBZ qualities/NNS of/IN the/DT workers/NNS and/CC guarantees/VBZ the/DT target/NN accuracy/NN in/IN a/DT cost/NN optimal/JJ way/NN ./.
