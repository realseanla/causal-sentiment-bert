This/DT document/NN presents/VBZ Annotated/JJ English/NNP ,/, a/DT system/NN of/IN diacritical/JJ symbols/NNS which/WDT turns/VBZ English/NNP pronunciation/NN into/IN a/DT precise/JJ and/CC unambiguous/JJ process/NN ./.
The/DT annotations/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN and/CC located/VBN in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT original/JJ English/NNP text/NN is/VBZ not/RB altered/VBN (/-LRB- not/RB even/RB a/DT letter/NN )/-RRB- ,/, thus/RB allowing/VBG for/IN a/DT consistent/JJ reading/NN and/CC learning/NN of/IN the/DT English/NNP language/NN with/IN and/CC without/IN annotations/NNS ./.
The/DT annotations/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN general/JJ rules/NNS that/WDT make/VBP the/DT frequency/NN of/IN annotations/NNS not/RB dramatically/RB high/JJ ./.
This/DT makes/VBZ the/DT reader/NN easily/RB associate/JJ annotations/NNS with/IN exceptions/NNS ,/, and/CC makes/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO shape/VB ,/, internalise/VB and/CC consolidate/VB some/DT rules/NNS for/IN the/DT English/NNP language/NN which/WDT otherwise/RB are/VBP weakened/VBN by/IN the/DT enormous/JJ amount/NN of/IN exceptions/NNS in/IN English/NNP pronunciation/NN ./.
The/DT advantages/NNS of/IN this/DT annotation/NN system/NN are/VBP manifold/JJ ./.
Any/DT existing/VBG text/NN can/MD be/VB annotated/VBN without/IN a/DT significant/JJ increase/NN in/IN size/NN ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN we/PRP can/MD get/VB an/DT annotated/JJ version/NN of/IN any/DT document/NN or/CC book/NN with/IN the/DT same/JJ number/NN of/IN pages/NNS and/CC fontsize/NN ./.
Since/IN no/DT letter/NN is/VBZ affected/VBN ,/, the/DT text/NN can/MD be/VB perfectly/RB read/VBN by/IN a/DT person/NN who/WP does/VBZ not/RB know/VB the/DT annotation/NN rules/NNS ,/, since/IN annotations/NNS can/MD be/VB simply/RB ignored/VBN ./.
The/DT annotations/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN rules/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB progressively/RB learned/VBN and/CC recognised/VBN ,/, even/RB in/IN cases/NNS where/WRB the/DT reader/NN has/VBZ no/DT access/NN or/CC time/NN to/TO read/VB the/DT rules/NNS ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN a/DT reader/NN can/MD understand/VB most/JJS of/IN the/DT annotations/NNS after/IN reading/VBG a/DT few/JJ pages/NNS of/IN Annotated/JJ English/NNP ,/, and/CC can/MD take/VB advantage/NN from/IN that/DT knowledge/NN for/IN any/DT other/JJ annotated/JJ document/NN she/PRP may/MD read/VB in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
