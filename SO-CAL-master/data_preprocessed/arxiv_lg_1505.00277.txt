We/PRP present/VBP an/DT approach/NN for/IN the/DT detection/NN of/IN coordinate/NN -/HYPH term/NN relationships/NNS between/IN entities/NNS from/IN the/DT software/NN domain/NN ,/, that/WDT refer/VBP to/IN Java/NNP classes/NNS ./.
Usually/RB ,/, relations/NNS are/VBP found/VBN by/IN examining/VBG corpus/NN statistics/NNS associated/VBN with/IN text/NN entities/NNS ./.
In/IN some/DT technical/JJ domains/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP access/NN to/IN additional/JJ information/NN about/IN the/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN objects/NNS named/VBN by/IN the/DT entities/NNS ,/, suggesting/VBG that/IN coupling/VBG information/NN about/IN the/DT "/`` grounded/VBN "/'' entities/NNS with/IN corpus/NN statistics/NNS might/MD lead/VB to/IN improved/VBN methods/NNS for/IN relation/NN discovery/NN ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT similarity/NN measure/NN for/IN Java/NNP classes/NNS using/VBG distributional/JJ information/NN about/IN how/WRB they/PRP are/VBP used/VBN in/IN software/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP combine/VBP with/IN corpus/NN statistics/NNS on/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN contexts/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT classes/NNS appear/VBP in/IN text/NN ./.
