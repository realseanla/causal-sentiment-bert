Risk/NN aggregation/NN is/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ method/NN used/VBN to/TO estimate/VB the/DT sum/NN of/IN a/DT collection/NN of/IN financial/JJ assets/NNS or/CC events/NNS ,/, where/WRB each/DT asset/NN or/CC event/NN is/VBZ modelled/VBN as/IN a/DT random/JJ variable/NN ./.
Applications/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT financial/JJ services/NNS industry/NN ,/, include/VBP insurance/NN ,/, operational/JJ risk/NN ,/, stress/NN testing/NN ,/, and/CC sensitivity/NN analysis/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ widely/RB encountered/VBN in/IN many/JJ other/JJ application/NN domains/NNS ./.
This/DT thesis/NN has/VBZ contributed/VBN two/CD algorithms/NNS to/TO perform/VB Bayesian/JJ risk/NN aggregation/NN when/WRB model/NN exhibit/NN hybrid/NN dependency/NN and/CC high/JJ dimensional/JJ inter-dependency/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ algorithm/NN operates/VBZ on/IN a/DT subset/NN of/IN the/DT general/JJ problem/NN ,/, with/IN an/DT emphasis/NN on/IN convolution/NN problems/NNS ,/, in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN continuous/JJ and/CC discrete/JJ variables/NNS (/-LRB- so/RB called/VBN hybrid/NN models/NNS )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT second/JJ algorithm/NN offer/VBP a/DT universal/JJ method/NN for/IN general/JJ purpose/NN inference/NN over/RB much/RB wider/JJR classes/NNS of/IN Bayesian/JJ Network/NN models/NNS ./.
