In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, the/DT Dempster/NNP -/HYPH Shafer/NNP method/NN is/VBZ employed/VBN as/IN the/DT theoretical/JJ basis/NN for/IN creating/VBG data/NNS classification/NN systems/NNS ./.
Testing/NN is/VBZ carried/VBN out/RP using/VBG three/CD popular/JJ (/-LRB- multiple/JJ attribute/NN )/-RRB- benchmark/NN datasets/NNS that/WDT have/VBP two/CD ,/, three/CD and/CC four/CD classes/NNS ./.
In/IN each/DT case/NN ,/, a/DT subset/NN of/IN the/DT available/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ used/VBN for/IN training/NN to/TO establish/VB thresholds/NNS ,/, limits/NNS or/CC likelihoods/NNS of/IN class/NN membership/NN for/IN each/DT attribute/NN ,/, and/CC hence/RB create/VB mass/JJ functions/NNS that/WDT establish/VBP probability/NN of/IN class/NN membership/NN for/IN each/DT attribute/NN of/IN the/DT test/NN data/NNS ./.
Classification/NN of/IN each/DT data/NNS item/NN is/VBZ achieved/VBN by/IN combination/NN of/IN these/DT probabilities/NNS via/IN Dempster/NNP 's/POS Rule/NN of/IN Combination/NN ./.
Results/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ two/CD datasets/NNS show/VBP extremely/RB high/JJ classification/NN accuracy/NN that/WDT is/VBZ competitive/JJ with/IN other/JJ popular/JJ methods/NNS ./.

In/IN all/DT cases/NNS the/DT Dempster/NNP -/HYPH Shafer/NNP method/NN provides/VBZ comparable/JJ performance/NN to/IN other/JJ more/JJR popular/JJ algorithms/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT overhead/NN of/IN generating/VBG accurate/JJ mass/NN functions/VBZ increases/VBZ the/DT complexity/NN with/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN new/JJ attributes/NNS ./.
