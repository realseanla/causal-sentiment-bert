While/IN cardiovascular/JJ diseases/NNS (/-LRB- CVDs/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP prevalent/JJ across/IN economic/JJ strata/NN ,/, the/DT economically/RB disadvantaged/JJ population/NN is/VBZ disproportionately/RB affected/VBN due/IN to/IN the/DT high/JJ cost/NN of/IN traditional/JJ CVD/NNS management/NN ./.
Accordingly/RB ,/, developing/VBG an/DT ultra-low-cost/JJ alternative/NN ,/, affordable/JJ even/RB to/IN groups/NNS at/IN the/DT bottom/NN of/IN the/DT economic/JJ pyramid/NN ,/, has/VBZ emerged/VBN as/IN a/DT societal/JJ imperative/NN ./.
Against/IN this/DT backdrop/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT inexpensive/JJ yet/CC accurate/JJ home/NN -/HYPH based/VBN electrocardiogram/NN (/-LRB- ECG/NN )/-RRB- monitoring/NN service/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP seek/VBP to/TO provide/VB point/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH care/NN monitoring/NN of/IN premature/JJ ventricular/JJ contractions/NNS (/-LRB- PVCs/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, high/JJ frequency/NN of/IN which/WDT could/MD indicate/VB the/DT onset/NN of/IN potentially/RB fatal/JJ arrhythmia/NN ./.
Note/VB that/IN a/DT traditional/JJ telecardiology/NN system/NN acquires/VBZ the/DT ECG/NN ,/, transmits/VBZ it/PRP to/IN a/DT professional/JJ diagnostic/JJ centre/NN without/IN processing/NN ,/, and/CC nearly/RB achieves/VBZ the/DT diagnostic/JJ accuracy/NN of/IN a/DT bedside/NN setup/NN ,/, albeit/IN at/IN high/JJ bandwidth/NN cost/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, we/PRP aim/VBP at/IN reducing/VBG cost/NN without/IN significantly/RB sacrificing/VBG reliability/NN ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT dictionary/NN -/HYPH based/VBN algorithm/NN that/WDT detects/VBZ with/IN high/JJ sensitivity/NN the/DT anomalous/JJ beats/NNS only/RB which/WDT are/VBP then/RB transmitted/VBN ./.
We/PRP further/RB compress/VB those/DT transmitted/VBN beats/NNS using/VBG class/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ dictionaries/NNS subject/JJ to/IN suitable/JJ reconstruction/NN //HYPH diagnostic/JJ fidelity/NN ./.
Such/PDT a/DT scheme/NN would/MD not/RB only/RB reduce/VB the/DT overall/JJ bandwidth/NN requirement/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB localising/VBG anomalous/JJ beats/NNS ,/, thereby/RB reducing/VBG physicians/NNS '/POS burden/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, using/VBG Monte/NNP Carlo/NNP cross/VB validation/NN on/IN MIT/NN //HYPH BIH/NN arrhythmia/NN database/NN ,/, we/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN system/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, with/IN a/DT sensitivity/NN target/NN of/IN at/IN most/RBS one/CD undetected/JJ PVC/NNP in/IN one/CD hundred/CD beats/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT percentage/NN root/NN mean/VB squared/JJ difference/NN less/JJR than/IN 9/CD percent/NN (/-LRB- a/DT clinically/RB acceptable/JJ level/NN of/IN fidelity/NN )/-RRB- ,/, we/PRP achieved/VBD about/IN 99.15/CD percent/NN reduction/NN in/IN bandwidth/NN cost/NN ,/, equivalent/JJ to/IN 118-fold/JJ savings/NNS over/IN traditional/JJ telecardiology/NN ./.
