Syllogism/NN is/VBZ a/DT type/NN of/IN deductive/JJ reasoning/NN involving/VBG quantified/VBN statements/NNS ./.
The/DT syllogistic/JJ reasoning/NN scheme/NN in/IN the/DT classical/JJ Aristotelian/JJ framework/NN involves/VBZ three/CD crisp/JJ term/NN sets/NNS and/CC four/CD linguistic/JJ quantifiers/NNS ,/, for/IN which/WDT the/DT main/JJ support/NN is/VBZ the/DT linguistic/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT quantifiers/NNS ./.
A/DT number/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ approaches/NNS for/IN defining/VBG an/DT approximate/JJ syllogism/NN have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN for/IN which/WDT the/DT main/JJ support/NN is/VBZ cardinality/NN calculus/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP analyze/VBP fuzzy/JJ syllogistic/JJ models/NNS previously/RB described/VBN by/IN Zadeh/NNP and/CC Dubois/NNP et/FW al./FW and/CC compare/VB their/PRP$ behavior/NN with/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT classical/JJ Aristotelian/JJ framework/NN to/TO check/VB which/WDT of/IN the/DT 24/CD classical/JJ valid/JJ syllogistic/JJ reasoning/NN patterns/NNS or/CC moods/NNS are/VBP particular/JJ crisp/JJ cases/NNS of/IN these/DT fuzzy/JJ approaches/NNS ./.
This/DT allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO assess/VB to/IN what/WP extent/NN these/DT approaches/NNS can/MD be/VB considered/VBN as/IN either/CC plausible/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN the/DT classical/JJ crisp/JJ syllogism/NN or/CC a/DT basis/NN for/IN a/DT general/JJ approach/NN to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN approximate/JJ syllogism/NN ./.
