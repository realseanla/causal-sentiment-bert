Understanding/VBG infant/NN development/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT greatest/JJS scientific/JJ challenges/NNS of/IN contemporary/JJ science/NN ./.
A/DT large/JJ source/NN of/IN difficulty/NN comes/VBZ from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN skills/NNS in/IN infants/NNS results/VBZ from/IN the/DT interactions/NNS of/IN multiple/JJ mechanisms/NNS at/IN multiple/JJ spatio/JJ -/HYPH temporal/JJ scales/NNS ./.

Formulating/VBG hypothesis/NN about/IN development/NN using/VBG such/JJ models/NNS ,/, and/CC exploring/VBG them/PRP through/IN experiments/NNS ,/, allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO consider/VB in/IN detail/NN the/DT interaction/NN between/IN many/JJ mechanisms/NNS and/CC parameters/NNS ./.
