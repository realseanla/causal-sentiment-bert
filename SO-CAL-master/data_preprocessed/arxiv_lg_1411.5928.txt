We/PRP train/VBP a/DT generative/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN which/WDT is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO generate/VB images/NNS of/IN objects/NNS given/VBN object/NN type/NN ,/, viewpoint/NN ,/, and/CC color/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT network/NN does/VBZ not/RB merely/RB learn/VB all/DT images/NNS by/IN heart/NN ,/, but/CC rather/RB finds/VBZ a/DT meaningful/JJ representation/NN of/IN a/DT 3D/NN chair/NN model/NN allowing/VBG it/PRP to/TO assess/VB the/DT similarity/NN of/IN different/JJ chairs/NNS ,/, interpolate/VBP between/IN given/VBN viewpoints/NNS to/TO generate/VB the/DT missing/JJ ones/NNS ,/, or/CC invent/VB new/JJ chair/NN styles/NNS by/IN interpolating/VBG between/IN chairs/NNS from/IN the/DT training/NN set/NN ./.
