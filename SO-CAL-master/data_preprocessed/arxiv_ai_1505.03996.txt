In/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN using/VBG norms/NNS for/IN controlling/VBG multi-agent/JJ systems/NNS ,/, a/DT vitally/RB important/JJ question/NN that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN addressed/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN is/VBZ the/DT development/NN of/IN mechanisms/NNS for/IN monitoring/VBG norm/NN compliance/NN under/IN partial/JJ action/NN observability/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ the/DT reconstruction/NN of/IN unobserved/JJ actions/NNS to/TO tackle/VB this/DT problem/NN ./.
