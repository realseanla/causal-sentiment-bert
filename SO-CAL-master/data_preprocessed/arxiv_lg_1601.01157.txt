We/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ method/NN to/TO perform/VB multi-class/NN pattern/NN classification/NN with/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS and/CC test/NN it/PRP on/IN a/DT challenging/JJ 3D/JJ hand/NN gesture/NN recognition/NN problem/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT standard/JJ one/CD -/HYPH against/IN -/HYPH all/DT (/-LRB- OAA/NN )/-RRB- classification/NN ,/, followed/VBN by/IN another/DT network/NN layer/NN classifying/VBG the/DT resulting/VBG class/NN scores/NNS ,/, possibly/RB augmented/VBN by/IN the/DT original/JJ raw/JJ input/NN vector/NN ./.
This/DT allows/VBZ the/DT network/NN to/TO disambiguate/VB hard/JJ -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH separate/JJ classes/NNS as/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN class/NN scores/NNS carries/VBZ considerable/JJ information/NN as/RB well/RB ,/, and/CC is/VBZ in/IN fact/NN often/RB used/VBN for/IN assessing/VBG the/DT confidence/NN of/IN a/DT decision/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN by/IN this/DT approach/NN we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO significantly/RB boost/VB our/PRP$ results/NNS ,/, overall/RB as/RB well/RB as/IN for/IN particular/JJ difficult/JJ cases/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT hard/JJ 10/CD -/HYPH class/NN gesture/NN classification/NN task/NN ./.
