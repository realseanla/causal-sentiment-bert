We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT structured/JJ prediction/NN architecture/NN for/IN images/NNS centered/VBN around/IN deep/JJ recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN network/NN ,/, called/VBN ReSeg/NNP ,/, is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT recently/RB introduced/VBN ReNet/NNP model/NN for/IN object/NN classification/NN ./.
We/PRP modify/VBP and/CC extend/VBP it/PRP to/TO perform/VB object/NN segmentation/NN ,/, noting/VBG that/IN the/DT avoidance/NN of/IN pooling/VBG can/MD greatly/RB simplify/VB pixel-wise/JJ tasks/NNS for/IN images/NNS ./.
The/DT ReSeg/NNP layer/NN is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN four/CD recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS that/WDT sweep/VBP the/DT image/NN horizontally/RB and/CC vertically/RB in/IN both/DT directions/NNS ,/, along/IN with/IN a/DT final/JJ layer/NN that/WDT expands/VBZ the/DT prediction/NN back/RB to/IN the/DT original/JJ image/NN size/NN ./.
ReSeg/NNP combines/VBZ multiple/JJ ReSeg/NNP layers/NNS with/IN several/JJ possible/JJ input/NN layers/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT final/JJ layer/NN which/WDT expands/VBZ the/DT prediction/NN back/RB to/IN the/DT original/JJ image/NN size/NN ,/, making/VBG it/PRP suitable/JJ for/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN structured/JJ prediction/NN tasks/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP ReSeg/NNP on/IN the/DT specific/JJ task/NN of/IN object/NN segmentation/NN with/IN three/CD widely/RB -/HYPH used/VBN image/NN segmentation/NN datasets/NNS ,/, namely/RB Weizmann/NNP Horse/NNP ,/, Fashionista/NNP and/CC Oxford/NNP Flower/NNP ./.
The/DT results/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN ReSeg/NNP can/MD challenge/VB the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN in/IN object/NN segmentation/NN ,/, and/CC may/MD have/VB further/JJ applications/NNS in/IN structured/JJ prediction/NN at/IN large/JJ ./.
