Reasoning/NN with/IN ontologies/NNS is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT core/NN fields/NNS of/IN research/NN in/IN Description/NN Logics/NNS ./.
A/DT variety/NN of/IN efficient/JJ reasoner/NN with/IN highly/RB optimized/VBN algorithms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN developed/VBN to/TO allow/VB inference/NN tasks/NNS on/IN expressive/JJ ontology/NN languages/NNS such/JJ as/IN OWL/NN (/-LRB- DL/NN )/-RRB- ./.
However/RB ,/, reasoner/NN reported/VBD computing/VBG times/NNS have/VBP exceeded/VBN and/CC sometimes/RB fall/VB behind/IN the/DT expected/VBN theoretical/JJ values/NNS ./.
From/IN an/DT empirical/JJ perspective/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB yet/RB well/RB understood/VBN ,/, which/WDT particular/JJ aspects/NNS in/IN the/DT ontology/NN are/VBP reasoner/NN performance/NN degrading/JJ factors/NNS ./.
