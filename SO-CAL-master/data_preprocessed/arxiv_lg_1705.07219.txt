In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN for/IN semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN problems/NNS ,/, which/WDT considers/VBZ an/DT adaptive/JJ adjacency/NN of/IN the/DT examples/NNS throughout/IN the/DT unsupervised/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT training/NN ./.
Adjacency/NN of/IN the/DT examples/NNS is/VBZ inferred/VBN using/VBG the/DT predictions/NNS of/IN a/DT neural/JJ network/NN model/NN which/WDT is/VBZ first/JJ initialized/VBN by/IN a/DT supervised/JJ pretraining/NN ./.
These/DT predictions/NNS are/VBP then/RB updated/VBN according/VBG to/IN a/DT novel/JJ unsupervised/JJ objective/NN which/WDT regularizes/VBZ another/DT adjacency/NN ,/, now/RB linking/VBG the/DT output/NN nodes/NNS ./.
Regularizing/VBG the/DT adjacency/NN of/IN the/DT output/NN nodes/NNS ,/, inferred/VBN from/IN the/DT predictions/NNS of/IN the/DT network/NN ,/, creates/VBZ an/DT easier/JJR optimization/NN problem/NN and/CC ultimately/RB provides/VBZ that/IN the/DT predictions/NNS of/IN the/DT network/NN turn/VB into/IN the/DT optimal/JJ embedding/NN ./.
Ultimately/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN framework/NN provides/VBZ an/DT effective/JJ and/CC scalable/JJ graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN solution/NN which/WDT is/VBZ natural/JJ to/IN the/DT operational/JJ mechanism/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN performance/NN within/IN semi-supervised/VBN learning/NN with/IN the/DT highest/JJS accuracies/NNS reported/VBD to/IN date/NN in/IN the/DT literature/NN for/IN SVHN/NNP and/CC NORB/NNP datasets/NNS ./.
