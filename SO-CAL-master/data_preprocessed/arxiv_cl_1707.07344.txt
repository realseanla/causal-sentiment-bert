We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT novel/JJ iterative/JJ approach/NN for/IN event/NN coreference/NN resolution/NN that/WDT gradually/RB builds/VBZ event/NN clusters/NNS by/IN exploiting/VBG inter-dependencies/NNS among/IN event/NN mentions/VBZ within/IN the/DT same/JJ chain/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN across/IN event/NN chains/NNS ./.
Among/IN event/NN mentions/VBZ in/IN the/DT same/JJ chain/NN ,/, we/PRP distinguish/VBP within/IN -/HYPH and/CC cross-document/JJ event/NN coreference/NN links/NNS by/IN using/VBG two/CD distinct/JJ pairwise/JJ classifiers/NNS ,/, trained/VBN separately/RB to/TO capture/VB differences/NNS in/IN feature/NN distributions/NNS of/IN within/IN -/HYPH and/CC cross-document/JJ event/NN clusters/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ event/NN coreference/NN approach/NN alternates/VBZ between/IN WD/NNP and/CC CD/NNP clustering/NN and/CC combines/VBZ arguments/NNS from/IN both/DT event/NN clusters/NNS after/IN every/DT merge/NN ,/, continuing/VBG till/IN no/DT more/JJR merge/NN can/MD be/VB made/VBN ./.
