Feature/NN weighting/NN is/VBZ a/DT technique/NN used/VBN to/TO approximate/VB the/DT optimal/JJ degree/NN of/IN influence/NN of/IN individual/JJ features/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT feature/NN weighting/NN method/NN for/IN Document/NNP Image/NNP Retrieval/NNP System/NNP (/-LRB- DIRS/NNP )/-RRB- based/VBN on/IN keyword/NN spotting/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT method/NN ,/, we/PRP weight/VBP the/DT feature/NN using/VBG coefficient/NN of/IN multiple/JJ correlations/NNS ./.
Coefficient/NN of/IN multiple/JJ correlations/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO describe/VB the/DT synthesized/VBN effects/NNS and/CC correlation/NN of/IN each/DT feature/NN ./.
The/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO show/VB that/IN feature/NN weighting/NN increases/VBZ the/DT performance/NN of/IN DIRS/NNP ./.
After/IN applying/VBG the/DT feature/NN weighting/NN method/NN to/TO DIRS/VB the/DT average/JJ precision/NN is/VBZ 93.23/CD percent/NN and/CC average/JJ recall/NN become/VBN 98.66/CD percent/NN respectively/RB
