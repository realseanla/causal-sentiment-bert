This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT design/NN of/IN hierarchical/JJ fuzzy/JJ inference/NN tree/NN (/-LRB- HFIT/NN )/-RRB- ./.
An/DT HFIT/NN produces/VBZ an/DT optimum/JJ treelike/JJ structure/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, a/DT natural/JJ hierarchical/JJ structure/NN that/WDT accommodates/VBZ simplicity/NN by/IN combining/VBG several/JJ low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ fuzzy/JJ inference/NN systems/NNS (/-LRB- FISs/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
Such/PDT a/DT natural/JJ hierarchical/JJ structure/NN provides/VBZ a/DT high/JJ degree/NN of/IN approximation/NN accuracy/NN ./.
The/DT construction/NN of/IN HFIT/NN takes/VBZ place/NN in/IN two/CD phases/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, a/DT nondominated/JJ sorting/NN based/VBN multiobjective/JJ genetic/JJ programming/NN (/-LRB- MOGP/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ applied/VBN to/TO obtain/VB a/DT simple/JJ tree/NN structure/NN (/-LRB- a/DT low/JJ complexity/NN model/NN )/-RRB- with/IN a/DT high/JJ accuracy/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, the/DT differential/JJ evolution/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/TO optimize/VB the/DT obtained/VBN tree/NN 's/POS parameters/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT derived/VBN tree/NN ,/, each/DT node/NN acquires/VBZ a/DT different/JJ input/NN 's/POS combination/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT evolutionary/JJ process/NN governs/VBZ the/DT input/NN 's/POS combination/NN ./.
Hence/RB ,/, HFIT/NNP nodes/NNS are/VBP heterogeneous/JJ in/IN nature/NN ,/, which/WDT leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT high/JJ diversity/NN among/IN the/DT rules/NNS generated/VBN by/IN the/DT HFIT/NNP ./.
Additionally/RB ,/, the/DT HFIT/NN provides/VBZ an/DT automatic/JJ feature/NN selection/NN because/IN it/PRP uses/VBZ MOGP/NN for/IN the/DT tree/NN 's/POS structural/JJ optimization/NN that/WDT accepts/VBZ inputs/NNS only/RB relevant/JJ to/IN the/DT knowledge/NN contained/VBD in/IN data/NNS ./.
The/DT HFIT/NN was/VBD studied/VBN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN both/DT type/NN -/HYPH 1/CD and/CC type/NN -/HYPH 2/CD FISs/NNS ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ performance/NN was/VBD evaluated/VBN through/IN six/CD application/NN problems/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN multiobjective/JJ HFIT/NN was/VBD compared/VBN both/CC theoretically/RB and/CC empirically/RB with/IN recently/RB proposed/VBN FISs/NNS methods/NNS from/IN the/DT literature/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN McIT2FIS/NN ,/, TSCIT2FNN/NN ,/, SIT2FNN/NNP ,/, RIT2FNS/NNP -/HYPH WB/NNP ,/, eT2FIS/NN ,/, MRIT2NFS/NN ,/, IT2FNN/NN -/HYPH SVR/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.
From/IN the/DT obtained/VBN results/NNS ,/, it/PRP was/VBD found/VBN that/IN the/DT HFIT/NNP provided/VBD less/RBR complex/JJ and/CC highly/RB accurate/JJ models/NNS compared/VBN to/IN the/DT models/NNS produced/VBN by/IN the/DT most/JJS of/IN other/JJ methods/NNS ./.
Hence/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN HFIT/NN is/VBZ an/DT efficient/JJ and/CC competitive/JJ alternative/NN to/IN the/DT other/JJ FISs/NNS for/IN function/NN approximation/NN and/CC feature/NN selection/NN ./.
