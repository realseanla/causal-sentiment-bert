We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT Prediction/NN Advantage/NN (/-LRB- PA/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT novel/JJ performance/NN measure/NN for/IN prediction/NN functions/NNS under/IN any/DT loss/NN function/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, classification/NN or/CC regression/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT PA/NNP is/VBZ defined/VBN as/IN the/DT performance/NN advantage/NN relative/JJ to/IN the/DT Bayesian/JJ risk/NN restricted/VBN to/IN knowing/VBG only/RB the/DT distribution/NN of/IN the/DT labels/NNS ./.

In/IN the/DT latter/JJ case/NN ,/, the/DT PA/NNP is/VBZ identical/JJ to/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN R/NN -/HYPH squared/VBN measure/NN ,/, widely/RB used/VBN in/IN statistics/NNS ./.
