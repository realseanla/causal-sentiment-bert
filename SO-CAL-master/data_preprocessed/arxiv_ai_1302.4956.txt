We/PRP present/VBP a/DT precise/JJ definition/NN of/IN cause/NN and/CC effect/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN a/DT fundamental/JJ notion/NN called/VBN unresponsiveness/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ definition/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN Savage/NNP 's/POS (/-LRB- 1954/CD )/-RRB- formulation/NN of/IN decision/NN theory/NN and/CC departs/VBZ from/IN the/DT traditional/JJ view/NN of/IN causation/NN in/IN that/IN our/PRP$ causal/JJ assertions/NNS are/VBP made/VBN relative/JJ to/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN decisions/NNS ./.
An/DT important/JJ consequence/NN of/IN this/DT departure/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP can/MD reason/VB about/RB cause/VB locally/RB ,/, not/RB requiring/VBG a/DT causal/JJ explanation/NN for/IN every/DT dependency/NN ./.
Such/JJ local/JJ reasoning/NN can/MD be/VB beneficial/JJ because/IN it/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB necessary/JJ to/TO determine/VB whether/IN a/DT particular/JJ dependency/NN is/VBZ causal/JJ to/TO make/VB a/DT decision/NN ./.
Also/RB in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP examine/VBP the/DT graphical/JJ encoding/NN of/IN causal/JJ relationships/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN influence/NN diagrams/NNS in/IN canonical/JJ form/NN are/VBP an/DT accurate/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ representation/NN of/IN causal/JJ relationships/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP establish/VBP a/DT correspondence/NN between/IN canonical/JJ form/NN and/CC Pearl/NNP 's/POS causal/JJ theory/NN ./.
