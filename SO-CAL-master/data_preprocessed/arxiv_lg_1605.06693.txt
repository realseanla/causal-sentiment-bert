We/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ method/NN for/IN efficiently/RB searching/VBG top/JJ -/HYPH k/NN neighbors/NNS for/IN documents/NNS represented/VBN in/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ space/NN of/IN terms/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT cosine/NN similarity/NN ./.

One/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS used/JJ ways/NNS of/IN computing/VBG similarity/NN between/IN a/DT pair/NN of/IN documents/NNS is/VBZ cosine/JJ similarity/NN between/IN the/DT vector/NN representations/NNS ,/, but/CC cosine/NN similarity/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT metric/JJ distance/NN measure/NN as/IN it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB follow/VB triangle/NN inequality/NN ,/, therefore/RB most/RBS metric/JJ searching/NN methods/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB applied/VBN directly/RB ./.
