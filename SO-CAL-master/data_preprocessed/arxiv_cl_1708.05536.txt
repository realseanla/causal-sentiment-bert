Recent/JJ applications/NNS of/IN neural/JJ language/NN models/NNS have/VBP led/VBN to/IN an/DT increased/VBN interest/NN in/IN the/DT automatic/JJ generation/NN of/IN natural/JJ language/NN ./.
However/RB impressive/JJ ,/, the/DT evaluation/NN of/IN neurally/RB generated/VBN text/NN has/VBZ so/RB far/RB remained/VBN rather/RB informal/JJ and/CC anecdotal/JJ ./.
Here/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP an/DT attempt/NN at/IN the/DT systematic/JJ assessment/NN of/IN one/CD aspect/NN of/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN neurally/RB generated/VBN text/NN ./.
We/PRP focus/VBP on/IN a/DT specific/JJ aspect/NN of/IN neural/JJ language/NN generation/NN :/: its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO reproduce/VB authorial/JJ writing/NN styles/NNS ./.
Using/VBG established/VBN models/NNS for/IN authorship/NN attribution/NN ,/, we/PRP empirically/RB assess/VBP the/DT stylistic/JJ qualities/NNS of/IN neurally/RB generated/VBN text/NN ./.
In/IN comparison/NN to/IN conventional/JJ language/NN models/NNS ,/, neural/JJ models/NNS generate/VBP fuzzier/JJR text/NN that/WDT is/VBZ relatively/RB harder/JJR to/TO attribute/VB correctly/RB ./.
