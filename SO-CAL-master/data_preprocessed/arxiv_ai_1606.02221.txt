Security/NNP Games/NNPS employ/VBP game/NN theoretical/JJ tools/NNS to/TO derive/VB resource/NN allocation/NN strategies/NNS in/IN security/NN domains/NNS ./.
Recent/JJ works/NNS considered/VBD the/DT presence/NN of/IN alarm/NN systems/NNS ,/, even/RB suffering/VBG various/JJ forms/NNS of/IN uncertainty/NN ,/, and/CC showed/VBD that/IN disregarding/VBG alarm/NN signals/NNS may/MD lead/VB to/IN arbitrarily/RB bad/JJ strategies/NNS ./.
The/DT central/JJ problem/NN with/IN an/DT alarm/NN system/NN ,/, unexplored/JJ in/IN other/JJ Security/NNP Games/NNPS ,/, is/VBZ finding/VBG the/DT best/JJS strategy/NN to/TO respond/VB to/IN alarm/NN signals/NNS for/IN each/DT mobile/JJ defensive/JJ resource/NN ./.
The/DT literature/NN provides/VBZ results/NNS for/IN the/DT basic/JJ single/JJ -/HYPH resource/NN case/NN ,/, showing/VBG that/IN even/RB in/IN that/DT case/NN the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ computationally/RB hard/JJ ./.
