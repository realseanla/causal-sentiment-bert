Among/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH established/VBN methods/NNS for/IN facial/JJ landmark/NN detection/NN is/VBZ the/DT family/NN of/IN Constrained/VBN Local/JJ Models/NNS (/-LRB- CLMs/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
An/DT important/JJ part/NN of/IN CLM/NNP landmark/NN alignment/NN pipeline/NN are/VBP the/DT local/JJ detectors/NNS that/WDT estimate/VBP the/DT alignment/NN probability/NN of/IN each/DT individual/JJ landmark/NN over/IN the/DT facial/JJ region/NN ./.

DPN/NNP is/VBZ a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN that/WDT consists/VBZ of/IN two/CD important/JJ layers/NNS :/: Template/NNP Projection/NNP layer/NN and/CC Dense/JJ Aggregate/JJ layer/NN ./.
