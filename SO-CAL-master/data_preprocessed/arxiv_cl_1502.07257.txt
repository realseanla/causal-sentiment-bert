Recently/RB proposed/VBN Skip/VB -/HYPH gram/NN model/NN is/VBZ a/DT powerful/JJ method/NN for/IN learning/VBG high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ word/NN representations/NNS that/WDT capture/VBP rich/JJ semantic/JJ relationships/NNS between/IN words/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, Skip/VB -/HYPH gram/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN most/JJS prior/JJ work/NN on/IN learning/VBG word/NN representations/NNS does/VBZ not/RB take/VB into/IN account/NN word/NN ambiguity/NN and/CC maintain/VB only/RB single/JJ representation/NN per/IN word/NN ./.
Although/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN Skip/VB -/HYPH gram/NN modifications/NNS were/VBD proposed/VBN to/TO overcome/VB this/DT limitation/NN and/CC learn/VB multi-prototype/JJ word/NN representations/NNS ,/, they/PRP either/CC require/VBP a/DT known/VBN number/NN of/IN word/NN meanings/NNS or/CC learn/VB them/PRP using/VBG greedy/JJ heuristic/NN approaches/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP propose/VBP the/DT Adaptive/JJ Skip/VB -/HYPH gram/NN model/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT nonparametric/JJ Bayesian/JJ extension/NN of/IN Skip/VB -/HYPH gram/NN capable/JJ to/IN automatically/RB learn/VB the/DT required/VBN number/NN of/IN representations/NNS for/IN all/DT words/NNS at/IN desired/VBN semantic/JJ resolution/NN ./.
