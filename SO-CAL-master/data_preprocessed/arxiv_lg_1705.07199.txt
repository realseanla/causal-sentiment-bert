Recent/JJ research/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN one/PRP can/MD train/VB a/DT neural/JJ network/NN with/IN binary/JJ weights/NNS and/CC activations/NNS at/IN train/NN time/NN by/IN augmenting/VBG the/DT weights/NNS with/IN a/DT high/JJ -/HYPH precision/NN continuous/JJ latent/NN variable/NN that/WDT accumulates/VBZ small/JJ changes/NNS from/IN stochastic/JJ gradient/NN descent/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT dearth/NN of/IN theoretical/JJ analysis/NN to/TO explain/VB why/WRB we/PRP can/MD effectively/RB capture/VB the/DT features/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ data/NNS with/IN binary/JJ weights/NNS and/CC activations/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ main/JJ result/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT neural/JJ networks/NNS with/IN binary/JJ weights/NNS and/CC activations/NNS trained/VBN using/VBG the/DT method/NN of/IN Courbariaux/NNP ,/, Hubara/NNP et/FW al./FW (/-LRB- 2016/CD )/-RRB- work/NN because/IN of/IN the/DT high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ geometry/NN of/IN binary/NN vectors/NNS ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, the/DT ideal/JJ continuous/JJ vectors/NNS that/WDT extract/VBP out/RP features/NNS in/IN the/DT intermediate/JJ representations/NNS of/IN these/DT BNNs/NNS are/VBP well/RB -/HYPH approximated/VBN by/IN binary/NN vectors/NNS in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN dot/NN products/NNS are/VBP approximately/RB preserved/VBN ./.
Compared/VBN to/IN previous/JJ research/NN that/WDT demonstrated/VBD the/DT viability/NN of/IN such/JJ BNNs/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ work/NN explains/VBZ why/WRB these/DT BNNs/NNS work/VBP in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT HD/NN geometry/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ theory/NN serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT foundation/NN for/IN understanding/VBG not/RB only/RB BNNs/NNS but/CC a/DT variety/NN of/IN methods/NNS that/WDT seek/VBP to/TO compress/VB traditional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, a/DT better/JJR understanding/NN of/IN multilayer/JJ binary/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT starting/NN point/NN for/IN generalizing/VBG BNNs/NNS to/IN other/JJ neural/JJ network/NN architectures/NNS such/JJ as/IN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
