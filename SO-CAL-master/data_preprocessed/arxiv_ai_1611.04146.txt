The/DT first/JJ method/NN is/VBZ an/DT unsupervised/JJ method/NN ,/, which/WDT represents/VBZ all/PDT the/DT pronouns/NNS and/CC candidate/NN mentions/VBZ in/IN continuous/JJ vector/NN spaces/NNS based/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ contexts/NNS and/CC calculates/VBZ the/DT semantic/JJ similarities/NNS between/IN all/PDT the/DT possible/JJ word/NN pairs/NNS ./.
