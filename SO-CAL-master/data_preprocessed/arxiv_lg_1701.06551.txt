In/IN this/DT study/NN ,/, an/DT Artificial/NNP Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- ANN/NNP )/-RRB- approach/NN is/VBZ utilized/VBN to/TO perform/VB a/DT parametric/JJ study/NN on/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN extraction/NN of/IN lubricants/NNS from/IN heavy/JJ petroleum/NN cuts/NNS ./.
To/TO train/VB the/DT model/NN ,/, we/PRP used/VBD field/NN data/NNS collected/VBN from/IN an/DT industrial/JJ plant/NN ./.
Operational/JJ conditions/NNS of/IN feed/NN and/CC solvent/NN flow/NN rate/NN ,/, Temperature/NN of/IN streams/NNS and/CC mixing/VBG rate/NN were/VBD considered/VBN as/IN the/DT input/NN to/IN the/DT model/NN ,/, whereas/IN the/DT flow/NN rate/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ product/NN was/VBD considered/VBN as/IN the/DT output/NN of/IN the/DT ANN/NNP model/NN ./.
A/DT feed/NN -/HYPH forward/JJ Multi-Layer/NNP Perceptron/NNP Neural/JJ Network/NN was/VBD successfully/RB applied/VBN to/TO capture/VB the/DT relationship/NN between/IN inputs/NNS and/CC output/NN parameters/NNS ./.
