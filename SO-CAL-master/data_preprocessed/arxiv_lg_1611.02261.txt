Recent/JJ works/NNS on/IN neural/JJ architectures/NNS have/VBP demonstrated/VBN the/DT utility/NN of/IN attention/NN mechanisms/NNS for/IN a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN tasks/NNS ./.
Attention/NN models/NNS used/VBN for/IN problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN image/NN captioning/NN typically/RB depend/VBP on/IN the/DT image/NN under/IN consideration/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT previous/JJ sequence/NN of/IN words/NNS that/WDT come/VBP before/IN the/DT word/NN currently/RB being/VBG generated/VBN ./.
While/IN these/DT types/NNS of/IN models/NNS have/VBP produced/VBN impressive/JJ results/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP not/RB able/JJ to/TO model/VB the/DT higher/JJR -/HYPH order/NN interactions/NNS involved/VBN in/IN problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN video/NN description/NN //HYPH captioning/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT relationship/NN between/IN parts/NNS of/IN the/DT video/NN and/CC the/DT concepts/NNS being/VBG depicted/VBN is/VBZ complex/JJ ./.

Evaluation/NN on/IN the/DT challenging/JJ and/CC popular/JJ MSVD/NN and/CC Charades/NNP datasets/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN architecture/NN outperforms/VBZ all/DT previously/RB proposed/VBN methods/NNS and/CC leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT new/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN results/NNS in/IN the/DT video/NN description/NN ./.
