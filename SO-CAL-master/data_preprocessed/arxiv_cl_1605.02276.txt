Lacking/VBG standardized/VBN extrinsic/JJ evaluation/NN methods/NNS for/IN vector/NN representations/NNS of/IN words/NNS ,/, the/DT NLP/NNP community/NN has/VBZ relied/VBN heavily/RB on/IN word/NN similarity/NN tasks/NNS as/IN a/DT proxy/NN for/IN intrinsic/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN word/NN vectors/NNS ./.
