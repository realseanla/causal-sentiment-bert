We/PRP present/VBP two/CD algorithms/NNS for/IN exact/JJ and/CC approximate/JJ inference/NN in/IN causal/JJ networks/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, dynamic/JJ conditioning/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT refinement/NN of/IN cutset/NN conditioning/NN that/WDT has/VBZ linear/JJ complexity/NN on/IN some/DT networks/NNS for/IN which/WDT cutset/NN conditioning/NN is/VBZ exponential/JJ ./.
The/DT second/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, B/NN -/HYPH conditioning/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT algorithm/NN for/IN approximate/JJ inference/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ one/CD to/TO trade/VB -/HYPH off/RP the/DT quality/NN of/IN approximations/NNS with/IN the/DT computation/NN time/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB present/VBP some/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS illustrating/VBG the/DT properties/NNS of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithms/NNS ./.
