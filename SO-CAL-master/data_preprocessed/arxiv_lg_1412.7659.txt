When/WRB a/DT three/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ object/NN moves/VBZ through/IN a/DT scene/NN ,/, a/DT corresponding/VBG change/NN occurs/VBZ on/IN the/DT image/NN plane/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT visual/JJ representation/NN constructed/VBN by/IN a/DT learning/NN algorithm/NN ./.
Starting/VBG with/IN the/DT idea/NN that/IN a/DT good/JJ representation/NN is/VBZ one/CD that/WDT transforms/VBZ linearly/RB under/IN scene/NN motions/NNS ,/, we/PRP use/VBP standard/JJ results/NNS from/IN group/NN representation/NN theory/NN to/TO show/VB that/IN any/DT such/JJ representation/NN is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/IN a/DT combination/NN of/IN particularly/RB simple/JJ irreducible/JJ representations/NNS ./.
We/PRP derive/VBP a/DT striking/JJ relationship/NN between/IN irreducibility/NN and/CC the/DT statistical/JJ dependency/NN structure/NN of/IN the/DT representation/NN ./.
Under/IN partial/JJ observability/NN ,/, as/IN induced/VBN by/IN the/DT perspective/NN projection/NN of/IN a/DT scene/NN onto/IN the/DT image/NN plane/NN ,/, the/DT motion/NN group/NN does/VBZ not/RB have/VB a/DT linear/JJ action/NN on/IN the/DT space/NN of/IN images/NNS ,/, so/IN that/IN it/PRP becomes/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO perform/VB inference/NN over/IN a/DT latent/JJ representation/NN that/WDT does/VBZ transform/VB linearly/RB ./.
This/DT idea/NN is/VBZ demonstrated/VBN in/IN a/DT model/NN of/IN rotating/VBG NORB/NNP objects/NNS that/WDT employs/VBZ a/DT latent/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT non-commutative/JJ 3D/NN rotation/NN group/NN SO/RB (/-LRB- 3/CD )/-RRB- ./.
