When/WRB a/DT new/JJ treatment/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN for/IN use/NN ,/, whether/IN a/DT pharmaceutical/JJ drug/NN or/CC a/DT search/NN engine/NN ranking/VBG algorithm/NN ,/, a/DT typical/JJ question/NN that/WDT arises/VBZ is/VBZ ,/, will/MD its/PRP$ performance/NN exceed/VBP that/DT of/IN the/DT current/JJ treatment/NN ?/.
