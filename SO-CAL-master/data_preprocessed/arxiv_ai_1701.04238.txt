We/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ extension/NN of/IN Thompson/NNP Sampling/NNP for/IN stochastic/JJ sequential/JJ decision/NN problems/NNS with/IN graph/NN feedback/NN ,/, even/RB when/WRB the/DT graph/NN structure/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ unknown/JJ and/CC //HYPH or/CC changing/VBG ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP theoretical/JJ guarantees/NNS on/IN the/DT Bayesian/JJ regret/NN of/IN the/DT algorithm/NN ,/, linking/VBG its/PRP$ performance/NN to/IN the/DT underlying/VBG properties/NNS of/IN the/DT graph/NN ./.
