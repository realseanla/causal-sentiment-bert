This/DT paper/NN discusses/VBZ in/IN layperson/NN 's/POS terms/NNS human/JJ and/CC computational/JJ studies/NNS of/IN the/DT impact/NN of/IN threat/NN and/CC fear/NN on/IN exploration/NN and/CC creativity/NN ./.
A/DT first/JJ study/NN showed/VBD that/IN both/DT killifish/NNS from/IN a/DT lake/NN with/IN predators/NNS and/CC from/IN a/DT lake/NN without/IN predators/NNS explore/VB a/DT new/JJ environment/NN to/IN the/DT same/JJ degree/NN and/CC plotting/VBG number/NN of/IN new/JJ spaces/NNS covered/VBN over/IN time/NN generates/VBZ a/DT hump/NN -/HYPH shaped/VBN curve/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, for/IN the/DT fish/NN from/IN the/DT lake/NN with/IN predators/NNS the/DT curve/NN is/VBZ shifted/VBN to/IN the/DT right/NN ;/: they/PRP take/VBP longer/JJR ./.
