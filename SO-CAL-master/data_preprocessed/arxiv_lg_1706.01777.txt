Speech/NNP signals/NNS are/VBP complex/JJ intermingling/VBG of/IN various/JJ informative/JJ factors/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT information/NN blending/VBG makes/VBZ decoding/NN any/DT of/IN the/DT individual/JJ factors/NNS extremely/RB difficult/JJ ./.
A/DT natural/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ to/TO factorize/VB each/DT speech/NN frame/NN into/IN independent/JJ factors/NNS ,/, though/IN it/PRP turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO be/VB even/RB more/RBR difficult/JJ than/IN decoding/VBG each/DT individual/JJ factor/NN ./.
A/DT major/JJ encumbrance/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT speaker/NN trait/NN ,/, a/DT major/JJ factor/NN in/IN speech/NN signals/NNS ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN suspected/VBN to/TO be/VB a/DT long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN distributional/JJ pattern/NN and/CC so/RB not/RB identifiable/JJ at/IN the/DT frame/NN level/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP demonstrated/VBD that/IN the/DT speaker/NN factor/NN is/VBZ also/RB a/DT short/JJ -/HYPH time/NN spectral/JJ pattern/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB largely/RB identified/VBN with/IN just/RB a/DT few/JJ frames/NNS using/VBG a/DT simple/JJ deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- ./.

Our/PRP$ experiment/NN on/IN an/DT automatic/JJ emotion/NN recognition/NN (/-LRB- AER/NN )/-RRB- task/NN demonstrated/VBD that/IN this/DT approach/NN can/MD effectively/RB factorize/VB speech/NN signals/NNS ,/, and/CC using/VBG these/DT factors/NNS ,/, the/DT original/JJ speech/NN spectrum/NN can/MD be/VB recovered/VBN with/IN high/JJ accuracy/NN ./.
