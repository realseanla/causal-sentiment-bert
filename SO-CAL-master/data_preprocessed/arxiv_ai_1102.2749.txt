In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ age/NN estimation/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN GLOH/NN feature/NN descriptor/NN and/CC multi-task/VB learning/NN (/-LRB- MTL/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT GLOH/NN feature/NN descriptor/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN feature/NN descriptor/NN ,/, is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO capture/VB the/DT age/NN -/HYPH related/JJ local/JJ and/CC spatial/JJ information/NN of/IN face/NN image/NN ./.
As/IN the/DT exacted/VBN GLOH/NN features/NNS are/VBP often/RB redundant/JJ ,/, MTL/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO select/VB the/DT most/RBS informative/JJ feature/NN bins/NNS for/IN age/NN estimation/NN problem/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT corresponding/VBG weights/NNS are/VBP determined/VBN by/IN ridge/NN regression/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN largely/RB reduces/VBZ the/DT dimensions/NNS of/IN feature/NN ,/, which/WDT can/MD not/RB only/RB improve/VB performance/NN but/CC also/RB decrease/VBP the/DT computational/JJ burden/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN the/DT public/JJ available/JJ FG/NN -/HYPH NET/NN database/NN show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN can/MD achieve/VB comparable/JJ performance/NN over/IN previous/JJ approaches/NNS while/IN using/VBG much/JJ fewer/JJR features/NNS ./.
