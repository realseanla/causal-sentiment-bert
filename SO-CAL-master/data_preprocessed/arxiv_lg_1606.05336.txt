We/PRP study/VBP the/DT expressivity/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS with/IN random/JJ weights/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP several/JJ results/NNS ,/, both/CC theoretical/JJ and/CC experimental/JJ ,/, precisely/RB characterizing/VBG their/PRP$ functional/JJ properties/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT depth/NN and/CC width/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
In/IN doing/VBG so/RB ,/, we/PRP illustrate/VBP inherent/JJ connections/NNS between/IN the/DT length/NN of/IN a/DT latent/NN trajectory/NN ,/, local/JJ neuron/NN transitions/NNS ,/, and/CC network/NN activation/NN patterns/NNS ./.
The/DT latter/JJ ,/, a/DT notion/NN defined/VBN in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, is/VBZ further/RB studied/VBN using/VBG properties/NNS of/IN hyperplane/NN arrangements/NNS ,/, which/WDT also/RB help/VBP precisely/RB characterize/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT neural/JJ network/NN on/IN the/DT input/NN space/NN ./.
We/PRP further/RB show/VBP dualities/NNS between/IN changes/NNS to/IN the/DT latent/JJ state/NN and/CC changes/NNS to/IN the/DT network/NN weights/NNS ,/, and/CC between/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN achievable/JJ activation/NN patterns/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN achievable/JJ labellings/NNS over/IN input/NN data/NNS ./.
We/PRP see/VBP that/IN the/DT depth/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN affects/VBZ all/DT of/IN these/DT quantities/NNS exponentially/RB ,/, while/IN the/DT width/NN appears/VBZ at/IN most/RBS as/IN a/DT base/NN ./.
These/DT results/NNS also/RB suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT remaining/VBG depth/NN of/IN a/DT neural/JJ network/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ determinant/NN of/IN expressivity/NN ,/, supported/VBN by/IN experiments/NNS on/IN MNIST/NN and/CC CIFAR/NN -/HYPH 10/CD ./.
