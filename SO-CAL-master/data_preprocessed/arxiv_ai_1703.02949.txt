People/NNS can/MD learn/VB a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN tasks/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ experience/NN ,/, but/CC can/MD also/RB learn/VB from/IN observing/VBG other/JJ creatures/NNS ./.
This/DT can/MD accelerate/VB acquisition/NN of/IN new/JJ skills/NNS even/RB when/WRB the/DT observed/VBN agent/NN differs/VBZ substantially/RB from/IN the/DT learning/NN agent/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN morphology/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP examine/VBP how/WRB reinforcement/NN learning/VBG algorithms/NNS can/MD transfer/VB knowledge/NN between/IN morphologically/RB different/JJ agents/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, different/JJ robots/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT problem/NN formulation/NN where/WRB two/CD agents/NNS are/VBP tasked/VBN with/IN learning/VBG multiple/JJ skills/NNS by/IN sharing/VBG information/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN uses/VBZ the/DT skills/NNS that/WDT were/VBD learned/VBN by/IN both/DT agents/NNS to/TO train/VB invariant/JJ feature/NN spaces/NNS that/WDT can/MD then/RB be/VB used/VBN to/TO transfer/VB other/JJ skills/NNS from/IN one/CD agent/NN to/IN another/DT ./.
The/DT process/NN of/IN learning/VBG these/DT invariant/JJ feature/NN spaces/NNS can/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT kind/NN of/IN "/`` analogy/NN making/NN "/'' ,/, or/CC implicit/JJ learning/NN of/IN partial/JJ correspondences/NNS between/IN two/CD distinct/JJ domains/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP our/PRP$ transfer/NN learning/VBG algorithm/NN in/IN two/CD simulated/VBN robotic/JJ manipulation/NN skills/NNS ,/, and/CC illustrate/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD transfer/VB knowledge/NN between/IN simulated/JJ robotic/JJ arms/NNS with/IN different/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN links/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN simulated/JJ arms/NNS with/IN different/JJ actuation/NN mechanisms/NNS ,/, where/WRB one/CD robot/NN is/VBZ torque/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN while/IN the/DT other/JJ is/VBZ tendon/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN ./.
