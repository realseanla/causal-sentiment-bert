We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/IN the/DT analysis/NN of/IN Loopy/NNP Belief/NNP Propagation/NNP (/-LRB- LBP/NN )/-RRB- by/IN establishing/VBG a/DT formula/NN that/WDT connects/VBZ the/DT Hessian/JJ of/IN the/DT Bethe/NNP free/JJ energy/NN with/IN the/DT edge/NN zeta/NN function/NN ./.
The/DT formula/NN has/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN theoretical/JJ implications/NNS on/IN LBP/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ applied/VBN to/TO give/VB a/DT sufficient/JJ condition/NN that/IN the/DT Hessian/NNP of/IN the/DT Bethe/NNP free/JJ energy/NN is/VBZ positive/JJ definite/JJ ,/, which/WDT shows/VBZ non-convexity/NN for/IN graphs/NNS with/IN multiple/JJ cycles/NNS ./.
The/DT formula/NN clarifies/VBZ the/DT relation/NN between/IN the/DT local/JJ stability/NN of/IN a/DT fixed/VBN point/NN of/IN LBP/NN and/CC local/JJ minima/NN of/IN the/DT Bethe/NNP free/JJ energy/NN ./.
