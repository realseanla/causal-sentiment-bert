This/DT paper/NN discusses/VBZ a/DT fuzzy/JJ model/NN for/IN multi-level/JJ human/JJ emotions/NNS recognition/NN by/IN computer/NN systems/NNS through/IN keyboard/NN keystrokes/NNS ,/, mouse/NN and/CC touchscreen/NN interactions/NNS ./.
This/DT model/NN can/MD also/RB be/VB used/VBN to/TO detect/VB the/DT other/JJ possible/JJ emotions/NNS at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN recognition/NN ./.
Accuracy/NN measurements/NNS of/IN human/JJ emotions/NNS by/IN the/DT fuzzy/JJ model/NN are/VBP discussed/VBN through/IN two/CD methods/NNS ;/: the/DT first/JJ is/VBZ accuracy/NN analysis/NN and/CC the/DT second/NN is/VBZ false/JJ positive/JJ rate/NN analysis/NN ./.
This/DT fuzzy/JJ model/NN detects/VBZ more/JJR emotions/NNS ,/, but/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, for/IN some/DT of/IN emotions/NNS ,/, a/DT lower/JJR accuracy/NN was/VBD obtained/VBN with/IN the/DT comparison/NN with/IN the/DT non-fuzzy/JJ human/JJ emotions/NNS detection/NN methods/NNS ./.
This/DT system/NN was/VBD trained/VBN and/CC tested/VBN by/IN Support/NN Vector/NNP Machine/NNP (/-LRB- SVM/NNP )/-RRB- to/TO recognize/VB the/DT users/NNS '/POS emotions/NNS ./.
Overall/RB ,/, this/DT model/NN represents/VBZ a/DT closer/RBR similarity/NN between/IN human/JJ brain/NN detection/NN of/IN emotions/NNS and/CC computer/NN systems/NNS ./.
