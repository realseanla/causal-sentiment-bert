One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ challenges/NNS in/IN Grid/NNP systems/NNS is/VBZ designing/VBG an/DT adaptive/JJ ,/, scalable/JJ ,/, and/CC model/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ method/NN for/IN job/NN scheduling/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT desirable/JJ degree/NN of/IN load/NN balancing/NN and/CC system/NN efficiency/NN ./.
Centralized/JJ job/NN scheduling/NN methods/NNS have/VBP some/DT drawbacks/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN single/JJ point/NN of/IN failure/NN and/CC lack/NN of/IN scalability/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, decentralized/JJ methods/NNS require/VBP a/DT coordination/NN mechanism/NN with/IN limited/JJ communications/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT multi-agent/JJ approach/NN to/IN job/NN scheduling/NN in/IN Grid/NNP ,/, named/VBN Centralized/NNP Learning/NNP Distributed/VBN Scheduling/NN (/-LRB- CLDS/NN )/-RRB- ,/, by/IN utilizing/VBG the/DT reinforcement/NN learning/VBG framework/NN ./.
The/DT CLDS/NNP is/VBZ a/DT model/NN free/JJ approach/NN that/WDT uses/VBZ the/DT information/NN of/IN jobs/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ completion/NN time/NN to/TO estimate/VB the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN resources/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT method/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP a/DT learner/NN agent/NN and/CC several/JJ scheduler/NN agents/NNS that/WDT perform/VBP the/DT task/NN of/IN learning/NN and/CC job/NN scheduling/NN with/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN a/DT coordination/NN strategy/NN that/WDT maintains/VBZ the/DT communication/NN cost/NN at/IN a/DT limited/JJ level/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluated/VBD the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT CLDS/NN method/NN by/IN designing/VBG and/CC performing/VBG a/DT set/NN of/IN experiments/NNS on/IN a/DT simulated/JJ Grid/NNP system/NN under/IN different/JJ system/NN scales/NNS and/CC loads/NNS ./.
The/DT results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT CLDS/NNP can/MD effectively/RB balance/VB the/DT load/NN of/IN system/NN even/RB in/IN large/JJ scale/NN and/CC heavy/JJ loaded/JJ Grids/NNS ,/, while/IN maintains/VBZ its/PRP$ adaptive/JJ performance/NN and/CC scalability/NN ./.
