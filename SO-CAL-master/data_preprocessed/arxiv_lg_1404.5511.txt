Coactive/JJ learning/NN is/VBZ an/DT online/JJ problem/NN solving/VBG setting/NN where/WRB the/DT solutions/NNS provided/VBN by/IN a/DT solver/NN are/VBP interactively/RB improved/VBN by/IN a/DT domain/NN expert/NN ,/, which/WDT in/IN turn/NN drives/NNS learning/VBG ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP extend/VBP the/DT study/NN of/IN coactive/JJ learning/NN to/IN problems/NNS where/WRB obtaining/VBG a/DT globally/RB optimal/JJ or/CC near/JJ -/HYPH optimal/JJ solution/NN may/MD be/VB intractable/JJ or/CC where/WRB an/DT expert/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB expected/VBN to/TO make/VB small/JJ ,/, local/JJ improvements/NNS to/IN a/DT candidate/NN solution/NN ./.
The/DT goal/NN of/IN learning/NN in/IN this/DT new/JJ setting/NN is/VBZ to/TO minimize/VB the/DT cost/NN as/IN measured/VBN by/IN the/DT expert/JJ effort/NN over/IN time/NN ./.
We/PRP first/RB establish/VB theoretical/JJ bounds/NNS on/IN the/DT average/JJ cost/NN of/IN the/DT existing/VBG coactive/JJ Perceptron/NNP algorithm/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP new/JJ online/JJ algorithms/NNS that/WDT use/VBP cost/NN -/HYPH sensitive/JJ and/CC Passive/NNP -/HYPH Aggressive/NNP (/-LRB- PA/NNP )/-RRB- updates/NNS ,/, showing/VBG similar/JJ or/CC improved/JJ theoretical/JJ bounds/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP an/DT empirical/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT learners/NNS in/IN various/JJ domains/NNS ,/, which/WDT show/VBP that/IN the/DT Perceptron/NNP based/VBN algorithms/NNS are/VBP quite/RB effective/JJ and/CC that/IN unlike/IN the/DT case/NN for/IN online/JJ classification/NN ,/, the/DT PA/NNP algorithms/NNS do/VBP not/RB yield/VB significant/JJ performance/NN gains/NNS ./.
