The/DT speed/NN of/IN convergence/NN of/IN the/DT Expectation/NN Maximization/NN (/-LRB- EM/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN for/IN Gaussian/JJ mixture/NN model/NN fitting/NN is/VBZ known/VBN to/TO be/VB dependent/JJ on/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN overlap/NN among/IN the/DT mixture/NN components/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT impact/NN of/IN mixing/VBG coefficients/NNS on/IN the/DT convergence/NN of/IN EM/NNP ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN when/WRB the/DT mixture/NN components/NNS exhibit/VBP some/DT overlap/NN ,/, the/DT convergence/NN of/IN EM/NNP becomes/VBZ slower/JJR as/IN the/DT dynamic/JJ range/NN among/IN the/DT mixing/VBG coefficients/NNS increases/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT deterministic/JJ anti-annealing/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, that/DT significantly/RB improves/VBZ the/DT speed/NN of/IN convergence/NN of/IN EM/NNP for/IN such/JJ mixtures/NNS with/IN unbalanced/JJ mixing/VBG coefficients/NNS ./.

Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT similar/JJ deterministic/JJ anti-annealing/NN based/VBN algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT Dirichlet/NNP process/NN mixture/NN model/NN and/CC demonstrate/VBP its/PRP$ advantages/NNS over/IN the/DT conventional/JJ variational/JJ Bayesian/JJ approach/NN ./.
