The/DT growing/VBG demand/NN for/IN structured/JJ knowledge/NN has/VBZ led/VBN to/IN great/JJ interest/NN in/IN relation/NN extraction/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN cases/NNS with/IN limited/JJ supervision/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, existing/VBG distance/NN supervision/NN approaches/VBZ only/RB extract/NN relations/NNS expressed/VBN in/IN single/JJ sentences/NNS ./.
In/IN general/JJ ,/, cross-sentence/JJ relation/NN extraction/NN is/VBZ under/IN -/HYPH explored/VBN ,/, even/RB in/IN the/DT supervised/JJ -/HYPH learning/NN setting/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP the/DT first/JJ approach/NN for/IN applying/VBG distant/JJ supervision/NN to/TO cross/VB -/: sentence/NN relation/NN extraction/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT core/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ a/DT graph/NN representation/NN that/WDT can/MD incorporate/VB both/DT standard/JJ dependencies/NNS and/CC discourse/NN relations/NNS ,/, thus/RB providing/VBG a/DT unifying/JJ way/NN to/TO model/VB relations/NNS within/IN and/CC across/IN sentences/NNS ./.
We/PRP extract/VBP features/NNS from/IN multiple/JJ paths/NNS in/IN this/DT graph/NN ,/, increasing/VBG accuracy/NN and/CC robustness/NN when/WRB confronted/VBN with/IN linguistic/JJ variation/NN and/CC analysis/NN error/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN an/DT important/JJ extraction/NN task/NN for/IN precision/NN medicine/NN show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN can/MD learn/VB an/DT accurate/JJ cross-sentence/NN extractor/NN ,/, using/VBG only/RB a/DT small/JJ existing/VBG knowledge/NN base/NN and/CC unlabeled/JJ text/NN from/IN biomedical/JJ research/NN articles/NNS ./.
Compared/VBN to/IN the/DT existing/VBG distant/JJ supervision/NN paradigm/NN ,/, our/PRP$ approach/NN extracted/VBD twice/RB as/RB many/JJ relations/NNS at/IN similar/JJ precision/NN ,/, thus/RB demonstrating/VBG the/DT prevalence/NN of/IN cross-sentence/NN relations/NNS and/CC the/DT promise/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN ./.
