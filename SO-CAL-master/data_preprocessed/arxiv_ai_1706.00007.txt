This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ an/DT optimal/JJ task/NN allocation/NN problem/NN for/IN human/JJ robot/NN collaboration/NN in/IN human/JJ robot/NN systems/NNS with/IN persistent/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
Such/JJ human/JJ robot/NN systems/NNS consist/VBP of/IN human/JJ operators/NNS and/CC intelligent/JJ robots/NNS collaborating/VBG with/IN each/DT other/JJ to/TO accomplish/VB complex/JJ tasks/NNS that/WDT can/MD not/RB be/VB done/VBN by/IN either/CC part/NN alone/RB ./.
The/DT system/NN objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO maximize/VB the/DT probability/NN of/IN successfully/RB executing/VBG persistent/JJ tasks/NNS that/WDT are/VBP formulated/VBN as/IN linear/JJ temporal/JJ logic/NN specifications/NNS and/CC minimize/VB the/DT average/JJ cost/NN between/IN consecutive/JJ visits/NNS of/IN a/DT particular/JJ proposition/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ to/TO model/VB the/DT human/JJ robot/NN collaboration/NN under/IN a/DT framework/NN with/IN the/DT composition/NN of/IN multiple/JJ Markov/NNP Decision/NN Process/NN (/-LRB- MDP/NN )/-RRB- with/IN possibly/RB unknown/JJ transition/NN probabilities/NNS ,/, which/WDT characterizes/VBZ how/WRB human/JJ cognitive/JJ states/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN human/JJ trust/NN and/CC fatigue/NN ,/, stochastically/RB change/VB with/IN the/DT robot/NN performance/NN ./.
Under/IN the/DT unknown/JJ MDP/NN models/NNS ,/, an/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ developed/VBN to/TO learn/VB the/DT model/NN and/CC obtain/VB an/DT optimal/JJ task/NN allocation/NN policy/NN that/WDT minimizes/VBZ the/DT expected/VBN average/JJ cost/NN for/IN each/DT task/NN cycle/NN and/CC maximizes/VBZ the/DT probability/NN of/IN satisfying/VBG linear/JJ temporal/JJ logic/NN constraints/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, this/DT paper/NN shows/VBZ that/IN the/DT difference/NN between/IN the/DT optimal/JJ policy/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT learned/VBN model/NN and/CC that/IN based/VBN on/IN the/DT underlying/JJ ground/NN truth/NN model/NN can/MD be/VB bounded/VBN by/IN arbitrarily/RB small/JJ constant/JJ and/CC large/JJ confidence/NN level/NN with/IN sufficient/JJ samples/NNS ./.
The/DT case/NN study/NN of/IN an/DT assembly/NN process/NN demonstrates/VBZ the/DT effectiveness/NN and/CC benefits/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN learning/NN based/VBN human/JJ robot/NN collaboration/NN ./.
