For/IN agents/NNS and/CC robots/NNS to/TO become/VB more/RBR useful/JJ ,/, they/PRP must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO quickly/RB learn/VB from/IN non-technical/JJ users/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN interactively/RB learning/VBG behaviors/NNS communicated/VBN by/IN a/DT human/JJ teacher/NN using/VBG positive/JJ and/CC negative/JJ feedback/NN ./.
Much/JJ previous/JJ work/NN on/IN this/DT problem/NN has/VBZ made/VBN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN people/NNS provide/VBP feedback/NN for/IN decisions/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ dependent/JJ on/IN the/DT behavior/NN they/PRP are/VBP teaching/VBG and/CC is/VBZ independent/JJ from/IN the/DT learner/NN 's/POS current/JJ policy/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP empirical/JJ results/NNS that/WDT show/VBP this/DT assumption/NN to/TO be/VB false/JJ ---/, whether/IN human/JJ trainers/NNS give/VBP a/DT positive/JJ or/CC negative/JJ feedback/NN for/IN a/DT decision/NN is/VBZ influenced/VBN by/IN the/DT learner/NN 's/POS current/JJ policy/NN ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN policy/NN -/HYPH dependent/JJ feedback/NN ,/, in/IN addition/NN to/IN being/VBG commonplace/JJ ,/, enables/VBZ useful/JJ training/NN strategies/NNS from/IN which/WDT agents/NNS should/MD benefit/VB ./.
Based/VBN on/IN this/DT insight/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP Convergent/NNP Actor/NN -/HYPH Critic/NN by/IN Humans/NNS (/-LRB- COACH/NN )/-RRB- ,/, an/DT algorithm/NN for/IN learning/VBG from/IN policy/NN -/HYPH dependent/JJ feedback/NN that/WDT converges/VBZ to/IN a/DT local/JJ optimum/JJ ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN COACH/NN can/MD successfully/RB learn/VB multiple/JJ behaviors/NNS on/IN a/DT physical/JJ robot/NN ,/, even/RB with/IN noisy/JJ image/NN features/NNS ./.
