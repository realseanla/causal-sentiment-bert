Feature/NN selection/NN has/VBZ always/RB been/VBN a/DT critical/JJ step/NN in/IN pattern/NN recognition/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN (/-LRB- GA/NN )/-RRB- ,/, are/VBP most/RBS commonly/RB used/VBN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT individual/JJ encoding/VBG scheme/NN used/VBN in/IN various/JJ GAs/NNS would/MD either/CC pose/VB a/DT bias/NN on/IN the/DT solution/NN or/CC require/VB a/DT pre-specified/JJ number/NN of/IN features/NNS ,/, and/CC hence/RB may/MD lead/VB to/IN less/RBR accurate/JJ results/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT tribe/NN competition/NN -/HYPH based/VBN genetic/JJ algorithm/NN (/-LRB- TCbGA/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ proposed/VBN for/IN feature/NN selection/NN in/IN pattern/NN classification/NN ./.
The/DT population/NN of/IN individuals/NNS is/VBZ divided/VBN into/IN multiple/JJ tribes/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT initialization/NN and/CC evolutionary/JJ operations/NNS are/VBP modified/VBN to/TO ensure/VB that/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN selected/VBN features/NNS in/IN each/DT tribe/NN follows/VBZ a/DT Gaussian/JJ distribution/NN ./.
Thus/RB each/DT tribe/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN exploring/VBG a/DT specific/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT solution/NN space/NN ./.
Meanwhile/RB ,/, tribe/NN competition/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN to/IN the/DT evolution/NN process/NN ,/, which/WDT allows/VBZ the/DT winning/VBG tribes/NNS ,/, which/WDT produce/VBP better/JJR individuals/NNS ,/, to/TO enlarge/VB their/PRP$ sizes/NNS ,/, i.e./FW having/VBG more/JJR individuals/NNS to/TO search/VB their/PRP$ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT solution/NN space/NN ./.
This/DT algorithm/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, avoids/VBZ the/DT bias/NN on/IN solutions/NNS and/CC requirement/NN of/IN a/DT pre-specified/JJ number/NN of/IN features/NNS ./.
We/PRP have/VBP evaluated/VBN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN against/IN several/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN feature/NN selection/NN approaches/VBZ on/IN 20/CD benchmark/NN datasets/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN TCbGA/NN algorithm/NN can/MD identify/VB the/DT optimal/JJ feature/NN subset/NN more/RBR effectively/RB and/CC produce/VB more/JJR accurate/JJ pattern/NN classification/NN ./.
