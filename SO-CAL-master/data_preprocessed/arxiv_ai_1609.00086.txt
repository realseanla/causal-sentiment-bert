In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT high/JJ -/HYPH speed/NN online/JJ neural/JJ network/NN classifier/NN based/VBN on/IN extreme/JJ learning/NN machines/NNS for/IN multi-label/JJ classification/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
In/IN multi-label/JJ classification/NN ,/, each/DT of/IN the/DT input/NN data/NNS sample/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR than/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT target/NN labels/NNS ./.
The/DT traditional/JJ binary/JJ and/CC multi-class/JJ classification/NN where/WRB each/DT sample/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN only/RB one/CD target/NN class/NN forms/VBZ the/DT subset/NN of/IN multi-label/JJ classification/NN ./.
Multi-label/JJ classification/NN problems/NNS are/VBP far/RB more/RBR complex/JJ than/IN binary/JJ and/CC multi-class/JJ classification/NN problems/NNS ,/, as/IN both/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN target/NN labels/NNS and/CC each/DT of/IN the/DT target/NN labels/NNS corresponding/VBG to/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT input/NN samples/NNS are/VBP to/TO be/VB identified/VBN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN work/NN exploits/VBZ the/DT high/JJ -/HYPH speed/NN nature/NN of/IN the/DT extreme/JJ learning/NN machines/NNS to/TO achieve/VB real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN multi-label/NN classification/NN of/IN streaming/NN data/NNS ./.
A/DT new/JJ threshold/NN -/HYPH based/VBN online/JJ sequential/JJ learning/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN for/IN high/JJ speed/NN and/CC streaming/NN data/NNS classification/NN of/IN multi-label/JJ problems/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ experimented/VBN with/IN six/CD different/JJ datasets/NNS from/IN different/JJ application/NN domains/NNS such/JJ as/IN multimedia/NNS ,/, text/NN ,/, and/CC biology/NN ./.
The/DT hamming/VBG loss/NN ,/, accuracy/NN ,/, training/NN time/NN and/CC testing/NN time/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN technique/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN with/IN nine/CD different/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN methods/NNS ./.
Experimental/JJ studies/NNS shows/VBZ that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN technique/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT existing/VBG multi-label/NN classifiers/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN performance/NN and/CC speed/NN ./.
