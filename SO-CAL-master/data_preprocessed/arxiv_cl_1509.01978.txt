The/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ script/NN classification/NN method/NN for/IN the/DT discrimination/NN of/IN the/DT South/NNP Slavic/JJ medieval/JJ labels/NNS ./.
It/PRP consists/VBZ in/IN the/DT textural/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT script/NN types/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT first/JJ step/NN ,/, each/DT letter/NN is/VBZ coded/VBN by/IN the/DT equivalent/JJ script/NN type/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ defined/VBN by/IN its/PRP$ typographical/JJ features/NNS ./.
Obtained/VBN coded/VBN text/NN is/VBZ subjected/VBN to/IN the/DT run/NN -/HYPH length/NN statistical/JJ analysis/NN and/CC to/IN the/DT adjacent/JJ local/JJ binary/JJ pattern/NN analysis/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO extract/VB the/DT features/NNS ./.
The/DT result/NN shows/VBZ a/DT diversity/NN between/IN the/DT extracted/VBN features/NNS of/IN the/DT scripts/NNS ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ the/DT feature/NN classification/NN more/RBR effective/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN for/IN the/DT classification/NN process/NN of/IN the/DT script/NN identification/NN by/IN using/VBG an/DT extension/NN of/IN a/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN approach/NN for/IN document/NN clustering/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN on/IN an/DT example/NN of/IN hand/NN -/HYPH engraved/VBN in/IN stone/NN and/CC hand/NN -/HYPH printed/VBN in/IN paper/NN labels/NNS in/IN old/JJ Cyrillic/JJ ,/, angular/JJ and/CC round/JJ Glagolitic/JJ ./.
