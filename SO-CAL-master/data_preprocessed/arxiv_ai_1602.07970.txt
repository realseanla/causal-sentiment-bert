This/DT paper/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN causal/JJ structure/NN estimation/NN from/IN time/NN series/NN data/NNS in/IN which/WDT measurements/NNS are/VBP obtained/VBN at/IN a/DT coarser/JJR timescale/NN than/IN the/DT causal/JJ timescale/NN of/IN the/DT underlying/VBG system/NN ./.
Previous/JJ work/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN such/JJ sub-sampling/NN can/MD lead/VB to/IN significant/JJ errors/NNS about/IN the/DT system/NN 's/POS causal/JJ structure/NN if/IN not/RB properly/RB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP first/RB consider/VB the/DT search/NN for/IN the/DT system/NN timescale/NN causal/JJ structures/NNS that/WDT correspond/VBP to/IN a/DT given/VBN measurement/NN timescale/NN structure/NN ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP a/DT constraint/NN satisfaction/NN procedure/NN whose/WP$ computational/JJ performance/NN is/VBZ several/JJ orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN better/JJR than/IN previous/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, and/CC that/DT has/VBZ considerably/RB broader/JJR applicability/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB consider/VBP finite/JJ sample/NN data/NNS as/IN input/NN ,/, and/CC propose/VB the/DT first/JJ constraint/NN optimization/NN approach/NN for/IN recovering/VBG the/DT system/NN timescale/NN causal/JJ structure/NN ./.
This/DT algorithm/NN optimally/RB recovers/VBZ from/IN possible/JJ conflicts/NNS due/IN to/IN statistical/JJ errors/NNS ./.
More/RBR generally/RB ,/, these/DT advances/NNS allow/VBP for/IN a/DT robust/JJ and/CC non-parametric/JJ estimation/NN of/IN system/NN timescale/NN causal/JJ structures/NNS from/IN subsampled/JJ time/NN series/NN data/NNS ./.
