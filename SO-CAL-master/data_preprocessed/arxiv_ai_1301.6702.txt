Classical/JJ Decision/NN Theory/NN provides/VBZ a/DT normative/JJ framework/NN for/IN representing/VBG and/CC reasoning/NN about/IN complex/NN preferences/NNS ./.
Straightforward/JJ application/NN of/IN this/DT theory/NN to/IN automate/VB decision/NN making/NN is/VBZ difficult/JJ due/IN to/IN high/JJ elicitation/NN cost/NN ./.
In/IN response/NN to/IN this/DT problem/NN ,/, researchers/NNS have/VBP recently/RB developed/VBN a/DT number/NN of/IN qualitative/JJ ,/, logic/NN -/HYPH oriented/VBN approaches/NNS for/IN representing/VBG and/CC reasoning/NN about/IN references/NNS ./.
While/IN effectively/RB addressing/VBG some/DT expressiveness/NN issues/NNS ,/, these/DT logics/NNS have/VBP not/RB proven/VBN powerful/JJ enough/JJ for/IN building/VBG practical/JJ automated/VBN decision/NN making/VBG systems/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT hybrid/NN approach/NN to/IN preference/NN elicitation/NN and/CC decision/NN making/VBG that/DT is/VBZ grounded/VBN in/IN classical/JJ multi-attribute/JJ utility/NN theory/NN ,/, but/CC can/MD make/VB effective/JJ use/NN of/IN the/DT expressive/JJ power/NN of/IN qualitative/JJ approaches/NNS ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, assuming/VBG a/DT partially/RB specified/VBN multilinear/JJ utility/NN function/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP how/WRB comparative/JJ statements/NNS about/IN classes/NNS of/IN decision/NN alternatives/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO further/RB constrain/VB the/DT utility/NN function/NN and/CC thus/RB identify/VB sup/NN -/HYPH optimal/JJ alternatives/NNS ./.
This/DT work/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN quantitative/JJ and/CC qualitative/JJ approaches/NNS can/MD be/VB synergistically/RB integrated/VBN to/TO provide/VB effective/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ decision/NN support/NN ./.
