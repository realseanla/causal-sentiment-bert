The/DT question/NN of/IN how/WRB procedural/JJ knowledge/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN and/CC inferred/VBN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ problem/NN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN and/CC artificial/JJ intelligence/NN ./.
Recent/JJ work/NN on/IN program/NN induction/NN has/VBZ proposed/VBN neural/JJ architectures/NNS ,/, based/VBN on/IN abstractions/NNS like/IN stacks/NNS ,/, Turing/NNP machines/NNS ,/, and/CC interpreters/NNS ,/, that/DT operate/VBP on/IN abstract/JJ computational/JJ machines/NNS or/CC on/IN execution/NN traces/NNS ./.
But/CC the/DT recursive/JJ abstraction/NN that/WDT is/VBZ central/JJ to/IN procedural/JJ knowledge/NN is/VBZ perhaps/RB most/RBS naturally/RB represented/VBN by/IN symbolic/JJ representations/NNS that/WDT have/VBP syntactic/JJ structure/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN logical/JJ expressions/NNS and/CC source/NN code/NN ./.
Combining/VBG abstract/JJ ,/, symbolic/JJ reasoning/NN with/IN continuous/JJ neural/JJ reasoning/NN is/VBZ a/DT grand/JJ challenge/NN of/IN representation/NN learning/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT step/NN in/IN this/DT direction/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ architecture/NN ,/, called/VBN neural/JJ equivalence/NN networks/NNS ,/, for/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN learning/VBG continuous/JJ semantic/JJ representations/NNS of/IN mathematical/JJ and/CC logical/JJ expressions/NNS ./.
These/DT networks/NNS are/VBP trained/VBN to/TO represent/VB semantic/JJ equivalence/NN ,/, even/RB of/IN expressions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP syntactically/RB very/RB different/JJ ./.
The/DT challenge/NN is/VBZ that/IN semantic/JJ representations/NNS must/MD be/VB computed/VBN in/IN a/DT syntax/NN -/HYPH directed/VBN manner/NN ,/, because/IN semantics/NNS is/VBZ compositional/JJ ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, small/JJ changes/NNS in/IN syntax/NN can/MD lead/VB to/IN very/RB large/JJ changes/NNS in/IN semantics/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD be/VB difficult/JJ for/IN continuous/JJ neural/JJ architectures/NNS ./.
We/PRP perform/VBP an/DT exhaustive/JJ evaluation/NN on/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN checking/VBG equivalence/NN on/IN a/DT highly/RB diverse/JJ class/NN of/IN symbolic/JJ algebraic/JJ and/CC boolean/JJ expression/NN types/NNS ,/, showing/VBG that/IN our/PRP$ model/NN significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ existing/VBG architectures/NNS ./.
