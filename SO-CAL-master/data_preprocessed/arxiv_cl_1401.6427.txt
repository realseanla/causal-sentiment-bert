Automatic/JJ extraction/NN of/IN temporal/JJ relations/NNS between/IN event/NN pairs/NNS is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ task/NN for/IN several/JJ natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN applications/NNS such/JJ as/IN Question/NN Answering/NN ,/, Information/NN Extraction/NN ,/, and/CC Summarization/NN ./.
Since/IN most/JJS existing/VBG methods/NNS are/VBP supervised/JJ and/CC require/VBP large/JJ corpora/NNS ,/, which/WDT for/IN many/JJ languages/NNS do/VBP not/RB exist/VB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP concentrated/VBN our/PRP$ efforts/NNS to/TO reduce/VB the/DT need/NN for/IN annotated/VBN data/NNS as/RB much/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ two/CD different/JJ algorithms/NNS towards/IN this/DT goal/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ a/DT weakly/RB supervised/JJ machine/NN learning/NN approach/NN for/IN classification/NN of/IN temporal/JJ relations/NNS between/IN events/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT first/JJ stage/NN ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN learns/VBZ a/DT general/JJ classifier/NN from/IN an/DT annotated/JJ corpus/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, inspired/VBN by/IN the/DT hypothesis/NN of/IN "/`` one/CD type/NN of/IN temporal/JJ relation/NN per/IN discourse/NN ,/, it/PRP extracts/NNS useful/JJ information/NN from/IN a/DT cluster/NN of/IN topically/RB related/VBN documents/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN by/IN combining/VBG the/DT global/JJ information/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT cluster/NN with/IN local/JJ decisions/NNS of/IN a/DT general/JJ classifier/NN ,/, a/DT bootstrapping/NN cross-document/NN classifier/NN can/MD be/VB built/VBN to/TO extract/VB temporal/JJ relations/NNS between/IN events/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN without/IN any/DT additional/JJ annotated/JJ data/NNS ,/, the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN is/VBZ higher/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN several/JJ previous/JJ successful/JJ systems/NNS ./.
The/DT second/JJ proposed/JJ method/NN for/IN temporal/JJ relation/NN extraction/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT expectation/NN maximization/NN (/-LRB- EM/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN ./.
Within/IN EM/NNP ,/, we/PRP used/VBD different/JJ techniques/NNS such/JJ as/IN a/DT greedy/JJ best/RBS -/HYPH first/JJ search/NN and/CC integer/NN linear/JJ programming/NN for/IN temporal/JJ inconsistency/NN removal/NN ./.
We/PRP think/VBP that/IN the/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ EM/NNP based/VBN algorithm/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT first/JJ step/NN toward/IN a/DT fully/RB unsupervised/JJ temporal/JJ relation/NN extraction/NN method/NN ,/, is/VBZ encouraging/VBG ./.
