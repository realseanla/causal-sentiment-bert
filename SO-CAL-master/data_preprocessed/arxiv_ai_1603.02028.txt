Building/NN Information/NN Modeling/VBG (/-LRB- BIM/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT recent/JJ construction/NN process/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT 3D/JJ model/NN ,/, containing/VBG every/DT component/NN related/VBN to/IN the/DT building/NN achievement/NN ./.
Architects/NNS ,/, structure/NN engineers/NNS ,/, method/NN engineers/NNS ,/, and/CC others/NNS participant/NN to/IN the/DT building/NN process/NN work/NN on/IN this/DT model/NN through/IN the/DT design/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH construction/NN cycle/NN ./.
The/DT high/JJ complexity/NN and/CC the/DT large/JJ amount/NN of/IN information/NN included/VBN in/IN these/DT models/NNS raise/VBP several/JJ issues/NNS ,/, delaying/VBG its/PRP$ wide/JJ adoption/NN in/IN the/DT industrial/JJ world/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ is/VBZ the/DT visualization/NN :/: professionals/NNS have/VBP difficulties/NNS to/TO find/VB out/RP the/DT relevant/JJ information/NN for/IN their/PRP$ job/NN ./.
Actual/JJ solutions/NNS suffer/VBP from/IN two/CD limitations/NNS :/: the/DT BIM/NNP models/NNS information/NN are/VBP processed/VBN manually/RB and/CC insignificant/JJ information/NN are/VBP simply/RB hidden/VBN ,/, leading/VBG to/IN inconsistencies/NNS in/IN the/DT building/NN model/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ a/DT system/NN relying/VBG on/IN an/DT ontological/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT building/NN information/NN to/IN label/NN automatically/RB the/DT building/NN elements/NNS ./.

The/DT proposed/VBN saliency/NN model/NN incorporates/VBZ several/JJ adaptations/NNS to/TO fit/VB the/DT specificities/NNS of/IN architectural/JJ images/NNS ./.
