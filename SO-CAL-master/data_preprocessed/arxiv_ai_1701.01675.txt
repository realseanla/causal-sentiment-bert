Analogy/NN Based/VBN Effort/NNP Estimation/NNP (/-LRB- ABE/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT prominent/JJ methods/NNS for/IN software/NN effort/NN estimation/NN ./.
The/DT fundamental/JJ concept/NN of/IN ABE/NNP is/VBZ closer/JJR to/IN the/DT mentality/NN of/IN expert/NN estimation/NN but/CC with/IN an/DT automated/VBN procedure/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT final/JJ estimate/NN is/VBZ generated/VBN by/IN reusing/VBG similar/JJ historical/JJ projects/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ key/JJ issue/NN when/WRB using/VBG ABE/NN is/VBZ how/WRB to/TO adapt/VB the/DT effort/NN of/IN the/DT retrieved/VBN nearest/JJS neighbors/NNS ./.
The/DT adaptation/NN process/NN is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ part/NN of/IN ABE/NNP to/TO generate/VB more/JJR successful/JJ accurate/JJ estimation/NN based/VBN on/IN tuning/VBG the/DT selected/VBN raw/JJ solutions/NNS ,/, using/VBG some/DT adaptation/NN strategy/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT study/NN we/PRP show/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP three/CD interrelated/JJ decision/NN variables/NNS that/WDT have/VBP great/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT success/NN of/IN adaptation/NN method/NN :/: (/-LRB- 1/LS )/-RRB- number/NN of/IN nearest/JJS analogies/NNS (/-LRB- k/CD )/-RRB- ,/, (/-LRB- 2/LS )/-RRB- optimum/JJ feature/NN set/VBN needed/VBN for/IN adaptation/NN ,/, and/CC (/-LRB- 3/LS )/-RRB- adaptation/NN weights/NNS ./.
To/TO find/VB the/DT right/JJ decision/NN regarding/VBG these/DT variables/NNS ,/, one/CD need/NN to/TO study/VB all/DT possible/JJ combinations/NNS and/CC evaluate/VB them/PRP individually/RB to/TO select/VB the/DT one/NN that/WDT can/MD improve/VB all/DT prediction/NN evaluation/NN measures/NNS ./.
The/DT existing/VBG evaluation/NN measures/NNS usually/RB behave/VBP differently/RB ,/, presenting/VBG sometimes/RB opposite/JJ trends/NNS in/IN evaluating/VBG prediction/NN methods/NNS ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN changing/VBG one/CD decision/NN variable/NN could/MD improve/VB one/CD evaluation/NN measure/NN while/IN it/PRP is/VBZ decreasing/VBG the/DT others/NNS ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT main/JJ theme/NN of/IN this/DT research/NN is/VBZ how/WRB to/TO come/VB up/RP with/IN best/JJS decision/NN variables/NNS that/WDT improve/VBP adaptation/NN strategy/NN and/CC thus/RB ,/, the/DT overall/JJ evaluation/NN measures/NNS without/IN degrading/JJ the/DT others/NNS ./.
The/DT impact/NN of/IN these/DT decisions/NNS together/RB has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN investigated/VBN before/RB ,/, therefore/RB we/PRP propose/VBP to/TO view/VB the/DT building/NN of/IN adaptation/NN procedure/NN as/IN a/DT multi-objective/JJ optimization/NN problem/NN ./.
The/DT Particle/NN Swarm/NN Optimization/NN Algorithm/NN (/-LRB- PSO/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ utilized/VBN to/TO find/VB the/DT optimum/JJ solutions/NNS for/IN such/JJ decision/NN variables/NNS based/VBN on/IN optimizing/VBG multiple/JJ evaluation/NN measures/NNS
