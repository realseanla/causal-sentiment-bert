One/CD of/IN the/DT common/JJ artificial/JJ intelligence/NN applications/NNS in/IN electronic/JJ games/NNS consists/VBZ of/IN making/VBG an/DT artificial/JJ agent/NN learn/VB how/WRB to/TO execute/VB some/DT determined/JJ task/NN successfully/RB in/IN a/DT game/NN environment/NN ./.
One/CD way/NN to/TO perform/VB this/DT task/NN is/VBZ through/IN machine/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS capable/JJ of/IN learning/VBG the/DT sequence/NN of/IN actions/NNS required/VBN to/TO win/VB in/IN a/DT given/VBN game/NN environment/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP several/JJ supervised/JJ learning/NN techniques/NNS able/JJ to/TO learn/VB the/DT correct/JJ answer/NN for/IN a/DT problem/NN through/IN examples/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, when/WRB learning/VBG how/WRB to/TO play/VB electronic/JJ games/NNS ,/, the/DT correct/JJ answer/NN might/MD only/RB be/VB known/VBN by/IN the/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN ,/, after/IN all/PDT the/DT actions/NNS were/VBD already/RB taken/VBN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, not/RB being/VBG possible/JJ to/TO measure/VB the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN each/DT individual/JJ action/NN to/TO be/VB taken/VBN at/IN each/DT time/NN step/NN ./.
A/DT way/NN for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ through/IN Neuroevolution/NNP ,/, a/DT method/NN which/WDT trains/VBZ Artificial/NNP Neural/JJ Networks/NNS using/VBG evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT article/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT framework/NN for/IN testing/NN optimization/NN algorithms/NNS with/IN artificial/JJ agent/NN controllers/NNS in/IN electronic/JJ games/NNS ,/, called/VBN EvoMan/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ inspired/VBN in/IN the/DT action/NN -/HYPH platformer/NN game/NN Mega/JJ Man/NN II/CD ./.
The/DT environment/NN can/MD be/VB configured/VBN to/TO run/VB in/IN different/JJ experiment/NN modes/NNS ,/, as/IN single/JJ evolution/NN ,/, coevolution/NN and/CC others/NNS ./.
To/TO demonstrate/VB some/DT challenges/NNS regarding/VBG the/DT proposed/VBN platform/NN ,/, as/IN initial/JJ experiments/NNS we/PRP applied/VBD Neuroevolution/NNP using/VBG Genetic/JJ Algorithms/NNS and/CC the/DT NEAT/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN competitively/RB coevolving/VBG two/CD distinct/JJ agents/NNS in/IN this/DT game/NN ./.
