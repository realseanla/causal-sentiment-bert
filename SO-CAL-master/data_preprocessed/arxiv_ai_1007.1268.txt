As/IN network/NN attacks/NNS have/VBP increased/VBN in/IN number/NN and/CC severity/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, intrusion/NN detection/NN system/NN (/-LRB- IDS/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ increasingly/RB becoming/VBG a/DT critical/JJ component/NN to/TO secure/VB the/DT network/NN ./.
Due/IN to/IN large/JJ volumes/NNS of/IN security/NN audit/NN data/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN complex/JJ and/CC dynamic/JJ properties/NNS of/IN intrusion/NN behaviors/NNS ,/, optimizing/VBG performance/NN of/IN IDS/NNP becomes/VBZ an/DT important/JJ open/JJ problem/NN that/WDT is/VBZ receiving/VBG more/JJR and/CC more/JJR attention/NN from/IN the/DT research/NN community/NN ./.
