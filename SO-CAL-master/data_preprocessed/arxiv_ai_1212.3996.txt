Nowadays/RB ,/, huge/JJ efforts/NNS are/VBP made/VBN to/TO modernize/VB the/DT air/NN traffic/NN management/NN systems/NNS to/TO cope/VB with/IN uncertainty/NN ,/, complexity/NN and/CC sub-optimality/NN ./.
An/DT answer/NN is/VBZ to/TO enhance/VB the/DT information/NN sharing/NN between/IN the/DT stakeholders/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT framework/NN that/WDT bridges/VBZ the/DT gap/NN between/IN air/NN traffic/NN management/NN and/CC air/NN traffic/NN control/NN on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN ,/, and/CC bridges/NNS the/DT gap/NN between/IN the/DT ground/NN ,/, the/DT approach/NN and/CC the/DT en/FW -/HYPH route/NN centers/NNS on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ./.
An/DT original/JJ system/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN ,/, that/DT has/VBZ three/CD essential/JJ components/NNS :/: the/DT trajectory/NN models/NNS ,/, the/DT optimization/NN process/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT monitoring/NN process/NN ./.
The/DT uncertainty/NN of/IN the/DT trajectory/NN is/VBZ modeled/VBN with/IN a/DT Bayesian/JJ Network/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT nodes/NNS are/VBP associated/VBN to/IN two/CD types/NNS of/IN random/JJ variables/NNS :/: the/DT time/NN of/IN overflight/NN on/IN metering/NN points/NNS of/IN the/DT airspace/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT traveling/NN time/NN of/IN the/DT routes/NNS linking/VBG these/DT points/NNS ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG Bayesian/JJ Network/NN covers/VBZ the/DT complete/JJ airspace/NN ,/, and/CC Monte/NNP -/HYPH Carlo/NNP simulations/NNS are/VBP done/VBN to/TO estimate/VB the/DT probabilities/NNS of/IN sector/NN congestion/NN and/CC delays/NNS ./.
On/IN top/NN of/IN this/DT trajectory/NN model/NN ,/, an/DT optimization/NN process/NN minimizes/VBZ these/DT probabilities/NNS by/IN tuning/VBG the/DT parameters/NNS of/IN the/DT Bayesian/JJ trajectory/NN model/NN related/VBN to/IN overflight/NN times/NNS on/IN metering/NN points/NNS ./.
The/DT last/JJ component/NN is/VBZ the/DT monitoring/NN process/NN ,/, that/DT continuously/RB updates/NNS the/DT situation/NN of/IN the/DT airspace/NN ,/, modifying/VBG the/DT trajectories/NNS uncertainties/NNS according/VBG to/IN actual/JJ positions/NNS of/IN aircraft/NN ./.
After/IN each/DT update/NN ,/, a/DT new/JJ optimal/JJ set/NN of/IN overflight/NN times/NNS is/VBZ computed/VBN ,/, and/CC can/MD be/VB communicated/VBN to/IN the/DT controllers/NNS as/IN clearances/NNS for/IN the/DT aircraft/NN pilots/NNS ./.
The/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT formal/JJ specification/NN of/IN this/DT global/JJ optimization/NN problem/NN ,/, whose/WP$ underlying/JJ rationale/NN was/VBD derived/VBN with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN air/NN traffic/NN controllers/NNS at/IN Thales/NNP Air/NNP Systems/NNPS ./.
