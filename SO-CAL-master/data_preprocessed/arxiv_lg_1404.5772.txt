Click/VB prediction/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ problems/NNS in/IN sponsored/VBN search/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN existing/VBG studies/NNS took/VBD advantage/NN of/IN machine/NN learning/NN approaches/VBZ to/TO predict/VB ad/NN click/VB for/IN each/DT event/NN of/IN ad/NN view/NN independently/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, as/IN observed/VBN in/IN the/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN sponsored/VBN search/NN system/NN ,/, user/NN 's/POS behaviors/NNS on/IN ads/NNS yield/VBP high/JJ dependency/NN on/IN how/WRB the/DT user/NN behaved/VBD along/IN with/IN the/DT past/JJ time/NN ,/, especially/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN what/WP queries/VBZ she/PRP submitted/VBD ,/, what/WP ads/NNS she/PRP clicked/VBD or/CC ignored/VBD ,/, and/CC how/WRB long/RB she/PRP spent/VBD on/IN the/DT landing/NN pages/NNS of/IN clicked/VBN ads/NNS ,/, etc/FW ./.
Inspired/VBN by/IN these/DT observations/NNS ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT novel/JJ framework/NN based/VBN on/IN Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- RNN/NN )/-RRB- ./.
