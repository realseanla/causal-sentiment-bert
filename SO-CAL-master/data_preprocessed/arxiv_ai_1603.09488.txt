Knowledge/NN representation/NN is/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ research/NN field/NN in/IN IT/NN ./.
As/IN mathematical/JJ knowledge/NN is/VBZ most/RBS formalized/JJ ,/, its/PRP$ representation/NN is/VBZ important/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ ./.
Mathematical/NNP knowledge/NN consists/VBZ of/IN various/JJ mathematical/JJ theories/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP consider/VBP a/DT deductive/JJ system/NN that/WDT derives/VBZ mathematical/JJ notions/NNS ,/, axioms/NNS and/CC theorems/NNS ./.
All/PDT these/DT notions/NNS ,/, axioms/NNS and/CC theorems/NNS can/MD be/VB considered/VBN as/IN the/DT part/NN of/IN elementary/JJ set/NN theory/NN ./.
This/DT theory/NN will/MD be/VB represented/VBN as/IN a/DT semantic/JJ net/NN ./.
