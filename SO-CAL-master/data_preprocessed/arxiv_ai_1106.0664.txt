In/IN the/DT recent/JJ literature/NN of/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP ,/, an/DT intensive/JJ research/NN effort/NN has/VBZ been/VBN spent/VBN ,/, for/IN various/JJ algebras/NNS of/IN qualitative/JJ relations/NNS used/VBN in/IN the/DT representation/NN of/IN temporal/JJ and/CC spatial/JJ knowledge/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN classifying/VBG the/DT computational/JJ complexity/NN of/IN reasoning/NN problems/NNS for/IN subsets/NNS of/IN algebras/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ purpose/NN of/IN these/DT researches/NNS is/VBZ to/TO describe/VB a/DT restricted/VBN set/NN of/IN maximal/JJ tractable/JJ subalgebras/NNS ,/, ideally/RB in/IN an/DT exhaustive/JJ fashion/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT hosting/VBG algebras/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT novel/JJ algebra/NN for/IN reasoning/NN about/IN Spatial/JJ Congruence/NN ,/, show/VBP that/IN the/DT satisfiability/NN problem/NN in/IN the/DT spatial/JJ algebra/NN MC/NNP -/HYPH 4/CD is/VBZ NP/NNP -/HYPH complete/JJ ,/, and/CC present/VB a/DT complete/JJ classification/NN of/IN tractability/NN in/IN the/DT algebra/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN the/DT individuation/NN of/IN three/CD maximal/JJ tractable/JJ subclasses/NNS ,/, one/CD containing/VBG the/DT basic/JJ relations/NNS ./.
The/DT three/CD algebras/NNS are/VBP formed/VBN by/IN 14/CD ,/, 10/CD and/CC 9/CD relations/NNS out/IN of/IN 16/CD which/WDT form/VBP the/DT full/JJ algebra/NN ./.
