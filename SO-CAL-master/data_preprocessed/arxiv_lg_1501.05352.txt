In/IN binary/JJ hashing/VBG ,/, one/CD wants/VBZ to/TO learn/VB a/DT function/NN that/WDT maps/VBZ a/DT high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ feature/NN vector/NN to/IN a/DT vector/NN of/IN binary/JJ codes/NNS ,/, for/IN application/NN to/IN fast/JJ image/NN retrieval/NN ./.
This/DT typically/RB results/VBZ in/IN a/DT difficult/JJ optimization/NN problem/NN ,/, nonconvex/NN and/CC nonsmooth/JJ ,/, because/IN of/IN the/DT discrete/JJ variables/NNS involved/VBN ./.
Much/JJ work/NN has/VBZ simply/RB relaxed/VBN the/DT problem/NN during/IN training/NN ,/, solving/VBG a/DT continuous/JJ optimization/NN ,/, and/CC truncating/VBG the/DT codes/NNS a/DT posteriori/NN ./.
This/DT gives/VBZ reasonable/JJ results/NNS but/CC is/VBZ suboptimal/JJ ./.
Recent/JJ work/NN has/VBZ applied/VBN alternating/VBG optimization/NN to/IN the/DT objective/NN over/IN the/DT binary/JJ codes/NNS and/CC achieved/VBD better/JJR results/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT hash/NN function/NN was/VBD still/RB learned/VBN a/DT posteriori/NNP ,/, which/WDT remains/VBZ suboptimal/JJ ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT general/JJ framework/NN for/IN learning/VBG hash/NN functions/NNS using/VBG affinity/NN -/HYPH based/VBN loss/NN functions/NNS that/WDT closes/VBZ the/DT loop/NN and/CC optimizes/VBZ jointly/RB over/IN the/DT hash/NN functions/NNS and/CC the/DT binary/JJ codes/NNS ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG algorithm/NN can/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT corrected/VBN ,/, iterated/VBN version/NN of/IN the/DT procedure/NN of/IN optimizing/VBG first/RB over/IN the/DT codes/NNS and/CC then/RB learning/VBG the/DT hash/NN function/NN ./.
Compared/VBN to/IN this/DT ,/, our/PRP$ optimization/NN is/VBZ guaranteed/VBN to/TO obtain/VB better/JJR hash/NN functions/NNS while/IN being/VBG not/RB much/RB slower/JJR ,/, as/IN demonstrated/VBN experimentally/RB in/IN various/JJ supervised/JJ and/CC unsupervised/JJ datasets/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT framework/NN facilitates/VBZ the/DT design/NN of/IN optimization/NN algorithms/NNS for/IN arbitrary/JJ types/NNS of/IN loss/NN and/CC hash/NN functions/NNS ./.
