In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ measure/NN called/VBN Term_Class/NNP relevance/NN to/IN compute/VB the/DT relevancy/NN of/IN a/DT term/NN in/IN classifying/VBG a/DT document/NN into/IN a/DT particular/JJ class/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN measure/NN estimates/VBZ the/DT degree/NN of/IN relevance/NN of/IN a/DT given/VBN term/NN ,/, in/IN placing/VBG an/DT unlabeled/JJ document/NN to/TO be/VB a/DT member/NN of/IN a/DT known/JJ class/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT product/NN of/IN Class_Term/NN weight/NN and/CC Class_Term/NN density/NN ;/: where/WRB the/DT Class_Term/NN weight/NN is/VBZ the/DT ratio/NN of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN documents/NNS of/IN the/DT class/NN containing/VBG the/DT term/NN to/IN the/DT total/JJ number/NN of/IN documents/NNS containing/VBG the/DT term/NN and/CC the/DT Class_Term/NNP density/NN is/VBZ the/DT relative/JJ density/NN of/IN occurrence/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN in/IN the/DT class/NN to/IN the/DT total/JJ occurrence/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN in/IN the/DT entire/JJ population/NN ./.
Unlike/IN the/DT other/JJ existing/VBG term/NN weighting/NN schemes/NNS such/JJ as/IN TF/NNP -/HYPH IDF/NNP and/CC its/PRP$ variants/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN relevance/NN measure/NN takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN the/DT degree/NN of/IN relative/JJ participation/NN of/IN the/DT term/NN across/IN all/DT documents/NNS of/IN the/DT class/NN to/IN the/DT entire/JJ population/NN ./.
To/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT significance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN measure/NN experimentation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN conducted/VBN on/IN the/DT 20/CD Newsgroups/NNS dataset/NN ./.
Further/RB ,/, the/DT superiority/NN of/IN the/DT novel/JJ measure/NN is/VBZ brought/VBN out/RP through/IN a/DT comparative/JJ analysis/NN ./.
