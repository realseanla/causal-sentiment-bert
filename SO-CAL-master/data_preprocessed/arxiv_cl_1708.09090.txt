Dialogue/NN authoring/NN in/IN large/JJ games/NNS requires/VBZ not/RB only/RB content/JJ creation/NN but/CC the/DT subtlety/NN of/IN its/PRP$ delivery/NN ,/, which/WDT can/MD vary/VB from/IN character/NN to/IN character/NN ./.
Manually/RB authoring/VBG this/DT dialogue/NN can/MD be/VB tedious/JJ ,/, time/NN -/HYPH consuming/VBG ,/, or/CC even/RB altogether/RB infeasible/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN utilizes/VBZ a/DT rich/JJ narrative/NN representation/NN for/IN modeling/VBG dialogue/NN and/CC an/DT expressive/JJ natural/JJ language/NN generation/NN engine/NN for/IN realizing/VBG it/PRP ,/, and/CC expands/VBZ upon/IN a/DT translation/NN tool/NN that/WDT bridges/VBZ the/DT two/CD ./.
