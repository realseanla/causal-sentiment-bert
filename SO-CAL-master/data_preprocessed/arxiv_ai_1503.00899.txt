In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN finding/VBG high/JJ quality/NN solutions/NNS for/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN maximum/JJ partitioning/NN of/IN graphs/NNS with/IN supply/NN and/CC demand/NN (/-LRB- MPGSD/NN )/-RRB- ./.
There/EX is/VBZ a/DT growing/VBG interest/NN for/IN the/DT MPGSD/NNP due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ close/JJ connection/NN to/IN problems/NNS appearing/VBG in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN electrical/JJ distribution/NN systems/NNS ,/, especially/RB for/IN the/DT optimization/NN of/IN self/NN -/HYPH adequacy/NN of/IN interconnected/VBN microgrids/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP an/DT ant/NN colony/NN optimization/NN algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.
With/IN the/DT goal/NN of/IN further/RB improving/VBG the/DT algorithm/NN we/PRP combine/VBP it/PRP with/IN a/DT previously/RB developed/VBN correction/NN procedure/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ computational/JJ experiments/NNS we/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN on/IN both/DT trees/NNS and/CC general/JJ graphs/NNS ./.
The/DT tests/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT method/NN manages/VBZ to/TO find/VB optimal/JJ solutions/NNS in/IN more/JJR than/IN 50/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN instances/NNS ,/, and/CC has/VBZ an/DT average/JJ relative/JJ error/NN of/IN less/JJR than/IN 0.5/CD percent/NN when/WRB compared/VBN to/IN known/VBN optimal/JJ solutions/NNS ./.
