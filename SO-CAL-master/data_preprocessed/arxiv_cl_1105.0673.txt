The/DT psycholinguistic/JJ theory/NN of/IN communication/NN accommodation/NN accounts/VBZ for/IN the/DT general/JJ observation/NN that/IN participants/NNS in/IN conversations/NNS tend/VBP to/TO converge/VB to/IN one/CD another/DT 's/POS communicative/JJ behavior/NN :/: they/PRP coordinate/VBP in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN dimensions/NNS including/VBG choice/NN of/IN words/NNS ,/, syntax/NN ,/, utterance/NN length/NN ,/, pitch/NN and/CC gestures/NNS ./.
In/IN its/PRP$ almost/RB forty/CD years/NNS of/IN existence/NN ,/, this/DT theory/NN has/VBZ been/VBN empirically/RB supported/VBN exclusively/RB through/IN small/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN or/CC controlled/VBN laboratory/NN studies/NNS ./.

Its/PRP$ novelty/NN comes/VBZ not/RB only/RB from/IN its/PRP$ size/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB from/IN the/DT non/FW real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN nature/NN of/IN conversations/NNS ,/, from/IN the/DT 140/CD character/NN length/NN restriction/NN ,/, from/IN the/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN social/JJ relation/NN types/NNS ,/, and/CC from/IN a/DT design/NN that/WDT was/VBD initially/RB not/RB geared/VBN towards/IN conversation/NN at/IN all/DT ./.

To/TO investigate/VB this/DT ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT probabilistic/JJ framework/NN that/WDT can/MD model/VB accommodation/NN and/CC measure/VB its/PRP$ effects/NNS ./.
We/PRP apply/VBP it/PRP to/IN a/DT large/JJ Twitter/NNP conversational/JJ dataset/NN specifically/RB developed/VBN for/IN this/DT task/NN ./.
