We/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN to/IN model/NN and/CC investigate/VB the/DT learning/NN process/NN of/IN a/DT learner/NN mastering/VBG a/DT set/NN of/IN grammatical/JJ rules/NNS from/IN an/DT inconsistent/JJ source/NN ./.
The/DT compelling/JJ interest/NN of/IN human/JJ language/NN acquisition/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT learning/NN succeeds/VBZ in/IN virtually/RB every/DT case/NN ,/, despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT input/NN data/NNS are/VBP formally/RB inadequate/JJ to/TO explain/VB the/DT success/NN of/IN learning/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ model/NN explains/VBZ how/WRB a/DT learner/NN can/MD successfully/RB learn/VB from/IN or/CC even/RB surpass/VB its/PRP$ imperfect/JJ source/NN without/IN possessing/VBG any/DT additional/JJ biases/NNS or/CC constraints/NNS about/IN the/DT types/NNS of/IN patterns/NNS that/WDT exist/VBP in/IN the/DT language/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP the/DT data/NNS collected/VBN by/IN Singleton/NNP and/CC Newport/NNP (/-LRB- 2004/CD )/-RRB- on/IN the/DT performance/NN of/IN a/DT 7/CD -/HYPH year/NN boy/NN Simon/NNP ,/, who/WP mastered/VBD the/DT American/JJ Sign/VB Language/NNP (/-LRB- ASL/NN )/-RRB- by/IN learning/VBG it/PRP from/IN his/PRP$ parents/NNS ,/, both/DT of/IN whom/WP were/VBD imperfect/JJ speakers/NNS of/IN ASL/NN ./.
