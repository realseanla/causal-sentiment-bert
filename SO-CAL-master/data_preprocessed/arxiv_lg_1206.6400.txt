Online/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO learn/VB even/RB when/WRB their/PRP$ input/NN is/VBZ generated/VBN by/IN an/DT adversary/NN ./.
The/DT widely/RB -/HYPH accepted/VBN formal/JJ definition/NN of/IN an/DT online/JJ algorithm/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO learn/VB is/VBZ the/DT game/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ notion/NN of/IN regret/NN ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT standard/JJ definition/NN of/IN regret/NN becomes/VBZ inadequate/JJ if/IN the/DT adversary/NN is/VBZ allowed/VBN to/TO adapt/VB to/IN the/DT online/JJ algorithm/NN 's/POS actions/NNS ./.
We/PRP define/VBP the/DT alternative/JJ notion/NN of/IN policy/NN regret/NN ,/, which/WDT attempts/VBZ to/TO provide/VB a/DT more/JJR meaningful/JJ way/NN to/TO measure/VB an/DT online/JJ algorithm/NN 's/POS performance/NN against/IN adaptive/JJ adversaries/NNS ./.
Focusing/VBG on/IN the/DT online/JJ bandit/NN setting/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN no/DT bandit/NN algorithm/NN can/MD guarantee/VB a/DT sublinear/NN policy/NN regret/NN against/IN an/DT adaptive/JJ adversary/NN with/IN unbounded/JJ memory/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT adversary/NN 's/POS memory/NN is/VBZ bounded/VBN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT general/JJ technique/NN that/WDT converts/VBZ any/DT bandit/NN algorithm/NN with/IN a/DT sublinear/NN regret/NN bound/VBN into/IN an/DT algorithm/NN with/IN a/DT sublinear/JJ policy/NN regret/NN bound/VBN ./.
We/PRP extend/VBP this/DT result/NN to/IN other/JJ variants/NNS of/IN regret/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN switching/VBG regret/NN ,/, internal/JJ regret/NN ,/, and/CC swap/NN regret/NN ./.
