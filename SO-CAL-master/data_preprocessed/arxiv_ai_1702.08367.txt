Learned/VBN models/NNS composed/VBN of/IN probabilistic/JJ logical/JJ rules/NNS are/VBP useful/JJ for/IN many/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN knowledge/NN base/NN completion/NN ./.
Unfortunately/RB this/DT learning/NN problem/NN is/VBZ difficult/JJ ,/, since/IN determining/VBG the/DT structure/NN of/IN the/DT theory/NN normally/RB requires/VBZ solving/VBG a/DT discrete/JJ optimization/NN problem/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT alternative/JJ approach/NN :/: a/DT completely/RB differentiable/JJ model/NN for/IN learning/NN sets/NNS of/IN first/JJ -/HYPH order/NN rules/NNS ./.
The/DT approach/NN is/VBZ inspired/VBN by/IN a/DT recently/RB -/HYPH developed/VBN differentiable/JJ logic/NN ,/, i.e./FW a/DT subset/NN of/IN first/JJ -/HYPH order/NN logic/NN for/IN which/WDT inference/NN tasks/NNS can/MD be/VB compiled/VBN into/IN sequences/NNS of/IN differentiable/JJ operations/NNS ./.
Here/RB we/PRP describe/VBP a/DT neural/JJ controller/NN system/NN which/WDT learns/VBZ how/WRB to/TO sequentially/RB compose/VB the/DT these/DT primitive/JJ differentiable/JJ operations/NNS to/TO solve/VB reasoning/NN tasks/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN particular/JJ ,/, to/TO perform/VB knowledge/NN base/NN completion/NN ./.
The/DT long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN goal/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ to/TO develop/VB integrated/VBN ,/, end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN systems/NNS that/WDT can/MD learn/VB to/TO perform/VB high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN logical/JJ reasoning/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN lower/JJR -/HYPH level/NN perceptual/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
