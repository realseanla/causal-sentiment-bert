Optimization/NN is/VBZ becoming/VBG a/DT crucial/JJ element/NN in/IN industrial/JJ applications/NNS involving/VBG sustainable/JJ alternative/JJ energy/NN systems/NNS ./.
During/IN the/DT design/NN of/IN such/JJ systems/NNS ,/, the/DT engineer/NN //HYPH decision/NN maker/NN would/MD often/RB encounter/VB noise/NN factors/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW solar/JJ insolation/NN and/CC ambient/JJ temperature/NN fluctuations/NNS )/-RRB- when/WRB their/PRP$ system/NN interacts/VBZ with/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.
