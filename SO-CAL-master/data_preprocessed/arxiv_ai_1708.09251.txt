The/DT optimization/NN of/IN functions/NNS to/TO find/VB the/DT best/JJS solution/NN according/VBG to/IN one/CD or/CC several/JJ objectives/NNS has/VBZ a/DT central/JJ role/NN in/IN many/JJ engineering/NN and/CC research/NN fields/NNS ./.
Recently/RB ,/, a/DT new/JJ family/NN of/IN optimization/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, named/VBN Quality/NNP -/HYPH Diversity/NNP optimization/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN introduced/VBN ,/, and/CC contrasts/VBZ with/IN classic/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
Instead/RB of/IN searching/VBG for/IN a/DT single/JJ solution/NN ,/, Quality/NNP -/HYPH Diversity/NNP algorithms/NNS are/VBP searching/VBG for/IN a/DT large/JJ collection/NN of/IN both/DT diverse/JJ and/CC high/JJ -/HYPH performing/VBG solutions/NNS ./.
The/DT role/NN of/IN this/DT collection/NN is/VBZ to/TO cover/VB the/DT range/NN of/IN possible/JJ solution/NN types/NNS as/RB much/RB as/IN possible/JJ ,/, and/CC to/TO contain/VB the/DT best/JJS solution/NN for/IN each/DT type/NN ./.
The/DT contribution/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ threefold/RB ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT unifying/JJ framework/NN of/IN Quality/NN -/HYPH Diversity/NN optimization/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT covers/VBZ the/DT two/CD main/JJ algorithms/NNS of/IN this/DT family/NN (/-LRB- Multi-dimensional/JJ Archive/NN of/IN Phenotypic/JJ Elites/NNS and/CC the/DT Novelty/NNP Search/VB with/IN Local/JJ Competition/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC that/DT highlights/VBZ the/DT large/JJ variety/NN of/IN variants/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB investigated/VBN within/IN this/DT family/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP algorithms/NNS with/IN a/DT new/JJ selection/NN mechanism/NN for/IN Quality/NN -/HYPH Diversity/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT outperforms/VBZ all/PDT the/DT algorithms/NNS tested/VBN in/IN this/DT paper/NN ./.
Lastly/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ collection/NN management/NN that/WDT overcomes/VBZ the/DT erosion/NN issues/NNS observed/VBN when/WRB using/VBG unstructured/JJ collections/NNS ./.
These/DT three/CD contributions/NNS are/VBP supported/VBN by/IN extensive/JJ experimental/JJ comparisons/NNS of/IN Quality/NN -/HYPH Diversity/NN algorithms/NNS on/IN three/CD different/JJ experimental/JJ scenarios/NNS ./.
