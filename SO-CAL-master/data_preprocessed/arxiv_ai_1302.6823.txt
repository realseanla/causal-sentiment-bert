The/DT paper/NN deals/NNS with/IN optimality/NN issues/NNS in/IN connection/NN with/IN updating/VBG beliefs/NNS in/IN networks/NNS ./.
We/PRP address/VBP two/CD processes/NNS :/: triangulation/NN and/CC construction/NN of/IN junction/NN trees/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT first/JJ part/NN ,/, we/PRP give/VBP a/DT simple/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN constructing/VBG an/DT optimal/JJ junction/NN tree/NN from/IN a/DT triangulated/JJ network/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT second/JJ part/NN ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN any/DT exact/JJ method/NN based/VBN on/IN local/JJ calculations/NNS must/MD either/CC be/VB less/RBR efficient/JJ than/IN the/DT junction/NN tree/NN method/NN ,/, or/CC it/PRP has/VBZ an/DT optimality/NN problem/NN equivalent/JJ to/IN that/DT of/IN triangulation/NN ./.
