In/IN railway/NN operations/NNS ,/, a/DT timetable/NN is/VBZ established/VBN to/TO determine/VB the/DT departure/NN and/CC arrival/NN times/NNS for/IN the/DT trains/NNS or/CC other/JJ rolling/VBG stock/NN at/IN the/DT different/JJ stations/NNS or/CC relevant/JJ points/NNS inside/IN the/DT rail/NN network/NN or/CC a/DT subset/NN of/IN this/DT network/NN ./.
The/DT elaboration/NN of/IN this/DT timetable/NN is/VBZ done/VBN to/TO respond/VB to/IN the/DT commercial/JJ requirements/NNS for/IN both/DT passenger/NN and/CC freight/NN traffic/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB it/PRP must/MD respect/VB a/DT set/NN of/IN security/NN and/CC capacity/NN constraints/NNS associated/VBN with/IN the/DT railway/NN network/NN ,/, rolling/VBG stock/NN and/CC legislation/NN ./.
Combining/VBG these/DT requirements/NNS and/CC constraints/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT important/JJ number/NN of/IN trains/NNS and/CC schedules/NNS to/TO plan/VB ,/, makes/VBZ the/DT preparation/NN of/IN a/DT feasible/JJ timetable/NN a/DT complex/NN and/CC time/NN -/HYPH consuming/VBG process/NN ,/, that/DT normally/RB takes/VBZ several/JJ months/NNS to/TO be/VB completed/VBN ./.
This/DT article/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN generating/VBG periodic/JJ timetables/NNS ,/, which/WDT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT involved/JJ trains/NNS operate/VBP in/IN a/DT recurrent/JJ pattern/NN ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, the/DT trains/NNS belonging/VBG to/IN the/DT same/JJ train/NN line/NN ,/, depart/VB from/IN some/DT station/NN every/DT 15/CD minutes/NNS or/CC one/CD hour/NN ./.
To/TO tackle/VB the/DT problem/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT constraint/NN -/HYPH based/VBN model/NN suitable/JJ for/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN problem/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, allowing/VBG a/DT rapid/JJ generation/NN of/IN feasible/JJ periodic/JJ timetables/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, two/CD case/NN studies/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN ,/, the/DT first/JJ ,/, describing/VBG a/DT sub-set/NN of/IN the/DT Netherlands/NNP rail/NN network/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT second/JJ a/DT large/JJ portion/NN of/IN the/DT Nord/NNP -/HYPH pas/NN -/HYPH de-Calais/JJ regional/JJ rail/NN network/NN ,/, both/DT of/IN them/PRP are/VBP then/RB solved/VBN using/VBG our/PRP$ algorithm/NN and/CC the/DT results/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN and/CC discussed/VBN ./.
