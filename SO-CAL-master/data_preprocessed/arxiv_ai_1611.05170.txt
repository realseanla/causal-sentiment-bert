Over/IN the/DT last/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, the/DT number/NN of/IN smart/JJ objects/NNS connected/VBN to/IN the/DT Internet/NN has/VBZ grown/VBN exponentially/RB in/IN comparison/NN to/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN services/NNS and/CC applications/NNS ./.
The/DT integration/NN between/IN Cloud/NNP Computing/NNP and/CC Internet/NNP of/IN Things/NNPS ,/, named/VBN as/IN Cloud/NN of/IN Things/NNS ,/, plays/VBZ a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN managing/VBG the/DT connected/JJ things/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ data/NNS and/CC services/NNS ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ challenges/NNS in/IN Cloud/NNP of/IN Things/NNPS is/VBZ the/DT resource/NN discovery/NN of/IN the/DT smart/JJ objects/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ reuse/VB in/IN different/JJ contexts/NNS ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT existent/JJ work/NN uses/VBZ some/DT kind/NN of/IN multi-criteria/JJ decision/NN analysis/NN algorithm/NN to/TO perform/VB the/DT resource/NN discovery/NN ,/, but/CC do/VBP not/RB evaluate/VB the/DT impact/NN that/WDT the/DT user/NN constraints/NNS has/VBZ in/IN the/DT final/JJ solution/NN ./.
