Qualitative/JJ probabilistic/JJ reasoning/NN in/IN a/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN often/RB reveals/VBZ tradeoffs/NNS :/: relationships/NNS that/WDT are/VBP ambiguous/JJ due/IN to/IN competing/VBG qualitative/JJ influences/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP two/CD techniques/NNS that/WDT combine/VBP qualitative/JJ and/CC numeric/JJ probabilistic/JJ reasoning/NN to/TO resolve/VB such/JJ tradeoffs/NNS ,/, inferring/VBG the/DT qualitative/JJ relationship/NN between/IN nodes/NNS in/IN a/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ approach/NN incrementally/RB marginalizes/VBZ nodes/NNS that/WDT contribute/VBP to/IN the/DT ambiguous/JJ qualitative/JJ relationships/NNS ./.
The/DT second/JJ approach/NN evaluates/VBZ approximate/JJ Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS for/IN bounds/NNS of/IN probability/NN distributions/NNS ,/, and/CC uses/VBZ these/DT bounds/NNS to/IN determinate/JJ qualitative/JJ relationships/NNS in/IN question/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN is/VBZ also/RB incremental/JJ in/IN that/IN the/DT algorithm/NN refines/VBZ the/DT state/NN spaces/NNS of/IN random/JJ variables/NNS for/IN tighter/JJR bounds/NNS until/IN the/DT qualitative/JJ relationships/NNS are/VBP resolved/VBN ./.
Both/DT approaches/NNS provide/VBP systematic/JJ methods/NNS for/IN tradeoff/NN resolution/NN at/IN potentially/RB lower/JJR computational/JJ cost/NN than/IN application/NN of/IN purely/RB numeric/JJ methods/NNS ./.
