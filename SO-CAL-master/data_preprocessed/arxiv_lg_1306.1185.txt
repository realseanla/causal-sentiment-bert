Ideas/NNS from/IN the/DT image/NN processing/NN literature/NN have/VBP recently/RB motivated/VBN a/DT new/JJ set/NN of/IN clustering/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT rely/VBP on/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN total/JJ variation/NN ./.
While/IN these/DT algorithms/NNS perform/VBP well/RB for/IN bi-partitioning/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ recursive/JJ extensions/NNS yield/VBP unimpressive/JJ results/NNS for/IN multiclass/NN clustering/NN tasks/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT general/JJ framework/NN for/IN multiclass/NN total/JJ variation/NN clustering/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB rely/VB on/IN recursion/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS greatly/RB outperform/VBP previous/JJ total/JJ variation/NN algorithms/NNS and/CC compare/VBP well/RB with/IN state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN NMF/NN approaches/NNS ./.
