This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ an/DT algorithm/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT calculation/NN of/IN confidence/NN measure/NN for/IN spoken/JJ term/NN detection/NN (/-LRB- STD/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Given/VBN an/DT input/NN query/NN term/NN ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN first/RB calculates/VBZ a/DT measurement/NN named/VBN document/NN ranking/VBG weight/NN for/IN each/DT document/NN in/IN the/DT speech/NN database/NN to/TO reflect/VB its/PRP$ relevance/NN with/IN the/DT query/NN term/NN by/IN summing/VBG all/PDT the/DT confidence/NN measures/NNS of/IN the/DT hypothesized/VBN term/NN occurrences/NNS in/IN this/DT document/NN ./.
The/DT confidence/NN measure/NN of/IN each/DT term/NN occurrence/NN is/VBZ then/RB re-estimated/VBN through/IN linear/JJ interpolation/NN with/IN the/DT calculated/VBN document/NN ranking/VBG weight/NN to/TO improve/VB its/PRP$ reliability/NN by/IN integrating/VBG document/NN -/HYPH level/NN information/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS are/VBP conducted/VBN on/IN three/CD standard/JJ STD/NN tasks/NNS for/IN Tamil/NNP ,/, Vietnamese/NNP and/CC English/NNP respectively/RB ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS all/RB demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN achieves/VBZ consistent/JJ improvements/NNS over/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN method/NN for/IN confidence/NN measure/NN calculation/NN ./.
