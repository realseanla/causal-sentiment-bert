This/DT report/NN provides/VBZ an/DT overview/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN deep/JJ learning/NN architectures/NNS and/CC optimisation/NN techniques/NNS ,/, and/CC uses/VBZ the/DT ADNI/NN hippocampus/NN MRI/NN dataset/NN as/IN an/DT example/NN to/TO compare/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN and/CC efficiency/NN of/IN different/JJ convolutional/JJ architectures/NNS on/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN patch/NN -/HYPH based/VBN 3/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ hippocampal/JJ segmentation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ important/JJ in/IN the/DT diagnosis/NN of/IN Alzheimer/NNP 's/POS Disease/NNP ./.
We/PRP found/VBD that/IN a/DT slightly/RB unconventional/JJ "/`` stacked/VBN 2D/NN "/'' approach/NN provides/VBZ much/RB better/JJR classification/NN performance/NN than/IN simple/JJ 2D/NN patches/NNS without/IN requiring/VBG significantly/RB more/RBR computational/JJ power/NN ./.
