The/DT K/NN -/HYPH nearest/JJS neighbor/NN (/-LRB- KNN/NN )/-RRB- classifier/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT simplest/JJS and/CC most/RBS common/JJ classifiers/NNS ,/, yet/CC its/PRP$ performance/NN competes/VBZ with/IN the/DT most/RBS complex/JJ classifiers/NNS in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
The/DT core/NN of/IN this/DT classifier/NN depends/VBZ mainly/RB on/IN measuring/VBG the/DT distance/NN or/CC similarity/NN between/IN the/DT tested/VBN example/NN and/CC the/DT training/NN examples/NNS ./.
This/DT raises/VBZ a/DT major/JJ question/NN about/IN which/WDT distance/NN measures/NNS to/TO be/VB used/VBN for/IN the/DT KNN/NNP classifier/NN among/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN distance/NN and/CC similarity/NN measures/NNS ?/.
This/DT review/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO answer/VB the/DT previous/JJ question/NN through/IN evaluating/VBG the/DT performance/NN (/-LRB- measured/VBN by/IN accuracy/NN ,/, precision/NN and/CC recall/NN )/-RRB- of/IN the/DT KNN/NN using/VBG a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN distance/NN measures/NNS ,/, tested/VBN on/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN real/JJ world/NN datasets/NNS ,/, with/IN and/CC without/IN adding/VBG different/JJ levels/NNS of/IN noise/NN ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT performance/NN of/IN KNN/NNP classifier/NN depends/VBZ significantly/RB on/IN the/DT distance/NN used/VBN ,/, the/DT results/NNS showed/VBD large/JJ gaps/NNS between/IN the/DT performances/NNS of/IN different/JJ distances/NNS ./.
We/PRP found/VBD that/IN a/DT recently/RB proposed/VBN non-convex/JJ distance/NN performed/VBD the/DT best/JJS when/WRB applied/VBN on/IN most/JJS datasets/NNS comparing/VBG to/IN the/DT other/JJ tested/JJ distances/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT KNN/NN degraded/VBN only/RB about/RB $/$ 20/CD \/SYM percent/NN $/$ while/IN the/DT noise/NN level/NN reaches/VBZ $/$ 90/CD \/SYM percent/NN $/$ ,/, this/DT is/VBZ true/JJ for/IN all/PDT the/DT distances/NNS used/VBN ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN the/DT KNN/NNP classifier/NN using/VBG any/DT of/IN the/DT top/JJ $/$ 10/CD $/$ distances/NNS tolerate/VBP noise/NN to/IN a/DT certain/JJ degree/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT results/NNS show/VBP that/IN some/DT distances/NNS are/VBP less/RBR affected/VBN by/IN the/DT added/VBN noise/NN comparing/VBG to/IN other/JJ distances/NNS ./.
