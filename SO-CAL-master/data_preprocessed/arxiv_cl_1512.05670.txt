About/RB 1115/CD rules/NNS in/IN Astadhyayi/NNP from/IN A./NNP 4.1.76/CD to/IN A./NNP 5.4.160/CD deal/NN with/IN generation/NN of/IN derivative/JJ nouns/NNS ,/, making/VBG it/PRP one/CD of/IN the/DT largest/JJS topical/JJ sections/NNS in/IN Astadhyayi/NNP ,/, called/VBN as/IN the/DT Taddhita/NNP section/NN owing/VBG to/IN the/DT head/NN rule/NN A./NNP 4.1.76/CD ./.
This/DT section/NN is/VBZ a/DT systematic/JJ arrangement/NN of/IN rules/NNS that/WDT enumerates/VBZ various/JJ affixes/VBZ that/DT are/VBP used/VBN in/IN the/DT derivation/NN under/IN specific/JJ semantic/JJ relations/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT system/NN that/WDT automates/VBZ the/DT process/NN of/IN generation/NN of/IN derivative/JJ nouns/NNS as/IN per/IN the/DT rules/NNS in/IN Astadhyayi/NNP ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN system/NN follows/VBZ a/DT completely/RB object/VBP oriented/VBN approach/NN ,/, that/IN models/NNS each/DT rule/NN as/IN a/DT class/NN of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ and/CC then/RB groups/NNS them/PRP as/IN rule/NN groups/NNS ./.
The/DT rule/NN groups/NNS are/VBP decided/VBN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN selective/JJ grouping/NN of/IN rules/NNS by/IN virtue/NN of/IN anuvrtti/NN ./.
The/DT grouping/NN of/IN rules/NNS results/VBZ in/IN an/DT inheritance/NN network/NN of/IN rules/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT directed/VBN acyclic/JJ graph/NN ./.
Every/DT rule/NN group/NN has/VBZ a/DT head/NN rule/NN and/CC the/DT head/NN rule/NN notifies/VBZ all/PDT the/DT direct/JJ member/NN rules/NNS of/IN the/DT group/NN about/IN the/DT environment/NN which/WDT contains/VBZ all/PDT the/DT details/NNS about/IN data/NNS entities/NNS ,/, participating/VBG in/IN the/DT derivation/NN process/NN ./.
The/DT system/NN implements/VBZ this/DT mechanism/NN using/VBG multilevel/JJ inheritance/NN and/CC observer/NN design/NN patterns/NNS ./.
The/DT system/NN focuses/VBZ not/RB only/RB on/IN generation/NN of/IN the/DT desired/VBN final/JJ form/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB on/IN the/DT correctness/NN of/IN sequence/NN of/IN rules/NNS applied/VBN to/TO make/VB sure/JJ that/IN the/DT derivation/NN has/VBZ taken/VBN place/NN in/IN strict/JJ adherence/NN to/IN Astadhyayi/NNP ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN system/NN 's/POS design/NN allows/VBZ to/TO incorporate/VB various/JJ conflict/NN resolution/NN methods/NNS mentioned/VBN in/IN authentic/JJ texts/NNS and/CC hence/RB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN those/DT rules/NNS can/MD be/VB validated/VBN with/IN the/DT results/NNS from/IN the/DT system/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB present/JJ cases/NNS where/WRB we/PRP have/VBP checked/VBN the/DT applicability/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN with/IN the/DT rules/NNS which/WDT are/VBP not/RB specifically/RB applicable/JJ to/IN derivation/NN of/IN derivative/JJ nouns/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO see/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN schema/NN as/IN a/DT generic/JJ system/NN for/IN modeling/VBG Astadhyayi/NNP ./.
