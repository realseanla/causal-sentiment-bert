One/CD particular/JJ challenge/NN in/IN AI/NN is/VBZ the/DT computational/JJ modelling/NN and/CC simulation/NN of/IN creativity/NN ./.
Feedback/NN and/CC learning/NN from/IN experience/NN are/VBP key/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT creative/JJ process/NN ./.
Here/RB we/PRP investigate/VB how/WRB we/PRP could/MD implement/VB feedback/NN in/IN creative/JJ systems/NNS using/VBG a/DT social/JJ model/NN ./.
From/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN creative/JJ writing/NN we/PRP borrow/VBP the/DT concept/NN of/IN a/DT Writers/NNP Workshop/NNP as/IN a/DT model/NN for/IN learning/VBG through/IN feedback/NN ./.
The/DT Writers/NNPS Workshop/NNP encourages/VBZ examination/NN ,/, discussion/NN and/CC debates/NNS of/IN a/DT piece/NN of/IN creative/JJ work/NN using/VBG a/DT prescribed/VBN format/NN of/IN activities/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT computational/JJ model/NN of/IN the/DT Writers/NNPS Workshop/NNP as/IN a/DT roadmap/NN for/IN incorporation/NN of/IN feedback/NN in/IN artificial/JJ creativity/NN systems/NNS ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT Writers/NNPS Workshop/NNP setting/VBG describes/VBZ the/DT anatomy/NN of/IN the/DT creative/JJ process/NN ./.
We/PRP support/VBP our/PRP$ claim/NN with/IN a/DT case/NN study/NN that/WDT describes/VBZ how/WRB to/TO implement/VB the/DT Writers/NNPS Workshop/NNP model/NN in/IN a/DT computational/JJ creativity/NN system/NN ./.
