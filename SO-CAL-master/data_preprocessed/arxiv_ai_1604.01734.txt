In/IN fair/JJ division/NN of/IN indivisible/JJ goods/NNS ,/, using/VBG sequences/NNS of/IN sincere/JJ choices/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC picking/VBG sequences/NNS )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ way/NN to/TO allocate/VB the/DT objects/NNS ./.
The/DT idea/NN is/VBZ the/DT following/VBG :/: at/IN each/DT stage/NN ,/, a/DT designated/VBN agent/NN picks/VBZ one/CD object/NN among/IN those/DT that/WDT remain/VBP ./.
This/DT paper/NN ,/, restricted/VBN to/IN the/DT case/NN where/WRB the/DT agents/NNS have/VBP numerical/JJ additive/JJ preferences/NNS over/IN objects/NNS ,/, revisits/VBZ to/IN some/DT extent/NN the/DT seminal/JJ paper/NN by/IN Brams/NNP and/CC King/NNP [/-LRB- 9/CD ]/-RRB- which/WDT was/VBD specific/JJ to/IN ordinal/JJ and/CC linear/JJ order/NN preferences/NNS over/IN items/NNS ./.
We/PRP point/VBP out/RP similarities/NNS and/CC differences/NNS with/IN this/DT latter/JJ context/NN ./.

This/DT asymmetry/NN leads/VBZ naturally/RB to/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN a/DT "/`` scale/NN of/IN efficiency/NN "/'' having/VBG three/CD steps/NNS :/: Pareto/NN -/HYPH optimality/NN ,/, sequenceability/NN without/IN Pareto/NN -/HYPH optimality/NN ,/, and/CC non-sequenceability/NN ./.
