A/DT scheme/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN for/IN learning/VBG connectivity/NN in/IN spiking/VBG neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
The/DT scheme/NN learns/VBZ instantaneous/JJ firing/NN rates/NNS that/WDT are/VBP conditional/JJ on/IN the/DT activity/NN in/IN other/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
The/DT scheme/NN is/VBZ independent/JJ of/IN the/DT choice/NN of/IN neuron/NN dynamics/NNS or/CC activation/NN function/NN ,/, and/CC network/NN architecture/NN ./.
