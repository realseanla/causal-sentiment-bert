Dynamic/JJ programming/NN algorithms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN successfully/RB applied/VBN to/IN propositional/JJ stochastic/JJ planning/NN problems/NNS by/IN using/VBG compact/JJ representations/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ algebraic/JJ decision/NN diagrams/NNS ,/, to/TO capture/VB domain/NN dynamics/NNS and/CC value/NN functions/NNS ./.
Work/VB on/IN symbolic/JJ dynamic/JJ programming/NN lifted/VBD these/DT ideas/NNS to/TO first/RB order/VB logic/NN using/VBG several/JJ representation/NN schemes/NNS ./.
Recent/JJ work/NN introduced/VBD a/DT first/JJ order/NN variant/NN of/IN decision/NN diagrams/NNS (/-LRB- FODD/NN )/-RRB- and/CC developed/VBD a/DT value/NN iteration/NN algorithm/NN for/IN this/DT representation/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN develops/VBZ several/JJ improvements/NNS to/IN the/DT FODD/NNP algorithm/NN that/WDT make/VBP the/DT approach/NN practical/JJ ./.
These/DT include/VBP ,/, new/JJ reduction/NN operators/NNS that/WDT decrease/VBP the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT representation/NN ,/, several/JJ speedup/NN techniques/NNS ,/, and/CC techniques/NNS for/IN value/NN approximation/NN ./.
Incorporating/VBG these/DT ,/, the/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT planning/NN system/NN ,/, FODD/NN -/HYPH Planner/NN ,/, for/IN solving/VBG relational/JJ stochastic/JJ planning/NN problems/NNS ./.
The/DT system/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN on/IN several/JJ domains/NNS ,/, including/VBG problems/NNS from/IN the/DT recent/JJ international/JJ planning/NN competition/NN ,/, and/CC shows/VBZ competitive/JJ performance/NN with/IN top/JJ ranking/VBG systems/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ demonstration/NN of/IN feasibility/NN of/IN this/DT approach/NN and/CC it/PRP shows/VBZ that/IN abstraction/NN through/IN compact/JJ representation/NN is/VBZ a/DT promising/JJ approach/NN to/IN stochastic/JJ planning/NN ./.
