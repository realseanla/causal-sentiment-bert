This/DT approach/NN represents/VBZ human/JJ behaviour/NN with/IN probabilistic/JJ cause/NN -/HYPH effect/NN relations/NNS based/VBN on/IN knowledge/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB with/IN conditional/JJ probabilities/NNS coming/VBG either/RB from/IN knowledge/NN or/CC deduced/VBN from/IN observations/NNS ./.
This/DT approach/NN has/VBZ been/VBN applied/VBN to/IN the/DT co-simulation/NN of/IN the/DT CO2/NN concentration/NN in/IN an/DT office/NN coupled/VBN with/IN human/JJ behaviour/NN ./.
