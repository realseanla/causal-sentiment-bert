There/EX are/VBP many/JJ goals/NNS for/IN an/DT AI/NN that/WDT could/MD become/VB dangerous/JJ if/IN the/DT AI/NN becomes/VBZ superintelligent/JJ or/CC otherwise/RB powerful/JJ ./.
Much/JJ work/NN on/IN the/DT AI/NN control/NN problem/NN has/VBZ been/VBN focused/VBN on/IN constructing/VBG AI/NN goals/NNS that/WDT are/VBP safe/JJ even/RB for/IN such/JJ AIs/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN looks/VBZ at/IN an/DT alternative/JJ approach/NN :/: defining/VBG a/DT general/JJ concept/NN of/IN `/`` low/JJ impact/NN '/'' ./.
The/DT aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO ensure/VB that/IN a/DT powerful/JJ AI/NN which/WDT implements/VBZ low/JJ impact/NN will/MD not/RB modify/VB the/DT world/NN extensively/RB ,/, even/RB if/IN it/PRP is/VBZ given/VBN a/DT simple/JJ or/CC dangerous/JJ goal/NN ./.
The/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ various/JJ ways/NNS of/IN defining/VBG and/CC grounding/VBG low/JJ impact/NN ,/, and/CC discusses/VBZ methods/NNS for/IN ensuring/VBG that/IN the/DT AI/NN can/MD still/RB be/VB allowed/VBN to/TO have/VB a/DT (/-LRB- desired/VBN )/-RRB- impact/NN despite/IN the/DT restriction/NN ./.
The/DT end/NN of/IN the/DT paper/NN addresses/NNS known/VBN issues/NNS with/IN this/DT approach/NN and/CC avenues/NNS for/IN future/JJ research/NN ./.
