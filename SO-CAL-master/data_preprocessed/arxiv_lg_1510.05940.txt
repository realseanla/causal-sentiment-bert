Probabilistic/JJ linear/JJ discriminant/JJ analysis/NN (/-LRB- PLDA/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ among/IN the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ methods/NNS that/WDT accompany/VBP the/DT i/NN -/HYPH vector/NN model/NN to/TO deliver/VB state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN performance/NN for/IN speaker/NN recognition/NN ./.
