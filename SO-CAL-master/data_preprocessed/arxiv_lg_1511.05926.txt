The/DT last/JJ decade/NN has/VBZ witnessed/VBN the/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT traditional/JJ feature/NN -/HYPH based/VBN method/NN on/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT discrete/JJ structures/NNS such/JJ as/IN words/NNS or/CC lexical/JJ patterns/NNS to/TO extract/VB relations/NNS from/IN text/NN ./.
Recently/RB ,/, convolutional/JJ and/CC recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS has/VBZ provided/VBN very/RB effective/JJ mechanisms/NNS to/TO capture/VB the/DT hidden/JJ structures/NNS within/IN sentences/NNS via/IN continuous/JJ representations/NNS ,/, thereby/RB significantly/RB advancing/VBG the/DT performance/NN of/IN relation/NN extraction/NN ./.
The/DT advantage/NN of/IN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS is/VBZ their/PRP$ capacity/NN to/TO generalize/VB the/DT consecutive/JJ k/NN -/HYPH grams/NNS in/IN the/DT sentences/NNS while/IN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS are/VBP effective/JJ to/TO encode/VB long/JJ ranges/NNS of/IN sentence/NN context/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ to/TO combine/VB the/DT traditional/JJ feature/NN -/HYPH based/VBN method/NN ,/, the/DT convolutional/JJ and/CC recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS to/TO simultaneously/RB benefit/VB from/IN their/PRP$ advantages/NNS ./.
