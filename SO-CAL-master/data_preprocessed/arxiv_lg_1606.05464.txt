Stance/NN detection/NN is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN classifying/VBG the/DT attitude/NN expressed/VBN in/IN a/DT text/NN towards/IN a/DT target/NN such/JJ as/IN "/`` Climate/NNP Change/NNP is/VBZ a/DT Real/JJ Concern/NN "/'' to/TO be/VB "/`` positive/JJ "/'' ,/, "/`` negative/JJ "/'' or/CC "/`` neutral/JJ "/'' ./.
Previous/JJ work/NN has/VBZ assumed/VBN that/IN either/CC the/DT target/NN is/VBZ mentioned/VBN in/IN the/DT text/NN or/CC that/IN training/NN data/NNS for/IN every/DT target/NN is/VBZ given/VBN ./.
This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ the/DT more/RBR challenging/JJ version/NN of/IN this/DT task/NN ,/, where/WRB targets/NNS are/VBP not/RB always/RB mentioned/VBN and/CC no/DT training/NN data/NNS is/VBZ available/JJ for/IN the/DT test/NN targets/NNS ./.
We/PRP experiment/VBP with/IN conditional/JJ LSTM/NN encoding/VBG ,/, which/WDT builds/VBZ a/DT representation/NN of/IN the/DT tweet/NN that/WDT is/VBZ dependent/JJ on/IN the/DT target/NN ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP that/IN it/PRP outperforms/VBZ the/DT independent/JJ encoding/NN of/IN tweet/NN and/CC target/NN ./.
Performance/NN improves/VBZ even/RB further/RB when/WRB the/DT conditional/JJ model/NN is/VBZ augmented/VBN with/IN bidirectional/JJ encoding/NN ./.
The/DT method/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN on/IN the/DT SemEval/NNP 2016/CD Task/NNP 6/CD Twitter/NNP Stance/NN Detection/NN corpus/NN and/CC achieves/VBZ performance/NN second/RB best/JJS only/RB to/IN a/DT system/NN trained/VBN on/IN semi-automatically/RB labelled/VBN tweets/NNS for/IN the/DT test/NN target/NN ./.
When/WRB such/JJ weak/JJ supervision/NN is/VBZ added/VBN ,/, our/PRP$ approach/NN achieves/VBZ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN results/NNS ./.
