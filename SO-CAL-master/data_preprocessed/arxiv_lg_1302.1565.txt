Bayesian/JJ approaches/NNS to/TO learn/VB the/DT graphical/JJ structure/NN of/IN Bayesian/JJ Belief/NN Networks/NNS (/-LRB- BBNs/NNS )/-RRB- from/IN databases/NNS share/VBP the/DT assumption/NN that/IN the/DT database/NN is/VBZ complete/JJ ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, no/DT entry/NN is/VBZ reported/VBN as/IN unknown/JJ ./.
Attempts/NNS to/TO relax/VB this/DT assumption/NN involve/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN expensive/JJ iterative/JJ methods/NNS to/TO discriminate/VB among/IN different/JJ structures/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT deterministic/JJ method/NN to/TO learn/VB the/DT graphical/JJ structure/NN of/IN a/DT BBN/NNP from/IN a/DT possibly/RB incomplete/JJ database/NN ./.
