Previous/JJ research/NN on/IN relation/NN classification/NN has/VBZ verified/VBN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN using/VBG dependency/NN shortest/JJS paths/NNS or/CC subtrees/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP further/RB explore/VB how/WRB to/TO make/VB full/JJ use/NN of/IN the/DT combination/NN of/IN these/DT dependency/NN information/NN ./.
We/PRP first/RB propose/VB a/DT new/JJ structure/NN ,/, termed/VBN augmented/VBN dependency/NN path/NN (/-LRB- ADP/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN the/DT shortest/JJS dependency/NN path/NN between/IN two/CD entities/NNS and/CC the/DT subtrees/NNS attached/VBN to/IN the/DT shortest/JJS path/NN ./.
To/TO exploit/VB the/DT semantic/JJ representation/NN behind/IN the/DT ADP/NN structure/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP dependency/NN -/HYPH based/VBN neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- DepNN/NN )/-RRB- :/: a/DT recursive/JJ neural/JJ network/NN designed/VBN to/TO model/VB the/DT subtrees/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN to/TO capture/VB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ features/NNS on/IN the/DT shortest/JJS path/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN the/DT SemEval/NNP -/HYPH 2010/CD dataset/NN show/NN that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/JJ method/NN achieves/VBZ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH art/NN results/NNS ./.
