This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT new/JJ method/NN for/IN solving/VBG Bayesian/JJ decision/NN problems/NNS ./.
The/DT method/NN consists/VBZ of/IN representing/VBG a/DT Bayesian/JJ decision/NN problem/NN as/IN a/DT valuation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN system/NN and/CC applying/VBG a/DT fusion/NN algorithm/NN for/IN solving/VBG it/PRP ./.
The/DT fusion/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ a/DT hybrid/NN of/IN local/JJ computational/JJ methods/NNS for/IN computation/NN of/IN marginals/NNS of/IN joint/JJ probability/NN distributions/NNS and/CC the/DT local/JJ computational/JJ methods/NNS for/IN discrete/JJ optimization/NN problems/NNS ./.
