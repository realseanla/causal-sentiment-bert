Texture/NN classification/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT problems/NNS which/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN paid/VBN much/JJ attention/NN on/IN by/IN computer/NN scientists/NNS since/IN late/JJ 90s/NNS ./.
If/IN texture/NN classification/NN is/VBZ done/VBN correctly/RB and/CC accurately/RB ,/, it/PRP can/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS such/JJ as/IN Pattern/NN recognition/NN ,/, object/NN tracking/NN ,/, and/CC shape/NN recognition/NN ./.
So/RB far/RB ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN so/RB many/JJ methods/NNS offered/VBN to/TO solve/VB this/DT problem/NN ./.
Near/NNP all/PDT these/DT methods/NNS have/VBP tried/VBN to/TO extract/VB and/CC define/VB features/NNS to/TO separate/VB different/JJ labels/NNS of/IN textures/NNS really/RB well/RB ./.
This/DT article/NN has/VBZ offered/VBN an/DT approach/NN which/WDT has/VBZ an/DT overall/JJ process/NN on/IN the/DT images/NNS of/IN textures/NNS based/VBN on/IN Local/JJ binary/JJ pattern/NN and/CC Gray/NNP Level/NNP Co-occurrence/NN matrix/NN and/CC then/RB by/IN edge/NN detection/NN ,/, and/CC finally/RB ,/, extracting/VBG the/DT statistical/JJ features/NNS from/IN the/DT images/NNS would/MD classify/VB them/PRP ./.
Although/IN ,/, this/DT approach/NN is/VBZ a/DT general/JJ one/NN and/CC is/VBZ could/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN different/JJ applications/NNS ,/, the/DT method/NN has/VBZ been/VBN tested/VBN on/IN the/DT stone/NN texture/NN and/CC the/DT results/NNS have/VBP been/VBN compared/VBN with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT previous/JJ approaches/NNS to/TO prove/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN proposed/VBN approach/NN ./.
