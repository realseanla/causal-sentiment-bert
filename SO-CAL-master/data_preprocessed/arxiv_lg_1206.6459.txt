Cointegration/NNP is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ topic/NN for/IN time/NN -/HYPH series/NN ,/, and/CC describes/VBZ a/DT relationship/NN between/IN two/CD series/NNS in/IN which/WDT a/DT linear/JJ combination/NN is/VBZ stationary/JJ ./.
Classically/RB ,/, the/DT test/NN for/IN cointegration/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN a/DT two/CD stage/NN process/NN in/IN which/WDT first/RB the/DT linear/JJ relation/NN between/IN the/DT series/NN is/VBZ estimated/VBN by/IN Ordinary/JJ Least/JJS Squares/NNS ./.
Subsequently/RB a/DT unit/NN root/NN test/NN is/VBZ performed/VBN on/IN the/DT residuals/NNS ./.
A/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN deficiency/NN of/IN this/DT classical/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP can/MD lead/VB to/IN erroneous/JJ conclusions/NNS about/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN cointegration/NN ./.
As/IN an/DT alternative/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT framework/NN for/IN estimating/VBG whether/IN cointegration/NN exists/VBZ using/VBG Bayesian/JJ inference/NN which/WDT is/VBZ empirically/RB superior/JJ to/IN the/DT classical/JJ approach/NN ./.
