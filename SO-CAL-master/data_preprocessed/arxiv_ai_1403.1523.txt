Alignment/NN -/HYPH free/JJ sequence/NN analysis/NN approaches/NNS provide/VBP important/JJ alternatives/NNS over/IN multiple/JJ sequence/NN alignment/NN (/-LRB- MSA/NNP )/-RRB- in/IN biological/JJ sequence/NN analysis/NN because/IN alignment/NN -/HYPH free/JJ approaches/NNS have/VBP low/JJ computation/NN complexity/NN and/CC are/VBP not/RB dependent/JJ on/IN high/JJ level/NN of/IN sequence/NN identity/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT existing/VBG alignment/NN -/HYPH free/JJ methods/NNS do/VBP not/RB employ/VB true/JJ full/JJ information/NN content/NN of/IN sequences/NNS and/CC thus/RB can/MD not/RB accurately/RB reveal/VB similarities/NNS and/CC differences/NNS among/IN DNA/NN sequences/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ alignment/NN -/HYPH free/JJ computational/JJ method/NN for/IN sequence/NN analysis/NN based/VBN on/IN Ramanujan/NNP -/HYPH Fourier/NNP transform/VB (/-LRB- RFT/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, in/IN which/WDT complete/JJ information/NN of/IN DNA/NN sequences/NNS is/VBZ retained/VBN ./.
We/PRP represent/VBP DNA/NN sequences/NNS as/IN four/CD binary/JJ indicator/NN sequences/NNS and/CC apply/VB RFT/NN on/IN the/DT indicator/NN sequences/NNS to/TO convert/VB them/PRP into/IN frequency/NN domain/NN ./.
The/DT Euclidean/JJ distance/NN of/IN the/DT complete/JJ RFT/NN coefficients/NNS of/IN DNA/NN sequences/NNS are/VBP used/VBN as/IN similarity/NN measure/NN ./.
To/TO address/VB the/DT different/JJ lengths/NNS in/IN Euclidean/NNP space/NN of/IN RFT/NN coefficients/NNS ,/, we/PRP pad/VBP zeros/NNS to/IN short/JJ DNA/NN binary/NN sequences/NNS so/IN that/IN the/DT binary/JJ sequences/NNS equal/VBP the/DT longest/JJS length/NN in/IN the/DT comparison/NN sequence/NN data/NNS ./.
