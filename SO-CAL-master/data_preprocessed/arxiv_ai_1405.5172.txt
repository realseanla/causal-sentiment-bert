Electromagnetismlike/NNP Optimization/NN (/-LRB- EMO/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT global/JJ optimization/NN algorithm/NN ,/, particularly/RB well/RB suited/JJ to/TO solve/VB problems/NNS featuring/VBG nonlinear/JJ and/CC multimodal/JJ cost/NN functions/NNS ./.
EMO/NNP employs/VBZ searcher/NN agents/NNS that/WDT emulate/VBP a/DT population/NN of/IN charged/VBN particles/NNS which/WDT interact/VBP to/IN each/DT other/JJ according/VBG to/IN electromagnetisms/NNS laws/NNS of/IN attraction/NN and/CC repulsion/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, EMO/NNP usually/RB requires/VBZ a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN iterations/NNS for/IN a/DT local/JJ search/NN procedure/NN ;/: any/DT reduction/NN or/CC cancelling/VBG over/IN such/JJ number/NN ,/, critically/RB perturb/VB other/JJ issues/NNS such/JJ as/IN convergence/NN ,/, exploration/NN ,/, population/NN diversity/NN and/CC accuracy/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ an/DT enhanced/VBN EMO/NN algorithm/NN called/VBN OBEMO/NNP ,/, which/WDT employs/VBZ the/DT Opposition/NN -/HYPH Based/VBN Learning/NNP (/-LRB- OBL/NNP )/-RRB- approach/NN to/TO accelerate/VB the/DT global/JJ convergence/NN speed/NN ./.
OBL/NNP is/VBZ a/DT machine/NN intelligence/NN strategy/NN which/WDT considers/VBZ the/DT current/JJ candidate/NN solution/NN and/CC its/PRP$ opposite/JJ value/NN at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, achieving/VBG a/DT faster/RBR exploration/NN of/IN the/DT search/NN space/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN OBEMO/NN method/NN significantly/RB reduces/VBZ the/DT required/VBN computational/JJ effort/NN yet/RB avoiding/VBG any/DT detriment/NN to/IN the/DT good/JJ search/NN capabilities/NNS of/IN the/DT original/JJ EMO/NNP algorithm/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS are/VBP conducted/VBN over/IN a/DT comprehensive/JJ set/NN of/IN benchmark/NN functions/NNS ,/, showing/VBG that/IN OBEMO/NNP obtains/VBZ promising/JJ performance/NN for/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT discussed/VBN test/NN problems/NNS ./.
