Document/NN clustering/NN as/IN an/DT unsupervised/JJ approach/NN extensively/RB used/VBN to/TO navigate/VB ,/, filter/NN ,/, summarize/VB and/CC manage/VB large/JJ collection/NN of/IN document/NN repositories/NNS like/IN the/DT World/NN Wide/JJ Web/NN (/-LRB- WWW/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Recently/RB ,/, focuses/VBZ in/IN this/DT domain/NN shifted/VBD from/IN traditional/JJ vector/NN based/VBN document/NN similarity/NN for/IN clustering/NN to/IN suffix/NN tree/NN based/VBN document/NN similarity/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP offers/VBZ more/JJR semantic/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT text/NN present/NN in/IN the/DT document/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP compare/VBP and/CC contrast/NN two/CD recently/RB introduced/VBN approaches/NNS to/IN document/NN clustering/NN based/VBN on/IN suffix/NN tree/NN data/NNS model/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ an/DT Efficient/JJ Phrase/NN based/VBN document/NN clustering/NN ,/, which/WDT extracts/NNS phrases/NNS from/IN documents/NNS to/TO form/VB compact/JJ document/NN representation/NN and/CC uses/VBZ a/DT similarity/NN measure/NN based/VBN on/IN common/JJ suffix/NN tree/NN to/IN cluster/NN the/DT documents/NNS ./.
The/DT second/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ a/DT frequent/JJ word/NN //HYPH word/NN meaning/NN sequence/NN based/VBN document/NN clustering/NN ,/, it/PRP similarly/RB extracts/NNS the/DT common/JJ word/NN sequence/NN from/IN the/DT document/NN and/CC uses/VBZ the/DT common/JJ sequence/NN //HYPH common/JJ word/NN meaning/NN sequence/NN to/TO perform/VB the/DT compact/JJ representation/NN ,/, and/CC finally/RB ,/, it/PRP uses/VBZ document/NN clustering/NN approach/NN to/IN cluster/NN the/DT compact/JJ documents/NNS ./.
These/DT algorithms/NNS are/VBP using/VBG agglomerative/JJ hierarchical/JJ document/NN clustering/NN to/TO perform/VB the/DT actual/JJ clustering/NN step/NN ,/, the/DT difference/NN in/IN these/DT approaches/NNS are/VBP mainly/RB based/VBN on/IN extraction/NN of/IN phrases/NNS ,/, model/NN representation/NN as/IN a/DT compact/JJ document/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT similarity/NN measures/NNS used/VBN for/IN clustering/NN ./.
