We/PRP tackle/VBP the/DT fundamental/JJ problem/NN of/IN Bayesian/JJ active/JJ learning/NN with/IN noise/NN ,/, where/WRB we/PRP need/VBP to/TO adaptively/RB select/VB from/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN expensive/JJ tests/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO identify/VB an/DT unknown/JJ hypothesis/NN sampled/VBN from/IN a/DT known/VBN prior/JJ distribution/NN ./.
