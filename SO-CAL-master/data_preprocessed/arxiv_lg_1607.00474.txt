A/DT neighborhood/NN graph/NN ,/, which/WDT represents/VBZ the/DT instances/NNS as/IN vertices/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ relations/NNS as/IN weighted/JJ edges/NNS ,/, is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN of/IN many/JJ semi-supervised/VBN and/CC relational/JJ models/NNS for/IN node/NN labeling/NN and/CC link/NN prediction/NN ./.
Most/JJS methods/NNS employ/VBP a/DT sequential/JJ process/NN to/TO construct/VB the/DT neighborhood/NN graph/NN ./.
This/DT process/NN often/RB consists/VBZ of/IN generating/VBG a/DT candidate/NN graph/NN ,/, pruning/NN the/DT candidate/NN graph/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT neighborhood/NN graph/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB performing/VBG inference/NN on/IN the/DT variables/NNS (/-LRB- i.e./FW ,/, nodes/NNS )/-RRB- in/IN the/DT neighborhood/NN graph/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT framework/NN that/WDT can/MD dynamically/RB adapt/VB the/DT neighborhood/NN graph/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT states/NNS of/IN variables/NNS from/IN intermediate/JJ inference/NN results/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN structural/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT relations/NNS connecting/VBG them/PRP ./.
A/DT key/JJ strength/NN of/IN our/PRP$ framework/NN is/VBZ its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO handle/VB multi-relational/JJ data/NNS and/CC employ/VB varying/VBG amounts/NNS of/IN relations/NNS for/IN each/DT instance/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT intermediate/JJ inference/NN results/NNS ./.
We/PRP formulate/VBP the/DT link/NN prediction/NN task/NN as/IN inference/NN on/IN neighborhood/NN graphs/NNS ,/, and/CC include/VBP preliminary/JJ results/NNS illustrating/VBG the/DT effects/NNS of/IN different/JJ strategies/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN framework/NN ./.
