Many/JJ formalisms/NNS combining/VBG ontology/NN languages/NNS with/IN uncertainty/NN ,/, usually/RB in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN probabilities/NNS ,/, have/VBP been/VBN studied/VBN over/IN the/DT years/NNS ./.
Most/JJS of/IN these/DT formalisms/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, assume/VB that/IN the/DT probabilistic/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT knowledge/NN remains/VBZ static/JJ over/IN time/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT general/JJ approach/NN for/IN extending/VBG ontology/NN languages/NNS to/TO handle/VB time/NN -/HYPH evolving/VBG uncertainty/NN represented/VBN by/IN a/DT dynamic/JJ Bayesian/JJ network/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP how/WRB reasoning/NN in/IN the/DT original/JJ language/NN and/CC dynamic/JJ Bayesian/JJ inferences/NNS can/MD be/VB exploited/VBN for/IN effective/JJ reasoning/NN in/IN our/PRP$ framework/NN ./.
