In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN recovering/VBG a/DT matrix/NN ,/, with/IN inherent/JJ low/JJ rank/NN structure/NN ,/, from/IN its/PRP$ lower/JJR dimensional/JJ projections/NNS ./.
This/DT problem/NN is/VBZ frequently/RB encountered/VBN in/IN wide/JJ range/NN of/IN areas/NNS including/VBG pattern/NN recognition/NN ,/, wireless/JJ sensor/NN networks/NNS ,/, control/NN systems/NNS ,/, recommender/NN systems/NNS ,/, image/NN //HYPH video/NN reconstruction/NN etc/FW ./.
Both/CC in/IN theory/NN and/CC practice/NN ,/, the/DT most/RBS optimal/JJ way/NN to/TO solve/VB the/DT low/JJ rank/NN matrix/NN recovery/NN problem/NN is/VBZ via/IN nuclear/JJ norm/NN minimization/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT Split/NNP Bregman/NNP algorithm/NN for/IN nuclear/JJ norm/NN minimization/NN ./.
The/DT use/NN of/IN Bregman/NNP technique/NN improves/VBZ the/DT convergence/NN speed/NN of/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN and/CC gives/VBZ a/DT higher/JJR success/NN rate/NN ./.
Also/RB ,/, the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN reconstruction/NN is/VBZ much/RB better/JJR even/RB for/IN cases/NNS where/WRB small/JJ number/NN of/IN linear/JJ measurements/NNS are/VBP available/JJ ./.
Our/PRP$ claim/NN is/VBZ supported/VBN by/IN empirical/JJ results/NNS obtained/VBN using/VBG our/PRP$ algorithm/NN and/CC its/PRP$ comparison/NN to/IN other/JJ existing/VBG methods/NNS for/IN matrix/NN recovery/NN ./.
The/DT algorithms/NNS are/VBP compared/VBN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN NMSE/NNP ,/, execution/NN time/NN and/CC success/NN rate/NN for/IN varying/VBG ranks/NNS and/CC sampling/NN ratios/NNS ./.
