We/PRP study/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN identifying/VBG the/DT top/JJ $/$ m/CD $/$ arms/NNS in/IN a/DT multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN game/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/VBN solution/NN relies/VBZ on/IN a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN successive/JJ rejects/VBZ of/IN the/DT seemingly/RB bad/JJ arms/NNS ,/, and/CC successive/JJ accepts/VBZ of/IN the/DT good/JJ ones/NNS ./.
This/DT algorithmic/JJ contribution/NN allows/VBZ to/TO tackle/VB other/JJ multiple/JJ identifications/NNS settings/NNS that/WDT were/VBD previously/RB out/IN of/IN reach/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ we/PRP show/VBP that/IN this/DT idea/NN of/IN successive/JJ accepts/VBZ and/CC rejects/VBZ applies/VBZ to/IN the/DT multi-bandit/NN best/JJS arm/NN identification/NN problem/NN ./.
