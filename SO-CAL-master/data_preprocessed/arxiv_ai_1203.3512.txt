Markov/NNP Networks/NNPS are/VBP widely/RB used/VBN through/IN out/IN computer/NN vision/NN and/CC machine/NN learning/NN ./.
An/DT important/JJ subclass/NN are/VBP the/DT Associative/JJ Markov/NNP Networks/NNS which/WDT are/VBP used/VBN in/IN a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN applications/NNS ./.
For/IN these/DT networks/NNS a/DT good/JJ approximate/JJ minimum/JJ cost/NN solution/NN can/MD be/VB found/VBN efficiently/RB using/VBG graph/NN cut/NN based/VBN move/NN making/VBG algorithms/NNS such/JJ as/IN alpha/NN -/HYPH expansion/NN ./.
Recently/RB a/DT related/JJ model/NN has/VBZ been/VBN proposed/VBN ,/, the/DT associative/JJ hierarchical/JJ network/NN ,/, which/WDT provides/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ generalisation/NN of/IN the/DT Associative/JJ Markov/NNP Network/NNP for/IN higher/JJR order/NN cliques/NNS (/-LRB- i.e./FW clique/NN size/NN greater/JJR than/IN two/CD )/-RRB- ./.
This/DT method/NN provides/VBZ a/DT good/JJ model/NN for/IN object/NN class/NN segmentation/NN problem/NN in/IN computer/NN vision/NN ./.
Within/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP briefly/RB describe/VB the/DT associative/JJ hierarchical/JJ network/NN and/CC provide/VB a/DT computationally/RB efficient/JJ method/NN for/IN approximate/JJ inference/NN based/VBN on/IN graph/NN cuts/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN performs/VBZ well/RB for/IN networks/NNS containing/VBG hundreds/NNS of/IN thousand/CD of/IN variables/NNS ,/, and/CC higher/JJR order/NN potentials/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN over/IN cliques/NNS containing/VBG tens/NNS of/IN thousands/NNS of/IN variables/NNS ./.
Due/IN to/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN these/DT problems/NNS standard/JJ linear/JJ programming/NN techniques/NNS are/VBP inapplicable/JJ ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN has/VBZ a/DT bound/VBN of/IN 4/CD for/IN the/DT solution/NN of/IN general/JJ associative/JJ hierarchical/JJ network/NN with/IN arbitrary/JJ clique/NN size/NN noting/VBG that/IN few/JJ results/NNS on/IN bounds/NNS exist/VBP for/IN the/DT solution/NN of/IN labelling/NN of/IN Markov/NNP Networks/NNP with/IN higher/JJR order/NN cliques/NNS ./.
