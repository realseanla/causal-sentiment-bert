Attribute/VB reduction/NN is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ issue/NN in/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN and/CC data/NNS mining/NN ./.
Rough/JJ sets/NNS provide/VBP a/DT theoretical/JJ foundation/NN for/IN the/DT issue/NN ./.
Matroids/NNP generalized/VBD from/IN matrices/NNS have/VBP been/VBN widely/RB used/VBN in/IN many/JJ fields/NNS ,/, particularly/RB greedy/JJ algorithm/NN design/NN ,/, which/WDT plays/VBZ an/DT important/JJ role/NN in/IN attribute/NN reduction/NN ./.
