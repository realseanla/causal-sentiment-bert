When/WRB humans/NNS read/VBP text/NN ,/, they/PRP fixate/VBP some/DT words/NNS and/CC skip/VB others/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN few/JJ attempts/NNS to/TO explain/VB skipping/VBG behavior/NN with/IN computational/JJ models/NNS ,/, as/IN most/JJS existing/VBG work/NN has/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN predicting/VBG reading/NN times/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, ~/SYM using/VBG surprisal/NN )/-RRB- ./.
