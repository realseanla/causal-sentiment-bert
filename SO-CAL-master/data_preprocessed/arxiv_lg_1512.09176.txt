Given/VBN the/DT variability/NN in/IN student/NN learning/VBG it/PRP is/VBZ becoming/VBG increasingly/RB important/JJ to/IN tailor/NN courses/NNS as/RB well/RB as/RB course/RB sequences/NNS to/IN student/NN needs/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT systematic/JJ methodology/NN for/IN offering/VBG personalized/VBN course/NN sequence/NN recommendations/NNS to/IN students/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, a/DT forward/RB -/HYPH search/VB backward/JJ -/HYPH induction/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ developed/VBN that/WDT can/MD optimally/RB select/VB course/NN sequences/NNS to/TO decrease/VB the/DT time/NN required/VBN for/IN a/DT student/NN to/TO graduate/VB ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN accounts/VBZ for/IN prerequisite/NN requirements/NNS (/-LRB- typically/RB present/JJ in/IN higher/JJR level/NN education/NN )/-RRB- and/CC course/NN availability/NN ./.
Second/RB ,/, using/VBG the/DT tools/NNS of/IN multi-armed/JJ bandits/NNS ,/, an/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ developed/VBN that/WDT can/MD optimally/RB recommend/VB a/DT course/NN sequence/NN that/IN both/DT reduces/VBZ the/DT time/NN to/TO graduate/VB while/IN also/RB increasing/VBG the/DT overall/JJ GPA/NNP of/IN the/DT student/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN dynamically/RB learns/VBZ how/WRB students/NNS with/IN different/JJ contextual/JJ backgrounds/NNS perform/VBP for/IN given/VBN course/NN sequences/NNS and/CC then/RB recommends/VBZ an/DT optimal/JJ course/NN sequence/NN for/IN new/JJ students/NNS ./.
Using/VBG real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN student/NN data/NNS from/IN the/DT UCLA/NNP Mechanical/NNP and/CC Aerospace/NNP Engineering/NNP department/NN ,/, we/PRP illustrate/VBP how/WRB the/DT proposed/VBN algorithms/NNS outperform/VBP other/JJ methods/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB include/VB student/NN contextual/JJ information/NN when/WRB making/VBG course/NN sequence/NN recommendations/NNS ./.
