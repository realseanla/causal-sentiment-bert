The/DT Frank/NNP -/HYPH Wolfe/NNP (/-LRB- FW/NNP )/-RRB- optimization/NN algorithm/NN has/VBZ lately/RB re-gained/VBN popularity/NN thanks/NNS in/IN particular/JJ to/IN its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO nicely/RB handle/VB the/DT structured/JJ constraints/NNS appearing/VBG in/IN machine/NN learning/NN applications/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, its/PRP$ convergence/NN rate/NN is/VBZ known/VBN to/TO be/VB slow/JJ (/-LRB- sublinear/NN )/-RRB- when/WRB the/DT solution/NN lies/VBZ at/IN the/DT boundary/NN ./.
A/DT simple/JJ less/RBR -/HYPH known/VBN fix/NN is/VBZ to/TO add/VB the/DT possibility/NN to/TO take/VB '/`` away/RB steps/NNS '/POS during/IN optimization/NN ,/, an/DT operation/NN that/WDT importantly/RB does/VBZ not/RB require/VB a/DT feasibility/NN oracle/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP highlight/VBP and/CC clarify/VBP several/JJ variants/NNS of/IN the/DT Frank/NNP -/HYPH Wolfe/NNP optimization/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN successfully/RB applied/VBN in/IN practice/NN :/: away/RB -/HYPH steps/NNS FW/NNP ,/, pairwise/JJ FW/NNP ,/, fully/RB -/HYPH corrective/JJ FW/NNP and/CC Wolfe/NNP 's/POS minimum/JJ norm/NN point/NN algorithm/NN ,/, and/CC prove/VB for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/WDT they/PRP all/DT enjoy/VBP global/JJ linear/JJ convergence/NN ,/, under/IN a/DT weaker/JJR condition/NN than/IN strong/JJ convexity/NN of/IN the/DT objective/NN ./.
