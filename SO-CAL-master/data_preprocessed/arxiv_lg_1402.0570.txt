Many/JJ feature/NN subset/NN selection/NN (/-LRB- FSS/NN )/-RRB- algorithms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN ,/, but/CC not/RB all/DT of/IN them/PRP are/VBP appropriate/JJ for/IN a/DT given/VBN feature/NN selection/NN problem/NN ./.
At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ,/, so/RB far/RB there/EX is/VBZ rarely/RB a/DT good/JJ way/NN to/TO choose/VB appropriate/JJ FSS/NNP algorithms/NNS for/IN the/DT problem/NN at/IN hand/NN ./.

The/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT candidate/NN FSS/NNP algorithms/NNS is/VBZ evaluated/VBN by/IN a/DT multi-criteria/JJ metric/JJ that/IN takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN not/RB only/RB the/DT classification/NN accuracy/NN over/IN the/DT selected/VBN features/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB the/DT runtime/NN of/IN feature/NN selection/NN and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN selected/VBN features/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ recommendation/NN method/NN is/VBZ extensively/RB tested/VBN on/IN 115/CD real/JJ world/NN data/NN sets/NNS with/IN 22/CD well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN and/CC frequently/RB -/HYPH used/VBN different/JJ FSS/NNP algorithms/NNS for/IN five/CD representative/JJ classifiers/NNS ./.
