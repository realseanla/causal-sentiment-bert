Over/IN the/DT past/JJ decade/NN the/DT rate/NN of/IN intensive/JJ care/NN unit/NN (/-LRB- ICU/NN )/-RRB- use/NN in/IN the/DT United/NNP States/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN increasing/VBG ,/, with/IN a/DT recent/JJ study/NN reporting/VBG almost/RB one/CD in/IN three/CD Medicare/NNP beneficiaries/NNS experiencing/VBG an/DT ICU/NN visit/NN during/IN the/DT last/JJ month/NN of/IN their/PRP$ lives/NNS ./.
With/IN an/DT aging/VBG population/NN and/CC ever/RB -/HYPH growing/VBG demand/NN for/IN critical/JJ care/NN ,/, effective/JJ management/NN of/IN patient/NN flow/NN and/CC transition/NN among/IN different/JJ care/NN facilities/NNS will/MD prove/VB indispensible/JJ for/IN shortening/NN lengths/NNS of/IN hospital/NN stays/NNS ,/, improving/VBG patient/JJ outcomes/NNS ,/, allocating/VBG critical/JJ resources/NNS ,/, and/CC reducing/VBG preventable/JJ re-admissions/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN a/DT new/JJ problem/NN of/IN predicting/VBG the/DT so/RB -/HYPH called/VBN ICU/NN patient/NN flow/NN from/IN longitudinal/JJ electronic/JJ health/NN records/NNS (/-LRB- EHRs/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB explored/VBN via/IN existing/VBG machine/NN learning/NN techniques/NNS ./.
By/IN treating/VBG a/DT sequence/NN of/IN transition/NN events/NNS as/IN a/DT point/NN process/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT novel/JJ framework/NN for/IN modeling/VBG patient/NN flow/NN through/IN various/JJ ICU/NN care/NN units/NNS and/CC predict/VB patients/NNS '/POS destination/NN ICUs/NNS and/CC duration/NN days/NNS jointly/RB ./.
