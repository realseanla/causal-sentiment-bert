Ongoing/JJ research/NN has/VBZ proposed/VBN several/JJ methods/NNS to/TO defend/VB neural/JJ networks/NNS against/IN adversarial/JJ examples/NNS ,/, many/JJ of/IN which/WDT researchers/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN to/TO be/VB ineffective/JJ ./.
We/PRP ask/VBP whether/IN a/DT strong/JJ defense/NN can/MD be/VB created/VBN by/IN combining/VBG multiple/JJ (/-LRB- possibly/RB weak/JJ )/-RRB- defenses/NNS ./.
To/TO answer/VB this/DT question/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP three/CD defenses/NNS that/WDT follow/VBP this/DT approach/NN ./.
Two/CD of/IN these/DT are/VBP recently/RB proposed/VBN defenses/NNS that/WDT intentionally/RB combine/VBP components/NNS designed/VBN to/TO work/VB well/RB together/RB ./.
A/DT third/JJ defense/NN combines/VBZ three/CD independent/JJ defenses/NNS ./.
For/IN all/PDT the/DT components/NNS of/IN these/DT defenses/NNS and/CC the/DT combined/VBN defenses/NNS themselves/PRP ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN an/DT adaptive/JJ adversary/NN can/MD create/VB adversarial/JJ examples/NNS successfully/RB with/IN low/JJ distortion/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, our/PRP$ work/NN implies/VBZ that/IN ensemble/NN of/IN weak/JJ defenses/NNS is/VBZ not/RB sufficient/JJ to/TO provide/VB strong/JJ defense/NN against/IN adversarial/JJ examples/NNS ./.
