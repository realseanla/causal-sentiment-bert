This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ an/DT important/JJ problem/NN in/IN stream/NN mining/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, classification/NN under/IN streaming/NN emerging/VBG new/JJ classes/NNS or/CC SENC/NN ./.
The/DT common/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ to/TO treat/VB it/PRP as/IN a/DT classification/NN problem/NN and/CC solve/VB it/PRP using/VBG either/CC a/DT supervised/JJ learner/NN or/CC a/DT semi-supervised/JJ learner/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP an/DT alternative/JJ approach/NN by/IN using/VBG unsupervised/JJ learning/NN as/IN the/DT basis/NN to/TO solve/VB this/DT problem/NN ./.
The/DT SENC/NNP problem/NN can/MD be/VB decomposed/VBN into/IN three/CD sub/NN problems/NNS :/: detecting/VBG emerging/VBG new/JJ classes/NNS ,/, classifying/VBG for/IN known/VBN classes/NNS ,/, and/CC updating/VBG models/NNS to/TO enable/VB classification/NN of/IN instances/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ class/NN and/CC detection/NN of/IN more/JJR emerging/VBG new/JJ classes/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN employs/VBZ completely/RB random/JJ trees/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN shown/VBN to/TO work/VB well/RB in/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN and/CC supervised/VBD learning/VBG independently/RB in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, as/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP know/VBP ,/, that/DT completely/RB random/JJ trees/NNS are/VBP used/VBN as/IN a/DT single/JJ common/JJ core/NN to/TO solve/VB all/DT three/CD sub/NN problems/NNS :/: unsupervised/JJ learning/NN ,/, supervised/VBD learning/NN and/CC model/NN update/NN in/IN data/NN streams/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN unsupervised/JJ -/HYPH learning/NN -/HYPH focused/JJ method/NN often/RB achieves/VBZ significantly/RB better/JJR outcomes/NNS than/IN existing/VBG classification/NN -/HYPH focused/VBN methods/NNS ./.
