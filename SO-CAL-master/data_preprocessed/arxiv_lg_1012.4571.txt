This/DT article/NN discusses/VBZ in/IN detail/NN the/DT rating/NN system/NN that/WDT won/VBD the/DT kaggle/NN competition/NN "/'' Chess/NN Ratings/NNS :/: Elo/NNP vs/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN "/'' ./.
The/DT competition/NN provided/VBD a/DT historical/JJ dataset/NN of/IN outcomes/NNS for/IN chess/NN games/NNS ,/, and/CC aimed/VBN to/TO discover/VB whether/IN novel/JJ approaches/NNS can/MD predict/VB the/DT outcomes/NNS of/IN future/JJ games/NNS ,/, more/RBR accurately/RB than/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN Elo/NNP rating/NN system/NN ./.
The/DT winning/VBG rating/NN system/NN ,/, called/VBN Elo/NNP in/IN the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT article/NN ,/, builds/VBZ upon/IN the/DT Elo/NNP rating/NN system/NN ./.
Like/IN Elo/NNP ,/, Elo/NNP uses/VBZ a/DT single/JJ rating/NN per/IN player/NN and/CC predicts/VBZ the/DT outcome/NN of/IN a/DT game/NN ,/, by/IN using/VBG a/DT logistic/JJ curve/NN over/IN the/DT difference/NN in/IN ratings/NNS of/IN the/DT players/NNS ./.
The/DT major/JJ component/NN of/IN Elo/NNP is/VBZ a/DT regularization/NN technique/NN that/WDT avoids/VBZ overfitting/VBG these/DT ratings/NNS ./.
The/DT dataset/NN of/IN chess/NN games/NNS and/CC outcomes/NNS is/VBZ relatively/RB small/JJ and/CC one/PRP has/VBZ to/TO be/VB careful/JJ not/RB to/TO draw/VB "/`` too/RB many/JJ conclusions/NNS "/'' out/IN of/IN the/DT limited/JJ data/NNS ./.
Many/JJ approaches/NNS tested/VBN in/IN the/DT competition/NN showed/VBD signs/NNS of/IN such/PDT an/DT overfitting/NN ./.
The/DT leader/NN -/HYPH board/NN was/VBD dominated/VBN by/IN attempts/NNS that/WDT did/VBD a/DT very/RB good/JJ job/NN on/IN a/DT small/JJ test/NN dataset/NN ,/, but/CC could/MD n't/RB generalize/VB well/RB on/IN the/DT private/JJ hold/NN -/HYPH out/NN dataset/NN ./.
The/DT Elo/NNP regularization/NN takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN the/DT number/NN of/IN games/NNS per/IN player/NN ,/, the/DT recency/NN of/IN these/DT games/NNS and/CC the/DT ratings/NNS of/IN the/DT opponents/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, Elo/NNP employs/VBZ a/DT stochastic/JJ gradient/NN descent/NN scheme/NN for/IN training/VBG the/DT ratings/NNS ,/, and/CC uses/VBZ only/RB two/CD global/JJ parameters/NNS (/-LRB- white/NN 's/POS advantage/NN and/CC regularization/NN constant/JJ )/-RRB- that/WDT are/VBP optimized/VBN using/VBG cross-validation/NN ./.
