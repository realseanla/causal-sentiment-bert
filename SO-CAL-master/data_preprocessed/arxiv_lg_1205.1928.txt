A/DT family/NN of/IN regularization/NN functionals/NNS is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO admit/VB a/DT linear/JJ representer/NN theorem/NN if/IN every/DT member/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN admits/VBZ minimizers/NNS that/WDT lie/VBP in/IN a/DT fixed/VBN finite/JJ dimensional/JJ subspace/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN a/DT general/JJ class/NN of/IN extended/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH valued/VBN regularization/NN functionals/NNS admits/VBZ a/DT linear/JJ representer/NN theorem/NN if/IN and/CC only/RB if/IN the/DT regularizer/NN is/VBZ a/DT non-decreasing/NN function/NN of/IN the/DT norm/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, we/PRP extend/VBP a/DT recent/JJ characterization/NN stating/VBG that/IN such/JJ condition/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ and/CC sufficient/JJ for/IN differentiable/JJ regularizers/NNS ./.
