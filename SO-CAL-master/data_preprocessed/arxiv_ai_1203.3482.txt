Computing/NNP the/DT probability/NN of/IN a/DT formula/NN given/VBN the/DT probabilities/NNS or/CC weights/NNS associated/VBN with/IN other/JJ formulas/NNS is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ extension/NN of/IN logical/JJ inference/NN to/IN the/DT probabilistic/JJ setting/NN ./.
Surprisingly/RB ,/, this/DT problem/NN has/VBZ received/VBN little/JJ attention/NN in/IN the/DT literature/NN to/IN date/NN ,/, particularly/RB considering/VBG that/IN it/PRP includes/VBZ many/JJ standard/JJ inference/NN problems/NNS as/IN special/JJ cases/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP two/CD algorithms/NNS for/IN this/DT problem/NN :/: formula/NN decomposition/NN and/CC conditioning/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT exact/JJ method/NN ,/, and/CC formula/NN importance/NN sampling/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT approximate/JJ method/NN ./.
The/DT latter/JJ is/VBZ ,/, to/IN our/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, the/DT first/JJ application/NN of/IN model/NN counting/VBG to/IN approximate/JJ probabilistic/JJ inference/NN ./.
Unlike/IN conventional/JJ variable/JJ -/HYPH based/VBN algorithms/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ algorithms/NNS work/VBP in/IN the/DT dual/JJ realm/NN of/IN logical/JJ formulas/NNS ./.
Theoretically/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ algorithms/NNS can/MD greatly/RB improve/VB efficiency/NN by/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT structural/JJ information/NN in/IN the/DT formulas/NNS ./.
Empirically/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP indeed/RB quite/RB powerful/JJ ,/, often/RB achieving/VBG substantial/JJ performance/NN gains/NNS over/IN state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN schemes/NNS ./.
