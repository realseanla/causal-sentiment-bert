In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP first/RB prove/VB a/DT high/JJ probability/NN bound/VBN rather/RB than/IN an/DT expectation/NN bound/VBN for/IN stochastic/JJ optimization/NN with/IN smooth/JJ loss/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT existing/VBG analysis/NN requires/VBZ the/DT knowledge/NN of/IN optimal/JJ classifier/NN for/IN tuning/VBG the/DT step/NN size/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB the/DT desired/VBN bound/VBN ./.
