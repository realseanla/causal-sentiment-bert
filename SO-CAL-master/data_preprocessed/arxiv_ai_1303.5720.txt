Value/NNP -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH information/NN analyses/NNS provide/VBP a/DT straightforward/JJ means/NN for/IN selecting/VBG the/DT best/JJS next/JJ observation/NN to/TO make/VB ,/, and/CC for/IN determining/VBG whether/IN it/PRP is/VBZ better/JJR to/TO gather/VB additional/JJ information/NN or/CC to/TO act/VB immediately/RB ./.
Determining/VBG the/DT next/JJ best/JJS test/NN to/TO perform/VB ,/, given/VBN a/DT state/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN about/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, requires/VBZ a/DT consideration/NN of/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN making/VBG all/DT possible/JJ sequences/NNS of/IN observations/NNS ./.
In/IN practice/NN ,/, decision/NN analysts/NNS and/CC expert/NN -/HYPH system/NN designers/NNS have/VBP avoided/VBN the/DT intractability/NN of/IN exact/JJ computation/NN of/IN the/DT value/NN of/IN information/NN by/IN relying/VBG on/IN a/DT myopic/JJ approximation/NN ./.
Myopic/JJ analyses/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN only/RB one/CD additional/JJ test/NN will/MD be/VB performed/VBN ,/, even/RB when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN observations/NNS ./.
