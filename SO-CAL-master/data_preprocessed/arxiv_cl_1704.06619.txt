We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT summarization/NN approach/NN for/IN scientific/JJ articles/NNS which/WDT takes/VBZ advantage/NN of/IN citation/NN -/HYPH context/NN and/CC the/DT document/NN discourse/NN model/NN ./.
While/IN citations/NNS have/VBP been/VBN previously/RB used/VBN in/IN generating/VBG scientific/JJ summaries/NNS ,/, they/PRP lack/VBP the/DT related/JJ context/NN from/IN the/DT referenced/VBN article/NN and/CC therefore/RB do/VBP not/RB accurately/RB reflect/VB the/DT article/NN 's/POS content/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN overcomes/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN inconsistency/NN between/IN the/DT citation/NN summary/NN and/CC the/DT article/NN 's/POS content/NN by/IN providing/VBG context/NN for/IN each/DT citation/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB leverage/VBP the/DT inherent/JJ scientific/JJ article/NN 's/POS discourse/NN for/IN producing/VBG better/JJR summaries/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/JJ method/NN effectively/RB improves/VBZ over/IN existing/VBG summarization/NN approaches/NNS (/-LRB- greater/JJR than/IN 30/CD percent/NN improvement/NN over/IN the/DT best/JJS performing/VBG baseline/NN )/-RRB- in/IN terms/NNS of/IN \/SYM textsc/NN {/-LRB- Rouge/NNP }/-RRB- scores/NNS on/IN TAC2014/NN scientific/JJ summarization/NN dataset/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT dataset/NN we/PRP use/VBP for/IN evaluation/NN is/VBZ in/IN the/DT biomedical/JJ domain/NN ,/, most/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ approaches/NNS are/VBP general/JJ and/CC therefore/RB adaptable/JJ to/IN other/JJ domains/NNS ./.
