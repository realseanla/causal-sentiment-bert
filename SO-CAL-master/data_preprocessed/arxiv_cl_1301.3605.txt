Recent/JJ studies/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN that/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- DNNs/NNS )/-RRB- perform/VBP significantly/RB better/JJR than/IN shallow/JJ networks/NNS and/CC Gaussian/JJ mixture/NN models/NNS (/-LRB- GMMs/NNS )/-RRB- on/IN large/JJ vocabulary/NN speech/NN recognition/NN tasks/NNS ./.
