We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN creating/VBG fair/JJ course/NN timetables/NNS in/IN the/DT setting/NN of/IN a/DT university/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ motivation/NN is/VBZ to/TO improve/VB the/DT overall/JJ satisfaction/NN of/IN individuals/NNS concerned/JJ (/-LRB- students/NNS ,/, teachers/NNS ,/, etc./FW )/-RRB- by/IN providing/VBG a/DT fair/JJ timetable/NN to/IN them/PRP ./.
The/DT central/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ that/IN undesirable/JJ arrangements/NNS in/IN the/DT course/NN timetable/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, violations/NNS of/IN soft/JJ constraints/NNS ,/, should/MD be/VB distributed/VBN in/IN a/DT fair/JJ way/NN among/IN the/DT individuals/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP two/CD formulations/NNS for/IN the/DT fair/JJ course/NN timetabling/VBG problem/NN that/WDT are/VBP based/VBN on/IN max/NN -/HYPH min/NN fairness/NN and/CC Jain/NNP 's/POS fairness/NN index/NN ,/, respectively/RB ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP and/CC experimentally/RB evaluate/VB an/DT optimization/NN algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN simulated/JJ annealing/VBG for/IN solving/VBG max/NN -/HYPH min/NN fair/JJ course/NN timetabling/NN problems/NNS ./.
The/DT new/JJ contribution/NN is/VBZ concerned/VBN with/IN measuring/VBG the/DT energy/NN difference/NN between/IN two/CD timetables/NNS ,/, i.e./FW ,/, how/WRB much/RB worse/JJR a/DT timetable/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN to/IN another/DT timetable/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN max/NN -/HYPH min/NN fairness/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP three/CD different/JJ energy/NN difference/NN measures/NNS and/CC evaluate/VB their/PRP$ impact/NN on/IN the/DT overall/JJ algorithm/NN performance/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ proposed/VBN problem/NN formulation/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN the/DT tradeoff/NN between/IN fairness/NN and/CC the/DT total/JJ amount/NN of/IN soft/JJ constraint/NN violations/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ evaluation/NN shows/VBZ that/IN the/DT known/VBN best/JJS solutions/NNS to/IN the/DT ITC2007/NN curriculum/NN -/HYPH based/VBN course/NN timetabling/NN instances/NNS are/VBP quite/RB fair/JJ with/IN respect/NN to/IN Jain/NNP 's/POS fairness/NN index/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT experiments/NNS also/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT fairness/NN can/MD be/VB improved/VBN further/RB for/IN only/RB a/DT rather/RB small/JJ increase/NN in/IN the/DT total/JJ amount/NN of/IN soft/JJ constraint/NN violations/NNS ./.
