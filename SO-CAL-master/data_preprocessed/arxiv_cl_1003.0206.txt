Hidden/VBN Markov/NNP models/NNS (/-LRB- HMMs/NNS )/-RRB- have/VBP been/VBN successfully/RB applied/VBN to/IN automatic/JJ speech/NN recognition/NN for/IN more/JJR than/IN 35/CD years/NNS in/IN spite/NN of/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT key/JJ HMM/NNP assumption/NN --/: the/DT statistical/JJ independence/NN of/IN frames/NNS --/: is/VBZ obviously/RB violated/VBN by/IN speech/NN data/NNS ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, this/DT data/NN //HYPH model/NN mismatch/NN has/VBZ inspired/VBN many/JJ attempts/NNS to/TO modify/VB or/CC replace/VB HMMs/NNS with/IN alternative/JJ models/NNS that/WDT are/VBP better/RBR able/JJ to/TO take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT statistical/JJ dependence/NN of/IN frames/NNS ./.
However/RB it/PRP is/VBZ fair/JJ to/TO say/VB that/IN in/IN 2010/CD the/DT HMM/NNP is/VBZ the/DT consensus/NN model/NN of/IN choice/NN for/IN speech/NN recognition/NN and/CC that/IN HMMs/NNPS are/VBP at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN both/DT commercially/RB available/JJ products/NNS and/CC contemporary/JJ research/NN systems/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT preliminary/JJ exploration/NN aimed/VBN at/IN understanding/VBG how/WRB speech/NN data/NNS depart/VBP from/IN HMMs/NNPS and/CC what/WDT effect/NN this/DT departure/NN has/VBZ on/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN HMM/NNP -/HYPH based/VBN speech/NN recognition/NN ./.
