In/IN covering/VBG based/VBN rough/JJ sets/NNS ,/, the/DT neighborhood/NN of/IN an/DT element/NN is/VBZ the/DT intersection/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT covering/VBG blocks/NNS containing/VBG the/DT element/NN ./.
All/PDT the/DT neighborhoods/NNS form/VBP a/DT new/JJ covering/NN called/VBD a/DT covering/NN of/IN neighborhoods/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN studying/VBG under/IN what/WP condition/NN a/DT covering/NN of/IN neighborhoods/NNS is/VBZ a/DT partition/NN ,/, the/DT concept/NN of/IN repeat/NN degree/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ,/, with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN which/WDT the/DT issue/NN is/VBZ addressed/VBN ./.
This/DT paper/NN studies/NNS further/RB the/DT application/NN of/IN repeat/NN degree/NN on/IN coverings/NNS of/IN neighborhoods/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP under/IN what/WDT condition/NN a/DT covering/NN of/IN neighborhoods/NNS is/VBZ the/DT reduct/NN of/IN the/DT covering/VBG inducing/VBG it/PRP ./.
As/IN a/DT preparation/NN for/IN addressing/VBG this/DT issue/NN ,/, we/PRP give/VBP a/DT necessary/JJ and/CC sufficient/JJ condition/NN for/IN a/DT subset/NN of/IN a/DT set/VBN family/NN to/TO be/VB the/DT reduct/NN of/IN the/DT set/VBN family/NN ./.
Then/RB we/PRP study/VBP under/IN what/WP condition/NN two/CD coverings/NNS induce/VBP a/DT same/JJ relation/NN and/CC a/DT same/JJ covering/NN of/IN neighborhoods/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP give/VBP the/DT method/NN of/IN calculating/VBG the/DT covering/VBG according/VBG to/IN repeat/NN degree/NN ./.
