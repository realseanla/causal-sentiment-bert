This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ about/RB two/CD related/JJ methods/NNS for/IN two/CD sample/NN testing/NN and/CC independence/NN testing/NN which/WDT have/VBP emerged/VBN over/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN :/: Maximum/NNP Mean/NNP Discrepancy/NN (/-LRB- MMD/NN )/-RRB- for/IN the/DT former/JJ problem/NN and/CC Distance/NNP Correlation/NN (/-LRB- dCor/NN )/-RRB- for/IN the/DT latter/JJ ./.
Both/PDT these/DT methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN suggested/VBN for/IN high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ problems/NNS ,/, and/CC sometimes/RB claimed/VBD to/TO be/VB unaffected/JJ by/IN increasing/VBG dimensionality/NN of/IN the/DT samples/NNS ./.
We/PRP will/MD show/VB theoretically/RB and/CC practically/RB that/IN the/DT power/NN of/IN both/DT methods/NNS (/-LRB- for/IN different/JJ reasons/NNS )/-RRB- does/VBZ actually/RB decrease/VB polynomially/RB with/IN dimension/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB analyze/VB the/DT median/JJ heuristic/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT method/NN for/IN choosing/VBG tuning/NN parameters/NNS of/IN translation/NN invariant/JJ kernels/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN different/JJ bandwidth/NN choices/NNS could/MD result/VB in/IN the/DT MMD/NNP decaying/VBG polynomially/RB or/CC even/RB exponentially/RB in/IN dimension/NN ./.
