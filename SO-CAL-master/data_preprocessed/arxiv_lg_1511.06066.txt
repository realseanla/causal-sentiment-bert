Transfer/NN learning/NN is/VBZ a/DT vital/JJ technique/NN that/WDT generalizes/VBZ models/NNS trained/VBN for/IN one/CD setting/NN or/CC task/NN to/IN other/JJ settings/NNS or/CC tasks/NNS ./.
For/IN example/NN in/IN speech/NN recognition/NN ,/, an/DT acoustic/JJ model/NN trained/VBN for/IN one/CD language/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO recognize/VB speech/NN in/IN another/DT language/NN ,/, with/IN little/JJ or/CC no/DT re-training/NN data/NNS ./.
Transfer/NN learning/NN is/VBZ closely/RB related/JJ to/TO multi-task/VB learning/NN (/-LRB- cross-lingual/JJ vs./FW multilingual/JJ )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC is/VBZ traditionally/RB studied/VBN in/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN `/`` model/NN adaptation/NN '/'' ./.
Recent/JJ advance/NN in/IN deep/JJ learning/NN shows/VBZ that/IN transfer/NN learning/NN becomes/VBZ much/RB easier/JJR and/CC more/JJR effective/JJ with/IN high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN abstract/JJ features/NNS learned/VBN by/IN deep/JJ models/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT `/`` transfer/NN '/'' can/MD be/VB conducted/VBN not/RB only/RB between/IN data/NNS distributions/NNS and/CC data/NNS types/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB between/IN model/NN structures/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, shallow/JJ nets/NNS and/CC deep/JJ nets/NNS )/-RRB- or/CC even/RB model/NN types/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, Bayesian/JJ models/NNS and/CC neural/JJ models/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
