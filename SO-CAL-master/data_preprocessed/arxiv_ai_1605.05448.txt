In/IN this/DT thesis/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT Vehicle/NN Routing/VBG Problem/NNP called/VBD the/DT Enhanced/VBN Bees/NNPS Algorithm/NNP ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ adapted/VBN from/IN a/DT fairly/RB recent/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, the/DT Bees/NNPS Algorithm/NNP ,/, which/WDT was/VBD developed/VBN for/IN continuous/JJ optimisation/NN problems/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT results/NNS obtained/VBN by/IN the/DT Enhanced/VBN Bees/NNPS Algorithm/NNP are/VBP competitive/JJ with/IN the/DT best/JJS meta/NN -/HYPH heuristics/NNS available/JJ for/IN the/DT Vehicle/NN Routing/VBG Problem/NN (/-LRB- within/IN 0.5/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT optimal/JJ solution/NN for/IN common/JJ benchmark/NN problems/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT algorithm/NN has/VBZ good/JJ runtime/NN performance/NN ,/, producing/VBG results/NNS within/IN 2/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT optimal/JJ solution/NN within/IN 60/CD seconds/NNS ,/, making/VBG it/PRP suitable/JJ for/IN use/NN within/IN real/JJ world/NN dispatch/NN scenarios/NNS ./.
