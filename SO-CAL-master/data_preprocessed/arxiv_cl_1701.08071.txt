In/IN this/DT paper/NN the/DT task/NN of/IN emotion/NN recognition/NN from/IN speech/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN ./.
Proposed/VBN approach/NN uses/VBZ deep/JJ recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN trained/VBN on/IN a/DT sequence/NN of/IN acoustic/JJ features/NNS calculated/VBN over/IN small/JJ speech/NN intervals/NNS ./.
At/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN special/JJ probabilistic/JJ -/HYPH nature/NN CTC/NN loss/NN function/NN allows/VBZ to/TO consider/VB long/JJ utterances/NNS containing/VBG both/CC emotional/JJ and/CC unemotional/JJ parts/NNS ./.
The/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN such/PDT an/DT approach/NN is/VBZ shown/VBN in/IN two/CD ways/NNS ./.
First/RB one/CD is/VBZ the/DT comparison/NN with/IN recent/JJ advances/NNS in/IN this/DT field/NN ./.
While/IN second/JJ way/NN implies/VBZ measuring/VBG human/JJ performance/NN on/IN the/DT same/JJ task/NN ,/, which/WDT also/RB was/VBD done/VBN by/IN authors/NNS ./.
