With/IN the/DT rapid/JJ growth/NN of/IN social/JJ media/NNS ,/, rumors/NNS are/VBP also/RB spreading/VBG widely/RB on/IN social/JJ media/NNS and/CC bring/VB harm/NN to/IN people/NNS 's/POS daily/JJ life/NN ./.
Nowadays/RB ,/, information/NN credibility/NN evaluation/NN has/VBZ drawn/VBN attention/NN from/IN academic/JJ and/CC industrial/JJ communities/NNS ./.
Current/JJ methods/NNS mainly/RB focus/VBP on/IN feature/NN engineering/NN and/CC achieve/VB some/DT success/NN ./.

In/IN our/PRP$ viewpoint/NN ,/, the/DT key/JJ elements/NNS of/IN user/NN behaviors/NNS for/IN evaluating/VBG credibility/NN are/VBP concluded/VBN as/IN "/`` who/WP "/'' ,/, "/`` what/WP "/'' ,/, "/`` when/WRB "/`` ,/, and/CC "/`` how/WRB "/'' ./.
These/DT existing/VBG methods/NNS can/MD not/RB model/VB the/DT correlation/NN among/IN different/JJ key/JJ elements/NNS during/IN the/DT spreading/NN of/IN microblogs/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ representation/NN learning/NN method/NN ,/, Information/NN Credibility/NN Evaluation/NN (/-LRB- ICE/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, to/TO learn/VB representations/NNS of/IN information/NN credibility/NN on/IN social/JJ media/NNS ./.

The/DT aggregation/NN of/IN these/DT factors/NNS in/IN the/DT microblog/NN spreading/VBG process/NN yields/VBZ the/DT representation/NN of/IN a/DT user/NN 's/POS behavior/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT aggregation/NN of/IN these/DT dynamic/JJ representations/NNS generates/VBZ the/DT credibility/NN representation/NN of/IN an/DT event/NN spreading/VBG on/IN social/JJ media/NNS ./.
