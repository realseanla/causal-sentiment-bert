Many/JJ modern/JJ NLP/NN systems/NNS rely/VBP on/IN word/NN embeddings/NNS ,/, previously/RB trained/VBN in/IN an/DT unsupervised/JJ manner/NN on/IN large/JJ corpora/NNS ,/, as/IN base/NN features/NNS ./.
Efforts/NNS to/TO obtain/VB embeddings/NNS for/IN larger/JJR chunks/NNS of/IN text/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN sentences/NNS ,/, have/VBP however/RB not/RB been/VBN so/RB successful/JJ ./.
