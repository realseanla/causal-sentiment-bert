This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ the/DT development/NN of/IN a/DT passive/JJ infra/NN -/HYPH red/JJ sensor/NN tower/NN platform/NN along/IN with/IN a/DT classification/NN algorithm/NN to/TO distinguish/VB between/IN human/JJ intrusion/NN ,/, animal/NN intrusion/NN and/CC clutter/NN arising/VBG from/IN wind/NN -/HYPH blown/VBN vegetative/JJ movement/NN in/IN an/DT outdoor/JJ environment/NN ./.
The/DT research/NN was/VBD aimed/VBN at/IN exploring/VBG the/DT potential/JJ use/NN of/IN wireless/JJ sensor/NN networks/NNS as/IN an/DT early/JJ -/HYPH warning/NN system/NN to/TO help/VB mitigate/VB human/JJ -/HYPH wildlife/NN conflicts/NNS occurring/VBG at/IN the/DT edge/NN of/IN a/DT forest/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP three/CD important/JJ features/NNS to/IN the/DT development/NN ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, the/DT sensor/NN platform/NN employs/VBZ multiple/JJ sensors/NNS arranged/VBN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT two/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ array/NN to/TO give/VB it/PRP a/DT key/JJ spatial/JJ -/HYPH resolution/NN capability/NN that/WDT aids/VBZ in/IN classification/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, given/VBN the/DT challenges/NNS of/IN collecting/VBG data/NNS involving/VBG animal/NN intrusion/NN ,/, an/DT Animation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN Simulation/NNP tool/NN for/IN Passive/NNP Infra/NNP -/HYPH Red/NNP sEnsor/NNP (/-LRB- ASPIRE/NNP )/-RRB- was/VBD developed/VBN that/WDT simulates/VBZ signals/NNS corresponding/VBG to/IN human/JJ and/CC animal/NN intrusion/NN and/CC some/DT limited/JJ models/NNS of/IN vegetative/JJ clutter/NN ./.
This/DT speeded/VBD up/RP the/DT process/NN of/IN algorithm/NN development/NN by/IN allowing/VBG us/PRP to/TO test/VB different/JJ hypotheses/NNS in/IN a/DT time/NN -/HYPH efficient/JJ manner/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, a/DT chirplet/NN -/HYPH based/VBN model/NN for/IN intruder/NN signal/NN was/VBD developed/VBN that/WDT significantly/RB helped/VBD boost/VB classification/NN accuracy/NN despite/IN drawing/VBG data/NNS from/IN a/DT smaller/JJR number/NN of/IN sensors/NNS ./.
An/DT SVM/NN -/HYPH based/VBN classifier/NN was/VBD used/VBN which/WDT made/VBD use/NN of/IN chirplet/NN ,/, energy/NN and/CC signal/NN cross-correlation-based/VBN features/NNS ./.
The/DT average/JJ accuracy/NN obtained/VBN for/IN intruder/NN detection/NN and/CC classification/NN on/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN and/CC simulated/VBN data/NNS sets/NNS was/VBD in/IN excess/NN of/IN 97/CD percent/NN ./.
