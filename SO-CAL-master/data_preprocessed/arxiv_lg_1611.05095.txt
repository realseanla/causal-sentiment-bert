We/PRP explore/VBP learning/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approaches/NNS for/IN feedback/NN control/NN of/IN a/DT dexterous/JJ five/CD -/HYPH finger/NN hand/NN performing/VBG non-prehensile/JJ manipulation/NN ./.
First/RB ,/, we/PRP learn/VBP local/JJ controllers/NNS that/WDT are/VBP able/JJ to/TO perform/VB the/DT task/NN starting/VBG at/IN a/DT predefined/JJ initial/JJ state/NN ./.
These/DT controllers/NNS are/VBP constructed/VBN using/VBG trajectory/NN optimization/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN locally/RB -/HYPH linear/JJ time/NN -/HYPH varying/VBG models/NNS learned/VBN directly/RB from/IN sensor/NN data/NNS ./.
In/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, we/PRP initialize/VBP the/DT optimizer/NN with/IN human/JJ demonstrations/NNS collected/VBN via/IN teleoperation/NN in/IN a/DT virtual/JJ environment/NN ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN such/JJ controllers/NNS can/MD perform/VB the/DT task/NN robustly/RB ,/, both/CC in/IN simulation/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT physical/JJ platform/NN ,/, for/IN a/DT limited/JJ range/NN of/IN initial/JJ conditions/NNS around/IN the/DT trained/VBN starting/VBG state/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB consider/VBP two/CD interpolation/NN methods/NNS for/IN generalizing/VBG to/IN a/DT wider/JJR range/NN of/IN initial/JJ conditions/NNS :/: deep/JJ learning/NN ,/, and/CC nearest/JJS neighbors/NNS ./.
We/PRP find/VBP that/IN nearest/JJS neighbors/NNS achieve/VBP higher/JJR performance/NN ./.
Nevertheless/RB ,/, the/DT neural/JJ network/NN has/VBZ its/PRP$ advantages/NNS :/: it/PRP uses/VBZ only/RB tactile/JJ and/CC proprioceptive/JJ feedback/NN but/CC no/DT visual/JJ feedback/NN about/IN the/DT object/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW it/PRP performs/VBZ the/DT task/NN blind/JJ )/-RRB- and/CC learns/VBZ a/DT time/NN -/HYPH invariant/JJ policy/NN ./.
In/IN contrast/NN ,/, the/DT nearest/JJS neighbors/NNS method/NN switches/NNS between/IN time/NN -/HYPH varying/VBG local/JJ controllers/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT proximity/NN of/IN initial/JJ object/NN states/NNS sensed/VBD via/IN motion/NN capture/NN ./.
While/IN both/DT generalization/NN methods/NNS leave/VBP room/NN for/IN improvement/NN ,/, our/PRP$ work/NN shows/VBZ that/IN (/-LRB- i/LS )/-RRB- local/JJ trajectory/NN -/HYPH based/VBN controllers/NNS for/IN complex/JJ non-prehensile/JJ manipulation/NN tasks/NNS can/MD be/VB constructed/VBN from/IN surprisingly/RB small/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN training/NN data/NNS ,/, and/CC (/-LRB- ii/LS )/-RRB- collections/NNS of/IN such/JJ controllers/NNS can/MD be/VB interpolated/VBN to/TO form/VB more/JJR global/JJ controllers/NNS ./.
