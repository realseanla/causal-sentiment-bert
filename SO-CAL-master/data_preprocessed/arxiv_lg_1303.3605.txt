This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ a/DT survey/NN work/NN for/IN a/DT bigger/JJR project/NN for/IN designing/VBG a/DT Visual/JJ SLAM/NN robot/NN to/TO generate/VB 3D/JJ dense/JJ map/NN of/IN an/DT unknown/JJ unstructured/JJ environment/NN ./.
A/DT lot/NN of/IN factors/NNS have/VBP to/TO be/VB considered/VBN while/IN designing/VBG a/DT SLAM/NN robot/NN ./.
Sensing/VBG method/NN of/IN the/DT SLAM/NN robot/NN should/MD be/VB determined/VBN by/IN considering/VBG the/DT kind/NN of/IN environment/NN to/TO be/VB modeled/VBN ./.
Similarly/RB the/DT type/NN of/IN environment/NN determines/VBZ the/DT suitable/JJ feature/NN extraction/NN method/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN goes/VBZ through/IN the/DT sensing/VBG methods/NNS used/VBN in/IN some/DT recently/RB published/VBN papers/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ objective/NN of/IN this/DT survey/NN is/VBZ to/TO conduct/VB a/DT comparative/JJ study/NN among/IN the/DT current/JJ sensing/VBG methods/NNS and/CC feature/NN extraction/NN algorithms/NNS and/CC to/TO extract/VB out/RP the/DT best/JJS for/IN our/PRP$ work/NN ./.
