Lifelong/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG provides/VBZ a/DT promising/JJ framework/NN for/IN developing/VBG versatile/JJ agents/NNS that/WDT can/MD accumulate/VB knowledge/NN over/IN a/DT lifetime/NN of/IN experience/NN and/CC rapidly/RB learn/VB new/JJ tasks/NNS by/IN building/VBG upon/IN prior/JJ knowledge/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, current/JJ lifelong/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS exhibit/VBP non-vanishing/JJ regret/NN as/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN experience/NN increases/NNS and/CC include/VBP limitations/NNS that/WDT can/MD lead/VB to/IN suboptimal/JJ or/CC unsafe/JJ control/NN policies/NNS ./.
To/TO address/VB these/DT issues/NNS ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT lifelong/JJ policy/NN gradient/NN learner/NN that/WDT operates/VBZ in/IN an/DT adversarial/JJ set/NN -/, ting/NNP to/TO learn/VB multiple/JJ tasks/NNS online/RB while/IN enforcing/VBG safety/NN constraints/NNS on/IN the/DT learned/VBN policies/NNS ./.
