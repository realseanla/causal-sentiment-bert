This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT design/NN of/IN a/DT non-player/JJ character/NN (/-LRB- AI/NN )/-RRB- for/IN promoting/VBG balancedness/NN in/IN use/NN of/IN body/NN segments/NNS when/WRB engaging/VBG in/IN full/JJ -/HYPH body/NN motion/NN gaming/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ experiment/NN ,/, we/PRP settle/VBP a/DT battle/NN between/IN the/DT proposed/VBN AI/NN and/CC a/DT player/NN by/IN using/VBG FightingICE/NNP ,/, a/DT fighting/NN game/NN platform/NN for/IN AI/NN development/NN ./.
A/DT middleware/NN called/VBN UKI/NNP is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO allow/VB the/DT player/NN to/TO control/VB the/DT game/NN by/IN using/VBG body/NN motion/NN instead/RB of/IN the/DT keyboard/NN and/CC mouse/NN ./.
During/IN gameplay/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN AI/NN analyze/VB health/NN states/NNS of/IN the/DT player/NN ;/: it/PRP determines/VBZ its/PRP$ next/JJ action/NN by/IN predicting/VBG how/WRB each/DT candidate/NN action/NN ,/, recommended/VBN by/IN a/DT Monte/NNP -/HYPH Carlo/NNP tree/NN search/VB algorithm/NN ,/, will/MD induce/VB the/DT player/NN to/TO move/VB ,/, and/CC how/WRB the/DT player/NN 's/POS health/NN tends/VBZ to/TO be/VB affected/VBN ./.
Our/PRP$ result/NN demonstrates/VBZ successful/JJ improvement/NN in/IN balancedness/NN in/IN use/NN of/IN body/NN segments/NNS on/IN 4/CD out/IN of/IN 5/CD subjects/NNS ./.
