This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ new/JJ optimality/NN -/HYPH preserving/VBG operators/NNS on/IN Q/NN -/HYPH functions/NNS ./.
We/PRP first/RB describe/VB an/DT operator/NN for/IN tabular/JJ representations/NNS ,/, the/DT consistent/JJ Bellman/NNP operator/NN ,/, which/WDT incorporates/VBZ a/DT notion/NN of/IN local/JJ policy/NN consistency/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN this/DT local/JJ consistency/NN leads/VBZ to/IN an/DT increase/NN in/IN the/DT action/NN gap/NN at/IN each/DT state/NN ;/: increasing/VBG this/DT gap/NN ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP ,/, mitigates/VBZ the/DT undesirable/JJ effects/NNS of/IN approximation/NN and/CC estimation/NN errors/NNS on/IN the/DT induced/VBN greedy/JJ policies/NNS ./.
This/DT operator/NN can/MD also/RB be/VB applied/VBN to/IN discretized/VBN continuous/JJ space/NN and/CC time/NN problems/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP provide/VBP empirical/JJ results/NNS evidencing/VBG superior/JJ performance/NN in/IN this/DT context/NN ./.
Extending/VBG the/DT idea/NN of/IN a/DT locally/RB consistent/JJ operator/NN ,/, we/PRP then/RB derive/VBP sufficient/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN an/DT operator/NN to/TO preserve/VB optimality/NN ,/, leading/VBG to/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN operators/NNS which/WDT includes/VBZ our/PRP$ consistent/JJ Bellman/NNP operator/NN ./.
As/IN corollaries/NNS we/PRP provide/VBP a/DT proof/NN of/IN optimality/NN for/IN Baird/NNP 's/POS advantage/NN learning/NN algorithm/NN and/CC derive/VBP other/JJ gap/NN -/HYPH increasing/VBG operators/NNS with/IN interesting/JJ properties/NNS ./.
We/PRP conclude/VBP with/IN an/DT empirical/JJ study/NN on/IN 60/CD Atari/NNP 2600/CD games/NNS illustrating/VBG the/DT strong/JJ potential/NN of/IN these/DT new/JJ operators/NNS ./.
