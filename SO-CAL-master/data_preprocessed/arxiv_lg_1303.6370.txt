We/PRP discuss/VBP structured/JJ Schatten/NNP norms/NNS for/IN tensor/NN decomposition/NN that/WDT includes/VBZ two/CD recently/RB proposed/VBN norms/NNS (/-LRB- "/`` overlapped/VBD "/'' and/CC "/`` latent/JJ "/'' )/-RRB- for/IN convex/NN -/HYPH optimization/NN -/HYPH based/VBN tensor/NN decomposition/NN ,/, and/CC connect/VB tensor/NN decomposition/NN with/IN wider/JJR literature/NN on/IN structured/JJ sparsity/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT properties/NNS of/IN the/DT structured/JJ Schatten/NNP norms/NNS ,/, we/PRP mathematically/RB analyze/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN "/`` latent/JJ "/'' approach/NN for/IN tensor/NN decomposition/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD empirically/RB found/VBN to/TO perform/VB better/JJR than/IN the/DT "/`` overlapped/VBD "/'' approach/NN in/IN some/DT settings/NNS ./.
