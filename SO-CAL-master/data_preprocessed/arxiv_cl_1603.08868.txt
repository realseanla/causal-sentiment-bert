In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP aim/VBP at/IN addressing/VBG this/DT issue/NN by/IN presenting/VBG the/DT first/JJ approach/NN for/IN predicting/VBG linguistic/JJ complexity/NN for/IN Swedish/JJ second/JJ language/NN learning/NN material/NN on/IN a/DT 5/CD -/HYPH point/NN scale/NN ./.
After/IN showing/VBG that/IN the/DT traditional/JJ Swedish/JJ readability/NN measure/NN ,/, L/NN \/SYM "/`` asbarhetsindex/NN (/-LRB- LIX/NN )/-RRB- ,/, is/VBZ not/RB suitable/JJ for/IN this/DT task/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT supervised/JJ machine/NN learning/NN model/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN linguistic/JJ features/NNS ,/, that/DT can/MD reliably/RB classify/VB texts/NNS according/VBG to/IN their/PRP$ difficulty/NN level/NN ./.
