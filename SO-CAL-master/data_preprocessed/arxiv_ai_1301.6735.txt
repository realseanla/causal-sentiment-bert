Qualitative/JJ probabilistic/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN introduced/VBN as/IN qualitative/JJ abstractions/NNS of/IN Bayesian/JJ belief/NN networks/NNS ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ drawbacks/NNS of/IN these/DT qualitative/JJ networks/NNS is/VBZ their/PRP$ coarse/JJ level/NN of/IN detail/NN ,/, which/WDT may/MD lead/VB to/IN unresolved/JJ trade/NN -/HYPH offs/NNS during/IN inference/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP an/DT enhanced/VBN formalism/NN for/IN qualitative/JJ networks/NNS with/IN a/DT finer/JJR level/NN of/IN detail/NN ./.
An/DT enhanced/VBN qualitative/JJ probabilistic/JJ network/NN differs/VBZ from/IN a/DT regular/JJ qualitative/JJ network/NN in/IN that/IN it/PRP distinguishes/VBZ between/IN strong/JJ and/CC weak/JJ influences/NNS ./.
Enhanced/VBN qualitative/JJ probabilistic/JJ networks/NNS are/VBP purely/RB qualitative/JJ in/IN nature/NN ,/, as/IN regular/JJ qualitative/JJ networks/NNS are/VBP ,/, yet/CC allow/VB for/IN efficiently/RB resolving/VBG trade/NN -/HYPH offs/NNS during/IN inference/NN ./.
