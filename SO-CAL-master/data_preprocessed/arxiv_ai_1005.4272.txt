In/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD decades/NNS ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN for/IN forecasting/NN based/VBN on/IN fuzzy/JJ time/NN series/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT fuzzy/JJ time/NN series/NN methods/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN for/IN forecasting/NN of/IN car/NN road/NN accidents/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT forecasting/NN accuracy/NN rates/NNS of/IN the/DT existing/VBG methods/NNS are/VBP not/RB good/JJ enough/RB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP compared/VBD our/PRP$ proposed/VBN new/JJ method/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ time/NN series/NN forecasting/NN with/IN existing/VBG methods/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN means/NNS based/VBN partitioning/NN of/IN the/DT historical/JJ data/NNS of/IN car/NN road/NN accidents/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN the/DT kth/NN order/NN and/CC time/NN -/HYPH variant/NN methods/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN can/MD get/VB the/DT best/JJS forecasting/NN accuracy/NN rate/NN for/IN forecasting/VBG the/DT car/NN road/NN accidents/NNS than/IN the/DT existing/VBG methods/NNS ./.
