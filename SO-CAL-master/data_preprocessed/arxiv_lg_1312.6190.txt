Transfer/NN Learning/NN is/VBZ concerned/VBN with/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN knowledge/NN gained/VBN from/IN solving/VBG a/DT problem/NN to/IN a/DT different/JJ but/CC related/JJ problem/NN domain/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN and/CC efficient/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN ranking/VBG and/CC selecting/VBG representations/NNS from/IN a/DT Restricted/VBN Boltzmann/NNP Machine/NNP trained/VBN on/IN a/DT source/NN domain/NN to/TO be/VB transferred/VBN onto/IN a/DT target/NN domain/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS carried/VBD out/RP using/VBG the/DT MNIST/NN ,/, ICDAR/NN and/CC TiCC/NN image/NN datasets/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN adaptive/JJ feature/NN ranking/NN and/CC transfer/NN learning/NN method/NN offers/VBZ statistically/RB significant/JJ improvements/NNS on/IN the/DT training/NN of/IN RBMs/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ general/JJ in/IN that/IN the/DT knowledge/NN chosen/VBN by/IN the/DT ranking/VBG function/NN does/VBZ not/RB depend/VB on/IN its/PRP$ relation/NN to/IN any/DT specific/JJ target/NN domain/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP works/VBZ with/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN and/CC knowledge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN transfer/NN ./.
