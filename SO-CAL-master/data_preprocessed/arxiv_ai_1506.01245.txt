The/DT shortest/JJS path/NN between/IN two/CD concepts/NNS in/IN a/DT taxonomic/JJ ontology/NN is/VBZ commonly/RB used/VBN to/TO represent/VB the/DT semantic/JJ distance/NN between/IN concepts/NNS in/IN the/DT edge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN semantic/JJ similarity/NN measures/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, the/DT edge/NN counting/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT default/NN method/NN for/IN the/DT path/NN computation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ simple/JJ ,/, intuitive/JJ and/CC has/VBZ low/JJ computational/JJ complexity/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, a/DT large/JJ lexical/JJ taxonomy/NN of/IN such/JJ as/IN WordNet/NNP has/VBZ the/DT irregular/JJ densities/NNS of/IN links/NNS between/IN concepts/NNS due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ broad/JJ domain/NN but/CC ./.
The/DT edge/NN counting/NN -/HYPH based/VBN path/NN computation/NN is/VBZ powerless/JJ for/IN this/DT non-uniformity/JJ problem/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP advocate/VBP that/IN the/DT path/NN computation/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO be/VB separated/VBN from/IN the/DT edge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN similarity/NN measures/NNS and/CC form/VBP various/JJ general/JJ computing/NN models/NNS ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN non-uniformity/NN of/IN concept/NN density/NN in/IN a/DT large/JJ taxonomic/JJ ontology/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ path/NN computing/VBG model/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT compensation/NN of/IN local/JJ area/NN density/NN of/IN concepts/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ equal/JJ to/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN direct/JJ hyponyms/NNS of/IN the/DT subsumers/NNS of/IN concepts/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ shortest/JJS path/NN ./.
This/DT path/NN model/NN considers/VBZ the/DT local/JJ area/NN density/NN of/IN concepts/NNS as/IN an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT edge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN path/NN and/CC converts/VBZ the/DT local/JJ area/NN density/NN divided/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ depth/NN into/IN the/DT compensation/NN for/IN edge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN path/NN with/IN an/DT adjustable/JJ parameter/NN ,/, which/WDT idea/NN has/VBZ been/VBN proven/VBN to/TO be/VB consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT information/NN theory/NN ./.
This/DT model/NN is/VBZ a/DT general/JJ path/NN computing/VBG model/NN and/CC can/MD be/VB applied/VBN in/IN various/JJ edge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN similarity/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
The/DT experiment/NN results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN path/NN model/NN improves/VBZ the/DT average/JJ correlation/NN between/IN edge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN measures/NNS with/IN human/JJ judgments/NNS on/IN Miller/NNP and/CC Charles/NNP benchmark/NN from/IN less/JJR than/IN 0.8/CD to/IN more/JJR than/IN 0.85/CD ,/, and/CC has/VBZ a/DT big/JJ advantage/NN in/IN efficiency/NN than/IN information/NN content/NN (/-LRB- IC/NN )/-RRB- computation/NN in/IN a/DT dynamic/JJ ontology/NN ,/, thereby/RB successfully/RB solving/VBG the/DT non-uniformity/JJ problem/NN of/IN taxonomic/JJ ontology/NN ./.
