In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP the/DT results/NNS obtained/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ DKP/NN -/HYPH AOM/NN system/NN within/IN the/DT OAEI/NN 2015/CD campaign/NN ./.
DKP/NNP -/HYPH AOM/NNP is/VBZ an/DT ontology/NN merging/VBG tool/NN designed/VBN to/TO merge/VB heterogeneous/JJ ontologies/NNS ./.
In/IN OAEI/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP participated/VBN with/IN its/PRP$ ontology/JJ mapping/NN component/NN which/WDT serves/VBZ as/IN a/DT basic/JJ module/NN capable/JJ of/IN matching/VBG large/JJ scale/NN ontologies/NNS before/IN their/PRP$ merging/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ our/PRP$ first/JJ successful/JJ participation/NN in/IN the/DT Conference/NNP ,/, OA4QA/NN and/CC Anatomy/NN track/NN of/IN OAEI/NNP ./.
DKP/NNP -/HYPH AOM/NNP is/VBZ participating/VBG with/IN two/CD versions/NNS (/-LRB- DKP/NN -/HYPH AOM/NN and/CC DKP/NN -/HYPH AOM_lite/NN )/-RRB- ,/, DKP/NN -/HYPH AOM/NN performs/VBZ coherence/NN analysis/NN ./.
In/IN OA4QA/NN track/NN ,/, DKPAOM/NNP out/IN -/HYPH performed/VBN in/IN the/DT evaluation/NN and/CC generated/VBN accurate/JJ alignments/NNS allowed/VBN to/TO answer/VB all/PDT the/DT queries/NNS of/IN the/DT evaluation/NN ./.
We/PRP can/MD also/RB see/VB its/PRP$ competitive/JJ results/NNS for/IN the/DT conference/NN track/NN in/IN the/DT evaluation/NN initiative/NN among/IN other/JJ reputed/JJ systems/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT anatomy/NN track/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ produced/VBN alignments/NNS within/IN an/DT allocated/VBN time/NN and/CC appeared/VBD in/IN the/DT list/NN of/IN systems/NNS which/WDT produce/VBP coherent/JJ results/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP discuss/VBP some/DT future/JJ work/NN towards/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN DKP/NNP -/HYPH AOM/NNP ./.
