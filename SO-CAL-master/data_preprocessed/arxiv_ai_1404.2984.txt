Given/VBN a/DT CNF/NN formula/NN and/CC a/DT weight/NN for/IN each/DT assignment/NN of/IN values/NNS to/IN variables/NNS ,/, two/CD natural/JJ problems/NNS are/VBP weighted/JJ model/NN counting/VBG and/CC distribution/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ sampling/NN of/IN satisfying/VBG assignments/NNS ./.
Both/DT problems/NNS have/VBP a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN important/JJ applications/NNS ./.
Due/IN to/IN the/DT inherent/JJ complexity/NN of/IN the/DT exact/JJ versions/NNS of/IN the/DT problems/NNS ,/, interest/NN has/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN solving/VBG them/PRP approximately/RB ./.
Prior/JJ work/NN in/IN this/DT area/NN scaled/VBN only/RB to/IN small/JJ problems/NNS in/IN practice/NN ,/, or/CC failed/VBD to/TO provide/VB strong/JJ theoretical/JJ guarantees/NNS ,/, or/CC employed/VBN a/DT computationally/RB -/HYPH expensive/JJ maximum/NN a/DT posteriori/JJ probability/NN (/-LRB- MAP/NN )/-RRB- oracle/NN that/WDT assumes/VBZ prior/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN a/DT factored/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT weight/NN distribution/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ approach/NN works/VBZ under/IN mild/JJ assumptions/NNS on/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN weights/NNS of/IN satisfying/VBG assignments/NNS ,/, provides/VBZ strong/JJ theoretical/JJ guarantees/NNS ,/, and/CC scales/NNS to/IN problems/NNS involving/VBG several/JJ thousand/CD variables/NNS ./.
