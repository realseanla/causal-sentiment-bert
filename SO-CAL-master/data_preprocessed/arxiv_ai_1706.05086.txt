A/DT key/JJ part/NN of/IN any/DT evolutionary/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ fitness/NN evaluation/NN ./.
When/WRB fitness/NN evaluations/NNS are/VBP corrupted/VBN by/IN noise/NN ,/, as/IN happens/VBZ in/IN many/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN problems/NNS as/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN various/JJ types/NNS of/IN uncertainty/NN ,/, a/DT strategy/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO cope/VB with/IN this/DT ./.
Resampling/NNP is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS common/JJ strategies/NNS ,/, whereby/WRB each/DT solution/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN many/JJ times/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT variance/NN of/IN the/DT fitness/NN estimates/NNS ./.
When/WRB evaluating/VBG the/DT performance/NN of/IN a/DT noisy/JJ optimisation/NN algorithm/NN ,/, a/DT key/JJ consideration/NN is/VBZ the/DT stopping/VBG condition/NN for/IN the/DT algorithm/NN ./.
A/DT frequently/RB used/VBN stopping/VBG condition/NN in/IN runtime/NN analysis/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN "/`` First/NNP Hitting/NNP Time/NNP "/'' ,/, is/VBZ to/TO stop/VB the/DT algorithm/NN as/RB soon/RB as/IN it/PRP encounters/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ solution/NN ./.
