We/PRP construct/VBP optimal/JJ estimation/NN algorithms/NNS over/IN distributed/VBN networks/NNS for/IN state/NN estimation/NN in/IN the/DT mean/NN -/HYPH square/JJ error/NN (/-LRB- MSE/NN )/-RRB- sense/NN ./.
Here/RB ,/, we/PRP have/VBP a/DT distributed/VBN collection/NN of/IN agents/NNS with/IN processing/NN and/CC cooperation/NN capabilities/NNS ./.
These/DT agents/NNS continually/RB observe/VBP a/DT noisy/JJ version/NN of/IN a/DT desired/VBN state/NN of/IN the/DT nature/NN through/IN a/DT linear/JJ model/NN and/CC seek/VB to/TO learn/VB this/DT state/NN by/IN interacting/VBG with/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
Although/IN this/DT problem/NN has/VBZ attracted/VBN significant/JJ attention/NN and/CC extensively/RB been/VBN studied/VBN in/IN several/JJ different/JJ fields/NNS including/VBG machine/NN learning/NN theory/NN to/IN signal/NN processing/NN ,/, all/PDT the/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN strategies/NNS achieve/VBP suboptimal/JJ learning/NN performance/NN in/IN the/DT MSE/NNP sense/NN ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP algorithms/NNS that/WDT achieve/VBP distributed/VBN minimum/JJ MSE/NNP (/-LRB- MMSE/NNP )/-RRB- performance/NN over/IN an/DT arbitrary/JJ network/NN topology/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT aggregation/NN of/IN information/NN at/IN each/DT agent/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN differs/VBZ from/IN the/DT diffusion/NN of/IN information/NN across/IN network/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, exchange/NN of/IN local/JJ estimates/NNS per/IN time/NN instance/NN ./.
Importantly/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN exchange/NN of/IN local/JJ estimates/NNS is/VBZ sufficient/JJ only/RB over/IN the/DT certain/JJ network/NN topologies/NNS ./.
By/IN inspecting/VBG these/DT network/NN structures/NNS ,/, we/PRP also/RB propose/VBP strategies/NNS that/WDT achieve/VBP the/DT distributed/VBN MMSE/NN performance/NN also/RB through/IN the/DT diffusion/NN of/IN information/NN such/JJ that/IN we/PRP can/MD substantially/RB reduce/VB the/DT communication/NN load/NN while/IN achieving/VBG the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ MSE/NNP performance/NN ./.
For/IN practical/JJ implementations/NNS we/PRP provide/VBP approaches/NNS to/TO reduce/VB the/DT complexity/NN of/IN the/DT algorithms/NNS through/IN the/DT time/NN -/HYPH windowing/NN of/IN the/DT observations/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT numerical/JJ examples/NNS ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT superior/JJ performance/NN of/IN the/DT introduced/VBN algorithms/NNS in/IN the/DT MSE/NNP sense/NN due/IN to/IN optimal/JJ estimation/NN ./.
