This/DT work/NN shows/VBZ how/WRB using/VBG reduced/VBN precision/NN data/NNS in/IN Convolutional/NNP Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNNs/NNS )/-RRB- affects/VBZ network/NN accuracy/NN during/IN classification/NN ./.

The/DT key/JJ result/NN of/IN this/DT study/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT tolerance/NN of/IN CNNs/NNS to/IN reduced/VBN precision/NN data/NNS not/RB only/RB varies/VBZ across/IN networks/NNS ,/, a/DT well/RB established/VBN observation/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB within/IN networks/NNS ./.
