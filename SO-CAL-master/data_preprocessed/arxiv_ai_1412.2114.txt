We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ approach/NN for/IN solving/VBG combinatorial/JJ optimization/NN problem/NN by/IN utilizing/VBG the/DT mechanism/NN of/IN chases/VBZ and/CC escapes/VBZ ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT long/JJ history/NN in/IN mathematics/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN to/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH used/VBN steepest/JJS descent/NN and/CC neighboring/NN search/NN ,/, we/PRP perform/VBP a/DT chase/NN and/CC escape/NN game/NN on/IN the/DT "/`` landscape/NN "/'' of/IN the/DT cost/NN function/NN ./.
