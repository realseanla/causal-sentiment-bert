Finding/VBG features/NNS that/WDT disentangle/VBP the/DT different/JJ causes/NNS of/IN variation/NN in/IN real/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ a/DT difficult/JJ task/NN ,/, that/WDT has/VBZ nonetheless/RB received/VBN considerable/JJ attention/NN in/IN static/NN domains/NNS like/IN natural/JJ images/NNS ./.
Interactive/JJ environments/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT an/DT agent/NN can/MD deliberately/RB take/VB actions/NNS ,/, offer/VBP an/DT opportunity/NN to/TO tackle/VB this/DT task/NN better/RBR ,/, because/IN the/DT agent/NN can/MD experiment/VB with/IN different/JJ actions/NNS and/CC observe/VBP their/PRP$ effects/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT idea/NN that/IN in/IN interactive/JJ environments/NNS ,/, latent/JJ factors/NNS that/WDT control/VBP the/DT variation/NN in/IN observed/VBN data/NNS can/MD be/VB identified/VBN by/IN figuring/VBG out/RP what/WP the/DT agent/NN can/MD control/VB ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT naive/JJ method/NN to/TO find/VB factors/NNS that/WDT explain/VBP or/CC measure/VBP the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT actions/NNS of/IN a/DT learner/NN ,/, and/CC test/VB it/PRP in/IN illustrative/JJ experiments/NNS ./.
