Traditional/JJ manifold/JJ learning/NN algorithms/NNS often/RB bear/VBP an/DT assumption/NN that/IN the/DT local/JJ neighborhood/NN of/IN any/DT point/NN on/IN embedded/VBN manifold/NN is/VBZ roughly/RB equal/JJ to/IN the/DT tangent/NN space/NN at/IN that/DT point/NN without/IN considering/VBG the/DT curvature/NN ./.
The/DT curvature/NN indifferent/JJ way/NN of/IN manifold/JJ processing/NN often/RB makes/VBZ traditional/JJ dimension/NN reduction/NN poorly/RB neighborhood/NN preserving/VBG ./.
To/TO overcome/VB this/DT drawback/NN we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN called/VBN RF/NNP -/HYPH ML/NNP to/TO perform/VB an/DT operation/NN on/IN the/DT manifold/NN with/IN help/NN of/IN Ricci/NNP flow/NN before/IN reducing/VBG the/DT dimension/NN of/IN manifold/NN ./.
