Deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS are/VBP state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN methods/NNS for/IN many/JJ learning/NN tasks/NNS due/IN to/IN their/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO extract/VB increasingly/RB better/JJR features/NNS at/IN each/DT network/NN layer/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT improved/VBN performance/NN of/IN additional/JJ layers/NNS in/IN a/DT deep/JJ network/NN comes/VBZ at/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN added/VBN latency/NN and/CC energy/NN usage/NN in/IN feedforward/JJ inference/NN ./.
As/IN networks/NNS continue/VBP to/TO get/VB deeper/JJR and/CC larger/JJR ,/, these/DT costs/NNS become/VBP more/RBR prohibitive/JJ for/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN and/CC energy/NN -/HYPH sensitive/JJ applications/NNS ./.
To/TO address/VB this/DT issue/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP BranchyNet/NNP ,/, a/DT novel/JJ deep/JJ network/NN architecture/NN that/WDT is/VBZ augmented/VBN with/IN additional/JJ side/NN branch/NN classifiers/NNS ./.
The/DT architecture/NN allows/VBZ prediction/NN results/NNS for/IN a/DT large/JJ portion/NN of/IN test/NN samples/NNS to/TO exit/VB the/DT network/NN early/RB via/IN these/DT branches/NNS when/WRB samples/NNS can/MD already/RB be/VB inferred/VBN with/IN high/JJ confidence/NN ./.
BranchyNet/NNP exploits/VBZ the/DT observation/NN that/IN features/NNS learned/VBN at/IN an/DT early/JJ layer/NN of/IN a/DT network/NN may/MD often/RB be/VB sufficient/JJ for/IN the/DT classification/NN of/IN many/JJ data/NNS points/NNS ./.
For/IN more/RBR difficult/JJ samples/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP expected/VBN less/RBR frequently/RB ,/, BranchyNet/NNP will/MD use/VB further/JJ or/CC all/DT network/NN layers/NNS to/TO provide/VB the/DT best/JJS likelihood/NN of/IN correct/JJ prediction/NN ./.
We/PRP study/VBP the/DT BranchyNet/NNP architecture/NN using/VBG several/JJ well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN networks/NNS (/-LRB- LeNet/NNP ,/, AlexNet/NNP ,/, ResNet/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC datasets/NNS (/-LRB- MNIST/NNP ,/, CIFAR10/NN )/-RRB- and/CC show/VBP that/IN it/PRP can/MD both/CC improve/VB accuracy/NN and/CC significantly/RB reduce/VB the/DT inference/NN time/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
