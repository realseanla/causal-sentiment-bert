Recent/JJ advances/NNS in/IN deep/JJ learning/NN motivate/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN deep/JJ neutral/JJ networks/NNS in/IN sensing/VBG applications/NNS ,/, but/CC their/PRP$ excessive/JJ resource/NN needs/VBZ on/IN constrained/VBN embedded/VBN devices/NNS remain/VBP an/DT important/JJ impediment/NN ./.
A/DT recently/RB explored/VBN solution/NN space/NN lies/VBZ in/IN compressing/VBG (/-LRB- approximating/VBG or/CC simplifying/VBG )/-RRB- deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS in/IN some/DT manner/NN before/IN use/NN on/IN the/DT device/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ compression/NN solution/NN ,/, called/VBN DeepIoT/NNP ,/, that/WDT makes/VBZ two/CD key/JJ contributions/NNS in/IN that/DT space/NN ./.
First/RB ,/, unlike/IN current/JJ solutions/NNS geared/VBN for/IN compressing/VBG specific/JJ types/NNS of/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, DeepIoT/NNP presents/VBZ a/DT unified/JJ approach/NN that/WDT compresses/VBZ all/DT commonly/RB used/VBN deep/JJ learning/NN structures/NNS for/IN sensing/VBG applications/NNS ,/, including/VBG fully/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN ,/, convolutional/JJ ,/, and/CC recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN their/PRP$ combinations/NNS ./.
Second/RB ,/, unlike/IN solutions/NNS that/WDT either/CC sparsify/JJ weight/NN matrices/NNS or/CC assume/VB linear/JJ structure/NN within/IN weight/NN matrices/NNS ,/, DeepIoT/NNP compresses/VBZ neural/JJ network/NN structures/NNS into/IN smaller/JJR dense/JJ matrices/NNS by/IN finding/VBG the/DT minimum/JJ number/NN of/IN non-redundant/JJ hidden/JJ elements/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN filters/NNS and/CC dimensions/NNS required/VBN by/IN each/DT layer/NN ,/, while/IN keeping/VBG the/DT performance/NN of/IN sensing/VBG applications/NNS the/DT same/JJ ./.
Importantly/RB ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ so/RB using/VBG an/DT approach/NN that/WDT obtains/VBZ a/DT global/JJ view/NN of/IN parameter/NN redundancies/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ shown/VBN to/TO produce/VB superior/JJ compression/NN ./.
We/PRP conduct/VBP experiments/NNS with/IN five/CD different/JJ sensing/VBG -/HYPH related/VBN tasks/NNS on/IN Intel/NNP Edison/NNP devices/NNS ./.
DeepIoT/NNP outperforms/VBZ all/DT compared/VBN baseline/NN algorithms/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/IN execution/NN time/NN and/CC energy/NN consumption/NN by/IN a/DT significant/JJ margin/NN ./.
It/PRP reduces/VBZ the/DT size/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS by/IN 90/CD percent/NN to/IN 98.9/CD percent/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ thus/RB able/JJ to/TO shorten/VB execution/NN time/NN by/IN 71.4/CD percent/NN to/IN 94.5/CD percent/NN ,/, and/CC decrease/NN energy/NN consumption/NN by/IN 72.2/CD percent/NN to/IN 95.7/CD percent/NN ./.
These/DT improvements/NNS are/VBP achieved/VBN without/IN loss/NN of/IN accuracy/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS underscore/VBP the/DT potential/NN of/IN DeepIoT/NNP for/IN advancing/VBG the/DT exploitation/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS on/IN resource/NN -/HYPH constrained/VBN embedded/VBN devices/NNS ./.
