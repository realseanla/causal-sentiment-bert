We/PRP present/VBP a/DT dictionary/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN to/IN racism/NN detection/NN in/IN Dutch/JJ social/JJ media/NNS comments/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD retrieved/VBN from/IN two/CD public/JJ Belgian/JJ social/JJ media/NN sites/NNS likely/JJ to/TO attract/VB racist/NN reactions/NNS ./.
These/DT comments/NNS were/VBD labeled/VBN as/IN racist/JJ or/CC non-racist/JJ by/IN multiple/JJ annotators/NNS ./.
For/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN ,/, three/CD discourse/NN dictionaries/NNS were/VBD created/VBN :/: first/RB ,/, we/PRP created/VBD a/DT dictionary/NN by/RB retrieving/VBG possibly/RB racist/JJ and/CC more/RBR neutral/JJ terms/NNS from/IN the/DT training/NN data/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB augmenting/VBG these/DT with/IN more/JJR general/JJ words/NNS to/TO remove/VB some/DT bias/NN ./.
A/DT second/JJ dictionary/NN was/VBD created/VBN through/IN automatic/JJ expansion/NN using/VBG a/DT \/NN texttt/NN {/-LRB- word2vec/NN }/-RRB- model/NN trained/VBN on/IN a/DT large/JJ corpus/NN of/IN general/JJ Dutch/JJ text/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, a/DT third/JJ dictionary/NN was/VBD created/VBN by/IN manually/RB filtering/VBG out/RP incorrect/JJ expansions/NNS ./.
We/PRP trained/VBD multiple/JJ Support/NN Vector/NNP Machines/NNPS ,/, using/VBG the/DT distribution/NN of/IN words/NNS over/IN the/DT different/JJ categories/NNS in/IN the/DT dictionaries/NNS as/IN features/NNS ./.
The/DT best/RBS -/HYPH performing/VBG model/NN used/VBD the/DT manually/RB cleaned/VBN dictionary/NN and/CC obtained/VBD an/DT F/NN -/HYPH score/NN of/IN 0.46/CD for/IN the/DT racist/JJ class/NN on/IN a/DT test/NN set/VBN consisting/VBG of/IN unseen/JJ Dutch/JJ comments/NNS ,/, retrieved/VBN from/IN the/DT same/JJ sites/NNS used/VBN for/IN the/DT training/NN set/NN ./.
The/DT automated/VBN expansion/NN of/IN the/DT dictionary/NN only/RB slightly/RB boosted/VBD the/DT model/NN 's/POS performance/NN ,/, and/CC this/DT increase/NN in/IN performance/NN was/VBD not/RB statistically/RB significant/JJ ./.
The/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT coverage/NN of/IN the/DT expanded/VBN dictionaries/NNS did/VBD increase/VB indicates/VBZ that/IN the/DT words/NNS that/WDT were/VBD automatically/RB added/VBN did/VBD occur/VB in/IN the/DT corpus/NN ,/, but/CC were/VBD not/RB able/JJ to/TO meaningfully/RB impact/VB performance/NN ./.
