Identifying/VBG musical/JJ instruments/NNS in/IN polyphonic/JJ music/NN recordings/NNS is/VBZ a/DT challenging/JJ but/CC important/JJ problem/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN music/NN information/NN retrieval/NN ./.
It/PRP enables/VBZ music/NN search/NN by/IN instrument/NN ,/, helps/VBZ recognize/VB musical/JJ genres/NNS ,/, or/CC can/MD make/VB music/NN transcription/NN easier/JJR and/CC more/RBR accurate/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN framework/NN for/IN predominant/JJ instrument/NN recognition/NN in/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN polyphonic/JJ music/NN ./.
We/PRP train/VBP our/PRP$ network/NN from/IN fixed/VBN -/HYPH length/NN music/NN excerpts/NNS with/IN a/DT single/JJ -/HYPH labeled/VBN predominant/JJ instrument/NN and/CC estimate/VB an/DT arbitrary/JJ number/NN of/IN predominant/JJ instruments/NNS from/IN an/DT audio/JJ signal/NN with/IN a/DT variable/JJ length/NN ./.
To/TO obtain/VB the/DT audio/JJ -/HYPH excerpt-wise/JJ result/NN ,/, we/PRP aggregate/JJ multiple/JJ outputs/NNS from/IN sliding/VBG windows/NNS over/IN the/DT test/NN audio/NN ./.
In/IN doing/VBG so/RB ,/, we/PRP investigated/VBD two/CD different/JJ aggregation/NN methods/NNS :/: one/CD takes/VBZ the/DT average/NN for/IN each/DT instrument/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ takes/VBZ the/DT instrument-wise/JJ sum/NN followed/VBN by/IN normalization/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP conducted/VBD extensive/JJ experiments/NNS on/IN several/JJ important/JJ factors/NNS that/WDT affect/VBP the/DT performance/NN ,/, including/VBG analysis/NN window/NN size/NN ,/, identification/NN threshold/NN ,/, and/CC activation/NN functions/NNS for/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS to/TO find/VB the/DT optimal/JJ set/NN of/IN parameters/NNS ./.
Using/VBG a/DT dataset/NN of/IN 10k/NN audio/NN excerpts/NNS from/IN 11/CD instruments/NNS for/IN evaluation/NN ,/, we/PRP found/VBD that/IN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS are/VBP more/RBR robust/JJ than/IN conventional/JJ methods/NNS that/WDT exploit/VBP spectral/JJ features/NNS and/CC source/NN separation/NN with/IN support/NN vector/NN machines/NNS ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS showed/VBD that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN convolutional/JJ network/NN architecture/NN obtained/VBD an/DT F1/NN measure/NN of/IN 0.602/CD for/IN micro/JJ and/CC 0.503/CD for/IN macro/NN ,/, respectively/RB ,/, achieving/VBG 19.6/CD percent/NN and/CC 16.4/CD percent/NN in/IN performance/NN improvement/NN compared/VBN with/IN other/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
