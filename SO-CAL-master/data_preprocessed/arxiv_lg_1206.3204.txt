Aiming/VBG to/TO unify/VB known/VBN results/NNS about/IN clustering/VBG mixtures/NNS of/IN distributions/NNS under/IN separation/NN conditions/NNS ,/, Kumar/NNP and/CC Kannan/NNP [/-LRB- 2010/CD ]/-RRB- introduced/VBD a/DT deterministic/JJ condition/NN for/IN clustering/VBG datasets/NNS ./.
They/PRP showed/VBD that/IN this/DT single/JJ deterministic/JJ condition/NN encompasses/VBZ many/JJ previously/RB studied/VBN clustering/NN assumptions/NNS ./.
More/RBR specifically/RB ,/, their/PRP$ proximity/NN condition/NN requires/VBZ that/IN in/IN the/DT target/NN $/$ k/CD $/$ -/HYPH clustering/NN ,/, the/DT projection/NN of/IN a/DT point/NN $/$ x/SYM $/$ onto/IN the/DT line/NN joining/VBG its/PRP$ cluster/NN center/NN $/$ \/SYM mu/NNS $/$ and/CC some/DT other/JJ center/NN $/$ \/SYM mu/NNS '/POS $/$ ,/, is/VBZ a/DT large/JJ additive/JJ factor/NN closer/RBR to/IN $/$ \/SYM mu/NNS $/$ than/IN to/IN $/$ \/SYM mu/NNS '/POS $/$ ./.
This/DT additive/JJ factor/NN can/MD be/VB roughly/RB described/VBN as/IN $/$ k/CD $/$ times/CC the/DT spectral/JJ norm/NN of/IN the/DT matrix/NN representing/VBG the/DT differences/NNS between/IN the/DT given/VBN (/-LRB- known/VBN )/-RRB- dataset/NN and/CC the/DT means/NNS of/IN the/DT (/-LRB- unknown/JJ )/-RRB- target/NN clustering/NN ./.
Clearly/RB ,/, the/DT proximity/NN condition/NN implies/VBZ center/NN separation/NN --/: the/DT distance/NN between/IN any/DT two/CD centers/NNS must/MD be/VB as/IN large/JJ as/IN the/DT above/RB mentioned/VBN bound/VBN ./.
