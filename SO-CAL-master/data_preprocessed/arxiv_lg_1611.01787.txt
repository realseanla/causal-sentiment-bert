Code/NNP super-optimization/NN is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN transforming/VBG any/DT given/VBN program/NN to/IN a/DT more/RBR efficient/JJ version/NN while/IN preserving/VBG its/PRP$ input/NN -/HYPH output/NN behaviour/NN ./.
In/IN some/DT sense/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ similar/JJ to/IN the/DT paraphrase/NN problem/NN from/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN where/WRB the/DT intention/NN is/VBZ to/TO change/VB the/DT syntax/NN of/IN an/DT utterance/NN without/IN changing/VBG its/PRP$ semantics/NNS ./.
