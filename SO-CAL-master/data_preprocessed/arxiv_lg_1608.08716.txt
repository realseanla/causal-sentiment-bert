As/IN machines/NNS have/VBP become/VBN more/RBR intelligent/JJ ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT renewed/VBN interest/NN in/IN methods/NNS for/IN measuring/VBG their/PRP$ intelligence/NN ./.
A/DT common/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ to/TO propose/VB tasks/NNS for/IN which/WDT a/DT human/NN excels/VBZ ,/, but/CC one/CD which/WDT machines/NNS find/VBP difficult/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, an/DT ideal/JJ task/NN should/MD also/RB be/VB easy/JJ to/TO evaluate/VB and/CC not/RB be/VB easily/RB gameable/JJ ./.
We/PRP begin/VBP with/IN a/DT case/NN study/NN exploring/VBG the/DT recently/RB popular/JJ task/NN of/IN image/NN captioning/NN and/CC its/PRP$ limitations/NNS as/IN a/DT task/NN for/IN measuring/VBG machine/NN intelligence/NN ./.
