Feature/NN subspace/NN selection/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ part/NN in/IN speech/NN emotion/NN recognition/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT studies/NNS are/VBP devoted/VBN to/IN finding/VBG a/DT feature/NN subspace/NN for/IN representing/VBG all/DT emotions/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, some/DT studies/NNS have/VBP indicated/VBN that/IN the/DT features/NNS associated/VBN with/IN different/JJ emotions/NNS are/VBP not/RB exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ ./.
Hence/RB ,/, traditional/JJ methods/NNS may/MD fail/VB to/TO distinguish/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT emotions/NNS with/IN just/RB one/CD global/JJ feature/NN subspace/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ divide/NN and/CC conquer/VB idea/NN to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN ./.

The/DT final/JJ emotion/NN recognition/NN result/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN by/IN the/DT voting/NN and/CC competition/NN method/NN ./.
