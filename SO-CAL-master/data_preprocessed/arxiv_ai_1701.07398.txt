The/DT Human/JJ visual/JJ perception/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN is/VBZ of/IN a/DT large/JJ fixed/VBN image/NN that/WDT is/VBZ highly/RB detailed/JJ and/CC sharp/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, receptor/NN density/NN in/IN the/DT retina/NN is/VBZ not/RB uniform/JJ :/: a/DT small/JJ central/JJ region/NN called/VBD the/DT fovea/NN is/VBZ very/RB dense/JJ and/CC exhibits/VBZ high/JJ resolution/NN ,/, whereas/IN a/DT peripheral/JJ region/NN around/IN it/PRP has/VBZ much/RB lower/JJR spatial/JJ resolution/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, contrary/JJ to/IN our/PRP$ perception/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP only/RB able/JJ to/TO observe/VB a/DT very/RB small/JJ region/NN around/IN the/DT line/NN of/IN sight/NN with/IN high/JJ resolution/NN ./.
The/DT perception/NN of/IN a/DT complete/JJ and/CC stable/JJ view/NN is/VBZ aided/VBN by/IN an/DT attention/NN mechanism/NN that/WDT directs/VBZ the/DT eyes/NNS to/IN the/DT numerous/JJ points/NNS of/IN interest/NN within/IN the/DT scene/NN ./.
The/DT eyes/NNS move/VBP between/IN these/DT targets/NNS in/IN quick/JJ ,/, unconscious/JJ movements/NNS ,/, known/VBN as/IN "/`` saccades/NNS "/'' ./.
Once/IN a/DT target/NN is/VBZ centered/VBN at/IN the/DT fovea/NN ,/, the/DT eyes/NNS fixate/VBP for/IN a/DT fraction/NN of/IN a/DT second/JJ while/IN the/DT visual/JJ system/NN extracts/NNS the/DT necessary/JJ information/NN ./.
An/DT artificial/JJ visual/JJ system/NN was/VBD built/VBN based/VBN on/IN a/DT fully/RB recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN set/VBN within/IN a/DT reinforcement/NN learning/VBG protocol/NN ,/, and/CC learned/VBD to/TO attend/VB to/IN regions/NNS of/IN interest/NN while/IN solving/VBG a/DT classification/NN task/NN ./.
The/DT model/NN is/VBZ consistent/JJ with/IN several/JJ experimentally/RB observed/VBN phenomena/NNS ,/, and/CC suggests/VBZ novel/JJ predictions/NNS ./.
