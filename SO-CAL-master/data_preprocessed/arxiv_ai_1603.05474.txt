In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT Neural/JJ Aggregation/NNP Network/NNP (/-LRB- NAN/NNP )/-RRB- for/IN video/NN face/NN recognition/NN ./.
The/DT network/NN takes/VBZ a/DT face/NN video/NN or/CC face/NN image/NN set/NN of/IN a/DT person/NN with/IN variable/JJ number/NN of/IN face/NN frames/NNS as/IN its/PRP$ input/NN ,/, and/CC produces/VBZ a/DT compact/JJ and/CC fixed/JJ -/HYPH dimension/NN visual/JJ representation/NN of/IN that/DT person/NN ./.
The/DT whole/JJ network/NN is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN two/CD modules/NNS ./.
The/DT feature/NN embedding/NN module/NN is/VBZ a/DT CNN/NNP which/WDT maps/VBZ each/DT face/NN frame/NN into/IN a/DT feature/NN representation/NN ./.
The/DT neural/JJ aggregation/NN module/NN is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN two/CD content/NN based/VBN attention/NN blocks/NNS which/WDT is/VBZ driven/VBN by/IN a/DT memory/NN storing/VBG all/PDT the/DT features/NNS extracted/VBN from/IN the/DT face/NN video/NN through/IN the/DT feature/NN embedding/NN module/NN ./.
The/DT output/NN of/IN the/DT first/JJ attention/NN block/NN adapts/VBZ the/DT second/JJ ,/, whose/WP$ output/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN as/IN the/DT aggregated/VBN representation/NN of/IN the/DT video/NN faces/VBZ ./.
Due/IN to/IN the/DT attention/NN mechanism/NN ,/, this/DT representation/NN is/VBZ invariant/JJ to/IN the/DT order/NN of/IN the/DT face/NN frames/NNS ./.
The/DT experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN NAN/NNP consistently/RB outperforms/VBZ hand/NN -/HYPH crafted/VBN aggregations/NNS such/JJ as/IN average/JJ pooling/VBG ,/, and/CC achieves/VBZ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN accuracy/NN on/IN three/CD video/NN face/NN recognition/NN datasets/NNS :/: the/DT YouTube/NNP Face/NNP ,/, IJB/NNP -/HYPH A/NNP and/CC Celebrity/NNP -/HYPH 1000/CD datasets/NNS ./.
