Content/NN caching/NN in/IN small/JJ base/NN stations/NNS (/-LRB- SBSs/NNS )/-RRB- or/CC wireless/JJ infostations/NNS is/VBZ considered/VBN as/IN a/DT suitable/JJ approach/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT efficiency/NN in/IN wireless/JJ content/NN delivery/NN ./.
Due/IN to/IN storage/NN limitations/NNS ,/, placing/VBG the/DT optimal/JJ content/NN into/IN local/JJ caches/NNS is/VBZ crucial/JJ ./.
Cache/NN content/NN placement/NN is/VBZ challenging/JJ since/IN it/PRP requires/VBZ knowledge/NN about/IN the/DT content/NN popularity/NN distribution/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ often/RB not/RB available/JJ in/IN advance/NN ./.
