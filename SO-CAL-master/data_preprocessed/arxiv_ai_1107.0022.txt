This/DT paper/NN discusses/VBZ an/DT interested/JJ party/NN who/WP wishes/VBZ to/TO influence/VB the/DT behavior/NN of/IN agents/NNS in/IN a/DT game/NN (/-LRB- multi-agent/JJ interaction/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ not/RB under/IN his/PRP$ control/NN ./.
The/DT interested/JJ party/NN can/MD not/RB design/VB a/DT new/JJ game/NN ,/, can/MD not/RB enforce/VB agents/NNS '/POS behavior/NN ,/, can/MD not/RB enforce/VB payments/NNS by/IN the/DT agents/NNS ,/, and/CC can/MD not/RB prohibit/VB strategies/NNS available/JJ to/IN the/DT agents/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, he/PRP can/MD influence/VB the/DT outcome/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN by/IN committing/VBG to/IN non-negative/JJ monetary/JJ transfers/NNS for/IN the/DT different/JJ strategy/NN profiles/NNS that/WDT may/MD be/VB selected/VBN by/IN the/DT agents/NNS ./.
The/DT interested/JJ party/NN assumes/VBZ that/IN agents/NNS are/VBP rational/JJ in/IN the/DT commonly/RB agreed/VBN sense/NN that/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB use/VB dominated/VBN strategies/NNS ./.
Hence/RB ,/, a/DT certain/JJ subset/NN of/IN outcomes/NNS is/VBZ implemented/VBN in/IN a/DT given/VBN game/NN if/IN by/IN adding/VBG non-negative/JJ payments/NNS ,/, rational/JJ players/NNS will/MD necessarily/RB produce/VB an/DT outcome/NN in/IN this/DT subset/NN ./.
Obviously/RB ,/, by/IN making/VBG sufficiently/RB big/JJ payments/NNS one/PRP can/MD implement/VB any/DT desirable/JJ outcome/NN ./.
The/DT question/NN is/VBZ what/WP is/VBZ the/DT cost/NN of/IN implementation/NN ?/.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT notion/NN of/IN k/CD -/HYPH implementation/NN of/IN a/DT desired/VBN set/NN of/IN strategy/NN profiles/NNS ,/, where/WRB k/NN stands/VBZ for/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN payment/NN that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB actually/RB made/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO implement/VB desirable/JJ outcomes/NNS ./.
A/DT major/JJ point/NN in/IN k/CD -/HYPH implementation/NN is/VBZ that/IN monetary/JJ offers/NNS need/VBP not/RB necessarily/RB materialize/VB when/WRB following/VBG desired/VBN behaviors/NNS ./.
We/PRP define/VBP and/CC study/VBP k/CD -/HYPH implementation/NN in/IN the/DT contexts/NNS of/IN games/NNS with/IN complete/JJ and/CC incomplete/JJ information/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT latter/JJ case/NN we/PRP mainly/RB focus/VBP on/IN the/DT VCG/NNP games/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ setting/NN is/VBZ later/RB extended/VBN to/TO deal/VB with/IN mixed/JJ strategies/NNS using/VBG correlation/NN devices/NNS ./.
Together/RB ,/, the/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ and/CC studies/VBZ the/DT implementation/NN of/IN desirable/JJ outcomes/NNS by/IN a/DT reliable/JJ party/NN who/WP can/MD not/RB modify/VB game/NN rules/NNS (/-LRB- i.e./FW provide/VBP protocols/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, complementing/VBG previous/JJ work/NN in/IN mechanism/NN design/NN ,/, while/IN making/VBG it/PRP more/RBR applicable/JJ to/IN many/JJ realistic/JJ CS/NN settings/NNS ./.
