In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, first/RB we/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ explanation/NN for/IN the/DT relation/NN between/IN logical/JJ circuits/NNS and/CC artificial/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, logical/JJ circuits/NNS and/CC fuzzy/JJ logic/NN ,/, and/CC artificial/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS and/CC fuzzy/JJ inference/NN systems/NNS ./.
Then/RB ,/, based/VBN on/IN these/DT results/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ neuro/NN -/HYPH fuzzy/JJ computing/NN system/NN which/WDT can/MD effectively/RB be/VB implemented/VBN on/IN the/DT memristor/NN -/HYPH crossbar/NN structure/NN ./.
One/CD important/JJ feature/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN system/NN is/VBZ that/IN its/PRP$ hardware/NN can/MD directly/RB be/VB trained/VBN using/VBG the/DT Hebbian/JJ learning/NN rule/NN and/CC without/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO any/DT optimization/NN ./.
The/DT system/NN also/RB has/VBZ a/DT very/RB good/JJ capability/NN to/TO deal/VB with/IN huge/JJ number/NN of/IN input/NN -/HYPH out/NN training/NN data/NNS without/IN facing/VBG problems/NNS like/IN overtraining/VBG ./.
