We/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ method/NN for/IN image/NN feature/NN -/HYPH extraction/NN which/WDT is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN representing/VBG an/DT image/NN by/IN a/DT finite/NN -/HYPH dimensional/JJ vector/NN of/IN distances/NNS that/WDT measure/VBP how/WRB different/JJ the/DT image/NN is/VBZ from/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN image/NN prototypes/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP the/DT recently/RB introduced/VBN Universal/NNP Image/NNP Distance/NNP (/-LRB- UID/NNP )/-RRB- to/TO compare/VB the/DT similarity/NN between/IN an/DT image/NN and/CC a/DT prototype/NN image/NN ./.
The/DT advantage/NN in/IN using/VBG the/DT UID/NNP is/VBZ the/DT fact/NN that/IN no/DT domain/NN knowledge/NN nor/CC any/DT image/NN analysis/NN need/VBP to/TO be/VB done/VBN ./.
Each/DT image/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN by/IN a/DT finite/JJ dimensional/JJ feature/NN vector/NN whose/WP$ components/NNS are/VBP the/DT UID/NN values/NNS between/IN the/DT image/NN and/CC a/DT finite/NN set/NN of/IN image/NN prototypes/NNS from/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT feature/NN categories/NNS ./.
The/DT method/NN is/VBZ automatic/JJ since/IN once/RB the/DT user/NN selects/VBZ the/DT prototype/NN images/NNS ,/, the/DT feature/NN vectors/NNS are/VBP automatically/RB calculated/VBN without/IN the/DT need/NN to/TO do/VB any/DT image/NN analysis/NN ./.
The/DT prototype/NN images/NNS can/MD be/VB of/IN different/JJ size/NN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, different/JJ than/IN the/DT image/NN size/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN a/DT collection/NN of/IN such/JJ cases/NNS any/DT supervised/JJ or/CC unsupervised/JJ learning/NN algorithm/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO train/VB and/CC produce/VB an/DT image/NN classifier/NN or/CC image/NN cluster/NN analysis/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP the/DT image/NN feature/NN -/HYPH extraction/NN method/NN and/CC use/VB it/PRP on/IN several/JJ supervised/JJ and/CC unsupervised/JJ learning/NN experiments/NNS for/IN satellite/NN image/NN data/NNS ./.
