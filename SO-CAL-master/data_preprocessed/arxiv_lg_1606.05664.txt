In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT support/NN vector/NN machine/NN and/CC introduced/VBD the/DT notion/NN of/IN generalized/VBN support/NN vector/NN machine/NN for/IN classification/NN of/IN data/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN generalized/VBN support/NN vector/NN machine/NN is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN generalized/VBN variational/JJ inequality/NN and/CC establish/VB various/JJ results/NNS for/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN solutions/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP various/JJ examples/NNS to/TO support/VB our/PRP$ results/NNS ./.
