Machine/NN translation/NN (/-LRB- MT/NN )/-RRB- was/VBD developed/VBN as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT hottest/JJS research/NN topics/NNS in/IN the/DT natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN (/-LRB- NLP/NN )/-RRB- literature/NN ./.
One/CD important/JJ issue/NN in/IN MT/NN is/VBZ that/IN how/WRB to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT MT/NN system/NN reasonably/RB and/CC tell/VB us/PRP whether/IN the/DT translation/NN system/NN makes/VBZ an/DT improvement/NN or/CC not/RB ./.
The/DT traditional/JJ manual/JJ judgment/NN methods/NNS are/VBP expensive/JJ ,/, time/NN -/HYPH consuming/VBG ,/, unrepeatable/JJ ,/, and/CC sometimes/RB with/IN low/JJ agreement/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT popular/JJ automatic/JJ MT/NN evaluation/NN methods/NNS have/VBP some/DT weaknesses/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, they/PRP tend/VBP to/TO perform/VB well/RB on/IN the/DT language/NN pairs/NNS with/IN English/NNP as/IN the/DT target/NN language/NN ,/, but/CC weak/JJ when/WRB English/NNP is/VBZ used/VBN as/IN source/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, some/DT methods/NNS rely/VBP on/IN many/JJ additional/JJ linguistic/JJ features/NNS to/TO achieve/VB good/JJ performance/NN ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ the/DT metric/JJ unable/JJ to/TO replicate/VB and/CC apply/VB to/IN other/JJ language/NN pairs/NNS easily/RB ./.
Thirdly/RB ,/, some/DT popular/JJ metrics/NNS utilize/VBP incomprehensive/JJ factors/NNS ,/, which/WDT result/VBP in/IN low/JJ performance/NN on/IN some/DT practical/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT thesis/NN ,/, to/TO address/VB the/DT existing/VBG problems/NNS ,/, we/PRP design/VBP novel/JJ MT/NN evaluation/NN methods/NNS and/CC investigate/VB their/PRP$ performances/NNS on/IN different/JJ languages/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP design/VBP augmented/VBN factors/NNS to/TO yield/VB highly/RB accurate/JJ evaluation.Secondly/NN ,/, we/PRP design/VBP a/DT tunable/JJ evaluation/NN model/NN where/WRB weighting/NN of/IN factors/NNS can/MD be/VB optimised/VBN according/VBG to/IN the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN languages/NNS ./.
Thirdly/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT enhanced/VBN version/NN of/IN our/PRP$ methods/NNS ,/, we/PRP design/VBP concise/JJ linguistic/JJ feature/NN using/VBG POS/NN to/TO show/VB that/IN our/PRP$ methods/NNS can/MD yield/VB even/RB higher/JJR performance/NN when/WRB using/VBG some/DT external/JJ linguistic/JJ resources/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT practical/JJ performance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ metrics/NNS in/IN the/DT ACL/NN -/HYPH WMT/NN workshop/NN shared/VBD tasks/NNS ,/, which/WDT show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN methods/NNS are/VBP robust/JJ across/IN different/JJ languages/NNS ./.
