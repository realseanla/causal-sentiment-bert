In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP two/CD methods/NNS to/TO provide/VB explanations/NNS for/IN reasoning/NN with/IN belief/NN functions/NNS in/IN the/DT valuation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN systems/NNS ./.
One/CD approach/NN ,/, inspired/VBN by/IN Strat/NNP 's/POS method/NN ,/, is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN sensitivity/NN analysis/NN ,/, but/CC its/PRP$ computation/NN is/VBZ simpler/JJR thus/RB easier/JJR to/TO implement/VB than/IN Strat/NNP 's/POS ./.
The/DT other/JJ one/NN is/VBZ to/TO examine/VB the/DT impact/NN of/IN evidence/NN on/IN the/DT conclusion/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT measure/NN of/IN the/DT information/NN content/NN in/IN the/DT evidence/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP the/DT property/NN of/IN additivity/NN for/IN the/DT pieces/NNS of/IN evidence/NN that/WDT are/VBP conditional/JJ independent/JJ within/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN the/DT valuation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN systems/NNS ./.
We/PRP will/MD give/VB an/DT example/NN to/TO show/VB how/WRB these/DT approaches/NNS are/VBP applied/VBN in/IN an/DT evidential/JJ network/NN ./.
