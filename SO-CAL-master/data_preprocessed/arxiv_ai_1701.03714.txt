In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT links/NNS between/IN instantiated/JJ argumentation/NN systems/NNS and/CC the/DT axioms/NNS for/IN non-monotonic/JJ reasoning/NN described/VBN in/IN [/-LRB- 9/CD ]/-RRB- with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN characterising/VBG the/DT nature/NN of/IN argument/NN based/VBN reasoning/NN ./.
In/IN doing/VBG so/RB ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP two/CD possible/JJ interpretations/NNS of/IN the/DT consequence/NN relation/NN ,/, and/CC describe/VB which/WDT axioms/NNS are/VBP met/VBN by/IN ASPIC/NN under/IN each/DT of/IN these/DT interpretations/NNS ./.
We/PRP then/RB consider/VBP the/DT links/NNS between/IN these/DT axioms/NNS and/CC the/DT rationality/NN postulates/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN argument/NN based/VBN reasoning/NN as/IN characterised/VBN by/IN ASPIC/NN is/VBZ -/HYPH according/VBG to/IN the/DT axioms/NNS of/IN [/-LRB- 9/CD ]/-RRB- -/HYPH non-cumulative/JJ and/CC non-monotonic/JJ ,/, and/CC therefore/RB weaker/JJR than/IN the/DT weakest/JJS non-monotonic/JJ reasoning/NN systems/NNS they/PRP considered/VBD possible/JJ ./.
This/DT weakness/NN underpins/VBZ ASPIC/NNP 's/POS success/NN in/IN modelling/VBG other/JJ reasoning/NN systems/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP conclude/VBP by/IN considering/VBG the/DT relationship/NN between/IN ASPIC/NN and/CC other/JJ weak/JJ logical/JJ systems/NNS ./.
