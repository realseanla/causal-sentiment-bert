Standard/JJ belief/NN change/NN assumes/VBZ an/DT underlying/JJ logic/NN containing/VBG full/JJ classical/JJ propositional/JJ logic/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP good/JJ reasons/NNS for/IN considering/VBG belief/NN change/NN in/IN less/JJR expressive/JJ logics/NNS as/RB well/RB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP build/VBP on/IN recent/JJ investigations/NNS by/IN Delgrande/NNP on/IN contraction/NN for/IN Horn/NNP logic/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT standard/JJ basic/JJ form/NN of/IN contraction/NN ,/, partial/JJ meet/NN ,/, is/VBZ too/RB strong/JJ in/IN the/DT Horn/NNP case/NN ./.
This/DT result/NN stands/VBZ in/IN contrast/NN to/IN Delgrande/NNP 's/POS conjecture/NN that/IN orderly/JJ maxichoice/NN is/VBZ the/DT appropriate/JJ form/NN of/IN contraction/NN for/IN Horn/NNP logic/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB define/VBP a/DT more/RBR appropriate/JJ notion/NN of/IN basic/JJ contraction/NN for/IN the/DT Horn/NNP case/NN ,/, influenced/VBN by/IN the/DT convexity/NN property/NN holding/VBG for/IN full/JJ propositional/JJ logic/NN and/CC which/WDT we/PRP refer/VBP to/IN as/IN infra/NN contraction/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ contribution/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ a/DT result/NN which/WDT shows/VBZ that/IN the/DT construction/NN method/NN for/IN Horn/NNP contraction/NN for/IN belief/NN sets/NNS based/VBN on/IN our/PRP$ infra/NN remainder/NN sets/NNS corresponds/VBZ exactly/RB to/IN Hansson/NNP 's/POS classical/JJ kernel/NN contraction/NN for/IN belief/NN sets/NNS ,/, when/WRB restricted/VBN to/IN Horn/NNP logic/NN ./.
This/DT result/NN is/VBZ obtained/VBN via/IN a/DT detour/NN through/IN contraction/NN for/IN belief/NN bases/NNS ./.
We/PRP prove/VBP that/IN kernel/NN contraction/NN for/IN belief/NN bases/NNS produces/VBZ precisely/RB the/DT same/JJ results/NNS as/IN the/DT belief/NN base/NN version/NN of/IN infra/NN contraction/NN ./.
The/DT use/NN of/IN belief/NN bases/NNS to/TO obtain/VB this/DT result/NN provides/VBZ evidence/NN for/IN the/DT conjecture/NN that/WDT Horn/NNP belief/NN change/NN is/VBZ best/JJS viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT hybrid/NN version/NN of/IN belief/NN set/VBN change/NN and/CC belief/NN base/NN change/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN the/DT link/NN with/IN base/NN contraction/NN is/VBZ the/DT provision/NN of/IN a/DT representation/NN result/NN for/IN Horn/NNP contraction/NN for/IN belief/NN sets/NNS in/IN which/WDT a/DT version/NN of/IN the/DT Core/NN -/HYPH retainment/NN postulate/NN features/NNS ./.
