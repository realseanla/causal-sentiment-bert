In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT set/NN theoretic/JJ approach/NN for/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT syntax/NN of/IN an/DT application/NN domain/NN is/VBZ captured/VBN by/IN set/VBN theoretic/JJ constructs/NNS including/VBG individuals/NNS ,/, concepts/NNS and/CC operators/NNS ,/, knowledge/NN is/VBZ formalized/VBN by/IN equality/NN assertions/NNS ./.
We/PRP first/RB present/VBP a/DT primitive/JJ form/NN that/WDT uses/VBZ minimal/JJ assumed/VBD knowledge/NN and/CC constructs/NNS ./.
Then/RB ,/, assuming/VBG naive/JJ set/NN theory/NN ,/, we/PRP extend/VBP it/PRP by/IN definitions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP special/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN knowledge/NN ./.
Interestingly/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT primitive/JJ form/NN is/VBZ expressive/JJ enough/RB to/TO define/VB logic/NN operators/NNS ,/, not/RB only/RB propositional/JJ connectives/NNS but/CC also/RB quantifiers/NNS ./.
