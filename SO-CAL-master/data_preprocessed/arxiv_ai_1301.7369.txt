It/PRP is/VBZ well/RB known/VBN that/IN one/PRP can/MD ignore/VB parts/NNS of/IN a/DT belief/NN network/NN when/WRB computing/VBG answers/NNS to/IN certain/JJ probabilistic/JJ queries/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB well/RB known/VBN that/IN the/DT ignorable/JJ parts/NNS (/-LRB- if/IN any/DT )/-RRB- depend/VBP on/IN the/DT specific/JJ query/NN of/IN interest/NN and/CC ,/, therefore/RB ,/, may/MD change/VB as/IN the/DT query/NN changes/NNS ./.
Algorithms/NNS based/VBN on/IN jointrees/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, do/VBP not/RB seem/VB to/TO take/VB computational/JJ advantage/NN of/IN these/DT facts/NNS given/VBN that/IN they/PRP typically/RB construct/VB jointrees/NNS for/IN worst/JJS -/HYPH case/NN queries/NNS ;/: that/DT is/VBZ ,/, queries/NNS for/IN which/WDT every/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT belief/NN network/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN relevant/JJ ./.
