One/CD important/JJ challenge/NN for/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN agents/NNS to/TO achieve/VB more/RBR efficient/JJ collaboration/NN is/VBZ for/IN these/DT agents/NNS to/TO maintain/VB proper/JJ models/NNS of/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
An/DT important/JJ aspect/NN of/IN these/DT models/NNS of/IN other/JJ agents/NNS is/VBZ that/IN they/PRP are/VBP often/RB partial/JJ and/CC incomplete/JJ ./.
Thus/RB far/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP two/CD common/JJ representations/NNS of/IN agent/NN models/NNS :/: MDP/NNP based/VBN and/CC action/NN based/VBN ,/, which/WDT are/VBP both/DT based/VBN on/IN action/NN modeling/NN ./.
In/IN many/JJ applications/NNS ,/, agent/NN models/NNS may/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN given/VBN ,/, and/CC hence/RB must/MD be/VB learnt/VBN ./.
While/IN it/PRP may/MD seem/VB convenient/JJ to/TO use/VB either/CC MDP/NNP based/VBN or/CC action/NN based/VBN models/NNS for/IN learning/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ representation/NN based/VBN on/IN capability/NN models/NNS ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ several/JJ unique/JJ advantages/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN learning/VBG capability/NN models/NNS can/MD be/VB performed/VBN efficiently/RB online/RB via/IN Bayesian/JJ learning/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT learning/NN process/NN is/VBZ robust/JJ to/IN high/JJ degrees/NNS of/IN incompleteness/NN in/IN plan/NN execution/NN traces/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, with/IN only/JJ start/NN and/CC end/NN states/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
While/IN high/JJ degrees/NNS of/IN incompleteness/NN in/IN plan/NN execution/NN traces/NNS presents/VBZ learning/VBG challenges/NNS for/IN MDP/NNP based/VBN and/CC action/NN based/VBN models/NNS ,/, capability/NN models/NNS can/MD still/RB learn/VB to/TO {/-LRB- \/SYM em/PRP abstract/JJ }/-RRB- useful/JJ information/NN out/IN of/IN these/DT traces/NNS ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, capability/NN models/NNS are/VBP useful/JJ in/IN applications/NNS in/IN which/WDT such/JJ incompleteness/NN is/VBZ common/JJ ,/, e.g./FW ,/, robot/NN learning/NN human/JJ model/NN from/IN observations/NNS and/CC interactions/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, when/WRB used/VBN in/IN multi-agent/JJ planning/NN (/-LRB- with/IN each/DT agent/NN modeled/VBN separately/RB )/-RRB- ,/, capability/NN models/NNS provide/VBP flexible/JJ abstraction/NN of/IN actions/NNS ./.
The/DT limitation/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ that/IN the/DT synthesized/VBN plan/NN is/VBZ incomplete/JJ and/CC abstract/JJ ./.
