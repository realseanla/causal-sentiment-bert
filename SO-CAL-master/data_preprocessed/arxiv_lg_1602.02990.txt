With/IN the/DT accelerated/VBN development/NN of/IN robot/NN technologies/NNS ,/, optimal/JJ control/NN becomes/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT central/JJ themes/NNS of/IN research/NN ./.
In/IN traditional/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, the/DT controller/NN ,/, by/IN its/PRP$ internal/JJ functionality/NN ,/, finds/VBZ appropriate/JJ actions/NNS on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN the/DT history/NN of/IN sensor/NN values/NNS ,/, guided/VBN by/IN the/DT goals/NNS ,/, intentions/NNS ,/, objectives/NNS ,/, learning/VBG schemes/NNS ,/, and/CC so/RB on/IN planted/VBN into/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT idea/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT controller/NN controls/VBZ the/DT world/NN ---/, the/DT body/NN plus/CC its/PRP$ environment/NN ---/NFP as/IN reliably/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN advocates/VBZ for/IN a/DT new/JJ paradigm/NN of/IN control/NN ,/, obtained/VBN by/IN making/VBG the/DT world/NN control/NN its/PRP$ controller/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.
The/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT solution/NN with/IN a/DT controller/NN that/WDT is/VBZ devoid/JJ of/IN any/DT functionalities/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, given/VBN by/IN a/DT fixed/VBN ,/, explicit/JJ and/CC context/NN -/HYPH free/JJ function/NN of/IN the/DT recent/JJ history/NN of/IN the/DT sensor/NN values/NNS ./.
When/WRB applying/VBG this/DT controller/NN to/IN a/DT muscle/NN -/HYPH tendon/NN driven/VBN arm/NN -/HYPH shoulder/NN system/NN from/IN the/DT Myorobotics/NNP toolkit/NN ,/, we/PRP observe/VBP a/DT vast/JJ variety/NN of/IN self/NN -/HYPH organized/VBN behavior/NN patterns/NNS :/: when/WRB left/VBN alone/RB ,/, the/DT arm/NN realizes/VBZ pseudo-random/NN sequences/NNS of/IN different/JJ poses/NNS but/CC one/PRP can/MD also/RB manipulate/VB the/DT system/NN into/IN definite/JJ motion/NN patterns/NNS ./.
But/CC most/RBS interestingly/RB ,/, after/IN attaching/VBG an/DT object/NN ,/, the/DT controller/NN gets/VBZ in/IN a/DT functional/JJ resonance/NN with/IN the/DT object/NN 's/POS internal/JJ dynamics/NNS :/: when/WRB given/VBN a/DT half/NN -/HYPH filled/VBN bottle/NN ,/, the/DT system/NN spontaneously/RB starts/VBZ shaking/VBG the/DT bottle/NN so/IN that/IN maximum/JJ response/NN from/IN the/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN the/DT water/NN is/VBZ being/VBG generated/VBN ./.
After/IN attaching/VBG a/DT pendulum/NN to/IN the/DT arm/NN ,/, the/DT controller/NN drives/VBZ the/DT pendulum/NN into/IN a/DT circular/JJ mode/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT robot/NN discovers/VBZ affordances/NNS of/IN objects/NNS its/PRP$ body/NN is/VBZ interacting/VBG with/IN ./.
We/PRP also/RB discuss/VBP perspectives/NNS for/IN using/VBG this/DT controller/NN paradigm/NN for/IN intention/NN driven/VBN behavior/NN generation/NN ./.
