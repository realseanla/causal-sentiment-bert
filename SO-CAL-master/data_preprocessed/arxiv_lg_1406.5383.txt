We/PRP present/VBP and/CC analyze/VBP an/DT adaptive/JJ margin/NN -/HYPH based/VBN algorithm/NN that/WDT actively/RB learns/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ linear/JJ separator/NN for/IN multi-dimensional/JJ data/NNS ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN has/VBZ the/DT capacity/NN of/IN adapting/VBG to/IN unknown/JJ level/NN of/IN label/NN noise/NN in/IN the/DT underlying/JJ distribution/NN ,/, making/VBG it/PRP suitable/JJ for/IN model/NN selection/NN under/IN the/DT active/JJ learning/NN setting/NN ./.
Compared/VBN to/IN other/JJ alternative/JJ agnostic/JJ active/JJ learning/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ much/JJ simpler/JJR and/CC achieves/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ convergence/NN rate/NN in/IN query/NN budget/NN T/NN and/CC data/NNS dimension/NN d/NN ,/, if/IN logarithm/NN factors/NNS are/VBP ignored/VBN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, our/PRP$ algorithm/NN can/MD handle/VB classification/NN loss/NN functions/VBZ other/JJ than/IN the/DT 0/CD -/HYPH 1/CD loss/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN hinge/NN and/CC logistic/JJ loss/NN ,/, and/CC hence/RB is/VBZ computationally/RB feasible/JJ ./.
