Multi-instance/NN learning/NN attempts/VBZ to/TO learn/VB from/IN a/DT training/NN set/VBN consisting/VBG of/IN labeled/VBN bags/NNS each/DT containing/VBG many/JJ unlabeled/JJ instances/NNS ./.
Previous/JJ studies/NNS typically/RB treat/VBP the/DT instances/NNS in/IN the/DT bags/NNS as/IN independently/RB and/CC identically/RB distributed/VBN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT instances/NNS in/IN a/DT bag/NN are/VBP rarely/RB independent/JJ ,/, and/CC therefore/RB a/DT better/JJR performance/NN can/MD be/VB expected/VBN if/IN the/DT instances/NNS are/VBP treated/VBN in/IN an/DT non-i.i.d./JJ way/NN that/WDT exploits/VBZ the/DT relations/NNS among/IN instances/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT simple/JJ yet/CC effective/JJ multi-instance/NN learning/NN method/NN ,/, which/WDT regards/VBZ each/DT bag/NN as/IN a/DT graph/NN and/CC uses/VBZ a/DT specific/JJ kernel/NN to/TO distinguish/VB the/DT graphs/NNS by/IN considering/VBG the/DT features/NNS of/IN the/DT nodes/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT features/NNS of/IN the/DT edges/NNS that/WDT convey/VBP some/DT relations/NNS among/IN instances/NNS ./.
The/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ validated/VBN by/IN experiments/NNS ./.
