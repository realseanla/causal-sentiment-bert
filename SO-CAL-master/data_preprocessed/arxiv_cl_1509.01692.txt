Recent/JJ work/NN on/IN word/NN embeddings/NNS has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN simple/JJ vector/NN subtraction/NN over/IN pre-trained/JJ embeddings/NNS is/VBZ surprisingly/RB effective/JJ at/IN capturing/VBG different/JJ lexical/JJ relations/NNS ,/, despite/IN lacking/VBG explicit/JJ supervision/NN ./.
Prior/JJ work/NN has/VBZ evaluated/VBN this/DT intriguing/JJ result/NN using/VBG a/DT word/NN analogy/NN prediction/NN formulation/NN and/CC hand/NN -/HYPH selected/VBN relations/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT generality/NN of/IN the/DT finding/NN over/IN a/DT broader/JJR range/NN of/IN lexical/JJ relation/NN types/NNS and/CC different/JJ learning/NN settings/NNS has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN evaluated/VBN ./.
