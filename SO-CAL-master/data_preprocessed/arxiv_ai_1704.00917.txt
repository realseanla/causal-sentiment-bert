The/DT probability/NN density/NN function/NN of/IN a/DT probability/NN distribution/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ concept/NN in/IN probability/NN theory/NN and/CC a/DT key/JJ ingredient/NN in/IN various/JJ widely/RB used/VBN machine/NN learning/NN methods/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT necessary/JJ framework/NN for/IN compiling/VBG probabilistic/JJ functional/JJ programs/NNS to/IN density/NN functions/NNS has/VBZ only/RB recently/RB been/VBN developed/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT density/NN compiler/NN for/IN a/DT probabilistic/JJ language/NN with/IN failure/NN and/CC both/DT discrete/JJ and/CC continuous/JJ distributions/NNS ,/, and/CC provide/VB a/DT proof/NN of/IN its/PRP$ soundness/NN ./.
