This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ concerned/VBN with/IN nearest/JJS neighbor/NN search/NN in/IN distributional/JJ semantic/JJ models/NNS ./.
A/DT normal/JJ nearest/JJS neighbor/NN search/NN only/RB returns/VBZ a/DT ranked/VBN list/NN of/IN neighbors/NNS ,/, with/IN no/DT information/NN about/IN the/DT structure/NN or/CC topology/NN of/IN the/DT local/JJ neighborhood/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ a/DT potentially/RB serious/JJ shortcoming/NN of/IN the/DT mode/NN of/IN querying/VBG a/DT distributional/JJ semantic/JJ model/NN ,/, since/IN a/DT ranked/VBN list/NN of/IN neighbors/NNS may/MD conflate/VB several/JJ different/JJ senses/NNS ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT topology/NN of/IN neighborhoods/NNS in/IN semantic/JJ space/NN provides/VBZ important/JJ information/NN about/IN the/DT different/JJ senses/NNS of/IN terms/NNS ,/, and/CC that/IN such/JJ topological/JJ structures/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN word/NN -/HYPH sense/NN induction/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB argue/VBP that/IN the/DT topology/NN of/IN the/DT neighborhoods/NNS in/IN semantic/JJ space/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO determine/VB the/DT semantic/JJ horizon/NN of/IN a/DT point/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP define/VBP as/IN the/DT set/NN of/IN neighbors/NNS that/WDT have/VBP a/DT direct/JJ connection/NN to/IN the/DT point/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP relative/JJ neighborhood/NN graphs/NNS as/IN method/NN to/TO uncover/VB the/DT topological/JJ properties/NNS of/IN neighborhoods/NNS in/IN semantic/JJ models/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB provide/VBP examples/NNS of/IN relative/JJ neighborhood/NN graphs/NNS for/IN three/CD well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN semantic/JJ models/NNS ;/: the/DT PMI/NNP model/NN ,/, the/DT GloVe/NN model/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT skipgram/NN model/NN ./.
