Manifold/NN learning/NN is/VBZ a/DT hot/JJ research/NN topic/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN computer/NN science/NN and/CC has/VBZ many/JJ applications/NNS in/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN ./.
A/DT main/JJ drawback/NN of/IN manifold/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS is/VBZ ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT explicit/JJ mappings/NNS from/IN the/DT input/NN data/NNS manifold/NN to/IN the/DT output/NN embedding/NN ./.
This/DT prohibits/VBZ the/DT application/NN of/IN manifold/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS in/IN many/JJ practical/JJ problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN classification/NN and/CC target/NN detection/NN ./.
Previously/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO provide/VB explicit/JJ mappings/NNS for/IN manifold/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS ,/, many/JJ methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO get/VB an/DT approximate/JJ explicit/JJ representation/NN mapping/NN with/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN there/EX exists/VBZ a/DT linear/JJ projection/NN between/IN the/DT high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ data/NNS samples/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ embedding/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT linearity/NN assumption/NN may/MD be/VB too/RB restrictive/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, an/DT explicit/JJ nonlinear/JJ mapping/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN for/IN manifold/JJ learning/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN there/EX exists/VBZ a/DT polynomial/JJ mapping/NN between/IN the/DT high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ data/NNS samples/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ representations/NNS ./.
As/RB far/RB as/IN we/PRP know/VBP ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/WDT an/DT explicit/JJ nonlinear/JJ mapping/NN for/IN manifold/JJ learning/NN is/VBZ given/VBN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP this/DT to/IN the/DT method/NN of/IN Locally/RB Linear/NNP Embedding/NNP (/-LRB- LLE/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC derive/VBP an/DT explicit/JJ nonlinear/JJ manifold/JJ learning/NN algorithm/NN ,/, named/VBN Neighborhood/NNP Preserving/VBG Polynomial/NNP Embedding/NNP (/-LRB- NPPE/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS on/IN both/DT synthetic/JJ and/CC real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN data/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ mapping/NN is/VBZ much/RB more/JJR effective/JJ in/IN preserving/VBG the/DT local/JJ neighborhood/NN information/NN and/CC the/DT nonlinear/JJ geometry/NN of/IN the/DT high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ data/NNS samples/NNS than/IN previous/JJ work/NN ./.
