Automatic/JJ essay/NN scoring/NN (/-LRB- AES/NNP )/-RRB- refers/VBZ to/IN the/DT process/NN of/IN scoring/VBG free/JJ text/NN responses/NNS to/IN given/VBN prompts/VBZ ,/, considering/VBG human/JJ grader/NN scores/NNS as/IN the/DT gold/NN standard/NN ./.
Writing/VBG such/JJ essays/NNS is/VBZ an/DT essential/JJ component/NN of/IN many/JJ language/NN and/CC aptitude/NN exams/NNS ./.
Hence/RB ,/, AES/NNP became/VBD an/DT active/JJ and/CC established/JJ area/NN of/IN research/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX are/VBP many/JJ proprietary/JJ systems/NNS used/VBN in/IN real/JJ life/NN applications/NNS today/NN ./.

This/DT article/NN addresses/VBZ that/IN by/IN exploring/VBG the/DT role/NN of/IN various/JJ linguistic/JJ features/NNS in/IN automatic/JJ essay/NN scoring/NN using/VBG two/CD publicly/RB available/JJ datasets/NNS of/IN non-native/JJ English/NNP essays/NNS written/VBN in/IN test/NN taking/VBG scenarios/NNS ./.
