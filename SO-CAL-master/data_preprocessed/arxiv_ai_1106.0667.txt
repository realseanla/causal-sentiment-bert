Description/NN Logics/NNS (/-LRB- DLs/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP suitable/JJ ,/, well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN ,/, logics/NNS for/IN managing/VBG structured/JJ knowledge/NN ./.
They/PRP allow/VBP reasoning/NN about/IN individuals/NNS and/CC well/RB defined/VBN concepts/NNS ,/, i.e./FW ,/, set/NN of/IN individuals/NNS with/IN common/JJ properties/NNS ./.
The/DT experience/NN in/IN using/VBG DLs/NNS in/IN applications/NNS has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO extend/VB their/PRP$ capabilities/NNS ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, their/PRP$ use/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN Multimedia/NNP Information/NNP Retrieval/NNP (/-LRB- MIR/NNP )/-RRB- leads/VBZ to/IN the/DT convincement/NN that/IN such/JJ DLs/NNS should/MD allow/VB the/DT treatment/NN of/IN the/DT inherent/JJ imprecision/NN in/IN multimedia/JJ object/NN content/NN representation/NN and/CC retrieval/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP will/MD present/VB a/DT fuzzy/JJ extension/NN of/IN ALC/NNP ,/, combining/VBG Zadeh/NNP 's/POS fuzzy/JJ logic/NN with/IN a/DT classical/JJ DL/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, concepts/NNS becomes/VBZ fuzzy/JJ and/CC ,/, thus/RB ,/, reasoning/NN about/IN imprecise/JJ concepts/NNS is/VBZ supported/VBN ./.
We/PRP will/MD define/VB its/PRP$ syntax/NN ,/, its/PRP$ semantics/NNS ,/, describe/VB its/PRP$ properties/NNS and/CC present/VB a/DT constraint/NN propagation/NN calculus/NN for/IN reasoning/NN in/IN it/PRP ./.
