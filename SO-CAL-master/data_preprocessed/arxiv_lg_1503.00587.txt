Mobile/NNP advertising/NN is/VBZ a/DT billion/CD pound/NN industry/NN that/WDT is/VBZ rapidly/RB expanding/VBG ./.
The/DT success/NN of/IN an/DT advert/NN is/VBZ measured/VBN based/VBN on/IN how/WRB users/NNS interact/VBP with/IN it/PRP ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP investigate/VBP whether/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN and/CC association/NN rule/NN mining/NN could/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO enable/VB personalised/VBN targeting/NN of/IN mobile/JJ adverts/NNS with/IN the/DT aim/NN of/IN increasing/VBG the/DT interaction/NN rate/NN ./.
Over/IN May/NNP and/CC June/NNP 2014/CD we/PRP recorded/VBD advert/NN interactions/NNS such/JJ as/IN tapping/VBG the/DT advert/NN or/CC watching/VBG the/DT whole/JJ advert/NN video/NN along/IN with/IN the/DT set/NN of/IN apps/NNS a/DT user/NN has/VBZ installed/VBN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN the/DT interaction/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT apps/NNS that/WDT the/DT users/NNS have/VBP installed/VBN we/PRP applied/VBD k/CD -/HYPH means/NN clustering/NN to/IN profile/NN the/DT users/NNS into/IN one/CD of/IN ten/CD classes/NNS ./.
Due/IN to/IN the/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN apps/NNS considered/VBN we/PRP implemented/VBD dimension/NN reduction/NN to/IN reduced/VBN the/DT app/NN feature/NN space/NN by/IN mapping/VBG the/DT apps/NNS to/IN their/PRP$ iTunes/NNP category/NN and/CC clustered/VBN users/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT percentage/NN of/IN their/PRP$ apps/NNS that/WDT correspond/VBP to/IN each/DT iTunes/NNP app/NN category/NN ./.
