In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT novel/JJ learning/NN paradigm/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN to/TO automatically/RB identify/VB groups/NNS of/IN informative/JJ and/CC correlated/VBD features/NNS from/IN very/RB high/JJ dimensions/NNS ./.

Second/RB ,/, during/IN the/DT learning/NN process/NN ,/, the/DT underlying/JJ group/NN structures/NNS of/IN correlated/VBN features/NNS associated/VBN with/IN each/DT support/NN feature/NN ,/, denoted/VBN as/IN Affiliated/VBN Features/NNS ,/, can/MD also/RB be/VB discovered/VBN without/IN any/DT additional/JJ cost/NN ./.
