This/DT paper/NN reviews/VBZ an/DT experiment/NN in/IN human/JJ -/HYPH computer/NN interaction/NN ,/, where/WRB interaction/NN takes/VBZ place/NN when/WRB humans/NNS attempt/VBP to/TO teach/VB a/DT computer/NN to/TO play/VB a/DT strategy/NN board/NN game/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN while/IN individually/RB learned/VBN models/NNS can/MD be/VB shown/VBN to/TO improve/VB the/DT playing/NN performance/NN of/IN the/DT computer/NN ,/, their/PRP$ straightforward/JJ composition/NN results/NNS in/IN diluting/VBG what/WP was/VBD earlier/RBR learned/VBN ./.
This/DT observation/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN interaction/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB easily/RB distributed/VBN when/WRB one/CD hopes/VBZ to/IN harness/NN multiple/JJ human/JJ experts/NNS to/TO develop/VB a/DT quality/NN computer/NN player/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ related/VBN to/IN similar/JJ approaches/NNS in/IN robot/NN task/NN learning/NN and/CC to/IN classic/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN human/JJ learning/NN and/CC reinforces/VBZ the/DT need/NN to/TO develop/VB tools/NNS that/WDT facilitate/VBP the/DT mix/NN of/IN human/JJ -/HYPH based/VBN tuition/NN and/CC computer/NN self/NN -/HYPH learning/NN ./.
