The/DT paper/NN first/JJ reports/VBZ an/DT experimentally/RB identified/VBN list/NN of/IN benchmark/NN data/NNS sets/VBZ that/DT are/VBP hard/JJ for/IN representative/JJ classification/NN and/CC feature/NN selection/NN methods/NNS ./.
This/DT was/VBD done/VBN after/IN systematically/RB evaluating/VBG a/DT total/NN of/IN 54/CD combinations/NNS of/IN methods/NNS ,/, involving/VBG nine/CD state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN classification/NN algorithms/NNS and/CC six/CD commonly/RB used/VBN feature/NN selection/NN methods/NNS ,/, on/IN 129/CD data/NNS sets/NNS from/IN the/DT UCI/NNP repository/NN (/-LRB- some/DT data/NNS sets/VBZ with/IN known/VBN high/JJ classification/NN accuracy/NN were/VBD excluded/VBN )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT data/NN set/NN for/IN classification/NN is/VBZ called/VBN hard/JJ if/IN none/NN of/IN the/DT 54/CD combinations/NNS can/MD achieve/VB an/DT AUC/NN over/IN 0.8/CD and/CC none/NN of/IN them/PRP can/MD achieve/VB an/DT F/NN -/HYPH Measure/NN value/NN over/IN 0.8/CD ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ called/VBN easy/JJ otherwise/RB ./.
A/DT total/NN of/IN 17/CD out/IN of/IN the/DT 129/CD data/NNS sets/NNS were/VBD found/VBN to/TO be/VB hard/JJ in/IN that/DT sense/NN ./.

This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ to/TO rank/VB methods/NNS separately/RB for/IN hard/JJ data/NNS sets/NNS and/CC for/IN easy/JJ data/NNS sets/NNS ./.
