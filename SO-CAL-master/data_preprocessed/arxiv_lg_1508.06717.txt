Anomaly/NNP detection/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ task/NN in/IN many/JJ real/JJ world/NN applications/NNS such/JJ as/IN fraud/NN detection/NN ,/, suspicious/JJ activity/NN detection/NN ,/, health/NN care/NN monitoring/NN etc/FW ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP tackle/VBP this/DT problem/NN from/IN supervised/JJ learning/NN perspective/NN in/IN online/JJ learning/NN setting/NN ./.
We/PRP maximize/VBP well/RB known/VBN \/SYM emph/NN {/-LRB- Gmean/NNP }/-RRB- metric/JJ for/IN class/NN -/HYPH imbalance/NN learning/NN in/IN online/JJ learning/NN framework/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN maximizing/VBG \/SYM emph/NN {/-LRB- Gmean/NNP }/-RRB- is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/IN minimizing/VBG a/DT convex/NN surrogate/JJ loss/NN function/NN and/CC based/VBN on/IN that/DT we/PRP propose/VBP novel/JJ online/JJ learning/NN algorithm/NN for/IN anomaly/NN detection/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB show/VBP ,/, by/IN extensive/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, that/IN the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN $/$ sum/VB $/$ metric/JJ is/VBZ as/RB good/JJ as/IN a/DT recently/RB proposed/VBN Cost/NN -/HYPH Sensitive/JJ Online/NN Classification/NN (/-LRB- CSOC/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN for/IN class/NN -/HYPH imbalance/NN learning/NN over/IN various/JJ benchmarked/JJ data/NNS sets/NNS while/IN keeping/VBG running/VBG time/NN close/NN to/IN the/DT perception/NN algorithm/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ another/DT conclusion/NN is/VBZ that/IN other/JJ competitive/JJ online/JJ algorithms/NNS do/VBP not/RB perform/VB consistently/RB over/IN data/NNS sets/NNS of/IN varying/VBG size/NN ./.
