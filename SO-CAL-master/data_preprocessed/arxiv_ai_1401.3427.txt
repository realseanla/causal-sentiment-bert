This/DT paper/NN defines/VBZ the/DT notion/NN of/IN analogical/JJ dissimilarity/NN between/IN four/CD objects/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT special/JJ focus/NN on/IN objects/NNS structured/VBN as/IN sequences/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, it/PRP studies/VBZ the/DT case/NN where/WRB the/DT four/CD objects/NNS have/VBP a/DT null/JJ analogical/JJ dissimilarity/NN ,/, i.e./FW are/VBP in/IN analogical/JJ proportion/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, when/WRB one/CD of/IN these/DT objects/NNS is/VBZ unknown/JJ ,/, it/PRP gives/VBZ algorithms/NNS to/TO compute/VB it/PRP ./.
Thirdly/RB ,/, it/PRP tackles/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN defining/VBG analogical/JJ dissimilarity/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT measure/NN of/IN how/WRB far/RB four/CD objects/NNS are/VBP from/IN being/VBG in/IN analogical/JJ proportion/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, when/WRB objects/NNS are/VBP sequences/NNS ,/, it/PRP gives/VBZ a/DT definition/NN and/CC an/DT algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN an/DT optimal/JJ alignment/NN of/IN the/DT four/CD sequences/NNS ./.
It/PRP gives/VBZ also/RB learning/VBG algorithms/NNS ,/, i.e./FW methods/NNS to/TO find/VB the/DT triple/JJ of/IN objects/NNS in/IN a/DT learning/NN sample/NN which/WDT has/VBZ the/DT least/JJS analogical/JJ dissimilarity/NN with/IN a/DT given/VBN object/NN ./.
Two/CD practical/JJ experiments/NNS are/VBP described/VBN :/: the/DT first/JJ is/VBZ a/DT classification/NN problem/NN on/IN benchmarks/NNS of/IN binary/JJ and/CC nominal/JJ data/NNS ,/, the/DT second/JJ shows/VBZ how/WRB the/DT generation/NN of/IN sequences/NNS by/IN solving/VBG analogical/JJ equations/NNS enables/VBZ a/DT handwritten/JJ character/NN recognition/NN system/NN to/TO rapidly/RB be/VB adapted/VBN to/IN a/DT new/JJ writer/NN ./.
