We/PRP propose/VBP `/`` Dracula/NNP '/'' ,/, a/DT new/JJ framework/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ feature/NN selection/NN from/IN sequential/JJ data/NNS such/JJ as/IN text/NN ./.
Dracula/NNP learns/VBZ a/DT dictionary/NN of/RB $/$ n/NN $/$ -/HYPH grams/NNS that/WDT efficiently/RB compresses/VBZ a/DT given/VBN corpus/NN and/CC recursively/RB compresses/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ dictionary/NN ;/: in/IN effect/NN ,/, Dracula/NNP is/VBZ a/DT `/`` deep/JJ '/'' extension/NN of/IN Compressive/NNP Feature/NNP Learning/NNP ./.
