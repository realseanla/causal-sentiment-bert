A/DT critical/JJ component/NN to/IN enabling/VBG intelligent/JJ reasoning/NN in/IN partially/RB observable/JJ environments/NNS is/VBZ memory/NN ./.
Despite/IN this/DT importance/NN ,/, Deep/JJ Reinforcement/NN Learning/NN (/-LRB- DRL/NN )/-RRB- agents/NNS have/VBP so/RB far/RB used/VBN relatively/RB simple/JJ memory/NN architectures/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT main/JJ methods/NNS to/TO overcome/VB partial/JJ observability/NN being/VBG either/CC a/DT temporal/JJ convolution/NN over/IN the/DT past/JJ k/CD frames/NNS or/CC an/DT LSTM/NN layer/NN ./.
More/RBR recent/JJ work/NN (/-LRB- Oh/NNP et/FW al./FW ,/, 2016/CD )/-RRB- has/VBZ went/VBD beyond/IN these/DT architectures/NNS by/IN using/VBG memory/NN networks/NNS which/WDT can/MD allow/VB more/RBR sophisticated/JJ addressing/VBG schemes/NNS over/IN the/DT past/JJ k/CD frames/NNS ./.
But/CC even/RB these/DT architectures/NNS are/VBP unsatisfactory/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT reason/NN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP limited/VBN to/IN only/RB remembering/VBG information/NN from/IN the/DT last/JJ k/NN frames/NNS ./.

This/DT architecture/NN ,/, called/VBD the/DT Neural/JJ Map/NN ,/, uses/VBZ a/DT spatially/RB structured/VBN 2D/NN memory/NN image/NN to/TO learn/VB to/TO store/VB arbitrary/JJ information/NN about/IN the/DT environment/NN over/RB long/JJ time/NN lags/VBZ ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP empirically/RB that/IN the/DT Neural/JJ Map/NN surpasses/VBZ previous/JJ DRL/NN memories/NNS on/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN challenging/JJ 2D/NN and/CC 3D/NN maze/NN environments/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN generalizing/VBG to/IN environments/NNS that/WDT were/VBD not/RB seen/VBN during/IN training/NN ./.
