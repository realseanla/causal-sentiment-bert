Visual/JJ narrative/NN is/VBZ often/RB a/DT combination/NN of/IN explicit/JJ information/NN and/CC judicious/JJ omissions/NNS ,/, relying/VBG on/IN the/DT viewer/NN to/TO supply/VB missing/JJ details/NNS ./.
In/IN comics/NNS ,/, most/JJS movements/NNS in/IN time/NN and/CC space/NN are/VBP hidden/VBN in/IN the/DT "/`` gutters/NNS "/'' between/IN panels/NNS ./.
To/TO follow/VB the/DT story/NN ,/, readers/NNS logically/RB connect/VBP panels/NNS together/RB by/IN inferring/VBG unseen/JJ actions/NNS through/IN a/DT process/NN called/VBN "/`` closure/NN "/'' ./.
While/IN computers/NNS can/MD now/RB describe/VB the/DT content/NN of/IN natural/JJ images/NNS ,/, in/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP examine/VBP whether/IN they/PRP can/MD understand/VB the/DT closure/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN narratives/NNS conveyed/VBN by/IN stylized/JJ artwork/NN and/CC dialogue/NN in/IN comic/JJ book/NN panels/NNS ./.
We/PRP collect/VBP a/DT dataset/NN ,/, COMICS/NN ,/, that/DT consists/VBZ of/IN over/IN 1.2/CD million/CD panels/NNS (/-LRB- 120/CD GB/NN )/-RRB- paired/VBN with/IN automatic/JJ textbox/NN transcriptions/NNS ./.
An/DT in/IN -/HYPH depth/NN analysis/NN of/IN COMICS/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN neither/CC text/NN nor/CC image/NN alone/RB can/MD tell/VB a/DT comic/JJ book/NN story/NN ,/, so/RB a/DT computer/NN must/MD understand/VB both/DT modalities/NNS to/TO keep/VB up/RP with/IN the/DT plot/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP three/CD cloze/NN -/HYPH style/NN tasks/NNS that/WDT ask/VBP models/NNS to/TO predict/VB narrative/NN and/CC character/NN -/HYPH centric/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN a/DT panel/NN given/VBN n/NN preceding/VBG panels/NNS as/IN context/NN ./.
Various/JJ deep/JJ neural/JJ architectures/NNS underperform/VBP human/JJ baselines/NNS on/IN these/DT tasks/NNS ,/, suggesting/VBG that/IN COMICS/NN contains/VBZ fundamental/JJ challenges/NNS for/IN both/DT vision/NN and/CC language/NN ./.
