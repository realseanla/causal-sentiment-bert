We/PRP present/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN performing/VBG hierarchical/JJ object/NN detection/NN in/IN images/NNS guided/VBN by/IN a/DT deep/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG agent/NN ./.
The/DT key/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ to/TO focus/VB on/IN those/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT image/NN that/WDT contain/VBP richer/JJR information/NN and/CC zoom/VB on/IN them/PRP ./.
We/PRP train/VBP an/DT intelligent/JJ agent/NN that/WDT ,/, given/VBN an/DT image/NN window/NN ,/, is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN deciding/VBG where/WRB to/TO focus/VB the/DT attention/NN among/IN five/CD different/JJ predefined/JJ region/NN candidates/NNS (/-LRB- smaller/JJR windows/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
This/DT procedure/NN is/VBZ iterated/VBN providing/VBG a/DT hierarchical/JJ image/NN analysis.We/NNP compare/VB two/CD different/JJ candidate/NN proposal/NN strategies/NNS to/TO guide/VB the/DT object/NN search/NN :/: with/IN and/CC without/IN overlap/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, our/PRP$ work/NN compares/VBZ two/CD different/JJ strategies/NNS to/TO extract/VB features/NNS from/IN a/DT convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN for/IN each/DT region/NN proposal/NN :/: a/DT first/JJ one/NN that/WDT computes/VBZ new/JJ feature/NN maps/VBZ for/IN each/DT region/NN proposal/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT second/JJ one/NN that/WDT computes/VBZ the/DT feature/NN maps/VBZ for/IN the/DT whole/JJ image/NN to/TO later/RB generate/VB crops/NNS for/IN each/DT region/NN proposal/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS indicate/VBP better/JJR results/NNS for/IN the/DT overlapping/VBG candidate/NN proposal/NN strategy/NN and/CC a/DT loss/NN of/IN performance/NN for/IN the/DT cropped/VBN image/NN features/NNS due/IN to/IN the/DT loss/NN of/IN spatial/JJ resolution/NN ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN ,/, while/IN this/DT loss/NN seems/VBZ unavoidable/JJ when/WRB working/VBG with/IN large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN object/NN candidates/NNS ,/, the/DT much/JJ more/JJR reduced/VBN amount/NN of/IN region/NN proposals/NNS generated/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG agent/NN allows/VBZ considering/VBG to/TO extract/VB features/NNS for/IN each/DT location/NN without/IN sharing/VBG convolutional/JJ computation/NN among/IN regions/NNS ./.
