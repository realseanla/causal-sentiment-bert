The/DT Knowledge/NN of/IN Preconditions/NNPS principle/NN (/-LRB- KoP/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ proposed/VBN as/IN a/DT widely/RB applicable/JJ connection/NN between/IN knowledge/NN and/CC action/NN in/IN multi-agent/JJ systems/NNS ./.
Roughly/RB speaking/VBG ,/, it/PRP asserts/VBZ that/IN if/IN some/DT condition/NN is/VBZ a/DT necessary/JJ condition/NN for/IN performing/VBG a/DT given/VBN action/NN A/NN ,/, then/RB knowing/VBG that/IN this/DT condition/NN holds/VBZ is/VBZ also/RB a/DT necessary/JJ condition/NN for/IN performing/VBG A/DT ./.
Since/IN the/DT specifications/NNS of/IN tasks/NNS often/RB involve/VBP necessary/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN actions/NNS ,/, the/DT KoP/NNP principle/NN shows/VBZ that/IN such/JJ specifications/NNS induce/VB knowledge/NN preconditions/NNS for/IN the/DT actions/NNS ./.
Distributed/VBN protocols/NNS or/CC multi-agent/JJ plans/NNS that/WDT satisfy/VBP the/DT specifications/NNS must/MD ensure/VB that/IN this/DT knowledge/NN be/VB attained/VBN ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ detected/VBN by/IN the/DT agents/NNS as/IN a/DT condition/NN for/IN action/NN ./.
The/DT knowledge/NN of/IN preconditions/NNS principle/NN is/VBZ formalised/VBN in/IN the/DT runs/NNS and/CC systems/NNS framework/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ proven/VBN to/TO hold/VB in/IN a/DT wide/JJ class/NN of/IN settings/NNS ./.
Well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN connections/NNS between/IN knowledge/NN and/CC coordinated/VBN action/NN are/VBP extended/VBN and/CC shown/VBN to/TO derive/VB directly/RB from/IN the/DT KoP/NNP principle/NN :/: a/DT "/`` common/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN preconditions/NNS "/'' principle/NN is/VBZ established/VBN showing/VBG that/IN common/JJ knowledge/NN is/VBZ a/DT necessary/JJ condition/NN for/IN performing/VBG simultaneous/JJ actions/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT "/`` nested/VBN knowledge/NN of/IN preconditions/NNS "/'' principle/NN is/VBZ proven/VBN ,/, showing/VBG that/IN coordinating/VBG actions/NNS to/TO be/VB performed/VBN in/IN linear/JJ temporal/JJ order/NN requires/VBZ a/DT corresponding/VBG form/NN of/IN nested/VBN knowledge/NN ./.
