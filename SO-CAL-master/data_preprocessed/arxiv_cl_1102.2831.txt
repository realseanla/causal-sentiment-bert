This/DT paper/NN studies/NNS the/DT effect/NN of/IN linguistic/JJ constraints/NNS on/IN the/DT large/JJ scale/NN organization/NN of/IN language/NN ./.
It/PRP describes/VBZ the/DT properties/NNS of/IN linguistic/JJ networks/NNS built/VBN using/VBG texts/NNS of/IN written/VBN language/NN with/IN the/DT words/NNS randomized/VBD ./.
These/DT properties/NNS are/VBP compared/VBN to/IN those/DT obtained/VBN for/IN a/DT network/NN built/VBN over/IN the/DT text/NN in/IN natural/JJ order/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ observed/VBN that/IN the/DT "/`` random/JJ "/'' networks/NNS too/RB exhibit/VBP small/JJ -/HYPH world/NN and/CC scale/NN -/HYPH free/JJ characteristics/NNS ./.

This/DT is/VBZ indeed/RB a/DT surprising/JJ result/NN -/HYPH one/NN that/WDT has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN addressed/VBN adequately/RB in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
