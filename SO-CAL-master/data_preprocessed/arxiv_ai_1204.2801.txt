We/PRP present/VBP a/DT framework/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ an/DT observer/NN to/TO determine/VB occluded/VBN portions/NNS of/IN a/DT structure/NN by/IN finding/VBG the/DT maximum/NN -/HYPH likelihood/NN estimate/NN of/IN those/DT occluded/VBN portions/NNS consistent/JJ with/IN visible/JJ image/NN evidence/NN and/CC a/DT consistency/NN model/NN ./.
