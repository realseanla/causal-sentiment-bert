The/DT restricted/JJ isometry/NN property/NN (/-LRB- RIP/UH )/-RRB- for/IN design/NN matrices/NNS gives/VBZ guarantees/NNS for/IN optimal/JJ recovery/NN in/IN sparse/JJ linear/JJ models/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ of/IN high/JJ interest/NN in/IN compressed/JJ sensing/VBG and/CC statistical/JJ learning/NN ./.
This/DT property/NN is/VBZ particularly/RB important/JJ for/IN computationally/RB efficient/JJ recovery/NN methods/NNS ./.
As/IN a/DT consequence/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN it/PRP is/VBZ in/IN general/JJ NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ to/TO check/VB that/IN RIP/UH holds/VBZ ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN substantial/JJ efforts/NNS to/TO find/VB tractable/JJ proxies/NNS for/IN it/PRP ./.

We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT framework/NN of/IN average/JJ -/HYPH case/NN certifiers/NNS ,/, that/WDT never/RB wrongly/RB declare/VB that/IN a/DT matrix/NN is/VBZ RIP/UH ,/, while/IN being/VBG often/RB correct/JJ for/IN random/JJ instances/NNS ./.
