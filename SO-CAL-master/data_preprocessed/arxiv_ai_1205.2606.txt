This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN online/JJ linear/JJ regression/NN whose/WP$ efficiency/NN guarantees/NNS satisfy/VBP the/DT requirements/NNS of/IN the/DT KWIK/NN (/-LRB- Knows/VBZ What/WP It/PRP Knows/VBZ )/-RRB- framework/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN improves/VBZ on/IN the/DT complexity/NN bounds/NNS of/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN procedure/NN in/IN this/DT setting/NN ./.
We/PRP explore/VBP several/JJ applications/NNS of/IN this/DT algorithm/NN for/IN learning/VBG compact/JJ reinforcement/NN -/HYPH learning/VBG representations/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN KWIK/NNP linear/JJ regression/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO learn/VB the/DT reward/NN function/NN of/IN a/DT factored/JJ MDP/NN and/CC the/DT probabilities/NNS of/IN action/NN outcomes/NNS in/IN Stochastic/JJ STRIPS/NNS and/CC Object/NN Oriented/VBN MDPs/NNS ,/, none/NN of/IN which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN proven/VBN to/TO be/VB efficiently/RB learnable/JJ in/IN the/DT RL/NN setting/VBG before/RB ./.
We/PRP also/RB combine/VBP KWIK/NN linear/JJ regression/NN with/IN other/JJ KWIK/NNP learners/NNS to/TO learn/VB larger/JJR portions/NNS of/IN these/DT models/NNS ,/, including/VBG experiments/NNS on/IN learning/VBG factored/VBD MDP/NNP transition/NN and/CC reward/NN functions/NNS together/RB ./.
