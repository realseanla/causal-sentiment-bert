In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP study/VBP different/JJ concepts/NNS of/IN independence/NN for/IN convex/NN sets/NNS of/IN probabilities/NNS ./.
There/EX will/MD be/VB two/CD basic/JJ ideas/NNS for/IN independence/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ is/VBZ irrelevance/NN ./.
Two/CD variables/NNS are/VBP independent/JJ when/WRB a/DT change/NN on/IN the/DT knowledge/NN about/IN one/CD variable/NN does/VBZ not/RB affect/VB the/DT other/JJ ./.
The/DT second/JJ one/NN is/VBZ factorization/NN ./.
Two/CD variables/NNS are/VBP independent/JJ when/WRB the/DT joint/JJ convex/NN set/NN of/IN probabilities/NNS can/MD be/VB decomposed/VBN on/IN the/DT product/NN of/IN marginal/JJ convex/NN sets/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT Theory/NN of/IN Probability/NNP ,/, these/DT two/CD starting/VBG points/NNS give/VBP rise/NN to/IN the/DT same/JJ definition/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN convex/NN sets/NNS of/IN probabilities/NNS ,/, the/DT resulting/VBG concepts/NNS will/MD be/VB strongly/RB related/VBN ,/, but/CC they/PRP will/MD not/RB be/VB equivalent/JJ ./.
As/IN application/NN of/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN independence/NN ,/, we/PRP shall/MD consider/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN building/VBG a/DT global/JJ convex/NN set/VBN from/IN marginal/JJ convex/NN sets/NNS of/IN probabilities/NNS ./.
