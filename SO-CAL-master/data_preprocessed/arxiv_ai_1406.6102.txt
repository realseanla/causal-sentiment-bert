This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT model/NN ,/, the/DT linear/JJ model/NN ,/, for/IN randomly/RB generating/VBG logic/NN programs/NNS with/IN low/JJ density/NN of/IN rules/NNS and/CC investigates/VBZ statistical/JJ properties/NNS of/IN such/JJ random/JJ logic/NN programs/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ mathematically/RB shown/VBN that/IN the/DT average/JJ number/NN of/IN answer/NN sets/NNS for/IN a/DT random/JJ program/NN converges/VBZ to/IN a/DT constant/JJ when/WRB the/DT number/NN of/IN atoms/NNS approaches/VBZ infinity/NN ./.
Several/JJ experimental/JJ results/NNS are/VBP also/RB reported/VBN ,/, which/WDT justify/VBP the/DT suitability/NN of/IN the/DT linear/JJ model/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ also/RB experimentally/RB shown/VBN that/IN ,/, under/IN this/DT model/NN ,/, the/DT size/NN distribution/NN of/IN answer/NN sets/NNS for/IN random/JJ programs/NNS tends/VBZ to/IN a/DT normal/JJ distribution/NN when/WRB the/DT number/NN of/IN atoms/NNS is/VBZ sufficiently/RB large/JJ ./.
