We/PRP present/VBP a/DT probabilistic/JJ model/NN that/WDT simultaneously/RB learns/VBZ alignments/NNS and/CC distributed/VBN representations/NNS for/IN bilingual/JJ data/NNS ./.
By/IN marginalizing/VBG over/IN word/NN alignments/NNS the/DT model/NN captures/VBZ a/DT larger/JJR semantic/JJ context/NN than/IN prior/JJ work/NN relying/VBG on/IN hard/JJ alignments/NNS ./.
