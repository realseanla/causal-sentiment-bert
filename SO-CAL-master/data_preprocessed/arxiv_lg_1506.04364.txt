We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT localized/VBN approach/NN to/IN multiple/JJ kernel/NN learning/NN that/WDT ,/, in/IN contrast/NN to/IN prevalent/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, can/MD be/VB formulated/VBN as/IN a/DT convex/NN optimization/NN problem/NN over/IN a/DT given/VBN cluster/NN structure/NN ./.
From/IN which/WDT we/PRP obtain/VBP the/DT first/JJ generalization/NN error/NN bounds/NNS for/IN localized/VBN multiple/JJ kernel/NN learning/NN and/CC derive/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ optimization/NN algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT Fenchel/NNP dual/JJ representation/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN datasets/NNS from/IN the/DT application/NN domains/NNS of/IN computational/JJ biology/NN and/CC computer/NN vision/NN show/VBP that/IN the/DT convex/NN approach/NN to/IN localized/VBN multiple/JJ kernel/NN learning/NN can/MD achieve/VB higher/JJR prediction/NN accuracies/NNS than/IN its/PRP$ global/JJ and/CC non-convex/JJ local/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
