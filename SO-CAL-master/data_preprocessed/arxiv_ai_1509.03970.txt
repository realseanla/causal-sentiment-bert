Humans/NNS are/VBP sensitive/JJ to/IN complexity/NN and/CC regularity/NN in/IN patterns/NNS ./.
The/DT subjective/JJ perception/NN of/IN pattern/NN complexity/NN is/VBZ correlated/VBN to/IN algorithmic/JJ (/-LRB- Kolmogorov/NNP -/HYPH Chaitin/NNP )/-RRB- complexity/NN as/IN defined/VBN in/IN computer/NN science/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB to/IN the/DT frequency/NN of/IN naturally/RB occurring/VBG patterns/NNS ./.
