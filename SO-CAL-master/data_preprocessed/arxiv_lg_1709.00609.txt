Pattern/NN classification/NN systems/NNS are/VBP commonly/RB used/VBN in/IN adversarial/JJ applications/NNS ,/, like/IN biometric/JJ authentication/NN ,/, network/NN intrusion/NN detection/NN ,/, and/CC spam/NN filtering/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT data/NNS can/MD be/VB purposely/RB manipulated/VBN by/IN humans/NNS to/TO undermine/VB their/PRP$ operation/NN ./.
As/IN this/DT adversarial/JJ scenario/NN is/VBZ not/RB taken/VBN into/IN account/NN by/IN classical/JJ design/NN methods/NNS ,/, pattern/NN classification/NN systems/NNS may/MD exhibit/VB vulnerabilities/NNS ,/, whose/WP$ exploitation/NN may/MD severely/RB affect/VB their/PRP$ performance/NN ,/, and/CC consequently/RB limit/VB their/PRP$ practical/JJ utility/NN ./.
