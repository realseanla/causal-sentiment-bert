In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP use/VBP the/DT framework/NN of/IN neural/JJ machine/NN translation/NN to/TO learn/VB joint/JJ sentence/NN representations/NNS across/IN different/JJ languages/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ hope/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT representation/NN which/WDT is/VBZ independent/JJ of/IN the/DT language/NN a/DT sentence/NN is/VBZ written/VBN in/IN ,/, is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO capture/VB the/DT underlying/VBG semantics/NNS ./.
We/PRP search/VBP and/CC compare/VBP more/JJR than/IN 1.4/CD M/NN sentence/NN representations/NNS in/IN three/CD different/JJ languages/NNS and/CC study/VB the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN close/JJ sentences/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP experimental/JJ evidence/NN that/IN sentences/NNS that/WDT are/VBP close/JJ in/IN embedding/VBG space/NN are/VBP indeed/RB semantically/RB highly/RB related/JJ ,/, but/CC often/RB have/VBP quite/RB different/JJ structure/NN and/CC syntax/NN ./.
These/DT relations/NNS also/RB hold/VBP when/WRB comparing/VBG sentences/NNS in/IN different/JJ languages/NNS ./.
