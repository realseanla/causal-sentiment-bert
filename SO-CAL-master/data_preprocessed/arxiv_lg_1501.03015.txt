An/DT important/JJ first/JJ step/NN in/IN computational/JJ SAR/NNP modeling/NN is/VBZ to/TO transform/VB the/DT compounds/NNS into/IN a/DT representation/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB processed/VBN by/IN predictive/JJ modeling/NN techniques/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ typically/RB a/DT feature/NN vector/NN where/WRB each/DT feature/NN indicates/VBZ the/DT presence/NN or/CC absence/NN of/IN a/DT molecular/JJ fragment/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT traditional/JJ approach/NN to/IN SAR/NNP modeling/VBG employed/VBN size/NN restricted/VBN fingerprints/NNS derived/VBN from/IN path/NN fragments/NNS ,/, much/JJ research/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS focussed/VBN on/IN mining/VBG more/RBR complex/JJ graph/NN based/VBN fragments/NNS ./.
Today/NN ,/, there/RB seems/VBZ to/TO be/VB a/DT growing/VBG consensus/NN in/IN the/DT data/NNS mining/NN community/NN that/WDT these/DT more/JJR expressive/JJ fragments/NNS should/MD be/VB more/RBR useful/JJ ./.
We/PRP question/VBP this/DT consensus/NN and/CC show/VBP experimentally/RB that/IN fragments/NNS of/IN low/JJ complexity/NN ,/, i.e./FW sequences/NNS ,/, perform/VB better/JJR than/IN equally/RB large/JJ sets/NNS of/IN more/RBR complex/JJ ones/NNS ,/, an/DT effect/NN we/PRP explain/VBP by/IN pairwise/JJ correlation/NN among/IN fragments/NNS and/CC the/DT ability/NN of/IN a/DT fragment/NN set/NN to/TO encode/VB compounds/NNS from/IN different/JJ classes/NNS distinctly/RB ./.
The/DT size/NN restriction/NN on/IN these/DT sets/NNS is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN ordering/VBG the/DT fragments/NNS by/IN class/NN -/HYPH correlation/NN scores/NNS ./.
