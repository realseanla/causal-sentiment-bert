Plausibility/NN models/NNS are/VBP Kripke/NNP models/NNS that/WDT agents/NNS use/VBP to/TO reason/VB about/RB knowledge/NN and/CC belief/NN ,/, both/DT of/IN themselves/PRP and/CC of/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
Such/JJ models/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO interpret/VB the/DT notions/NNS of/IN conditional/JJ belief/NN ,/, degrees/NNS of/IN belief/NN ,/, and/CC safe/JJ belief/NN ./.
The/DT logic/NN of/IN conditional/JJ belief/NN contains/VBZ that/IN modality/NN and/CC also/RB the/DT knowledge/NN modality/NN ,/, and/CC similarly/RB for/IN the/DT logic/NN of/IN degrees/NNS of/IN belief/NN and/CC the/DT logic/NN of/IN safe/JJ belief/NN ./.
With/IN respect/NN to/IN these/DT logics/NNS ,/, plausibility/NN models/NNS may/MD contain/VB too/RB much/JJ information/NN ./.
A/DT proper/JJ notion/NN of/IN bisimulation/NN is/VBZ required/VBN that/DT characterises/VBZ them/PRP ./.
We/PRP define/VBP that/IN notion/NN of/IN bisimulation/NN and/CC prove/VB the/DT required/VBN characterisations/NNS :/: on/IN the/DT class/NN of/IN image/NN -/HYPH finite/NN and/CC preimage/NN -/HYPH finite/NN models/NNS (/-LRB- with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT plausibility/NN relation/NN )/-RRB- ,/, two/CD pointed/VBD Kripke/NNP models/NNS are/VBP modally/RB equivalent/JJ in/IN either/DT of/IN the/DT three/CD logics/NNS ,/, if/IN and/CC only/RB if/IN they/PRP are/VBP bisimilar/JJ ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT information/NN content/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT model/NN can/MD be/VB similarly/RB expressed/VBN in/IN the/DT logic/NN of/IN conditional/JJ belief/NN ,/, or/CC the/DT logic/NN of/IN degrees/NNS of/IN belief/NN ,/, or/CC that/DT of/IN safe/JJ belief/NN ./.
This/DT ,/, we/PRP found/VBD a/DT surprising/JJ result/NN ./.
Still/RB ,/, that/DT does/VBZ not/RB mean/VB that/IN the/DT logics/NNS are/VBP equally/RB expressive/JJ :/: the/DT logics/NNS of/IN conditional/JJ and/CC degrees/NNS of/IN belief/NN are/VBP incomparable/JJ ,/, the/DT logics/NNS of/IN degrees/NNS of/IN belief/NN and/CC safe/JJ belief/NN are/VBP incomparable/JJ ,/, while/IN the/DT logic/NN of/IN safe/JJ belief/NN is/VBZ more/RBR expressive/JJ than/IN the/DT logic/NN of/IN conditional/JJ belief/NN ./.
In/IN view/NN of/IN the/DT result/NN on/IN bisimulation/NN characterisation/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ an/DT equally/RB surprising/JJ result/NN ./.
We/PRP hope/VBP our/PRP$ insights/NNS may/MD contribute/VB to/IN the/DT growing/VBG community/NN of/IN formal/JJ epistemology/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT relation/NN between/IN qualitative/JJ and/CC quantitative/JJ modelling/NN ./.
