This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ InfoGAN/NNP ,/, an/DT information/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ extension/NN to/IN the/DT Generative/NNP Adversarial/NNP Network/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO learn/VB disentangled/JJ representations/NNS in/IN a/DT completely/RB unsupervised/JJ manner/NN ./.
InfoGAN/NNP is/VBZ a/DT generative/JJ adversarial/JJ network/NN that/WDT also/RB maximizes/VBZ the/DT mutual/JJ information/NN between/IN a/DT small/JJ subset/NN of/IN the/DT latent/JJ variables/NNS and/CC the/DT observation/NN ./.
We/PRP derive/VBP a/DT lower/JJR bound/JJ to/IN the/DT mutual/JJ information/NN objective/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB optimized/VBN efficiently/RB ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ training/NN procedure/NN can/MD be/VB interpreted/VBN as/IN a/DT variation/NN of/IN the/DT Wake/NN -/HYPH Sleep/NN algorithm/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, InfoGAN/NNP successfully/RB disentangles/VBZ writing/VBG styles/NNS from/IN digit/NN shapes/NNS on/IN the/DT MNIST/NN dataset/NN ,/, pose/VBP from/IN lighting/NN of/IN 3D/NN rendered/VBN images/NNS ,/, and/CC background/NN digits/NNS from/IN the/DT central/JJ digit/NN on/IN the/DT SVHN/NNP dataset/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB discovers/VBZ visual/JJ concepts/NNS that/WDT include/VBP hair/NN styles/NNS ,/, presence/NN //HYPH absence/NN of/IN eyeglasses/NNS ,/, and/CC emotions/NNS on/IN the/DT CelebA/NN face/NN dataset/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN InfoGAN/NNP learns/VBZ interpretable/JJ representations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP competitive/JJ with/IN representations/NNS learned/VBN by/IN existing/VBG fully/RB supervised/JJ methods/NNS ./.
