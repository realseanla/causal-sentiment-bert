In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP several/JJ types/NNS of/IN information/NN and/CC methods/NNS of/IN combination/NN associated/VBN with/IN incomplete/JJ probabilistic/JJ systems/NNS ./.
We/PRP discriminate/VBP between/IN '/`` a/FW priori/FW '/'' and/CC evidential/JJ information/NN ./.
The/DT former/JJ one/NN is/VBZ a/DT description/NN of/IN the/DT whole/JJ population/NN ,/, the/DT latest/JJS is/VBZ a/DT restriction/NN based/VBN on/IN observations/NNS for/IN a/DT particular/JJ case/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP different/JJ combination/NN methods/NNS for/IN each/DT one/CD of/IN them/PRP ./.
We/PRP also/RB consider/VBP conditioning/VBG as/IN the/DT heterogeneous/JJ combination/NN of/IN '/`` a/FW priori/FW '/'' and/CC evidential/JJ information/NN ./.
The/DT evidential/JJ information/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN as/IN a/DT convex/NN set/NN of/IN likelihood/NN functions/NNS ./.
These/DT will/MD have/VB an/DT associated/JJ possibility/NN distribution/NN with/IN behavior/NN according/VBG to/IN classical/JJ Possibility/NN Theory/NN ./.
