Structured/VBN prediction/NN applications/NNS often/RB involve/VBP complex/JJ inference/NN problems/NNS that/WDT require/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN approximate/JJ methods/NNS ./.
Approximations/NNS based/VBN on/IN linear/JJ programming/NN (/-LRB- LP/NN )/-RRB- relaxations/NNS have/VBP proved/VBN particularly/RB successful/JJ in/IN this/DT setting/NN ,/, with/IN both/DT theoretical/JJ and/CC empirical/JJ support/NN ./.
