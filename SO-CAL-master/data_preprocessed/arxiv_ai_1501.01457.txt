In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT impact/NN of/IN selection/NN methods/NNS in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN on/IN -/HYPH line/NN on/IN -/HYPH board/NN distributed/VBN evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT variant/NN of/IN the/DT mEDEA/NNP algorithm/NN in/IN which/WDT we/PRP add/VBP a/DT selection/NN operator/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP apply/VBP it/PRP in/IN a/DT taskdriven/NN scenario/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP four/CD selection/NN methods/NNS that/WDT induce/VBP different/JJ intensity/NN of/IN selection/NN pressure/NN in/IN a/DT multi-robot/JJ navigation/NN with/IN obstacle/NN avoidance/NN task/NN and/CC a/DT collective/JJ foraging/VBG task/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN a/DT small/JJ intensity/NN of/IN selection/NN pressure/NN is/VBZ sufficient/JJ to/TO rapidly/RB obtain/VB good/JJ performances/NNS on/IN the/DT tasks/NNS at/IN hand/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP different/JJ measures/NNS to/TO compare/VB the/DT selection/NN methods/NNS ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN the/DT higher/JJR the/DT selection/NN pressure/NN ,/, the/DT better/JJR the/DT performances/NNS obtained/VBN ,/, especially/RB for/IN the/DT more/JJR challenging/JJ food/NN foraging/VBG task/NN ./.
