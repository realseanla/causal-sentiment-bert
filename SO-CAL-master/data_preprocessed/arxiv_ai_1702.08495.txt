In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS prominent/JJ intellectuals/NNS have/VBP raised/VBN ethical/JJ concerns/NNS about/IN the/DT consequences/NNS of/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN ./.
One/CD concern/NN is/VBZ that/IN an/DT autonomous/JJ agent/NN might/MD modify/VB itself/PRP to/TO become/VB "/`` superintelligent/NN "/'' and/CC ,/, in/IN supremely/RB effective/JJ pursuit/NN of/IN poorly/RB specified/VBN goals/NNS ,/, destroy/VB all/DT of/IN humanity/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ and/CC rejects/VBZ the/DT possibility/NN of/IN this/DT outcome/NN ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN this/DT scenario/NN depends/VBZ on/IN an/DT agent/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO rapidly/RB improve/VB its/PRP$ ability/NN to/TO predict/VB its/PRP$ environment/NN through/IN self/NN -/HYPH modification/NN ./.
Using/VBG a/DT Bayesian/JJ model/NN of/IN a/DT reasoning/NN agent/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN there/EX are/VBP important/JJ limitations/NNS to/IN how/WRB an/DT agent/NN may/MD improve/VB its/PRP$ predictive/JJ ability/NN through/IN self/NN -/HYPH modification/NN alone/JJ ./.
We/PRP conclude/VBP that/IN concern/NN about/IN this/DT artificial/JJ intelligence/NN outcome/NN is/VBZ misplaced/VBN and/CC better/JJR directed/VBN at/IN policy/NN questions/NNS around/IN data/NNS access/NN and/CC storage/NN ./.
