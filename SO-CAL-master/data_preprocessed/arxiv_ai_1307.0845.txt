The/DT theory/NN aims/VBZ to/TO simplify/VB and/CC integrate/VB ideas/NNS across/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN ,/, mainstream/NN computing/NN ,/, and/CC human/JJ perception/NN and/CC cognition/NN ,/, with/IN information/NN compression/NN as/IN a/DT unifying/JJ theme/NN ./.
It/PRP combines/VBZ conceptual/JJ simplicity/NN with/IN descriptive/JJ and/CC explanatory/JJ power/NN across/IN several/JJ areas/NNS of/IN computing/NN and/CC cognition/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT "/`` SP/NN machine/NN "/'' --/: an/DT expression/NN of/IN the/DT SP/NN theory/NN which/WDT is/VBZ currently/RB realised/VBN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT computer/NN model/NN --/: there/EX is/VBZ potential/JJ for/IN an/DT overall/JJ simplification/NN of/IN computing/VBG systems/NNS ,/, including/VBG software/NN ./.
The/DT SP/NN theory/NN promises/VBZ deeper/JJR insights/NNS and/CC better/JJR solutions/NNS in/IN several/JJ areas/NNS of/IN application/NN ,/, including/VBG natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN ,/, autonomous/JJ robots/NNS ,/, computer/NN vision/NN ,/, intelligent/JJ databases/NNS ,/, structuring/NN of/IN documents/NNS ,/, software/NN engineering/NN ,/, information/NN compression/NN ,/, the/DT economical/JJ transmission/NN of/IN data/NNS ,/, big/JJ data/NNS ,/, the/DT semantic/JJ web/NN ,/, medical/JJ diagnosis/NN ,/, the/DT detection/NN of/IN computer/NN viruses/NNS ,/, data/NNS fusion/NN ,/, and/CC new/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN computer/NN ./.
The/DT theory/NN promises/VBZ seamless/JJ integration/NN of/IN structures/NNS and/CC functions/NNS within/IN and/CC between/IN different/JJ areas/NNS of/IN application/NN ./.
