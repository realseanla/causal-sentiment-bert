An/DT important/JJ issue/NN in/IN public/JJ goods/NNS game/NN is/VBZ whether/IN player/NN 's/POS behaviour/NN changes/NNS over/IN time/NN ,/, and/CC if/IN so/RB ,/, how/WRB significant/JJ it/PRP is/VBZ ./.
In/IN this/DT game/NN players/NNS can/MD be/VB classified/VBN into/IN different/JJ groups/NNS according/VBG to/IN the/DT level/NN of/IN their/PRP$ participation/NN in/IN the/DT public/JJ good/NN ./.
This/DT problem/NN can/MD be/VB considered/VBN as/IN a/DT concept/NN drift/NN problem/NN by/IN asking/VBG the/DT amount/NN of/IN change/NN that/WDT happens/VBZ to/IN the/DT clusters/NNS of/IN players/NNS over/IN a/DT sequence/NN of/IN game/NN rounds/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT study/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN measuring/VBG changes/NNS in/IN clusters/NNS with/IN the/DT same/JJ items/NNS over/IN discrete/JJ time/NN points/NNS using/VBG external/JJ clustering/NN validation/NN indices/NNS and/CC area/NN under/IN the/DT curve/NN ./.
External/JJ clustering/NN indices/NNS were/VBD originally/RB used/VBN to/TO measure/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN suggested/VBN clusters/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN clustering/NN algorithms/NNS and/CC ground/NN truth/NN labels/NNS for/IN items/NNS provided/VBN by/IN experts/NNS ./.
Instead/RB of/IN different/JJ cluster/NN label/NN comparison/NN ,/, we/PRP use/VBP these/DT indices/NNS to/TO compare/VB between/IN clusters/NNS of/IN any/DT two/CD consecutive/JJ time/NN points/NNS or/CC between/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN point/NN and/CC the/DT remaining/VBG time/NN points/NNS to/TO measure/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN clusters/NNS through/IN time/NN points/NNS ./.
In/IN theory/NN ,/, any/DT external/JJ clustering/NN indices/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO measure/VB changes/NNS for/IN any/DT traditional/JJ (/-LRB- non-temporal/JJ )/-RRB- clustering/NN algorithm/NN ,/, due/IN to/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN any/DT time/NN point/NN alone/RB is/VBZ not/RB carrying/VBG any/DT temporal/JJ information/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT public/JJ goods/NNS game/NN ,/, our/PRP$ results/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN the/DT players/NNS are/VBP changing/VBG over/IN time/NN but/CC the/DT change/NN is/VBZ smooth/JJ and/CC relatively/RB constant/JJ between/IN any/DT two/CD time/NN points/NNS ./.
