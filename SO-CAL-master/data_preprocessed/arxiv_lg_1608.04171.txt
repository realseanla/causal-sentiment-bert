As/IN many/JJ applications/NNS organize/VB data/NNS into/IN temporal/JJ sequences/NNS ,/, the/DT problem/NN of/IN time/NN series/NN data/NNS classification/NN has/VBZ been/VBN widely/RB studied/VBN ./.
Recent/JJ studies/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT 1/CD -/HYPH nearest/JJS neighbor/NN with/IN dynamic/JJ time/NN warping/NN (/-LRB- 1NN/NN -/HYPH DTW/NN )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT long/JJ short/JJ term/NN memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- neural/JJ network/NN can/MD achieve/VB a/DT better/JJR performance/NN than/IN other/JJ machine/NN learning/VBG algorithms/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP build/VBP a/DT novel/JJ time/NN series/NN classification/NN algorithm/NN hybridizing/VBG 1NN/NN -/HYPH DTW/NN and/CC LSTM/NN ,/, and/CC apply/VB it/PRP to/IN a/DT practical/JJ data/NNS center/NN power/NN monitoring/NN problem/NN ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP define/VBP a/DT new/JJ distance/NN measurement/NN for/IN the/DT 1NN/NN -/HYPH DTW/NN classifier/NN ,/, termed/VBN as/IN Advancing/VBG Dynamic/JJ Time/NN Warping/NN (/-LRB- ADTW/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ non-commutative/JJ and/CC non-dynamic/JJ programming/NN ./.
Secondly/RB ,/, we/PRP hybridize/VBP the/DT 1NN/NN -/HYPH ADTW/NN and/CC LSTM/NN together/RB ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, a/DT series/NN of/IN auxiliary/JJ test/NN samples/NNS generated/VBN by/IN the/DT linear/JJ combination/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ test/NN sample/NN and/CC its/PRP$ nearest/JJS neighbor/NN with/IN ADTW/NN are/VBP utilized/VBN to/TO detect/VB which/WDT classifier/NN to/TO trust/VB in/IN the/DT hybrid/NN algorithm/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, using/VBG the/DT power/NN consumption/NN data/NNS from/IN a/DT real/JJ data/NNS center/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN ADTW/NN can/MD improve/VB the/DT classification/NN accuracy/NN from/IN about/RB 84/CD \/SYM percent/NN to/IN 89/CD \/SYM percent/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, with/IN the/DT hybrid/NN algorithm/NN ,/, the/DT accuracy/NN can/MD be/VB further/RB improved/VBN and/CC we/PRP achieve/VBP an/DT accuracy/NN up/RP to/IN about/RB 92/CD \/SYM percent/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ research/NN can/MD inspire/VB more/JJR studies/NNS on/IN non-commutative/JJ distance/NN measurement/NN and/CC the/DT hybrid/NN of/IN the/DT deep/JJ learning/NN models/NNS with/IN other/JJ traditional/JJ models/NNS ./.
