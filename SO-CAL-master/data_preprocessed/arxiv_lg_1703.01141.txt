The/DT ubiquity/NN of/IN sequences/NNS in/IN many/JJ domains/NNS enhances/VBZ significant/JJ recent/JJ interest/NN in/IN sequence/NN learning/NN ,/, for/IN which/WDT a/DT basic/JJ problem/NN is/VBZ how/WRB to/TO measure/VB the/DT distance/NN between/IN sequences/NNS ./.
Dynamic/JJ time/NN warping/NN (/-LRB- DTW/NN )/-RRB- aligns/VBZ two/CD sequences/NNS by/IN nonlinear/JJ local/JJ warping/NN and/CC returns/VBZ a/DT distance/NN value/NN ./.

However/RB ,/, in/IN DTW/NNP ,/, two/CD points/NNS are/VBP paired/VBN essentially/RB based/VBN on/IN point/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH point/NN Euclidean/JJ distance/NN (/-LRB- ED/NN )/-RRB- without/IN considering/VBG the/DT autocorrelation/NN of/IN sequences/NNS ./.
Thus/RB ,/, points/NNS with/IN different/JJ semantic/JJ meanings/NNS ,/, e.g./FW peaks/NNS and/CC valleys/NNS ,/, may/MD be/VB matched/VBN providing/VBG their/PRP$ coordinate/NN values/NNS are/VBP similar/JJ ./.

DSW/NNP converts/VBZ each/DT time/NN point/NN into/IN a/DT latent/JJ state/NN ,/, which/WDT endows/VBZ point-wise/JJ autocorrelation/NN information/NN ./.
