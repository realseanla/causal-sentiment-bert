Though/IN there/EX are/VBP some/DT works/NNS on/IN improving/VBG distributed/VBN word/NN representations/NNS using/VBG lexicons/NNS ,/, the/DT improper/JJ overfitting/NN of/IN the/DT words/NNS that/WDT have/VBP multiple/JJ meanings/NNS is/VBZ a/DT remaining/VBG issue/NN deteriorating/VBG the/DT learning/NN when/WRB lexicons/NNS are/VBP used/VBN ,/, which/WDT needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB solved/VBN ./.
An/DT alternative/JJ method/NN is/VBZ to/TO allocate/VB a/DT vector/NN per/IN sense/NN instead/RB a/DT vector/NN per/IN word/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT word/NN representations/NNS estimated/VBN in/IN the/DT former/JJ way/NN are/VBP not/RB as/RB easy/JJ to/TO use/VB as/IN the/DT latter/JJ one/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ previous/JJ work/NN uses/VBZ a/DT probabilistic/JJ method/NN to/TO alleviate/VB the/DT overfitting/NN ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB robust/JJ with/IN small/JJ corpus/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ neural/JJ network/NN to/TO estimate/VB distributed/VBN word/NN representations/NNS using/VBG a/DT lexicon/NN and/CC a/DT corpus/NN ./.
We/PRP add/VBP a/DT lexicon/NN layer/NN in/IN continuous/JJ bag/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH words/NNS model/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT threshold/NN node/NN after/IN the/DT output/NN of/IN the/DT lexicon/NN layer/NN ./.
The/DT threshold/NN rejects/VBZ the/DT "/`` bad/JJ "/'' outputs/NNS of/IN the/DT lexicon/NN layer/NN that/WDT are/VBP less/RBR likely/JJ to/TO be/VB the/DT same/JJ with/IN their/PRP$ inputs/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, it/PRP alleviates/VBZ the/DT overfitting/NN of/IN the/DT polysemous/JJ words/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN neural/JJ network/NN can/MD be/VB trained/VBN using/VBG negative/JJ sampling/NN ,/, which/WDT maximizing/VBG the/DT log/NN probabilities/NNS of/IN target/NN words/NNS given/VBN the/DT context/NN words/NNS ,/, by/IN distinguishing/VBG the/DT target/NN words/NNS from/IN random/JJ noises/NNS ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP the/DT proposed/VBN neural/JJ network/NN with/IN continuous/JJ bag/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH words/NNS model/NN ,/, the/DT other/JJ works/NNS improving/VBG it/PRP ,/, and/CC the/DT previous/JJ works/NNS estimating/VBG distributed/VBN word/NN representations/NNS using/VBG both/CC a/DT lexicon/NN and/CC a/DT corpus/NN ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN neural/JJ network/NN is/VBZ more/RBR efficient/JJ and/CC balanced/JJ for/IN both/DT semantic/JJ tasks/NNS and/CC syntactic/JJ tasks/NNS than/IN the/DT previous/JJ works/NNS ,/, and/CC robust/JJ to/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT corpus/NN ./.
