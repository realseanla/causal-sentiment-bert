This/DT paper/NN studies/NNS graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN active/JJ learning/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO reconstruct/VB a/DT binary/JJ signal/NN defined/VBN on/IN the/DT nodes/NNS of/IN a/DT weighted/JJ graph/NN ,/, by/IN sampling/VBG it/PRP on/IN a/DT small/JJ subset/NN of/IN the/DT nodes/NNS ./.
A/DT new/JJ sampling/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ,/, which/WDT sequentially/RB selects/VBZ the/DT graph/NN nodes/NNS to/TO be/VB sampled/VBN ,/, based/VBN on/IN an/DT aggressive/JJ search/NN for/IN the/DT boundary/NN of/IN the/DT signal/NN over/IN the/DT graph/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN generalizes/VBZ a/DT recent/JJ method/NN for/IN sampling/NN nodes/NNS in/IN unweighted/JJ graphs/NNS ./.
The/DT generalization/NN improves/VBZ the/DT sampling/NN performance/NN using/VBG the/DT information/NN gained/VBN from/IN the/DT available/JJ graph/NN weights/NNS ./.
An/DT analysis/NN of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN samples/NNS required/VBN by/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN is/VBZ provided/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT gain/NN over/IN the/DT unweighted/JJ method/NN is/VBZ further/JJ demonstrated/VBD in/IN simulations/NNS ./.
Additionally/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN with/IN an/DT alternative/JJ state/NN of/IN -/: the/DT -/HYPH art/NN method/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT graph/NN 's/POS spectral/JJ properties/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ the/DT spectral/JJ sampling/NN method/NN ,/, if/IN the/DT signal/NN needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB predicted/VBN with/IN high/JJ accuracy/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, if/IN a/DT higher/JJR level/NN of/IN inaccuracy/NN is/VBZ tolerable/JJ ,/, then/RB the/DT spectral/JJ method/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT proposed/VBN aggressive/JJ search/NN method/NN ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT hybrid/NN method/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ shown/VBN to/TO combine/VB the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN both/DT approaches/NNS ./.
