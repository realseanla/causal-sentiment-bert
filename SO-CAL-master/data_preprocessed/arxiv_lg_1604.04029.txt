Multiple/JJ views/NNS containing/VBG different/JJ types/NNS of/IN features/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN clustering/NN ./.
Although/IN multi-view/JJ clustering/NN has/VBZ been/VBN successfully/RB applied/VBN in/IN many/JJ applications/NNS ,/, the/DT previous/JJ methods/NNS usually/RB assume/VBP the/DT complete/JJ instance/NN mapping/NN between/IN different/JJ views/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN applications/NNS ,/, information/NN can/MD be/VB gathered/VBN from/IN multiple/JJ sources/NNS ,/, while/IN each/DT source/NN can/MD contain/VB multiple/JJ views/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP more/RBR cohesive/JJ for/IN learning/NN ./.
The/DT views/NNS under/IN the/DT same/JJ source/NN are/VBP usually/RB fully/RB mapped/VBN ,/, but/CC they/PRP can/MD be/VB very/RB heterogeneous/JJ ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, the/DT mappings/NNS between/IN different/JJ sources/NNS are/VBP usually/RB incomplete/JJ and/CC partially/RB observed/VBN ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP more/RBR difficult/JJ to/TO integrate/VB all/PDT the/DT views/NNS across/IN different/JJ sources/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP MMC/NN (/-LRB- Multi-source/JJ Multi-view/NN Clustering/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT framework/NN based/VBN on/IN collective/JJ spectral/JJ clustering/NN with/IN a/DT discrepancy/NN penalty/NN across/IN sources/NNS ,/, to/TO tackle/VB these/DT challenges/NNS ./.
MMC/NN has/VBZ several/JJ advantages/NNS compared/VBN with/IN other/JJ existing/VBG methods/NNS ./.

Third/JJ ,/, MMC/NN also/RB tries/VBZ to/TO infer/VB the/DT instance/NN similarities/NNS across/IN sources/NNS to/TO enhance/VB the/DT clustering/NN performance/NN ./.
