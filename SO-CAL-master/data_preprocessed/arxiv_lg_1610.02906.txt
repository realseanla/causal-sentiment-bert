This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN network/NN embedding/NN ,/, which/WDT aims/VBZ at/IN learning/VBG low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ vector/NN representation/NN of/IN nodes/NNS in/IN networks/NNS ./.
Most/JJS existing/VBG network/NN embedding/NN methods/NNS rely/VBP solely/RB on/IN the/DT network/NN structure/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, the/DT linkage/NN relationships/NNS between/IN nodes/NNS ,/, but/CC ignore/VB the/DT rich/JJ content/NN information/NN associated/VBN with/IN it/PRP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ common/JJ in/IN real/JJ world/NN networks/NNS and/CC beneficial/JJ to/IN describing/VBG the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN a/DT node/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP content/NN -/HYPH enhanced/VBN network/NN embedding/NN (/-LRB- CENE/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN jointly/RB leveraging/VBG the/DT network/NN structure/NN and/CC the/DT content/NN information/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN integrates/VBZ text/NN modeling/NN and/CC structure/NN modeling/NN in/IN a/DT general/JJ framework/NN by/IN treating/VBG the/DT content/NN information/NN as/IN a/DT special/JJ kind/NN of/IN node/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN several/JJ real/JJ world/NN net/JJ -/HYPH works/NNS with/IN application/NN to/IN node/NN classification/NN show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ models/NNS outperform/VBP all/DT existing/VBG network/NN embedding/NN methods/NNS ,/, demonstrating/VBG the/DT merits/NNS of/IN content/JJ information/NN and/CC joint/JJ learning/NN ./.
