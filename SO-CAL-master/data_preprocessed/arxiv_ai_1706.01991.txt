Symbolic/JJ has/VBZ been/VBN long/RB considered/VBN as/IN a/DT language/NN of/IN human/JJ intelligence/NN while/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP advantages/NNS of/IN robust/JJ computation/NN and/CC dealing/VBG with/IN noisy/JJ data/NNS ./.
The/DT integration/NN of/IN neural/JJ -/HYPH symbolic/JJ can/MD offer/VB better/JJR learning/NN and/CC reasoning/NN while/IN providing/VBG a/DT means/NN for/IN interpretability/NN through/IN the/DT representation/NN of/IN symbolic/JJ knowledge/NN ./.
Although/IN previous/JJ works/NNS focus/VBP intensively/RB on/IN supervised/JJ feedforward/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, little/JJ has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN for/IN the/DT unsupervised/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
