We/PRP address/VBP the/DT cost/NN -/HYPH sensitive/JJ feature/NN acquisition/NN problem/NN ,/, where/WRB misclassifying/VBG an/DT instance/NN is/VBZ costly/JJ but/CC the/DT expected/VBN misclassification/NN cost/NN can/MD be/VB reduced/VBN by/IN acquiring/VBG the/DT values/NNS of/IN the/DT missing/JJ features/NNS ./.
Because/IN acquiring/VBG the/DT features/NNS is/VBZ costly/JJ as/RB well/RB ,/, the/DT objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO acquire/VB the/DT right/JJ set/NN of/IN features/NNS so/IN that/IN the/DT sum/NN of/IN the/DT feature/NN acquisition/NN cost/NN and/CC misclassification/NN cost/NN is/VBZ minimized/VBN ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP the/DT Value/NN of/IN Information/NN Lattice/NN (/-LRB- VOILA/NN )/-RRB- ,/, an/DT optimal/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ feature/NN subset/NN acquisition/NN framework/NN ./.
Unlike/IN the/DT common/JJ practice/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ to/TO acquire/VB features/NNS greedily/RB ,/, VOILA/NNP can/MD reason/VB with/IN subsets/NNS of/IN features/NNS ./.
VOILA/NNP efficiently/RB searches/VBZ the/DT space/NN of/IN possible/JJ feature/NN subsets/NNS by/IN discovering/VBG and/CC exploiting/VBG conditional/JJ independence/NN properties/NNS between/IN the/DT features/NNS and/CC it/PRP reuses/VBZ probabilistic/JJ inference/NN computations/NNS to/TO further/RB speed/VB up/RP the/DT process/NN ./.
Through/IN empirical/JJ evaluation/NN on/IN five/CD medical/JJ datasets/NNS ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT greedy/JJ strategy/NN is/VBZ often/RB reluctant/JJ to/TO acquire/VB features/NNS ,/, as/IN it/PRP can/MD not/RB forecast/VB the/DT benefit/NN of/IN acquiring/VBG multiple/JJ features/NNS in/IN combination/NN ./.
