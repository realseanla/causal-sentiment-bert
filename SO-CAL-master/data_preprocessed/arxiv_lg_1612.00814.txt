Understanding/VBG the/DT 3D/JJ world/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ problem/NN in/IN computer/NN vision/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, learning/VBG a/DT good/JJ representation/NN of/IN 3D/JJ objects/NNS is/VBZ still/RB an/DT open/JJ problem/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT high/JJ dimensionality/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS and/CC many/JJ factors/NNS of/IN variation/NN involved/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT task/NN of/IN single/JJ -/HYPH view/NN 3D/JJ object/NN reconstruction/NN from/IN a/DT learning/NN agent/NN 's/POS perspective/NN ./.
We/PRP formulate/VBP the/DT learning/NN process/NN as/IN an/DT interaction/NN between/IN 3D/NN and/CC 2D/NN representations/NNS and/CC propose/VB an/DT encoder/NN -/HYPH decoder/NN network/NN with/IN a/DT novel/JJ projection/NN loss/NN defined/VBN by/IN the/DT perspective/NN transformation/NN ./.
