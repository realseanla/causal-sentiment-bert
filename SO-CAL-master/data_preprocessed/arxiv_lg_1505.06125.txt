In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN localizing/VBG a/DT mobile/JJ device/NN based/VBN on/IN readings/NNS from/IN its/PRP$ embedded/VBN sensors/NNS utilizing/VBG machine/NN learning/NN methodologies/NNS ./.
We/PRP consider/VBP a/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN environment/NN ,/, collect/VB a/DT large/JJ dataset/NN of/IN 3110/CD datapoints/NNS ,/, and/CC examine/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN a/DT substantial/JJ number/NN of/IN machine/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS in/IN localizing/VBG a/DT mobile/JJ device/NN ./.
We/PRP have/VBP found/VBN algorithms/NNS that/WDT give/VBP a/DT mean/JJ error/NN as/IN accurate/JJ as/IN 0.76/CD meters/NNS ,/, outperforming/VBG other/JJ indoor/JJ localization/NN systems/NNS reported/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB propose/VBP a/DT hybrid/NN instance/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN that/WDT results/VBZ in/IN a/DT speed/NN increase/NN by/IN a/DT factor/NN of/IN ten/CD with/IN no/DT loss/NN of/IN accuracy/NN in/IN a/DT live/JJ deployment/NN over/IN standard/JJ instance/NN -/HYPH based/VBN methods/NNS ,/, allowing/VBG for/IN fast/JJ and/CC accurate/JJ localization/NN ./.
Further/RB ,/, we/PRP determine/VBP how/WRB smaller/JJR datasets/NNS collected/VBN with/IN less/JJR density/NN affect/VBP accuracy/NN of/IN localization/NN ,/, important/JJ for/IN use/NN in/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN environments/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN these/DT approaches/NNS are/VBP appropriate/JJ for/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN deployment/NN by/IN evaluating/VBG their/PRP$ performance/NN in/IN an/DT online/JJ ,/, in/IN -/HYPH motion/NN experiment/NN ./.
