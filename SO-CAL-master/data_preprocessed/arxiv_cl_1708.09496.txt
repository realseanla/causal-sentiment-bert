Cognitive/JJ theories/NNS of/IN narrative/NN understanding/NN define/VBP these/DT inferences/NNS as/IN four/CD different/JJ types/NNS of/IN causality/NN ,/, that/DT include/VBP pairs/NNS of/IN events/NNS A/DT ,/, B/NN where/WRB A/DT physically/RB causes/VBZ B/NN (/-LRB- X/NN drop/NN ,/, X/NN break/NN )/-RRB- ,/, to/IN pairs/NNS of/IN events/NNS where/WRB A/DT causes/VBZ emotional/JJ state/NN B/NN (/-LRB- Y/NN saw/VBD X/NN ,/, Y/NN felt/VBD fear/NN )/-RRB- ./.
