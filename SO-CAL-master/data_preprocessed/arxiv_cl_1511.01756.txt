The/DT present/JJ study/NN is/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN the/DT automatic/JJ identification/NN and/CC description/NN of/IN frozen/JJ similes/NNS in/IN British/JJ and/CC French/JJ novels/NNS written/VBN between/IN the/DT 19/CD th/IN century/NN and/CC the/DT beginning/NN of/IN the/DT 20/CD th/IN century/NN ./.
Two/CD main/JJ patterns/NNS of/IN frozen/JJ similes/NNS were/VBD considered/VBN :/: adjectival/JJ ground/NN simile/NN marker/NN nominal/JJ vehicle/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW happy/JJ as/IN a/DT lark/NN )/-RRB- and/CC eventuality/NN simile/NN marker/NN nominal/JJ vehicle/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW sleep/NN like/IN a/DT top/NN )/-RRB- ./.
All/DT potential/JJ similes/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ components/NNS were/VBD first/JJ extracted/VBN using/VBG a/DT rule/NN -/HYPH based/VBN algorithm/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, frozen/VBN similes/NNS were/VBD identified/VBN based/VBN on/IN reference/NN lists/NNS of/IN existing/VBG similes/NNS and/CC semantic/JJ distance/NN between/IN the/DT tenor/NN and/CC the/DT vehicle/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS obtained/VBN tend/VBP to/TO confirm/VB the/DT fact/NN that/IN frozen/JJ similes/NNS are/VBP not/RB used/VBN haphazardly/RB in/IN literary/JJ texts/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, contrary/NN to/IN how/WRB they/PRP are/VBP often/RB presented/VBN ,/, frozen/VBN similes/NNS often/RB go/VBP beyond/IN the/DT ground/NN or/CC the/DT eventuality/NN and/CC the/DT vehicle/NN to/TO also/RB include/VB the/DT tenor/NN ./.
