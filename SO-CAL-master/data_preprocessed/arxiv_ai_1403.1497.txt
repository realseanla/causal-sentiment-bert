In/IN this/DT survey/NN we/PRP present/VBP different/JJ approaches/NNS that/WDT allow/VBP an/DT intelligent/JJ agent/NN to/TO explore/VB autonomous/JJ its/PRP$ environment/NN to/TO gather/VB information/NN and/CC learn/VB multiple/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
Different/JJ communities/NNS proposed/VBN different/JJ solutions/NNS ,/, that/WDT are/VBP in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, similar/JJ and/CC //HYPH or/CC complementary/JJ ./.
