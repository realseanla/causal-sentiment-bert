In/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN ,/, our/PRP$ DNA/NN is/VBZ unique/JJ but/CC many/JJ people/NNS share/VBP same/JJ names/NNS ./.
This/DT phenomenon/NN often/RB causes/VBZ erroneous/JJ aggregation/NN of/IN documents/NNS of/IN multiple/JJ persons/NNS who/WP are/VBP namesake/NN of/IN one/CD another/DT ./.
Such/JJ mistakes/NNS deteriorate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN document/NN retrieval/NN ,/, web/NN search/NN ,/, and/CC more/RBR seriously/RB ,/, cause/VB improper/JJ attribution/NN of/IN credit/NN or/CC blame/NN in/IN digital/JJ forensic/JJ ./.
To/TO resolve/VB this/DT issue/NN ,/, the/DT name/NN entity/NN disambiguation/NN task/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN which/WDT aims/VBZ to/TO partition/VB the/DT documents/NNS associated/VBN with/IN a/DT name/NN reference/NN such/JJ that/IN each/DT partition/NN contains/VBZ documents/NNS pertaining/VBG to/IN a/DT unique/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH life/NN person/NN ./.
Existing/VBG solutions/NNS to/IN this/DT task/NN substantially/RB rely/VBP on/IN feature/NN engineering/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN biographical/JJ feature/NN extraction/NN ,/, or/CC construction/NN of/IN auxiliary/JJ features/NNS from/IN Wikipedia/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, for/IN many/JJ scenarios/NNS ,/, such/JJ features/NNS may/MD be/VB costly/JJ to/TO obtain/VB or/CC unavailable/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT risk/NN of/IN privacy/NN violation/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ name/NN disambiguation/NN method/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ non-intrusive/JJ of/IN privacy/NN because/IN instead/RB of/IN using/VBG attributes/NNS pertaining/VBG to/IN a/DT real/JJ -/HYPH life/NN person/NN ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN leverages/VBZ only/RB relational/JJ data/NNS in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN anonymized/VBN graphs/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT aspect/NN of/IN methodological/JJ novelty/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN uses/VBZ a/DT representation/NN learning/NN strategy/NN to/TO embed/VB each/DT document/NN in/IN a/DT low/JJ dimensional/JJ vector/NN space/NN where/WRB name/NN disambiguation/NN can/MD be/VB solved/VBN by/IN a/DT hierarchical/JJ agglomerative/JJ clustering/NN algorithm/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ results/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ significantly/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT existing/VBG name/NN entity/NN disambiguation/NN methods/NNS working/VBG in/IN a/DT similar/JJ setting/NN ./.
