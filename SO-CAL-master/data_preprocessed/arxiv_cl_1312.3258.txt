So/RB far/RB and/CC trying/VBG to/TO reach/VB human/JJ capabilities/NNS ,/, research/NN in/IN automatic/JJ summarization/NN has/VBZ been/VBN based/VBN on/IN hypothesis/NN that/WDT are/VBP both/DT enabling/VBG and/CC limiting/VBG ./.
Some/DT of/IN these/DT limitations/NNS are/VBP :/: how/WRB to/TO take/VB into/IN account/NN and/CC reflect/VB (/-LRB- in/IN the/DT generated/VBN summary/NN )/-RRB- the/DT implicit/JJ information/NN conveyed/VBD in/IN the/DT text/NN ,/, the/DT author/NN intention/NN ,/, the/DT reader/NN intention/NN ,/, the/DT context/NN influence/NN ,/, the/DT general/JJ world/NN knowledge/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, if/IN we/PRP want/VBP machines/NNS to/TO mimic/VB human/JJ abilities/NNS ,/, then/RB they/PRP will/MD need/VB access/NN to/IN this/DT same/JJ large/JJ variety/NN of/IN knowledge/NN ./.
The/DT implicit/JJ is/VBZ affecting/VBG the/DT orientation/NN and/CC the/DT argumentation/NN of/IN the/DT text/NN and/CC consequently/RB its/PRP$ summary/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN Text/VB Summarizers/NNP (/-LRB- TS/NNP )/-RRB- are/VBP processing/VBG as/IN compressing/VBG the/DT initial/JJ data/NNS and/CC they/PRP necessarily/RB suffer/VB from/IN information/NN loss/NN ./.
TS/NNS are/VBP focusing/VBG on/IN features/NNS of/IN the/DT text/NN only/RB ,/, not/RB on/IN what/WP the/DT author/NN intended/VBN or/CC why/WRB the/DT reader/NN is/VBZ reading/VBG the/DT text/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP this/DT problem/NN and/CC we/PRP present/VBP a/DT system/NN focusing/VBG on/IN acquiring/VBG knowledge/NN that/WDT is/VBZ implicit/JJ ./.
We/PRP principally/RB spotlight/VBP the/DT implicit/JJ information/NN conveyed/VBN by/IN the/DT argumentative/JJ connectives/NNS such/JJ as/IN :/: but/CC ,/, even/RB ,/, yet/RB and/CC their/PRP$ effect/NN on/IN the/DT summary/NN ./.
