We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ framework/NN for/IN single/JJ -/HYPH channel/NN source/NN separation/NN that/WDT lies/VBZ between/IN the/DT fully/RB supervised/JJ and/CC unsupervised/JJ setting/NN ./.
Instead/RB of/IN supervision/NN ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP input/NN features/NNS for/IN each/DT source/NN signal/NN and/CC use/NN convex/NN methods/NNS to/TO estimate/VB the/DT correlations/NNS between/IN these/DT features/NNS and/CC the/DT unobserved/JJ signal/NN decomposition/NN ./.
We/PRP analyze/VBP the/DT case/NN of/IN $/$ \/CD ell_2/CD $/$ loss/NN theoretically/RB and/CC show/VB that/IN recovery/NN of/IN the/DT signal/NN components/NNS depends/VBZ only/RB on/IN cross-correlation/NN between/IN features/NNS for/IN different/JJ signals/NNS ,/, not/RB on/IN correlations/NNS between/IN features/NNS for/IN the/DT same/JJ signal/NN ./.
Contextually/RB supervised/JJ source/NN separation/NN is/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ fit/NN for/IN domains/NNS with/IN large/JJ amounts/NNS of/IN data/NNS but/CC no/DT explicit/JJ supervision/NN ;/: our/PRP$ motivating/VBG application/NN is/VBZ energy/NN disaggregation/NN of/IN hourly/JJ smart/JJ meter/NN data/NNS (/-LRB- the/DT separation/NN of/IN whole/JJ -/HYPH home/NN power/NN signals/NNS into/IN different/JJ energy/NN uses/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
Here/RB we/PRP apply/VBP contextual/JJ supervision/NN to/IN disaggregate/VB the/DT energy/NN usage/NN of/IN thousands/NNS homes/NNS over/IN four/CD years/NNS ,/, a/DT significantly/RB larger/JJR scale/NN than/IN previously/RB published/VBN efforts/NNS ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP on/IN synthetic/JJ data/NNS that/WDT our/PRP$ method/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT unsupervised/JJ approach/NN ./.
