Stochastic/JJ property/NN of/IN speech/NN signal/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ research/NN topic/NN in/IN speech/NN analysis/NN and/CC processing/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, multiple/JJ levels/NNS of/IN randomness/NN in/IN speech/NN signal/NN are/VBP discussed/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT stochastic/JJ properties/NNS of/IN unvoiced/JJ pronunciation/NN are/VBP studied/VBN in/IN detail/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB received/VBN sufficient/JJ research/NN attention/NN before/IN ./.
The/DT study/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT signals/NNS of/IN sustained/JJ unvoiced/JJ pronunciation/NN captured/VBN in/IN the/DT experiments/NNS ,/, for/IN which/WDT the/DT amplitude/NN and/CC phase/NN values/NNS in/IN the/DT short/JJ -/HYPH time/NN spectrum/NN are/VBP studied/VBN as/IN random/JJ variables/NNS ./.
The/DT statistics/NNS of/IN amplitude/NN for/IN each/DT frequency/NN component/NN is/VBZ studied/VBN individually/RB ,/, based/VBN on/IN which/WDT a/DT new/JJ property/NN of/IN "/`` consistent/JJ standard/JJ deviation/NN coefficient/NN "/'' is/VBZ revealed/VBN for/IN the/DT amplitude/NN spectrum/NN of/IN unvoiced/JJ pronunciation/NN ./.
The/DT relationship/NN between/IN the/DT amplitude/NN probability/NN distributions/NNS of/IN different/JJ frequency/NN components/NNS is/VBZ further/RB studied/VBN ,/, which/WDT indicates/VBZ that/IN all/PDT the/DT frequency/NN components/NNS have/VBP a/DT common/JJ prototype/NN of/IN amplitude/NN probability/NN distribution/NN ./.
As/IN an/DT adaptive/JJ and/CC flexible/JJ probability/NN distribution/NN ,/, the/DT Weibull/NNP distribution/NN is/VBZ adopted/VBN to/TO fit/VB the/DT expectation/NN -/HYPH normalized/VBN amplitude/NN spectrum/NN data/NNS ./.
The/DT phase/NN distribution/NN for/IN the/DT short/JJ -/HYPH time/NN spectrum/NN is/VBZ also/RB studied/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT results/NNS show/VBP a/DT uniform/JJ distribution/NN ./.
A/DT synthesis/NN method/NN for/IN unvoiced/JJ pronunciation/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT Weibull/NNP distribution/NN of/IN amplitude/NN and/CC uniform/JJ distribution/NN of/IN phase/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ implemented/VBN by/IN STFT/NN with/IN artificially/RB generated/VBN short/JJ -/HYPH time/NN spectrum/NN with/IN random/JJ amplitude/NN and/CC phase/NN ./.
The/DT synthesis/NN results/NNS have/VBP identical/JJ quality/NN of/IN auditory/JJ perception/NN as/IN the/DT original/JJ pronunciation/NN ,/, and/CC have/VBP similar/JJ autocorrelation/NN as/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT original/JJ signal/NN ,/, which/WDT proves/VBZ the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN stochastic/JJ model/NN of/IN short/JJ -/HYPH time/NN spectrum/NN for/IN unvoiced/JJ pronunciation/NN ./.
