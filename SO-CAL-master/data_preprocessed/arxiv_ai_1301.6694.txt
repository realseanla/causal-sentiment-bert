This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ a/DT purely/RB qualitative/JJ version/NN of/IN Savage/NNP 's/POS theory/NN for/IN decision/NN making/VBG under/IN uncertainty/NN ./.
Until/IN now/RB ,/, most/JJS representation/NN theorems/NNS for/IN preference/NN over/IN acts/NNS rely/VBP on/IN a/DT numerical/JJ representation/NN of/IN utility/NN and/CC uncertainty/NN where/WRB utility/NN and/CC uncertainty/NN are/VBP commensurate/JJ ./.
Disrupting/VBG the/DT tradition/NN ,/, we/PRP relax/VBP this/DT assumption/NN and/CC introduce/VB a/DT purely/RB ordinal/JJ axiom/NN requiring/VBG that/IN the/DT Decision/NN Maker/NN (/-LRB- DM/NN )/-RRB- preference/NN between/IN two/CD acts/NNS only/RB depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT relative/JJ position/NN of/IN their/PRP$ consequences/NNS for/IN each/DT state/NN ./.
Within/IN this/DT qualitative/JJ framework/NN ,/, we/PRP determine/VBP the/DT only/JJ possible/JJ form/NN of/IN the/DT decision/NN rule/NN and/CC investigate/VB some/DT instances/NNS compatible/JJ with/IN the/DT transitivity/NN of/IN the/DT strict/JJ preference/NN ./.
Finally/RB we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT mild/JJ relaxation/NN of/IN our/PRP$ ordinality/NN axiom/NN ,/, leaving/VBG room/NN for/IN a/DT new/JJ family/NN of/IN qualitative/JJ decision/NN rules/NNS compatible/JJ with/IN transitivity/NN ./.
