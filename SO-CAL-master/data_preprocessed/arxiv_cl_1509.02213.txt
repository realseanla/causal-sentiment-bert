This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ approach/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ Spoken/NNP Term/NN Detection/NN with/IN spoken/VBN queries/NNS using/VBG multiple/JJ sets/NNS of/IN acoustic/JJ patterns/NNS automatically/RB discovered/VBN from/IN the/DT target/NN corpus/NN ./.
The/DT different/JJ pattern/NN HMM/NN configurations/NNS (/-LRB- number/NN of/IN states/NNS per/IN model/NN ,/, number/NN of/IN distinct/JJ models/NNS ,/, number/NN of/IN Gaussians/NNPS per/IN state/NN )/-RRB- form/VBP a/DT three/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ model/NN granularity/NN space/NN ./.
Different/JJ sets/NNS of/IN acoustic/JJ patterns/NNS automatically/RB discovered/VBN on/IN different/JJ points/NNS properly/RB distributed/VBN over/IN this/DT three/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ space/NN are/VBP complementary/JJ to/IN one/CD another/DT ,/, thus/RB can/MD jointly/RB capture/VB the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN the/DT spoken/VBN terms/NNS ./.
By/IN representing/VBG the/DT spoken/VBN content/NN and/CC spoken/VBN query/NN as/IN sequences/NNS of/IN acoustic/JJ patterns/NNS ,/, a/DT series/NN of/IN approaches/NNS for/IN matching/VBG the/DT pattern/NN index/NN sequences/NNS while/IN considering/VBG the/DT signal/NN variations/NNS are/VBP developed/VBN ./.
