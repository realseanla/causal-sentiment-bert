Humans/NNS make/VBP complex/JJ inferences/NNS on/IN faces/NNS ,/, ranging/VBG from/IN objective/JJ properties/NNS (/-LRB- gender/NN ,/, ethnicity/NN ,/, expression/NN ,/, age/NN ,/, identity/NN ,/, etc/FW )/-RRB- to/IN subjective/JJ judgments/NNS (/-LRB- facial/JJ attractiveness/NN ,/, trustworthiness/NN ,/, sociability/NN ,/, friendliness/NN ,/, etc/FW )/-RRB- ./.
