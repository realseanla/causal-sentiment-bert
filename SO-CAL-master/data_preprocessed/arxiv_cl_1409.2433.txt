We/PRP study/VBP the/DT complexity/NN of/IN approximating/VBG solution/NN structure/NN of/IN the/DT bijective/JJ weighted/JJ sentence/NN alignment/NN problem/NN of/IN DeNero/NNP and/CC Klein/NNP (/-LRB- 2008/CD )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP the/DT complexity/NN of/IN finding/VBG an/DT alignment/NN that/WDT has/VBZ a/DT significant/JJ overlap/NN with/IN an/DT optimal/JJ alignment/NN ./.
We/PRP discuss/VBP ways/NNS of/IN representing/VBG the/DT solution/NN for/IN the/DT general/JJ weighted/JJ sentence/NN alignment/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN phrases/NNS -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH words/NNS alignment/NN problem/NN ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN computing/VBG a/DT string/NN which/WDT agrees/VBZ with/IN the/DT optimal/JJ sentence/NN partition/NN on/IN more/JJR than/IN half/NN (/-LRB- plus/CC an/DT arbitrarily/RB small/JJ polynomial/JJ fraction/NN )/-RRB- positions/NNS for/IN the/DT phrases/NNS -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH words/NNS alignment/NN is/VBZ NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ ./.
For/IN the/DT general/JJ weighted/JJ sentence/NN alignment/NN we/PRP obtain/VBP such/JJ bound/VBN from/IN the/DT agreement/NN on/IN a/DT little/JJ over/IN 2/3/CD of/IN the/DT bits/NNS ./.
