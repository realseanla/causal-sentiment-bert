Can/MD we/PRP develop/VB a/DT computer/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT assesses/VBZ the/DT creativity/NN of/IN a/DT painting/NN given/VBN its/PRP$ context/NN within/IN art/NN history/NN ?/.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ computational/JJ framework/NN for/IN assessing/VBG the/DT creativity/NN of/IN creative/JJ products/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN paintings/NNS ,/, sculptures/NNS ,/, poetry/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.
We/PRP use/VBP the/DT most/RBS common/JJ definition/NN of/IN creativity/NN ,/, which/WDT emphasizes/VBZ the/DT originality/NN of/IN the/DT product/NN and/CC its/PRP$ influential/JJ value/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN computational/JJ framework/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN constructing/VBG a/DT network/NN between/IN creative/JJ products/NNS and/CC using/VBG this/DT network/NN to/TO infer/VB about/IN the/DT originality/NN and/CC influence/NN of/IN its/PRP$ nodes/NNS ./.
