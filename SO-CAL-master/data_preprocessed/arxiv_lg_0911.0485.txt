This/DT article/NN applies/VBZ Machine/NN Learning/VBG techniques/NNS to/TO solve/VB Intrusion/NN Detection/NN problems/NNS within/IN computer/NN networks/NNS ./.
Due/IN to/IN complex/JJ and/CC dynamic/JJ nature/NN of/IN computer/NN networks/NNS and/CC hacking/VBG techniques/NNS ,/, detecting/VBG malicious/JJ activities/NNS remains/VBZ a/DT challenging/JJ task/NN for/IN security/NN experts/NNS ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, currently/RB available/JJ defense/NN systems/NNS suffer/VBP from/IN low/JJ detection/NN capability/NN and/CC high/JJ number/NN of/IN false/JJ alarms/NNS ./.
To/TO overcome/VB such/JJ performance/NN limitations/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ Machine/NN Learning/VBG algorithm/NN ,/, namely/RB Boosted/VBN Subspace/NN Probabilistic/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- BSPNN/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT integrates/VBZ an/DT adaptive/JJ boosting/VBG technique/NN and/CC a/DT semi/NN parametric/JJ neural/JJ network/NN to/TO obtain/VB good/JJ tradeoff/NN between/IN accuracy/NN and/CC generality/NN ./.
As/IN the/DT result/NN ,/, learning/VBG bias/NN and/CC generalization/NN variance/NN can/MD be/VB significantly/RB minimized/VBN ./.
Substantial/JJ experiments/NNS on/IN KDD/NNP 99/CD intrusion/NN benchmark/NN indicate/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ model/NN outperforms/VBZ other/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, with/IN significantly/RB improved/VBN detection/NN accuracy/NN ,/, minimal/JJ false/JJ alarms/NNS and/CC relatively/RB small/JJ computational/JJ complexity/NN ./.
