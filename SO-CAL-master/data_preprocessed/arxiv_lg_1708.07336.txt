Bipartite/JJ ranking/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ ranking/NN problem/NN that/WDT learns/VBZ to/TO order/VB relevant/JJ instances/NNS ahead/RB of/IN irrelevant/JJ ones/NNS ./.
The/DT pair-wise/JJ approach/NN for/IN bi-partite/JJ ranking/NN construct/VB a/DT quadratic/JJ number/NN of/IN pairs/NNS to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ infeasible/JJ for/IN large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN data/NN sets/NNS ./.
The/DT point-wise/JJ approach/NN ,/, albeit/IN more/RBR efficient/JJ ,/, often/RB results/VBZ in/IN inferior/JJ performance/NN ./.
That/DT is/VBZ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO conduct/VB bipartite/JJ ranking/VBG accurately/RB and/CC efficiently/RB at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN ./.
