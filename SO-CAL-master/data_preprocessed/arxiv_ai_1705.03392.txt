We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT logic/NN of/IN asynchronous/JJ announcements/NNS ,/, where/WRB truthful/JJ announcements/NNS are/VBP publicly/RB sent/VBN but/CC individually/RB received/VBN by/IN agents/NNS ./.
Additional/JJ to/IN epistemic/JJ modalities/NNS ,/, the/DT logic/NN therefore/RB contains/VBZ two/CD types/NNS of/IN dynamic/JJ modalities/NNS ,/, for/IN sending/VBG messages/NNS and/CC for/IN receiving/VBG messages/NNS ./.
The/DT semantics/NNS defines/VBZ truth/NN relative/JJ to/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN reception/NN of/IN messages/NNS for/IN all/DT agents/NNS ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN knowledge/NN need/VBP not/RB be/VB truthful/JJ ,/, because/IN some/DT messages/NNS may/MD not/RB have/VB been/VBN received/VBN by/IN the/DT knowing/VBG agent/NN ./.
Messages/NNS that/WDT are/VBP announcements/NNS may/MD also/RB result/VB in/IN partial/JJ synchronization/NN ,/, namely/RB when/WRB an/DT agent/NN learns/VBZ from/IN receiving/VBG an/DT announcement/NN that/IN other/JJ announcements/NNS must/MD already/RB have/VB been/VBN received/VBN by/IN other/JJ agents/NNS ./.
We/PRP give/VBP detailed/JJ examples/NNS of/IN the/DT semantics/NNS ,/, and/CC prove/VB several/JJ semantic/JJ results/NNS ,/, including/VBG that/DT :/: after/IN an/DT announcement/NN an/DT agent/NN knows/VBZ that/IN a/DT proposition/NN is/VBZ true/JJ ,/, if/IN and/CC only/RB if/IN on/IN condition/NN of/IN the/DT truth/NN of/IN that/DT announcement/NN ,/, the/DT agent/NN knows/VBZ that/IN after/IN that/DT announcement/NN and/CC after/IN any/DT number/NN of/IN other/JJ agents/NNS also/RB receiving/VBG it/PRP ,/, the/DT proposition/NN is/VBZ true/JJ ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN on/IN multi-agent/JJ epistemic/JJ models/NNS ,/, each/DT formula/NN in/IN asynchronous/JJ announcement/NN logic/NN is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/IN a/DT formula/NN in/IN epistemic/JJ logic/NN ./.
