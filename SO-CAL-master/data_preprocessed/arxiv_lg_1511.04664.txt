Despite/IN the/DT widespread/JJ installation/NN of/IN accelerometers/NNS in/IN almost/RB all/DT mobile/JJ phones/NNS and/CC wearable/JJ devices/NNS ,/, activity/NN recognition/NN using/VBG accelerometers/NNS is/VBZ still/RB immature/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT poor/JJ recognition/NN accuracy/NN of/IN existing/VBG recognition/NN methods/NNS and/CC the/DT scarcity/NN of/IN labeled/VBN training/NN data/NNS ./.
