We/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN finding/VBG the/DT shortest/JJS path/NN between/IN two/CD points/NNS in/IN an/DT unknown/JJ real/JJ physical/JJ environment/NN ,/, where/WRB a/DT traveling/VBG agent/NN must/MD move/VB around/RB in/IN the/DT environment/NN to/TO explore/VB unknown/JJ territory/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT Physical/JJ -/HYPH A/NN */NFP algorithm/NN (/-LRB- PHA/NN */SYM )/-RRB- for/IN solving/VBG this/DT problem/NN ./.
PHA/NN */NFP expands/VBZ all/PDT the/DT mandatory/JJ nodes/NNS that/WDT A/DT */SYM would/MD expand/VB and/CC returns/VBZ the/DT shortest/JJS path/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD points/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, due/IN to/IN the/DT physical/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ,/, the/DT complexity/NN of/IN the/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ measured/VBN by/IN the/DT traveling/VBG effort/NN of/IN the/DT moving/VBG agent/NN and/CC not/RB by/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN generated/VBN nodes/NNS ,/, as/IN in/IN standard/JJ A/NN */NFP ./.
PHA/NN */NFP is/VBZ presented/VBN as/IN a/DT two/CD -/HYPH level/NN algorithm/NN ,/, such/JJ that/IN its/PRP$ high/JJ level/NN ,/, A/DT */SYM ,/, chooses/VBZ the/DT next/JJ node/NN to/TO be/VB expanded/VBN and/CC its/PRP$ low/JJ level/NN directs/VBZ the/DT agent/NN to/IN that/DT node/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO explore/VB it/PRP ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN variations/NNS for/IN both/CC the/DT high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN and/CC low/JJ -/HYPH level/NN procedures/NNS and/CC evaluate/VB their/PRP$ performance/NN theoretically/RB and/CC experimentally/RB ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT travel/NN cost/NN of/IN our/PRP$ best/JJS variation/NN is/VBZ fairly/RB close/JJ to/IN the/DT optimal/JJ travel/NN cost/NN ,/, assuming/VBG that/IN the/DT mandatory/JJ nodes/NNS of/IN A/DT */NFP are/VBP known/VBN in/IN advance/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB generalize/VB our/PRP$ algorithm/NN to/IN the/DT multi-agent/JJ case/NN ,/, where/WRB a/DT number/NN of/IN cooperative/JJ agents/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP an/DT experimental/JJ implementation/NN for/IN such/PDT a/DT system/NN ./.
It/PRP should/MD be/VB noted/VBN that/IN the/DT problem/NN addressed/VBN here/RB is/VBZ not/RB a/DT navigation/NN problem/NN ,/, but/CC rather/RB a/DT problem/NN of/IN finding/VBG the/DT shortest/JJS path/NN between/IN two/CD points/NNS for/IN future/JJ usage/NN ./.
