In/IN this/DT book/NN authors/NNS for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN introduce/VB the/DT notion/NN of/IN strong/JJ neutrosophic/JJ graphs/NNS ./.
They/PRP are/VBP very/RB different/JJ from/IN the/DT usual/JJ graphs/NNS and/CC neutrosophic/JJ graphs/NNS ./.
Using/VBG these/DT new/JJ structures/NNS special/JJ subgraph/NN topological/JJ spaces/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN ./.
Further/JJ special/JJ lattice/NN graph/NN of/IN subgraphs/NNS of/IN these/DT graphs/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN and/CC described/VBN ./.
Several/JJ interesting/JJ properties/NNS using/VBG subgraphs/NNS of/IN a/DT strong/JJ neutrosophic/JJ graph/NN are/VBP obtained/VBN ./.
Several/JJ open/RB conjectures/VBZ are/VBP proposed/VBN ./.
These/DT new/JJ class/NN of/IN strong/JJ neutrosophic/JJ graphs/NNS will/MD certainly/RB find/VB applications/NNS in/IN Neutrosophic/NNP Cognitive/NNP Maps/NNPS (/-LRB- NCM/NN )/-RRB- ,/, Neutrosophic/NNP Relational/NNP Maps/NNPS (/-LRB- NRM/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Neutrosophic/JJ Relational/JJ Equations/NNS (/-LRB- NRE/NN )/-RRB- with/IN appropriate/JJ modifications/NNS ./.
