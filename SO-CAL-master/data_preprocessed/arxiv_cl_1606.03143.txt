In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP explore/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN document/NN summarization/NN in/IN Persian/JJ language/NN from/IN two/CD distinct/JJ angles/NNS ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ approach/NN ,/, we/PRP modify/VBP a/DT popular/JJ and/CC widely/RB cited/VBD Persian/JJ document/NN summarization/NN framework/NN to/TO see/VB how/WRB it/PRP works/VBZ on/IN a/DT realistic/JJ corpus/NN of/IN news/NN articles/NNS ./.
