The/DT aim/NN in/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO allocate/VB the/DT `/`` sleep/NN time/NN '/'' of/IN the/DT individual/JJ sensors/NNS in/IN an/DT intrusion/NN detection/NN application/NN so/IN that/IN the/DT energy/NN consumption/NN from/IN the/DT sensors/NNS is/VBZ reduced/VBN ,/, while/IN keeping/VBG the/DT tracking/NN error/NN to/IN a/DT minimum/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP two/CD novel/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/NN (/-LRB- RL/NN )/-RRB- based/VBN algorithms/NNS -/, with/IN both/DT infinite/JJ horizon/NN discounted/VBN and/CC long/RB -/HYPH run/VBN average/JJ cost/NN objectives/NNS -/, for/IN solving/VBG this/DT problem/NN ./.
All/PDT our/PRP$ algorithms/NNS incorporate/VB feature/NN -/HYPH based/VBN representations/NNS to/TO handle/VB the/DT curse/NN of/IN dimensionality/NN associated/VBN with/IN the/DT underlying/VBG partially/RB -/HYPH observable/JJ Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN (/-LRB- POMDP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Further/RB ,/, the/DT feature/NN selection/NN scheme/NN used/VBN in/IN our/PRP$ algorithms/NNS intelligently/RB manages/VBZ the/DT energy/NN cost/NN and/CC tracking/VBG cost/NN factors/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN turn/NN assists/VBZ the/DT search/NN for/IN the/DT optimal/JJ sleeping/NN policy/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ algorithm/NN in/IN either/CC (/-LRB- discounted/VBN or/CC average/JJ )/-RRB- setting/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN Q/NN -/HYPH learning/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT second/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ two/CD -/HYPH timescale/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT performs/VBZ on/IN -/HYPH policy/NN Q/NN -/HYPH learning/NN ./.
The/DT latter/JJ possesses/VBZ theoretical/JJ convergence/NN guarantees/NNS ,/, unlike/IN the/DT former/JJ Q/NN -/HYPH learning/NN based/VBN algorithm/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB extend/VBP these/DT algorithms/NNS to/IN a/DT setting/NN where/WRB the/DT intruder/NN 's/POS mobility/NN model/NN is/VBZ not/RB known/VBN by/IN incorporating/VBG a/DT stochastic/JJ iterative/JJ scheme/NN for/IN estimating/VBG the/DT mobility/NN model/NN ./.
The/DT simulation/NN results/VBZ on/IN a/DT synthetic/JJ 2/CD -/HYPH d/NN network/NN setting/VBG suggest/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN algorithms/NNS result/VBP in/IN better/JJR tracking/NN accuracy/NN at/IN the/DT cost/NN of/IN a/DT few/JJ additional/JJ sensors/NNS ,/, in/IN comparison/NN to/IN a/DT recent/JJ prior/JJ work/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB observe/VBP empirically/RB that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN model/NN estimation/NN scheme/NN converges/VBZ to/IN the/DT true/JJ model/NN ./.
