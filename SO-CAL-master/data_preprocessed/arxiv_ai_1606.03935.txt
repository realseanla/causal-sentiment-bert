Redescription/NN mining/NN is/VBZ a/DT field/NN of/IN knowledge/NN discovery/NN that/WDT aims/VBZ at/IN finding/VBG different/JJ descriptions/NNS of/IN similar/JJ subsets/NNS of/IN instances/NNS in/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
These/DT instances/NNS are/VBP characterized/VBN with/IN descriptive/JJ attributes/NNS from/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR disjoint/NN sets/NNS of/IN attributes/NNS called/VBN views/NNS ./.
By/IN exploring/VBG different/JJ characterizations/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO find/VB non/FW trivial/JJ and/CC interesting/JJ connections/NNS between/IN different/JJ subsets/NNS of/IN attributes/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP explore/VBP the/DT process/NN of/IN creating/VBG possibly/RB large/JJ and/CC heterogeneous/JJ redescription/NN set/VBN in/IN which/WDT redescriptions/NNS are/VBP iteratively/RB improved/VBN by/IN a/DT conjunctive/JJ refinement/NN procedure/NN aimed/VBN at/IN increasing/VBG redescription/NN accuracy/NN ./.
This/DT set/NN is/VBZ used/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ redescription/NN set/VBN construction/NN procedure/NN to/TO create/VB multiple/JJ redescription/NN sets/NNS of/IN user/NN defined/VBN size/NN ./.
Set/VBN construction/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN redescription/NN selection/NN by/IN using/VBG multi-objective/JJ optimization/NN incorporating/VBG user/NN defined/VBN importance/NN levels/NNS towards/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR redescription/NN quality/NN criteria/NNS ./.
These/DT properties/NNS distinguish/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN from/IN current/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN approaches/NNS that/WDT create/VBP one/CD ,/, mostly/RB smaller/JJR set/NN that/WDT contains/VBZ redescriptions/NNS satisfying/VBG a/DT pre-defined/JJ set/NN of/IN constraints/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ redescription/NN quality/NN criterion/NN that/WDT assesses/VBZ the/DT variability/NN of/IN redescription/NN accuracy/NN when/WRB missing/VBG values/NNS are/VBP present/JJ in/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
