The/DT notion/NN of/IN approachability/NN in/IN repeated/VBN games/NNS with/IN vector/NN payoffs/NNS was/VBD introduced/VBN by/IN Blackwell/JJ in/IN the/DT 1950s/NNS ,/, along/IN with/IN geometric/JJ conditions/NNS for/IN approachability/NN and/CC corresponding/VBG strategies/NNS that/WDT rely/VBP on/IN computing/VBG {/-LRB- \/SYM em/PRP steering/NN directions/NNS }/-RRB- as/IN projections/NNS from/IN the/DT current/JJ average/JJ payoff/NN vector/NN to/IN the/DT (/-LRB- convex/NN )/-RRB- target/NN set/NN ./.
Recently/RB ,/, Abernethy/NNP ,/, Batlett/NNP and/CC Hazan/NNP (/-LRB- 2011/CD )/-RRB- proposed/VBD a/DT class/NN of/IN approachability/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT rely/VBP on/IN the/DT no/DT -/HYPH regret/NN properties/NNS of/IN Online/NNP Linear/NNP Programming/NNP for/IN computing/VBG a/DT suitable/JJ sequence/NN of/IN steering/NN directions/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ first/JJ carried/VBD out/RP for/IN target/NN sets/NNS that/WDT are/VBP convex/JJ cones/NNS ,/, and/CC then/RB generalized/VBN to/IN any/DT convex/NN set/VBN by/IN embedding/VBG it/PRP in/IN a/DT higher/JJR -/HYPH dimensional/JJ convex/JJ cone/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT more/RBR direct/JJ formulation/NN that/WDT relies/VBZ on/IN the/DT support/NN function/NN of/IN the/DT set/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN suitable/JJ Online/NN Convex/NNP Optimization/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, which/WDT leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT general/JJ class/NN of/IN approachability/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
We/PRP further/RB show/VBP that/IN Blackwell/NNP 's/POS original/JJ algorithm/NN and/CC its/PRP$ convergence/NN follow/VB as/IN a/DT special/JJ case/NN ./.
