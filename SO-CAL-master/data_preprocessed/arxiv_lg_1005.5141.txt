This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ some/DT extensions/NNS to/IN the/DT work/NN on/IN kernels/NNS dedicated/VBN to/IN string/NN alignment/NN (/-LRB- biological/JJ sequence/NN alignment/NN )/-RRB- based/VBN on/IN the/DT summing/VBG up/IN of/IN scores/NNS obtained/VBN by/IN local/JJ alignments/NNS with/IN gaps/NNS ./.
The/DT extensions/NNS we/PRP propose/VBP allow/VB to/TO construct/VB ,/, from/IN classical/JJ time/NN warp/NN distances/NNS ,/, what/WP we/PRP called/VBD summative/JJ time/NN warp/NN kernels/NNS that/WDT are/VBP positive/JJ definite/JJ if/IN some/DT simple/JJ sufficient/JJ conditions/NNS are/VBP satisfied/JJ ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, from/IN the/DT same/JJ formalism/NN ,/, we/PRP derive/VBP a/DT time/NN warp/NN inner/JJ product/NN that/WDT extend/VBP the/DT usual/JJ euclidean/JJ inner/JJ product/NN ,/, providing/VBG the/DT capability/NN to/TO handle/VB discrete/JJ sequences/NNS or/CC time/NN series/NN of/IN variable/JJ lengths/NNS in/IN an/DT Hilbert/NNP space/NN ./.
The/DT classification/NN experiment/NN we/PRP conducted/VBD ,/, using/VBG either/CC first/RB near/IN neighbor/NN classifier/NN or/CC Support/NN Vector/NNP Machine/NNP classifier/NN leads/VBZ to/IN conclude/VB that/IN the/DT positive/JJ definite/JJ elastic/JJ kernels/NNS we/PRP propose/VBP outperform/VB the/DT distance/NN substituting/VBG kernels/NNS for/IN the/DT classical/JJ elastic/JJ distances/NNS we/PRP tested/VBD ./.
In/IN a/DT similar/JJ way/NN ,/, the/DT kernel/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT distance/NN induced/VBN by/IN the/DT time/NN warp/NN inner/JJ product/NN outperforms/VBZ significantly/RB on/IN the/DT considered/VBN task/NN the/DT kernel/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT euclidean/JJ distance/NN ./.
