We/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT potential/NN of/IN attention/NN -/HYPH based/VBN neural/JJ machine/NN translation/NN in/IN simultaneous/JJ translation/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT novel/JJ decoding/NN algorithm/NN ,/, called/VBN simultaneous/JJ greedy/JJ decoding/NN ,/, that/WDT allows/VBZ an/DT existing/VBG neural/JJ machine/NN translation/NN model/NN to/TO begin/VB translating/VBG before/IN a/DT full/JJ source/NN sentence/NN is/VBZ received/VBN ./.
This/DT approach/NN is/VBZ unique/JJ from/IN previous/JJ works/NNS on/IN simultaneous/JJ translation/NN in/IN that/DT segmentation/NN and/CC translation/NN are/VBP done/VBN jointly/RB to/TO maximize/VB the/DT translation/NN quality/NN and/CC that/IN translating/VBG each/DT segment/NN is/VBZ strongly/RB conditioned/VBN on/IN all/PDT the/DT previous/JJ segments/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT first/JJ step/NN toward/IN building/VBG a/DT full/JJ simultaneous/JJ translation/NN system/NN based/VBN on/IN neural/JJ machine/NN translation/NN ./.
