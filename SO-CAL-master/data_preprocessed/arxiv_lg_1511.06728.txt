We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN hand/NN pose/NN estimation/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT deep/JJ regressor/NN trained/VBN on/IN two/CD different/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN input/NN ./.
Raw/JJ depth/NN data/NNS is/VBZ fused/VBN with/IN an/DT intermediate/JJ representation/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT segmentation/NN of/IN the/DT hand/NN into/IN parts/NNS ./.
This/DT intermediate/JJ representation/NN contains/VBZ important/JJ topological/JJ information/NN and/CC provides/VBZ useful/JJ cues/NNS for/IN reasoning/NN about/IN joint/NN locations/NNS ./.
The/DT mapping/NN from/IN raw/JJ depth/NN to/IN segmentation/NN maps/NNS is/VBZ learned/VBN in/IN a/DT semi/NN //, weakly/RB -/HYPH supervised/JJ way/NN from/IN two/CD different/JJ datasets/NNS :/: (/-LRB- i/LS )/-RRB- a/DT synthetic/JJ dataset/NN created/VBN through/IN a/DT rendering/NN pipeline/NN including/VBG densely/RB labeled/VBN ground/NN truth/NN (/-LRB- pixelwise/NN segmentations/NNS )/-RRB- ;/: and/CC (/-LRB- ii/LS )/-RRB- a/DT dataset/NN with/IN real/JJ images/NNS for/IN which/WDT ground/NN truth/NN joint/JJ positions/NNS are/VBP available/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB dense/JJ segmentations/NNS ./.
Loss/NN for/IN training/NN on/IN real/JJ images/NNS is/VBZ generated/VBN from/IN a/DT patch-wise/NN restoration/NN process/NN ,/, which/WDT aligns/VBZ tentative/JJ segmentation/NN maps/VBZ with/IN a/DT large/JJ dictionary/NN of/IN synthetic/JJ poses/NNS ./.
The/DT underlying/VBG premise/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT domain/NN shift/NN between/IN synthetic/JJ and/CC real/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ smaller/JJR in/IN the/DT intermediate/JJ representation/NN ,/, where/WRB labels/NNS carry/VBP geometric/JJ and/CC topological/JJ meaning/NN ,/, than/IN in/IN the/DT raw/JJ input/NN domain/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN the/DT NYU/NNP dataset/NN show/NN that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN training/NN method/NN decreases/VBZ error/NN on/IN joints/NNS over/IN direct/JJ regression/NN of/IN joints/NNS from/IN depth/NN data/NNS by/IN 15.7/CD percent/NN ./.
