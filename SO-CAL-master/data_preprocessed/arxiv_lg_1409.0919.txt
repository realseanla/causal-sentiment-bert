This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ solution/NN for/IN choosing/VBG the/DT K/NN parameter/NN in/IN the/DT k/NN -/HYPH nearest/JJS neighbor/NN (/-LRB- KNN/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN ,/, the/DT solution/NN depending/VBG on/IN the/DT idea/NN of/IN ensemble/NN learning/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT a/DT weak/JJ KNN/NNP classifier/NN is/VBZ used/VBN each/DT time/NN with/IN a/DT different/JJ K/NN ,/, starting/VBG from/IN one/CD to/IN the/DT square/JJ root/NN of/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT training/NN set/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT weak/JJ classifiers/NNS are/VBP combined/VBN using/VBG the/DT weighted/JJ sum/NN rule/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN solution/NN was/VBD tested/VBN and/CC compared/VBN to/IN other/JJ solutions/NNS using/VBG a/DT group/NN of/IN experiments/NNS in/IN real/JJ life/NN problems/NNS ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN classifier/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT traditional/JJ KNN/NN classifier/NN that/WDT uses/VBZ a/DT different/JJ number/NN of/IN neighbors/NNS ,/, is/VBZ competitive/JJ with/IN other/JJ classifiers/NNS ,/, and/CC is/VBZ a/DT promising/JJ classifier/NN with/IN strong/JJ potential/NN for/IN a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN applications/NNS ./.
