This/DT paper/NN hypothesizes/VBZ that/IN chunking/VBG plays/NNS important/JJ role/NN in/IN reducing/VBG dependency/NN distance/NN and/CC dependency/NN crossings/NNS ./.
Computer/NN simulations/NNS ,/, when/WRB compared/VBN with/IN natural/JJ languages/NNS ,/, show/VBP that/IN chunking/VBG reduces/VBZ mean/JJ dependency/NN distance/NN (/-LRB- MDD/NNP )/-RRB- of/IN a/DT linear/JJ sequence/NN of/IN nodes/NNS (/-LRB- constrained/VBN by/IN continuity/NN or/CC projectivity/NN )/-RRB- to/IN that/DT of/IN natural/JJ languages/NNS ./.
More/RBR interestingly/RB ,/, chunking/VBG alone/JJ brings/VBZ about/RB less/JJR dependency/NN crossings/NNS as/RB well/RB ,/, though/IN having/VBG failed/VBN to/TO reduce/VB them/PRP ,/, to/IN such/JJ rarity/NN as/IN found/VBN in/IN human/JJ languages/NNS ./.
These/DT results/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN chunking/NN may/MD play/VB a/DT vital/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT minimization/NN of/IN dependency/NN distance/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT somewhat/RB contributing/JJ role/NN in/IN the/DT rarity/NN of/IN dependency/NN crossing/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT results/NNS point/VBP to/IN a/DT possibility/NN that/IN the/DT rarity/NN of/IN dependency/NN crossings/NNS is/VBZ not/RB a/DT mere/JJ side/NN -/HYPH effect/NN of/IN minimization/NN of/IN dependency/NN distance/NN ,/, but/CC a/DT linguistic/JJ phenomenon/NN with/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ motivations/NNS ./.
