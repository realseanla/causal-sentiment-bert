Human/JJ activity/NN recognition/NN (/-LRB- HAR/NN )/-RRB- has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT popular/JJ topic/NN in/IN research/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ wide/JJ application/NN ./.
With/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN deep/JJ learning/NN ,/, new/JJ ideas/NNS have/VBP appeared/VBN to/TO address/VB HAR/NN problems/NNS ./.
Here/RB ,/, a/DT deep/JJ network/NN architecture/NN using/VBG residual/JJ bidirectional/JJ long/JJ short/JJ -/HYPH term/NN memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- cells/NNS is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
The/DT advantages/NNS of/IN the/DT new/JJ network/NN include/VBP that/IN a/DT bidirectional/JJ connection/NN can/MD concatenate/VB the/DT positive/JJ time/NN direction/NN (/-LRB- forward/JJ state/NN )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT negative/JJ time/NN direction/NN (/-LRB- backward/JJ state/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Second/RB ,/, residual/JJ connections/NNS between/IN stacked/VBN cells/NNS act/VBP as/IN highways/NNS for/IN gradients/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD pass/VB underlying/VBG information/NN directly/RB to/IN the/DT upper/JJ layer/NN ,/, effectively/RB avoiding/VBG the/DT gradient/NN vanishing/VBG problem/NN ./.
Generally/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN network/NN shows/VBZ improvements/NNS on/IN both/CC the/DT temporal/JJ (/-LRB- using/VBG bidirectional/JJ cells/NNS )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT spatial/JJ (/-LRB- residual/JJ connections/NNS stacked/VBN deeply/RB )/-RRB- dimensions/NNS ,/, aiming/VBG to/TO enhance/VB the/DT recognition/NN rate/NN ./.
When/WRB tested/VBN with/IN the/DT Opportunity/NN data/NNS set/VBN and/CC the/DT public/JJ domain/NN UCI/NNP data/NNS set/NN ,/, the/DT accuracy/NN was/VBD increased/VBN by/IN 4.78/CD percent/NN and/CC 3.68/CD percent/NN ,/, respectively/RB ,/, compared/VBN with/IN previously/RB reported/VBN results/NNS ./.
