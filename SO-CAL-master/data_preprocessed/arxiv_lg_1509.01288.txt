Applications/NNS that/WDT learn/VBP from/IN opinionated/JJ documents/NNS ,/, like/IN tweets/NNS or/CC product/NN reviews/NNS ,/, face/VBP two/CD challenges/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, the/DT opinionated/JJ documents/NNS constitute/VBP an/DT evolving/VBG stream/NN ,/, where/WRB both/PDT the/DT author/NN 's/POS attitude/NN and/CC the/DT vocabulary/NN itself/PRP may/MD change/VB ./.
Second/RB ,/, labels/NNS of/IN documents/NNS are/VBP scarce/JJ and/CC labels/NNS of/IN words/NNS are/VBP unreliable/JJ ,/, because/IN the/DT sentiment/NN of/IN a/DT word/NN depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT (/-LRB- unknown/JJ )/-RRB- context/NN in/IN the/DT author/NN 's/POS mind/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT research/NN on/IN mining/NN over/IN opinionated/JJ streams/NNS focuses/VBZ on/IN the/DT first/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ,/, whereas/IN for/IN the/DT second/JJ a/DT continuous/JJ supply/NN of/IN labels/NNS from/IN the/DT stream/NN is/VBZ assumed/VBN ./.
Such/PDT an/DT assumption/NN though/RB is/VBZ utopian/JJ as/IN the/DT stream/NN is/VBZ infinite/JJ and/CC the/DT labeling/NN cost/NN is/VBZ prohibitive/JJ ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT potential/NN of/IN active/JJ stream/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT ask/VBP for/IN labels/NNS on/IN demand/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/VBN ACOSTREAM/NN 1/CD approach/NN works/VBZ with/IN limited/JJ labels/NNS :/: it/PRP uses/VBZ an/DT initial/JJ seed/NN of/IN labeled/VBN documents/NNS ,/, occasionally/RB requests/NNS additional/JJ labels/NNS for/IN documents/NNS from/IN the/DT human/JJ expert/NN and/CC incrementally/RB adapts/VBZ to/IN the/DT underlying/VBG stream/NN while/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT available/JJ labeled/VBN documents/NNS ./.
In/IN its/PRP$ core/NN ,/, ACOSTREAM/NNP consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT MNB/NNP classifier/NN coupled/VBN with/IN "/`` sampling/NN "/'' strategies/NNS for/IN requesting/VBG class/NN labels/NNS for/IN new/JJ unlabeled/JJ documents/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT experiments/NNS ,/, we/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT classifier/NN performance/NN over/IN time/NN by/IN varying/VBG :/: (/-LRB- a/LS )/-RRB- the/DT class/NN distribution/NN of/IN the/DT opinionated/JJ stream/NN ,/, while/IN assuming/VBG that/IN the/DT set/NN of/IN the/DT words/NNS in/IN the/DT vocabulary/NN is/VBZ fixed/VBN but/CC their/PRP$ polarities/NNS may/MD change/VB with/IN the/DT class/NN distribution/NN ;/: and/CC (/-LRB- b/LS )/-RRB- the/DT number/NN of/IN unknown/JJ words/NNS arriving/VBG at/IN each/DT moment/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT class/NN polarity/NN may/MD also/RB change/VB ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN active/JJ learning/NN on/IN a/DT stream/NN of/IN opinionated/JJ documents/NNS ,/, delivers/VBZ good/JJ performance/NN while/IN requiring/VBG a/DT small/JJ selection/NN of/IN labels/NNS
