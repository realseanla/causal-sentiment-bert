Person/NN re-identification/NN is/VBZ challenging/VBG due/IN to/IN the/DT large/JJ variations/NNS of/IN pose/NN ,/, illumination/NN ,/, occlusion/NN and/CC camera/NN view/NN ./.
Owing/VBG to/IN these/DT variations/NNS ,/, the/DT pedestrian/NN data/NNS is/VBZ distributed/VBN as/IN highly/RB -/HYPH curved/JJ manifolds/NNS in/IN the/DT feature/NN space/NN ,/, despite/IN the/DT current/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- 's/POS capability/NN of/IN feature/NN extraction/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT distribution/NN is/VBZ unknown/JJ ,/, so/IN it/PRP is/VBZ difficult/JJ to/TO use/VB the/DT geodesic/JJ distance/NN when/WRB comparing/VBG two/CD samples/NNS ./.
In/IN practice/NN ,/, the/DT current/JJ deep/JJ embedding/NN methods/NNS use/VBP the/DT Euclidean/JJ distance/NN for/IN the/DT training/NN and/CC test/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT manifold/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS suggest/VBP to/TO use/VB the/DT Euclidean/JJ distance/NN in/IN the/DT local/JJ range/NN ,/, combining/VBG with/IN the/DT graphical/JJ relationship/NN between/IN samples/NNS ,/, for/IN approximating/VBG the/DT geodesic/JJ distance/NN ./.
From/IN this/DT point/NN of/IN view/NN ,/, selecting/VBG suitable/JJ positive/JJ i.e./FW intra-class/NNS )/-RRB- training/NN samples/NNS within/IN a/DT local/JJ range/NN is/VBZ critical/JJ for/IN training/VBG the/DT CNN/NNP embedding/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB the/DT data/NNS has/VBZ large/JJ intra-class/JJ variations/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ moderate/JJ positive/JJ sample/NN mining/NN method/NN to/TO train/VB robust/JJ CNN/NNP for/IN person/NN re-identification/NN ,/, dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN large/JJ variation/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP improve/VBP the/DT learning/NN by/IN a/DT metric/JJ weight/NN constraint/NN ,/, so/IN that/IN the/DT learned/VBN metric/NN has/VBZ a/DT better/JJR generalization/NN ability/NN ./.
