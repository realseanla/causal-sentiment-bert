Current/JJ metropolises/NNS largely/RB depend/VBP on/IN a/DT functioning/VBG transport/NN infrastructure/NN and/CC the/DT increasing/VBG demand/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB satisfied/VBN by/IN a/DT well/RB organized/VBN mass/NN transit/NN ./.
One/CD example/NN for/IN a/DT crucial/JJ mass/NN transit/NN system/NN is/VBZ New/NNP York/NNP City/NNP 's/POS Staten/NNP Island/NNP Ferry/NNP ,/, connecting/VBG the/DT two/CD boroughs/NNS of/IN Staten/NNP Island/NNP and/CC Manhattan/NNP with/IN a/DT regular/JJ passenger/NN service/NN ./.
Today/NN 's/POS demand/NN already/RB exceeds/VBZ 2500/CD passengers/NNS for/IN a/DT single/JJ cycle/NN during/IN peek/NN hours/NNS ,/, and/CC future/JJ projections/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN it/PRP will/MD further/RB increase/VB ./.
One/CD way/NN to/IN appraise/VB how/WRB the/DT system/NN will/MD cope/VB with/IN future/JJ demand/NN is/VBZ by/IN simulation/NN ./.

The/DT simulation/NN relies/VBZ on/IN a/DT multiscale/JJ modeling/NN approach/NN where/WRB the/DT terminal/JJ buildings/NNS are/VBP simulated/VBN by/IN a/DT microscopic/JJ and/CC quantitatively/RB valid/JJ cellular/JJ automata/NN (/-LRB- CA/NN )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT journeys/NNS of/IN the/DT ferries/NNS themselves/PRP are/VBP modeled/VBN by/IN a/DT mesoscopic/JJ queue/NN simulation/NN approach/NN ./.
