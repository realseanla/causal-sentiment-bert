Asynchronous/JJ Partial/JJ Overlay/NN (/-LRB- APO/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT search/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT uses/VBZ cooperative/JJ mediation/NN to/TO solve/VB Distributed/VBN Constraint/NN Satisfaction/NN Problems/NNS (/-LRB- DisCSPs/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN partitions/NNS the/DT search/NN into/IN different/JJ subproblems/NNS of/IN the/DT DisCSP/NN ./.
The/DT original/JJ proof/NN of/IN completeness/NN of/IN the/DT APO/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT growth/NN of/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT subproblems/NNS ./.
