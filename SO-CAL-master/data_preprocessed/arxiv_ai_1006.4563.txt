Many/JJ formal/JJ languages/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO express/VB or/CC represent/VB Ontologies/NNS ,/, including/VBG RDF/NNP ,/, RDFS/NNP ,/, DAML/NNP OIL/NNP and/CC OWL/NNP ./.
Most/JJS of/IN these/DT languages/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN XML/NN syntax/NN ,/, but/CC with/IN various/JJ terminologies/NNS and/CC expressiveness/NN ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, choosing/VBG a/DT language/NN for/IN building/VBG an/DT Ontology/NN is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ step/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ point/NN of/IN choosing/VBG language/NN to/TO represent/VB Ontology/NNP is/VBZ based/VBN mainly/RB on/IN what/WP the/DT Ontology/NNP will/MD represent/VB or/CC be/VB used/VBN for/IN ./.
That/DT language/NN should/MD have/VB a/DT range/NN of/IN quality/NN support/NN features/NNS such/JJ as/IN ease/NN of/IN use/NN ,/, expressive/JJ power/NN ,/, compatibility/NN ,/, sharing/NN and/CC versioning/NN ,/, internationalisation/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ because/IN different/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN knowledge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN applications/NNS need/VBP different/JJ language/NN features/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ objective/NN of/IN these/DT languages/NNS is/VBZ to/TO add/VB semantics/NNS to/IN the/DT existing/VBG information/NN on/IN the/DT web/NN ./.
The/DT aims/NNS of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO provide/VB a/DT good/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN existing/VBG language/NN and/CC understanding/NN of/IN these/DT languages/NNS and/CC how/WRB could/MD be/VB used/VBN ./.
