In/IN the/DT last/JJ five/CD years/NNS there/RB has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT flurry/NN of/IN work/NN on/IN information/NN extraction/NN from/IN clinical/JJ documents/NNS ,/, i.e./FW ,/, on/IN algorithms/NNS capable/JJ of/IN extracting/VBG ,/, from/IN the/DT informal/JJ and/CC unstructured/JJ texts/NNS that/WDT are/VBP generated/VBN during/IN everyday/JJ clinical/JJ practice/NN ,/, mentions/VBZ of/IN concepts/NNS relevant/JJ to/IN such/JJ practice/NN ./.

Low/JJ quality/NN in/IN training/NN data/NNS often/RB derives/VBZ from/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN the/DT person/NN who/WP has/VBZ annotated/VBN the/DT data/NNS is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN the/DT one/NN against/IN whose/WP$ judgment/NN the/DT automatically/RB annotated/VBN data/NNS must/MD be/VB evaluated/VBN ./.
