We/PRP define/VBP a/DT SDP/NN framework/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT RLSTD/NNP algorithm/NN and/CC multivariate/JJ simplex/NN B/NN -/HYPH splines/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT local/JJ forget/VB factor/NN capable/JJ of/IN preserving/VBG the/DT continuity/NN of/IN the/DT simplex/NN splines/NNS ./.
This/DT local/JJ forget/VB factor/NN is/VBZ integrated/VBN with/IN the/DT RLSTD/NNP algorithm/NN ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN a/DT modified/VBN RLSTD/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN tracking/VBG time/NN -/HYPH varying/VBG systems/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP the/DT results/NNS of/IN two/CD numerical/JJ experiments/NNS ,/, one/CD validating/VBG SDP/NN and/CC comparing/VBG it/PRP with/IN NDP/NN and/CC another/DT to/TO show/VB the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN the/DT modified/VBN RLSTD/NN algorithm/NN over/IN the/DT original/JJ ./.
While/IN SDP/NN requires/VBZ more/JJR computations/NNS per/IN time/NN -/HYPH step/NN ,/, the/DT experiment/NN shows/VBZ that/IN for/IN the/DT same/JJ amount/NN of/IN function/NN approximator/NN parameters/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ an/DT increase/NN in/IN performance/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN stability/NN and/CC learning/NN rate/NN compared/VBN to/IN NDP/NNP ./.
