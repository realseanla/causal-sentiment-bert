Quality/JJ assurance/NN remains/VBZ a/DT key/JJ topic/NN in/IN human/JJ computation/NN research/NN ./.
Prior/JJ work/NN indicates/VBZ that/IN majority/NN voting/NN is/VBZ effective/JJ for/IN low/JJ difficulty/NN tasks/NNS ,/, but/CC has/VBZ limitations/NNS for/IN harder/JJR tasks/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN explores/VBZ two/CD methods/NNS of/IN addressing/VBG this/DT problem/NN :/: tournament/NN selection/NN and/CC elimination/NN selection/NN ,/, which/WDT exploit/VBP 2/CD -/HYPH ,/, 3/CD -/SYM and/CC 4/CD -/HYPH way/NN comparisons/NNS between/IN different/JJ answers/NNS to/IN human/JJ computation/NN tasks/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ results/NNS and/CC statistical/JJ analyses/NNS show/VBP that/IN both/DT methods/NNS produce/VBP the/DT correct/JJ answer/NN in/IN noisy/JJ human/JJ computation/NN environment/NN more/RBR often/RB than/IN majority/NN voting/NN ./.
