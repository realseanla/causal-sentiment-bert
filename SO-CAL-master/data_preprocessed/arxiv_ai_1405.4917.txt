The/DT constraint/NN satisfaction/NN problem/NN (/-LRB- CSP/NNP )/-RRB- on/IN a/DT relational/JJ structure/NN B/NN is/VBZ to/TO decide/VB ,/, given/VBN a/DT set/NN of/IN constraints/NNS on/IN variables/NNS where/WRB the/DT relations/NNS come/VBP from/IN B/NNP ,/, whether/IN or/CC not/RB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT assignment/NN to/IN the/DT variables/NNS satisfying/VBG all/DT of/IN the/DT constraints/NNS ;/: the/DT surjective/JJ CSP/NNP is/VBZ the/DT variant/NN where/WRB one/CD decides/VBZ the/DT existence/NN of/IN a/DT surjective/JJ satisfying/JJ assignment/NN onto/IN the/DT universe/NN of/IN B/NN ./.
