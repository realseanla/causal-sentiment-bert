In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP developed/VBD a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT learns/VBZ to/TO solve/VB simultaneously/RB the/DT three/CD tasks/NNS of/IN the/DT cQA/NN challenge/NN proposed/VBN by/IN the/DT SemEval/NNP -/HYPH 2016/CD Task/NNP 3/CD ,/, i.e./FW ,/, question/NN -/HYPH comment/NN similarity/NN ,/, question/NN -/HYPH question/NN similarity/NN and/CC new/JJ question/NN -/HYPH comment/NN similarity/NN ./.
The/DT latter/JJ is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ task/NN ,/, which/WDT can/MD exploit/VB the/DT previous/JJ two/CD for/IN achieving/VBG better/JJR results/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ DNN/NN is/VBZ trained/VBN jointly/RB on/IN all/PDT the/DT three/CD cQA/NN tasks/NNS and/CC learns/VBZ to/TO encode/VB questions/NNS and/CC comments/NNS into/IN a/DT single/JJ vector/NN representation/NN shared/VBD across/IN the/DT multiple/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
The/DT results/NNS on/IN the/DT official/NN challenge/NN test/NN set/VBN show/NN that/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN produces/VBZ higher/JJR accuracy/NN and/CC faster/RBR convergence/NN rates/NNS than/IN the/DT individual/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Additionally/RB ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN ,/, which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB use/VB any/DT manual/JJ feature/NN engineering/NN ,/, approaches/VBZ the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN established/VBN with/IN methods/NNS that/WDT make/VBP heavy/JJ use/NN of/IN it/PRP ./.
