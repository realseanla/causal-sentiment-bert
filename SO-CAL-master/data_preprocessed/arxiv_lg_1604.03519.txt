In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP describe/VBP a/DT novel/JJ deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- based/VBN approach/NN called/VBN contextual/JJ deep/JJ CNN/NNP that/WDT can/MD jointly/RB exploit/VB spatial/JJ and/CC spectral/JJ features/NNS for/IN hyperspectral/JJ image/NN classification/NN ./.
The/DT contextual/JJ deep/JJ CNN/NNP first/RB concurrently/RB applies/VBZ multiple/JJ 3/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ local/JJ convolutional/JJ filters/NNS with/IN different/JJ sizes/NNS jointly/RB exploiting/VBG spatial/JJ and/CC spectral/JJ features/NNS of/IN a/DT hyperspectral/JJ image/NN ./.
The/DT initial/JJ spatial/JJ and/CC spectral/JJ feature/NN maps/NNS obtained/VBN from/IN applying/VBG the/DT variable/JJ size/NN convolutional/JJ filters/NNS are/VBP then/RB combined/VBN together/RB to/TO form/VB a/DT joint/JJ spatio/JJ -/HYPH spectral/JJ feature/NN map/NN ./.
The/DT joint/JJ feature/NN map/NN representing/VBG rich/JJ spectral/JJ and/CC spatial/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT hyperspectral/JJ image/NN is/VBZ then/RB fed/VBN through/IN fully/RB convolutional/JJ layers/NNS that/WDT eventually/RB predict/VBP the/DT corresponding/VBG label/NN of/IN each/DT pixel/NN vector/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN is/VBZ tested/VBN on/IN the/DT Indian/JJ Pines/NNS data/NNS and/CC performance/NN comparison/NN shows/VBZ enhanced/VBN classification/NN performance/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN over/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ./.
