The/DT task/NN of/IN identifying/VBG synonymous/JJ relations/NNS and/CC objects/NNS ,/, or/CC synonym/NN resolution/NN ,/, is/VBZ critical/JJ for/IN high/JJ -/HYPH quality/NN information/NN extraction/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ synonym/NN resolution/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN unsupervised/JJ information/NN extraction/NN ,/, where/WRB neither/CC hand/NN -/HYPH tagged/VBN training/NN examples/NNS nor/CC domain/NN knowledge/NN is/VBZ available/JJ ./.
The/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT scalable/JJ ,/, fully/RB -/HYPH implemented/VBN system/NN that/WDT runs/VBZ in/IN O/NN (/-LRB- KN/NN log/NN N/NN )/-RRB- time/NN in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN extractions/NNS ,/, N/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT maximum/JJ number/NN of/IN synonyms/NNS per/IN word/NN ,/, K/NN ./.
The/DT system/NN ,/, called/VBN Resolver/NNP ,/, introduces/VBZ a/DT probabilistic/JJ relational/JJ model/NN for/IN predicting/VBG whether/IN two/CD strings/NNS are/VBP co-referential/JJ based/VBN on/IN the/DT similarity/NN of/IN the/DT assertions/NNS containing/VBG them/PRP ./.
On/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN two/CD million/CD assertions/NNS extracted/VBN from/IN the/DT Web/NN ,/, Resolver/NNP resolves/VBZ objects/NNS with/IN 78/CD percent/NN precision/NN and/CC 68/CD percent/NN recall/NN ,/, and/CC resolves/VBZ relations/NNS with/IN 90/CD percent/NN precision/NN and/CC 35/CD percent/NN recall/NN ./.
Several/JJ variations/NNS of/IN resolvers/NNS probabilistic/JJ model/NN are/VBP explored/VBN ,/, and/CC experiments/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN under/IN appropriate/JJ conditions/NNS these/DT variations/NNS can/MD improve/VB F1/NN by/IN 5/CD percent/NN ./.
An/DT extension/NN to/IN the/DT basic/JJ Resolver/NN system/NN allows/VBZ it/PRP to/TO handle/VB polysemous/JJ names/NNS with/IN 97/CD percent/NN precision/NN and/CC 95/CD percent/NN recall/NN on/IN a/DT data/NN set/NN from/IN the/DT TREC/NN corpus/NN ./.
