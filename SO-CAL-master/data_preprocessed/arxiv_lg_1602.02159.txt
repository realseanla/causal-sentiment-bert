Decision/NN making/NN in/IN cloud/NN environments/NNS is/VBZ quite/RB challenging/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT diversity/NN in/IN service/NN offerings/NNS and/CC pricing/NN models/NNS ,/, especially/RB considering/VBG that/IN the/DT cloud/NN market/NN is/VBZ an/DT incredibly/RB fast/RB moving/VBG one/CD ./.
