Semi-supervised/VBN learning/NN plays/VBZ an/DT important/JJ role/NN in/IN large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN machine/NN learning/NN ./.
Properly/RB using/VBG additional/JJ unlabeled/JJ data/NNS (/-LRB- largely/RB available/JJ nowadays/RB )/-RRB- often/RB can/MD improve/VB the/DT machine/NN learning/VBG accuracy/NN ./.
