The/DT paper/NN offers/VBZ a/DT mathematical/JJ formalization/NN of/IN the/DT Turing/NNP test/NN ./.
This/DT formalization/NN makes/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO establish/VB the/DT conditions/NNS under/IN which/WDT some/DT Turing/NNP machine/NN will/MD pass/VB the/DT Turing/NNP test/NN and/CC the/DT conditions/NNS under/IN which/WDT every/DT Turing/NNP machine/NN (/-LRB- or/CC every/DT Turing/NNP machine/NN of/IN the/DT special/JJ class/NN )/-RRB- will/MD fail/VB the/DT Turing/NNP test/NN ./.
