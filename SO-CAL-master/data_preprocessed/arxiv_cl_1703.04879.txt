Named/VBN entity/NN classification/NN is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN classifying/VBG text/NN -/HYPH based/VBN elements/NNS into/IN various/JJ categories/NNS ,/, including/VBG places/NNS ,/, names/NNS ,/, dates/NNS ,/, times/NNS ,/, and/CC monetary/JJ values/NNS ./.
A/DT bottleneck/NN in/IN named/VBN entity/NN classification/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, is/VBZ the/DT data/NNS problem/NN of/IN sparseness/NN ,/, because/IN new/JJ named/VBN entities/NNS continually/RB emerge/VBP ,/, making/VBG it/PRP rather/RB difficult/JJ to/TO maintain/VB a/DT dictionary/NN for/IN named/VBN entity/NN classification/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN named/VBN entity/NN classification/NN using/VBG matrix/NN factorization/NN to/TO overcome/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN feature/NN sparsity/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN model/NN ,/, with/IN fewer/JJR features/NNS and/CC a/DT smaller/JJR size/NN ,/, achieves/VBZ competitive/JJ accuracy/NN to/IN state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN models/NNS ./.
