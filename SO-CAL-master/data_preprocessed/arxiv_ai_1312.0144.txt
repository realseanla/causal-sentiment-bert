Knowing/VBG whether/IN a/DT proposition/NN is/VBZ true/JJ means/NNS knowing/VBG that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ true/JJ or/CC knowing/VBG that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ false/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP logics/NNS with/IN a/DT modal/JJ operator/NN Kw/NN for/IN knowing/VBG whether/IN but/CC without/IN a/DT modal/JJ operator/NN K/NN for/IN knowing/VBG that/DT ./.
This/DT logic/NN is/VBZ not/RB a/DT normal/JJ modal/JJ logic/NN ,/, because/IN we/PRP do/VBP not/RB have/VB that/DT Kw/NN phi/NN -/HYPH &gt;/SYM Kw/NN psi/NN and/CC Kw/NN phi/NN implies/VBZ Kw/NNP psi/NNP ./.
Knowing/VBG whether/IN logic/NN can/MD not/RB define/VB many/JJ common/JJ frame/NN properties/NNS ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ expressive/JJ power/NN less/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN basic/JJ modal/JJ logic/NN over/IN classes/NNS of/IN models/NNS without/IN reflexivity/NN ./.
These/DT features/NNS make/VBP axiomatizing/VBG knowing/VBG whether/IN logics/NNS non-trivial/JJ ./.
We/PRP axiomatize/VBP knowing/VBG whether/IN logic/NN over/IN various/JJ frame/NN classes/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB present/VBP an/DT extension/NN of/IN knowing/VBG whether/IN logic/NN with/IN public/JJ announcement/NN operators/NNS and/CC we/PRP give/VBP corresponding/VBG reduction/NN axioms/NNS for/IN that/DT ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP our/PRP$ work/NN in/IN detail/NN to/IN two/CD recent/JJ similar/JJ proposals/NNS ./.
