The/DT assignment/NN of/IN tasks/NNS to/IN multiple/JJ resources/NNS becomes/VBZ an/DT interesting/JJ game/NN theoretic/JJ problem/NN ,/, when/WRB both/CC the/DT task/NN owner/NN and/CC the/DT resources/NNS are/VBP strategic/JJ ./.
In/IN the/DT classical/JJ ,/, nonstrategic/JJ setting/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT states/NNS of/IN the/DT tasks/NNS and/CC resources/NNS are/VBP observable/JJ by/IN the/DT controller/NN ,/, this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN of/IN finding/VBG an/DT optimal/JJ policy/NN for/IN a/DT Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN (/-LRB- MDP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
When/WRB the/DT states/NNS are/VBP held/VBN by/IN strategic/JJ agents/NNS ,/, the/DT problem/NN of/IN an/DT efficient/JJ task/NN allocation/NN extends/VBZ beyond/IN that/DT of/IN solving/VBG an/DT MDP/NN and/CC becomes/VBZ that/DT of/IN designing/VBG a/DT mechanism/NN ./.
