We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN an/DT agent/NN to/TO revise/VB its/PRP$ incomplete/JJ probabilistic/JJ beliefs/NNS when/WRB a/DT new/JJ piece/NN of/IN propositional/JJ information/NN is/VBZ observed/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, an/DT agent/NN 's/POS beliefs/NNS are/VBP represented/VBN by/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN probabilistic/JJ formulae/NNS --/: a/DT belief/NN base/NN ./.
The/DT method/NN involves/VBZ determining/VBG a/DT representative/NN set/NN of/IN '/`` boundary/NN '/'' probability/NN distributions/NNS consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT current/JJ belief/NN base/NN ,/, revising/VBG each/DT of/IN these/DT probability/NN distributions/NNS and/CC then/RB translating/VBG the/DT revised/VBN information/NN into/IN a/DT new/JJ belief/NN base/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP a/DT version/NN of/IN Lewis/NNP Imaging/NNP as/IN the/DT revision/NN operation/NN ./.
The/DT correctness/NN of/IN the/DT approach/NN is/VBZ proved/VBN ./.
The/DT expressivity/NN of/IN the/DT belief/NN bases/NNS under/IN consideration/NN are/VBP rather/RB restricted/VBN ,/, but/CC has/VBZ some/DT applications/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB discuss/VBP methods/NNS of/IN belief/NN base/NN revision/NN employing/VBG the/DT notion/NN of/IN optimum/JJ entropy/NN ,/, and/CC point/VB out/RP some/DT of/IN the/DT benefits/NNS and/CC difficulties/NNS in/IN those/DT methods/NNS ./.
Both/CC the/DT boundary/NN distribution/NN method/NN and/CC the/DT optimum/JJ entropy/NN method/NN are/VBP reasonable/JJ ,/, yet/CC yield/VBP different/JJ results/NNS ./.
