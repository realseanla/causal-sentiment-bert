Stackelberg/NNP security/NN game/NN models/NNS and/CC associated/VBN computational/JJ tools/NNS have/VBP seen/VBN deployment/NN in/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN high/JJ -/HYPH consequence/NN security/NN settings/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN LAX/JJ canine/JJ patrols/NNS and/CC Federal/NNP Air/NNP Marshal/NNP Service/NNP ./.
These/DT models/NNS focus/VBP on/IN isolated/VBN systems/NNS with/IN only/RB one/CD defender/NN ,/, despite/IN being/VBG part/NN of/IN a/DT more/RBR complex/JJ system/NN with/IN multiple/JJ players/NNS ./.

To/TO understand/VB such/JJ multidefender/JJ strategic/JJ interactions/NNS present/JJ in/IN security/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP game/NN theoretic/JJ models/NNS of/IN security/NN games/NNS with/IN multiple/JJ defenders/NNS ./.

We/PRP start/VBP with/IN an/DT analytical/JJ investigation/NN of/IN multidefender/JJ security/NN games/NNS with/IN independent/JJ targets/NNS ,/, offering/VBG an/DT equilibrium/NN and/CC price/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH anarchy/NN analysis/NN of/IN three/CD models/NNS with/IN increasing/VBG generality/NN ./.
In/IN all/DT models/NNS ,/, we/PRP find/VBP that/IN defenders/NNS have/VBP the/DT incentive/NN to/TO over-protect/VB targets/NNS ,/, at/IN times/NNS significantly/RB ./.
Additionally/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT simpler/JJR models/NNS ,/, we/PRP find/VBP that/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN anarchy/NN is/VBZ unbounded/JJ ,/, linearly/RB increasing/VBG both/CC in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN defenders/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN targets/NNS per/IN defender/NN ./.
