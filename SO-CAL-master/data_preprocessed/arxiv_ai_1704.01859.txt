The/DT Dynamic/JJ Vehicle/NN Routing/VBG Problem/NN with/IN Time/NNP Windows/NNP (/-LRB- DVRPTW/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ an/DT extension/NN of/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN Vehicle/NN Routing/VBG Problem/NN (/-LRB- VRP/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN the/DT dynamic/JJ nature/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.
This/DT aspect/NN requires/VBZ the/DT vehicle/NN routes/NNS to/TO be/VB updated/VBN in/IN an/DT ongoing/JJ manner/NN as/IN new/JJ customer/NN requests/NNS arrive/VBP in/IN the/DT system/NN and/CC must/MD be/VB incorporated/VBN into/IN an/DT evolving/VBG schedule/NN during/IN the/DT working/VBG day/NN ./.
Besides/IN the/DT vehicle/NN capacity/NN constraint/NN involved/VBN in/IN the/DT classical/JJ VRP/NN ,/, DVRPTW/NNP considers/VBZ in/IN addition/NN time/NN windows/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP able/JJ to/TO better/RBR capture/VB real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN situations/NNS ./.
Despite/IN this/DT ,/, so/RB far/RB ,/, few/JJ studies/NNS have/VBP focused/VBN on/IN tackling/VBG this/DT problem/NN of/IN greater/JJR practical/JJ importance/NN ./.
