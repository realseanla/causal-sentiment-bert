Understanding/VBG open/JJ -/HYPH domain/NN text/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT primary/JJ challenges/NNS in/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN (/-LRB- NLP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Machine/NN comprehension/NN benchmarks/NNS evaluate/VBP the/DT system/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO understand/VB text/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT text/NN content/NN only/RB ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP machine/NN comprehension/NN on/IN MCTest/NNP ,/, a/DT question/NN answering/VBG (/-LRB- QA/NNP )/-RRB- benchmark/NN ./.
