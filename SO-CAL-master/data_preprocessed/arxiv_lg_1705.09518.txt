Graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN quite/RB successful/JJ in/IN solving/VBG unsupervised/JJ and/CC semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN problems/NNS ,/, as/IN they/PRP provide/VBP a/DT means/VBZ to/TO capture/VB the/DT underlying/VBG geometry/NN of/IN the/DT dataset/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ often/RB desirable/JJ for/IN the/DT constructed/VBN graph/NN to/TO satisfy/VB two/CD properties/NNS :/: first/RB ,/, data/NNS points/NNS that/WDT are/VBP similar/JJ in/IN the/DT feature/NN space/NN should/MD be/VB strongly/RB connected/VBN on/IN the/DT graph/NN ,/, and/CC second/RB ,/, the/DT class/NN label/NN information/NN should/MD vary/VB smoothly/RB with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT graph/NN ,/, where/WRB smoothness/NN is/VBZ measured/VBN using/VBG the/DT spectral/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT graph/NN Laplacian/NNP matrix/NN ./.
Recent/JJ works/NNS have/VBP justified/VBN some/DT of/IN these/DT smoothness/NN conditions/NNS by/IN showing/VBG that/IN they/PRP are/VBP strongly/RB linked/VBN to/IN the/DT semi-supervised/JJ smoothness/NN assumption/NN and/CC its/PRP$ variants/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP reinforce/VBP this/DT connection/NN by/IN viewing/VBG the/DT problem/NN from/IN a/DT graph/NN sampling/NN theoretic/JJ perspective/NN ,/, where/WRB class/NN indicator/NN functions/NNS are/VBP treated/VBN as/IN bandlimited/JJ graph/NN signals/NNS (/-LRB- in/IN the/DT eigenvector/NN basis/NN of/IN the/DT graph/NN Laplacian/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC label/NN prediction/NN as/IN a/DT bandlimited/JJ reconstruction/NN problem/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN involves/VBZ analyzing/VBG the/DT bandwidth/NN of/IN class/NN indicator/NN signals/NNS generated/VBN from/IN statistical/JJ data/NN models/NNS with/IN separable/JJ and/CC nonseparable/JJ classes/NNS ./.
These/DT models/NNS are/VBP quite/RB general/JJ and/CC mimic/VBP the/DT nature/NN of/IN most/JJS real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN datasets/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN in/IN the/DT asymptotic/JJ limit/NN ,/, the/DT bandwidth/NN of/IN any/DT class/NN indicator/NN is/VBZ also/RB closely/RB related/VBN to/IN the/DT geometry/NN of/IN the/DT dataset/NN ./.
This/DT allows/VBZ one/CD to/TO theoretically/RB justify/VB the/DT assumption/NN of/IN bandlimitedness/NN of/IN class/NN indicator/NN signals/NNS ,/, thereby/RB providing/VBG a/DT sampling/NN theoretic/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN semi-supervised/JJ classification/NN ./.
