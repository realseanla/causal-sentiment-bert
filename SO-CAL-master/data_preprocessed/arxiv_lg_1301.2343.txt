Efficient/JJ planning/NN plays/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ role/NN in/IN model/NN -/HYPH based/VBN reinforcement/NN learning/NN ./.
Traditionally/RB ,/, the/DT main/JJ planning/NN operation/NN is/VBZ a/DT full/JJ backup/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT current/JJ estimates/NNS of/IN the/DT successor/NN states/NNS ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, its/PRP$ computation/NN time/NN is/VBZ proportional/JJ to/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN successor/NN states/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ planning/NN backup/NN that/WDT uses/VBZ only/RB the/DT current/JJ value/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ successor/NN state/NN and/CC has/VBZ a/DT computation/NN time/NN independent/JJ of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN successor/NN states/NNS ./.
This/DT new/JJ backup/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP call/VBP a/DT small/JJ backup/NN ,/, opens/VBZ the/DT door/NN to/IN a/DT new/JJ class/NN of/IN model/NN -/HYPH based/VBN reinforcement/NN learning/NN methods/NNS that/WDT exhibit/VBP much/JJ finer/JJR control/NN over/IN their/PRP$ planning/NN process/NN than/IN traditional/JJ methods/NNS ./.
We/PRP empirically/RB demonstrate/VBP that/IN this/DT increased/VBN flexibility/NN allows/VBZ for/IN more/RBR efficient/JJ planning/NN by/IN showing/VBG that/IN an/DT implementation/NN of/IN prioritized/VBN sweeping/JJ based/VBN on/IN small/JJ backups/NNS achieves/VBZ a/DT substantial/JJ performance/NN improvement/NN over/IN classical/JJ implementations/NNS ./.
