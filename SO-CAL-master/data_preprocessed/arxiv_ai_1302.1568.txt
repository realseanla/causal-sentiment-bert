We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN two/CD related/JJ notions/NNS -/HYPH conditional/JJ utility/NN and/CC utility/NN independence/NN ./.
Unlike/IN the/DT traditional/JJ interpretation/NN ,/, the/DT new/JJ interpretation/NN renders/VBZ the/DT notions/NNS the/DT direct/JJ analogues/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ probabilistic/JJ counterparts/NNS ./.
To/TO capture/VB these/DT notions/NNS formally/RB ,/, we/PRP appeal/VBP to/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN utility/NN distribution/NN ,/, introduced/VBN in/IN previous/JJ paper/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN utility/NN distributions/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP a/DT structure/NN that/WDT is/VBZ identical/JJ to/IN that/DT of/IN probability/NN distributions/NNS ,/, can/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT special/JJ case/NN of/IN an/DT additive/JJ multiattribute/NN utility/NN functions/NNS ,/, and/CC show/VB how/WRB this/DT special/JJ case/NN permits/VBZ us/PRP to/TO capture/VB the/DT novel/JJ senses/NNS of/IN conditional/JJ utility/NN and/CC utility/NN independence/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP the/DT notion/NN of/IN utility/NN networks/NNS ,/, which/WDT do/VBP for/IN utilities/NNS what/WDT Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS do/VBP for/IN probabilities/NNS ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, utility/NN networks/NNS exploit/VBP the/DT new/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN conditional/JJ utility/NN and/CC utility/NN independence/NN to/IN compactly/RB represent/VBP a/DT utility/NN distribution/NN ./.
