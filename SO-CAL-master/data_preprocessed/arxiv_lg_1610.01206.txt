Recently/RB ,/, multi-view/JJ representation/NN learning/NN has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT rapidly/RB growing/VBG direction/NN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN and/CC data/NNS mining/NN areas/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN first/RB reviews/VBZ the/DT root/NN methods/NNS and/CC theories/NNS on/IN multi-view/JJ representation/NN learning/NN ,/, especially/RB on/IN canonical/JJ correlation/NN analysis/NN (/-LRB- CCA/NN )/-RRB- and/CC its/PRP$ several/JJ extensions/NNS ./.
And/CC then/RB we/PRP investigate/VB the/DT advancement/NN of/IN multi-view/JJ representation/NN learning/NN that/WDT ranges/VBZ from/IN shallow/JJ methods/NNS including/VBG multi-modal/JJ topic/NN learning/NN ,/, multi-view/JJ sparse/JJ coding/NN ,/, and/CC multi-view/JJ latent/JJ space/NN Markov/NNP networks/NNS ,/, to/IN deep/JJ methods/NNS including/VBG multi-modal/JJ restricted/VBN Boltzmann/JJ machines/NNS ,/, multi-modal/JJ autoencoders/NNS ,/, and/CC multi-modal/JJ recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Further/RB ,/, we/PRP also/RB provide/VBP an/DT important/JJ perspective/NN from/IN manifold/JJ alignment/NN for/IN multi-view/JJ representation/NN learning/NN ./.
Overall/RB ,/, this/DT survey/NN aims/VBZ to/TO provide/VB an/DT insightful/JJ overview/NN of/IN theoretical/JJ basis/NN and/CC current/JJ developments/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN multi-view/JJ representation/NN learning/NN and/CC to/TO help/VB researchers/NNS find/VB the/DT most/RBS appropriate/JJ tools/NNS for/IN particular/JJ applications/NNS ./.
