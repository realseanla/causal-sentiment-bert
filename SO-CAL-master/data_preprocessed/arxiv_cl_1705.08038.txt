Over/IN the/DT past/JJ century/NN ,/, personality/NN theory/NN and/CC research/NN has/VBZ successfully/RB identified/VBN core/NN sets/NNS of/IN characteristics/NNS that/WDT consistently/RB describe/VBP and/CC explain/VBP fundamental/JJ differences/NNS in/IN the/DT way/NN people/NNS think/VBP ,/, feel/VBP and/CC behave/VBP ./.
Such/JJ characteristics/NNS were/VBD derived/VBN through/IN theory/NN ,/, dictionary/NN analyses/NNS ,/, and/CC survey/NN research/NN using/VBG explicit/JJ self/NN -/HYPH reports/NNS ./.

Taking/VBG advantage/NN of/IN linguistic/JJ information/NN available/JJ through/IN Facebook/NNP ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT process/NN of/IN inferring/VBG a/DT new/JJ set/NN of/IN potential/JJ human/JJ traits/NNS based/VBN on/IN unprompted/JJ language/NN use/NN ./.

We/PRP find/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ language/NN -/HYPH based/VBN trait/NN construct/NN is/VBZ often/RB more/RBR generalizable/JJ in/IN that/IN it/PRP often/RB predicts/VBZ non-questionnaire-based/JJ outcomes/NNS better/JJR than/IN questionnaire/NN -/HYPH based/VBN traits/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW entities/NNS someone/NN likes/VBZ ,/, income/NN and/CC intelligence/NN quotient/NN )/-RRB- ,/, while/IN the/DT factors/NNS remain/VBP nearly/RB as/RB stable/JJ as/IN traditional/JJ factors/NNS ./.
