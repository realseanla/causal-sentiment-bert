This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT brief/JJ survey/NN on/IN Automatic/NNP Speech/NNP Recognition/NNP and/CC discusses/VBZ the/DT major/JJ themes/NNS and/CC advances/NNS made/VBN in/IN the/DT past/JJ 60/CD years/NNS of/IN research/NN ,/, so/RB as/IN to/TO provide/VB a/DT technological/JJ perspective/NN and/CC an/DT appreciation/NN of/IN the/DT fundamental/JJ progress/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN accomplished/VBN in/IN this/DT important/JJ area/NN of/IN speech/NN communication/NN ./.
After/IN years/NNS of/IN research/NN and/CC development/NN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN automatic/JJ speech/NN recognition/NN remains/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT important/JJ research/NN challenges/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, variations/NNS of/IN the/DT context/NN ,/, speakers/NNS ,/, and/CC environment/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT design/NN of/IN Speech/NNP Recognition/NNP system/NN requires/VBZ careful/JJ attentions/NNS to/IN the/DT following/VBG issues/NNS :/: Definition/NN of/IN various/JJ types/NNS of/IN speech/NN classes/NNS ,/, speech/NN representation/NN ,/, feature/NN extraction/NN techniques/NNS ,/, speech/NN classifiers/NNS ,/, database/NN and/CC performance/NN evaluation/NN ./.
The/DT problems/NNS that/WDT are/VBP existing/VBG in/IN ASR/NNP and/CC the/DT various/JJ techniques/NNS to/TO solve/VB these/DT problems/NNS constructed/VBN by/IN various/JJ research/NN workers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN presented/VBN in/IN a/DT chronological/JJ order/NN ./.
