The/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO investigate/VB the/DT interplay/NN between/IN knowledge/NN shared/VBN by/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN agents/NNS and/CC its/PRP$ coalition/NN ability/NN ./.
We/PRP characterize/VBP this/DT relation/NN in/IN the/DT standard/JJ context/NN of/IN imperfect/JJ information/NN concurrent/JJ game/NN ./.
We/PRP assume/VBP that/IN whenever/WRB a/DT set/NN of/IN agents/NNS form/VBP a/DT coalition/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT goal/NN ,/, they/PRP share/VBP their/PRP$ knowledge/NN before/IN acting/VBG ./.
Based/VBN on/IN this/DT assumption/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP new/JJ semantics/NNS for/IN alternating/VBG -/HYPH time/NN temporal/JJ logic/NN with/IN imperfect/JJ information/NN and/CC perfect/JJ recall/NN ./.
It/PRP turns/VBZ out/RP that/IN this/DT semantics/NNS is/VBZ sufficient/JJ to/TO preserve/VB all/PDT the/DT desirable/JJ properties/NNS of/IN coalition/NN ability/NN in/IN traditional/JJ coalitional/JJ logics/NNS ./.
Meanwhile/RB ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP how/WRB knowledge/NN sharing/NN within/IN a/DT group/NN of/IN agents/NNS contributes/VBZ to/IN its/PRP$ coalitional/JJ ability/NN through/IN the/DT interplay/NN of/IN epistemic/JJ and/CC coalition/NN modalities/NNS ./.
This/DT work/NN provides/VBZ a/DT partial/JJ answer/NN to/IN the/DT question/NN :/: which/WDT kind/NN of/IN group/NN knowledge/NN is/VBZ required/VBN for/IN a/DT group/NN to/TO achieve/VB their/PRP$ goals/NNS in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN imperfect/JJ information/NN ./.
