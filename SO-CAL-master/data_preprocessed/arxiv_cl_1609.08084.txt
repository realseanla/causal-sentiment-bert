Entity/NN linking/VBG is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN identifying/VBG mentions/VBZ of/IN entities/NNS in/IN text/NN ,/, and/CC linking/VBG them/PRP to/IN entries/NNS in/IN a/DT knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
This/DT task/NN is/VBZ especially/RB difficult/JJ in/IN microblogs/NNS ,/, as/IN there/EX is/VBZ little/JJ additional/JJ text/NN to/TO provide/VB disambiguating/VBG context/NN ;/: rather/RB ,/, authors/NNS rely/VBP on/IN an/DT implicit/JJ common/JJ ground/NN of/IN shared/VBN knowledge/NN with/IN their/PRP$ readers/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP attempt/VBP to/TO capture/VB some/DT of/IN this/DT implicit/JJ context/NN by/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT social/JJ network/NN structure/NN in/IN microblogs/NNS ./.
We/PRP build/VBP on/IN the/DT theory/NN of/IN homophily/NN ,/, which/WDT implies/VBZ that/IN socially/RB linked/VBN individuals/NNS share/VBP interests/NNS ,/, and/CC are/VBP therefore/RB likely/JJ to/TO mention/VB the/DT same/JJ sorts/NNS of/IN entities/NNS ./.
We/PRP implement/VBP this/DT idea/NN by/IN encoding/VBG authors/NNS ,/, mentions/VBZ ,/, and/CC entities/NNS in/IN a/DT continuous/JJ vector/NN space/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ constructed/VBN so/IN that/IN socially/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN authors/NNS have/VBP similar/JJ vector/NN representations/NNS ./.
