Traditionally/RB ,/, multitask/JJ learning/NN (/-LRB- MTL/NN )/-RRB- assumes/VBZ that/IN all/PDT the/DT tasks/NNS are/VBP related/VBN ./.
This/DT can/MD lead/VB to/IN negative/JJ transfer/NN when/WRB tasks/NNS are/VBP indeed/RB incoherent/JJ ./.
Recently/RB ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN approaches/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN that/IN alleviate/VB this/DT problem/NN by/IN discovering/VBG the/DT underlying/VBG task/NN clusters/NNS or/CC relationships/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ MTL/NN formulation/NN that/WDT captures/VBZ task/NN relationships/NNS at/IN the/DT feature/NN -/HYPH level/NN ./.
Depending/VBG on/IN the/DT interactions/NNS among/IN tasks/NNS and/CC features/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN construct/NN different/JJ task/NN clusters/NNS for/IN different/JJ features/NNS ,/, without/IN even/RB the/DT need/NN of/IN pre-specifying/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN clusters/NNS ./.

Under/IN various/JJ degrees/NNS of/IN task/NN relationships/NNS ,/, the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ consistently/RB among/IN the/DT best/JJS ./.
