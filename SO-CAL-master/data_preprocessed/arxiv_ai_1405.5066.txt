The/DT ability/NN of/IN an/DT Evolutionary/JJ Algorithm/NN (/-LRB- EA/NNP )/-RRB- to/TO find/VB a/DT global/JJ optimal/JJ solution/NN depends/VBZ on/IN its/PRP$ capacity/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT good/JJ rate/NN between/IN exploitation/NN of/IN found/VBN so/RB far/RB elements/NNS and/CC exploration/NN of/IN the/DT search/NN space/NN ./.
Inspired/VBN by/IN natural/JJ phenomena/NN ,/, researchers/NNS have/VBP developed/VBN many/JJ successful/JJ evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS which/WDT ,/, at/IN original/JJ versions/NNS ,/, define/VB operators/NNS that/WDT mimic/VBP the/DT way/NN nature/NN solves/VBZ complex/JJ problems/NNS ,/, with/IN no/DT actual/JJ consideration/NN of/IN the/DT exploration/NN //HYPH exploitation/NN balance/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT novel/JJ nature/NN -/HYPH inspired/VBN algorithm/NN called/VBD the/DT States/NNP of/IN Matter/NNP Search/NNP (/-LRB- SMS/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ introduced/VBN ./.
The/DT SMS/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT simulation/NN of/IN the/DT states/NNS of/IN matter/NN phenomenon/NN ./.

The/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ devised/VBN by/IN considering/VBG each/DT state/NN of/IN matter/NN at/IN one/CD different/JJ exploration/NN //HYPH exploitation/NN ratio/NN ./.
The/DT evolutionary/JJ process/NN is/VBZ divided/VBN into/IN three/CD phases/NNS which/WDT emulate/VBP the/DT three/CD states/NNS of/IN matter/NN :/: gas/NN ,/, liquid/NN and/CC solid/JJ ./.
In/IN each/DT state/NN ,/, molecules/NNS (/-LRB- individuals/NNS )/-RRB- exhibit/VBP different/JJ movement/NN capacities/NNS ./.

As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT approach/NN can/MD substantially/RB improve/VB the/DT balance/NN between/IN exploration/NN //HYPH exploitation/NN ,/, yet/CC preserving/VBG the/DT good/JJ search/NN capabilities/NNS of/IN an/DT evolutionary/JJ approach/NN ./.
