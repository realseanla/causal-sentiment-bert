We/PRP present/VBP Deep/JJ Speaker/NNP ,/, a/DT neural/JJ speaker/NN embedding/NN system/NN that/WDT maps/VBZ utterances/NNS to/IN a/DT hypersphere/NN where/WRB speaker/NN similarity/NN is/VBZ measured/VBN by/IN cosine/NN similarity/NN ./.
The/DT embeddings/NNS generated/VBN by/IN Deep/NNP Speaker/NNP can/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN many/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, including/VBG speaker/NN identification/NN ,/, verification/NN ,/, and/CC clustering/NN ./.
We/PRP experiment/VBP with/IN ResCNN/NN and/CC GRU/NNP architectures/NNS to/TO extract/VB the/DT acoustic/JJ features/NNS ,/, then/RB mean/VB pool/NN to/TO produce/VB utterance/NN -/HYPH level/NN speaker/NN embeddings/NNS ,/, and/CC train/NN using/VBG triplet/NN loss/NN based/VBN on/IN cosine/NN similarity/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN three/CD distinct/JJ datasets/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN Deep/JJ Speaker/NNP outperforms/VBZ a/DT DNN/NN -/HYPH based/VBN i/NN -/HYPH vector/NN baseline/NN ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, Deep/NNP Speaker/NNP reduces/VBZ the/DT verification/NN equal/JJ error/NN rate/NN by/IN 50/CD percent/NN (/-LRB- relatively/RB )/-RRB- and/CC improves/VBZ the/DT identification/NN accuracy/NN by/IN 60/CD percent/NN (/-LRB- relatively/RB )/-RRB- on/IN a/DT text/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ dataset/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB present/JJ results/NNS that/WDT suggest/VBP adapting/VBG from/IN a/DT model/NN trained/VBN with/IN Mandarin/NNP can/MD improve/VB accuracy/NN for/IN English/NNP speaker/NN recognition/NN ./.
