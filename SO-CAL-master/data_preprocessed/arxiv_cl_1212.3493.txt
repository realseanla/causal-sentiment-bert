Previous/JJ works/NNS demonstrated/VBD that/IN Automatic/NNP Text/VBP Summarization/NN (/-LRB- ATS/NN )/-RRB- by/IN sentences/NNS extraction/NN may/MD be/VB improved/VBN using/VBG sentence/NN compression/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT sentence/NN compressions/NNS approach/VBP guided/VBN by/IN level/NN -/HYPH sentence/NN discourse/NN segmentation/NN and/CC probabilistic/JJ language/NN models/NNS (/-LRB- LM/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT results/NNS presented/VBN here/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN solution/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO generate/VB coherent/JJ summaries/NNS with/IN grammatical/JJ compressed/JJ sentences/NNS ./.
The/DT approach/NN is/VBZ simple/JJ enough/RB to/TO be/VB transposed/VBN into/IN other/JJ languages/NNS ./.
