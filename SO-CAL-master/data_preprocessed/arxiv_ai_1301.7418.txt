In/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN ,/, insufficient/JJ information/NN ,/, limited/JJ computation/NN resources/NNS ,/, and/CC complex/JJ problem/NN structures/NNS often/RB force/VBP an/DT autonomous/JJ agent/NN to/TO make/VB a/DT decision/NN in/IN time/NN less/JJR than/IN that/DT required/VBN to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN at/IN hand/NN completely/RB ./.
