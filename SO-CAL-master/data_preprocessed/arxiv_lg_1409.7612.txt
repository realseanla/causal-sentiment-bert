Semi-supervised/VBN classification/NN is/VBZ an/DT interesting/JJ idea/NN where/WRB classification/NN models/NNS are/VBP learned/VBN from/IN both/DT labeled/VBN and/CC unlabeled/JJ data/NNS ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ several/JJ advantages/NNS over/IN supervised/JJ classification/NN in/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN domain/NN ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, supervised/VBD classification/NN exploits/NNS only/RB labeled/VBN data/NNS that/WDT are/VBP expensive/JJ ,/, often/RB difficult/JJ to/TO get/VB ,/, inadequate/JJ in/IN quantity/NN ,/, and/CC require/VBP human/JJ experts/NNS for/IN annotation/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, unlabeled/JJ data/NNS are/VBP inexpensive/JJ and/CC abundant/JJ ./.
Despite/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN many/JJ factors/NNS limit/VBP the/DT wide/JJ -/HYPH spread/NN use/NN of/IN semi-supervised/VBN classification/NN ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ become/VBN popular/JJ since/IN its/PRP$ level/NN of/IN performance/NN is/VBZ empirically/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN supervised/JJ classification/NN ./.
This/DT study/NN explores/VBZ the/DT possibilities/NNS and/CC achievements/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN complexity/NN and/CC limitations/NNS of/IN semi-supervised/VBN classification/NN for/IN several/JJ natural/JJ langue/NN processing/NN tasks/NNS like/IN parsing/VBG ,/, biomedical/JJ information/NN processing/NN ,/, text/NN classification/NN ,/, and/CC summarization/NN ./.
