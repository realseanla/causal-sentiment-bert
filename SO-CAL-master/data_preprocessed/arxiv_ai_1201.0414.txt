In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, the/DT continuity/NN and/CC strong/JJ continuity/NN in/IN domain/NN -/HYPH free/JJ information/NN algebras/NN and/CC labeled/VBN information/NN algebras/NNS are/VBP introduced/VBN respectively/RB ./.
A/DT more/RBR general/JJ concept/NN of/IN continuous/JJ function/NN which/WDT is/VBZ defined/VBN between/IN two/CD domain/NN -/HYPH free/JJ continuous/JJ information/NN algebras/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN ./.
