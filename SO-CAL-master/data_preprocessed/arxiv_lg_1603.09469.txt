The/DT problem/NN of/IN stereoscopic/JJ image/NN quality/NN assessment/NN ,/, which/WDT finds/VBZ applications/NNS in/IN 3D/JJ visual/JJ content/NN delivery/NN such/JJ as/IN 3DTV/NN ,/, is/VBZ investigated/VBN in/IN this/DT work/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ ParaBoost/NN (/-LRB- parallel/NN -/HYPH boosting/VBG )/-RRB- stereoscopic/JJ image/NN quality/NN assessment/NN (/-LRB- PBSIQA/NN )/-RRB- system/NN ./.
The/DT system/NN consists/VBZ of/IN two/CD stages/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT first/JJ stage/NN ,/, various/JJ distortions/NNS are/VBP classified/VBN into/IN a/DT few/JJ types/NNS ,/, and/CC individual/JJ quality/NN scorers/NNS targeting/VBG at/IN a/DT specific/JJ distortion/NN type/NN are/VBP developed/VBN ./.
These/DT scorers/NNS offer/VBP complementary/JJ performance/NN in/IN face/NN of/IN a/DT database/NN consisting/VBG of/IN heterogeneous/JJ distortion/NN types/NNS ./.
