The/DT Constructive/JJ Solid/JJ Geometry/NN (/-LRB- CSG/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT data/NN model/NN providing/VBG a/DT set/NN of/IN binary/JJ Boolean/JJ operators/NNS such/JJ as/IN Union/NNP ,/, Difference/NN and/CC Intersection/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, these/DT operators/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO compute/VB topological/JJ relations/NNS between/IN objects/NNS defined/VBN by/IN the/DT constraints/NNS of/IN the/DT nine/CD Intersection/NN Model/NN (/-LRB- 9/CD -/SYM IM/NN )/-RRB- from/IN Egenhofer/NNP ./.
With/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN these/DT constraints/NNS ,/, we/PRP define/VBP a/DT procedure/NN to/IN compute/VB the/DT topological/JJ relations/NNS on/IN CSG/NNP objects/NNS ./.
These/DT topological/JJ relations/NNS are/VBP Disjoint/NN ,/, Contains/VBZ ,/, Inside/NNP ,/, Covers/VBZ ,/, CoveredBy/NNP ,/, Equals/VBZ and/CC Overlaps/VBZ ,/, and/CC are/VBP defined/VBN in/IN a/DT top/JJ -/HYPH level/NN ontology/NN with/IN a/DT specific/JJ semantic/JJ definition/NN on/IN relation/NN such/JJ as/IN Transitive/JJ ,/, Symmetric/JJ ,/, Asymmetric/JJ ,/, Functional/JJ ,/, Reflexive/JJ ,/, and/CC Irreflexive/NNP ./.
