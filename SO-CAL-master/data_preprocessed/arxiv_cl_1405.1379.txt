This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT challenging/JJ scenario/NN for/IN the/DT distant/JJ -/HYPH talking/VBG control/NN of/IN a/DT music/NN playback/NN device/NN ,/, a/DT common/JJ portable/JJ speaker/NN with/IN four/CD small/JJ loudspeakers/NNS in/IN close/JJ proximity/NN to/IN one/CD microphone/NN ./.
The/DT user/NN controls/VBZ the/DT device/NN through/IN voice/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT speech/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH music/NN ratio/NN can/MD be/VB as/RB low/JJ as/IN -30/NN dB/NN during/IN music/NN playback/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT speech/NN enhancement/NN front/NN -/HYPH end/NN that/WDT relies/VBZ on/IN known/VBN robust/JJ methods/NNS for/IN echo/NN cancellation/NN ,/, double/JJ -/HYPH talk/NN detection/NN ,/, and/CC noise/NN suppression/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT novel/JJ adaptive/JJ quasi-binary/JJ mask/NN that/WDT is/VBZ well/RB suited/JJ for/IN speech/NN recognition/NN ./.
The/DT optimization/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN is/VBZ then/RB formulated/VBN as/IN a/DT large/JJ scale/NN nonlinear/JJ programming/NN problem/NN where/WRB the/DT recognition/NN rate/NN is/VBZ maximized/VBN and/CC the/DT optimal/JJ values/NNS for/IN the/DT system/NN parameters/NNS are/VBP found/VBN through/IN a/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN ./.
We/PRP validate/VBP our/PRP$ methodology/NN by/IN testing/VBG over/IN the/DT TIMIT/NNP database/NN for/IN different/JJ music/NN playback/NN levels/NNS and/CC noise/NN types/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ front/NN -/HYPH end/NN allows/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ interaction/NN with/IN the/DT device/NN for/IN limited/JJ -/HYPH vocabulary/NN voice/NN commands/NNS ./.
