In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP follow/VBP our/PRP$ previous/JJ research/NN in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN Computerized/JJ Adaptive/JJ Testing/NN (/-LRB- CAT/NN )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP present/VBP three/CD different/JJ methods/NNS for/IN CAT/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN them/PRP ,/, the/DT item/NN response/NN theory/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT well/RB established/JJ method/NN ,/, while/IN the/DT other/JJ two/CD ,/, Bayesian/JJ and/CC neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, are/VBP new/JJ in/IN the/DT area/NN of/IN educational/JJ testing/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT first/JJ part/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP the/DT concept/NN of/IN CAT/NN and/CC its/PRP$ advantages/NNS and/CC disadvantages/NNS ./.
We/PRP collected/VBD data/NNS from/IN paper/NN tests/NNS performed/VBN with/IN grammar/NN school/NN students/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP the/DT summary/NN of/IN data/NNS used/VBN for/IN our/PRP$ experiments/NNS in/IN the/DT second/JJ part/NN ./.
Next/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP three/CD different/JJ model/NN types/NNS for/IN CAT/NN ./.
They/PRP are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT item/NN response/NN theory/NN ,/, Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ,/, and/CC neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
The/DT general/JJ theory/NN associated/VBN with/IN each/DT type/NN is/VBZ briefly/RB explained/VBN and/CC the/DT utilization/NN of/IN these/DT models/NNS for/IN CAT/NN is/VBZ analyzed/VBN ./.
