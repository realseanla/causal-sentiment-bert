Sequential/JJ decision/NN tasks/NNS with/IN incomplete/JJ information/NN are/VBP characterized/VBN by/IN the/DT exploration/NN problem/NN ;/: namely/RB the/DT trade/NN -/HYPH off/NN between/IN further/JJ exploration/NN for/IN learning/VBG more/JJR about/IN the/DT environment/NN and/CC immediate/JJ exploitation/NN of/IN the/DT accrued/VBN information/NN for/IN decision/NN -/HYPH making/NN ./.
