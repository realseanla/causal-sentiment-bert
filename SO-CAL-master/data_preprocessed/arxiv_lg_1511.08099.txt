Artificially/RB intelligent/JJ agents/NNS equipped/VBN with/IN strategic/JJ skills/NNS that/WDT can/MD negotiate/VB during/IN their/PRP$ interactions/NNS with/IN other/JJ natural/JJ or/CC artificial/JJ agents/NNS are/VBP still/RB underdeveloped/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ a/DT successful/JJ application/NN of/IN Deep/JJ Reinforcement/NN Learning/NN (/-LRB- DRL/NN )/-RRB- for/IN training/NN intelligent/JJ agents/NNS with/IN strategic/JJ conversational/JJ skills/NNS ,/, in/IN a/DT situated/VBN dialogue/NN setting/NN ./.
Previous/JJ studies/NNS have/VBP modelled/VBN the/DT behaviour/NN of/IN strategic/JJ agents/NNS using/VBG supervised/JJ learning/NN and/CC traditional/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG techniques/NNS ,/, the/DT latter/JJ using/VBG tabular/JJ representations/NNS or/CC learning/VBG with/IN linear/JJ function/NN approximation/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT study/NN ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP DRL/NN with/IN a/DT high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ state/NN space/NN to/IN the/DT strategic/JJ board/NN game/NN of/IN Settlers/NNS of/IN Catan/NNP ---/, where/WRB players/NNS can/MD offer/VB resources/NNS in/IN exchange/NN for/IN others/NNS and/CC they/PRP can/MD also/RB reply/VB to/IN offers/NNS made/VBN by/IN other/JJ players/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ results/NNS report/VBP that/IN the/DT DRL/NNP -/HYPH based/VBN learnt/VBN policies/NNS significantly/RB outperformed/VBD several/JJ baselines/NNS including/VBG random/JJ ,/, rule/NN -/HYPH based/VBN ,/, and/CC supervised/JJ -/HYPH based/VBN behaviours/NNS ./.
The/DT DRL/NNP -/HYPH based/VBN policy/NN has/VBZ a/DT 53/CD percent/NN win/NN rate/NN versus/CC 3/CD automated/VBN players/NNS (/-LRB- `/`` bots/NNS '/'' )/-RRB- ,/, whereas/IN a/DT supervised/JJ player/NN trained/VBN on/IN a/DT dialogue/NN corpus/NN in/IN this/DT setting/NN achieved/VBD only/RB 27/CD percent/NN ,/, versus/CC the/DT same/JJ 3/CD bots/NNS ./.
