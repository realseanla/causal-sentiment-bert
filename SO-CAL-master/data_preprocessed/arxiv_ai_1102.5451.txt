In/IN our/PRP$ recent/JJ paper/NN we/PRP have/VBP established/VBN close/JJ relationships/NNS between/IN state/NN reduction/NN of/IN a/DT fuzzy/JJ recognizer/NN and/CC resolution/NN of/IN a/DT particular/JJ system/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ relation/NN equations/NNS ./.
In/IN that/DT paper/NN we/PRP have/VBP also/RB studied/VBN reductions/NNS by/IN means/NNS of/IN those/DT solutions/NNS which/WDT are/VBP fuzzy/JJ equivalences/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP will/MD see/VB that/IN in/IN some/DT cases/NNS better/JJR reductions/NNS can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN using/VBG the/DT solutions/NNS of/IN this/DT system/NN that/WDT are/VBP fuzzy/JJ quasi-orders/NNS ./.
Generally/RB ,/, fuzzy/JJ quasi-orders/NNS and/CC fuzzy/JJ equivalences/NNS are/VBP equally/RB good/JJ in/IN the/DT state/NN reduction/NN ,/, but/CC we/PRP show/VBP that/IN right/JJ and/CC left/JJ invariant/JJ fuzzy/JJ quasi-orders/NNS give/VBP better/JJR reductions/NNS than/IN right/JJ and/CC left/JJ invariant/JJ fuzzy/JJ equivalences/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB show/VBP that/IN alternate/JJ reductions/NNS by/IN means/NNS of/IN fuzzy/JJ quasi-orders/NNS give/VBP better/JJR results/NNS than/IN alternate/JJ reductions/NNS by/IN means/NNS of/IN fuzzy/JJ equivalences/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB we/PRP study/VBP a/DT more/RBR general/JJ type/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ quasi-orders/NNS ,/, weakly/RB right/RB and/CC left/VBD invariant/JJ ones/NNS ,/, and/CC we/PRP show/VBP that/IN they/PRP are/VBP closely/RB related/VBN to/IN determinization/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ recognizers/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB demonstrate/VBP some/DT applications/NNS of/IN weakly/RB left/VBN invariant/JJ fuzzy/JJ quasi-orders/NNS in/IN conflict/NN analysis/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ discrete/JJ event/NN systems/NNS ./.
