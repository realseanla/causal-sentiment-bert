The/DT standard/JJ coherence/NN criterion/NN for/IN lower/JJR previsions/NNS is/VBZ expressed/VBN using/VBG an/DT infinite/JJ number/NN of/IN linear/JJ constraints/NNS ./.
For/IN lower/JJR previsions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP essentially/RB defined/VBN on/IN some/DT finite/JJ set/NN of/IN gambles/NNS on/IN a/DT finite/JJ possibility/NN space/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT reformulation/NN of/IN this/DT criterion/NN that/WDT only/RB uses/VBZ a/DT finite/JJ number/NN of/IN constraints/NNS ./.
Any/DT such/JJ lower/JJR prevision/NN is/VBZ coherent/JJ if/IN it/PRP lies/VBZ within/IN the/DT convex/NN polytope/NN defined/VBN by/IN these/DT constraints/NNS ./.
The/DT vertices/NNS of/IN this/DT polytope/NN are/VBP the/DT extreme/JJ coherent/JJ lower/JJR previsions/NNS for/IN the/DT given/VBN set/NN of/IN gambles/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ reformulation/NN makes/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO compute/VB them/PRP ./.
We/PRP show/VBP how/WRB this/DT is/VBZ done/VBN and/CC illustrate/VB the/DT procedure/NN and/CC its/PRP$ results/NNS ./.
