In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP study/VBP the/DT application/NN of/IN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS for/IN jointly/RB detecting/VBG objects/NNS depicted/VBN in/IN still/RB images/NNS and/CC estimating/VBG their/PRP$ 3D/NN pose/NN ./.
We/PRP identify/VBP different/JJ feature/NN representations/NNS of/IN oriented/VBN objects/NNS ,/, and/CC energies/NNS that/WDT lead/VBP a/DT network/NN to/TO learn/VB this/DT representations/NNS ./.
The/DT choice/NN of/IN the/DT representation/NN is/VBZ crucial/JJ since/IN the/DT pose/NN of/IN an/DT object/NN has/VBZ a/DT natural/JJ ,/, continuous/JJ structure/NN while/IN its/PRP$ category/NN is/VBZ a/DT discrete/JJ variable/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT different/JJ approaches/NNS on/IN the/DT joint/JJ object/NN detection/NN and/CC pose/VBP estimation/NN task/NN of/IN the/DT Pascal3D/NN benchmark/NN using/VBG Average/JJ Viewpoint/NN Precision/NNP ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN a/DT classification/NN approach/NN on/IN discretized/JJ viewpoints/NNS achieves/VBZ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN performance/NN for/IN joint/JJ object/NN detection/NN and/CC pose/VBP estimation/NN ,/, and/CC significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ existing/VBG baselines/NNS on/IN this/DT benchmark/NN ./.
