Load/NN disaggregation/NN based/VBN on/IN aided/VBN linear/JJ integer/NN programming/NN (/-LRB- ALIP/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
We/PRP start/VBP with/IN a/DT conventional/JJ linear/JJ integer/NN programming/NN (/-LRB- IP/NN )/-RRB- based/VBN disaggregation/NN and/CC enhance/VB it/PRP in/IN several/JJ ways/NNS ./.
The/DT enhancements/NNS include/VBP additional/JJ constraints/NNS ,/, correction/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT state/NN diagram/NN ,/, median/JJ filtering/NN ,/, and/CC linear/JJ programming/NN -/HYPH based/VBN refinement/NN ./.
With/IN the/DT aid/NN of/IN these/DT enhancements/NNS ,/, the/DT performance/NN of/IN IP/RB -/HYPH based/VBN disaggregation/NN is/VBZ significantly/RB improved/VBN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN ALIP/NN system/NN relies/VBZ only/RB on/IN the/DT instantaneous/JJ load/NN samples/NNS instead/RB of/IN waveform/NN signatures/NNS ,/, and/CC hence/RB does/VBZ not/RB crucially/RB depend/VB on/IN high/JJ sampling/NN frequency/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN ALIP/NN system/NN performs/VBZ better/JJR than/IN the/DT conventional/JJ IP/NN -/HYPH based/VBN load/NN disaggregation/NN system/NN ./.
