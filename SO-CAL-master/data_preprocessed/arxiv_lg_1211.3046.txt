In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN how/WRB to/TO recover/VB the/DT optimal/JJ solution/NN to/IN the/DT optimization/NN problem/NN related/VBN to/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ data/NNS classification/NN using/VBG random/JJ projection/NN ,/, to/TO which/WDT we/PRP refer/VBP as/IN Recovery/NN of/IN Optimal/JJ Solution/NN ./.
