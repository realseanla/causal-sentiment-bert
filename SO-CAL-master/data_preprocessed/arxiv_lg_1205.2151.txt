We/PRP present/VBP a/DT converged/VBN algorithm/NN for/IN Tikhonov/NNP regularized/VBN nonnegative/JJ matrix/NN factorization/NN (/-LRB- NMF/NN )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP specially/RB choose/VB this/DT regularization/NN because/IN it/PRP is/VBZ known/VBN that/IN Tikhonov/NNP regularized/VBD least/JJS square/JJ (/-LRB- LS/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ the/DT more/RBR preferable/JJ form/NN in/IN solving/VBG linear/JJ inverse/NN problems/NNS than/IN the/DT conventional/JJ LS/NN ./.
Because/IN an/DT NMF/NN problem/NN can/MD be/VB decomposed/VBN into/IN LS/NNP subproblems/NNS ,/, it/PRP can/MD be/VB expected/VBN that/IN Tikhonov/NNP regularized/VBN NMF/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT more/RBR appropriate/JJ approach/NN in/IN solving/VBG NMF/NN problems/NNS ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN using/VBG additive/JJ update/NN rules/NNS which/WDT have/VBP been/VBN shown/VBN to/TO have/VB convergence/NN guarantee/NN ./.
We/PRP equip/VBP the/DT algorithm/NN with/IN a/DT mechanism/NN to/TO automatically/RB determine/VB the/DT regularization/NN parameters/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT L/NN -/HYPH curve/NN ,/, a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN concept/NN in/IN the/DT inverse/JJ problems/NNS community/NN ,/, but/CC is/VBZ rather/RB unknown/JJ in/IN the/DT NMF/NN research/NN ./.
The/DT introduction/NN of/IN this/DT algorithm/NN thus/RB solves/VBZ two/CD inherent/JJ problems/NNS in/IN Tikhonov/NNP regularized/VBN NMF/NN algorithm/NN research/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, convergence/NN guarantee/NN and/CC regularization/NN parameters/NNS determination/NN ./.
