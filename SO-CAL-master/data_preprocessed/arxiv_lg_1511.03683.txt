We/PRP present/VBP a/DT character/NN -/HYPH level/NN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN that/WDT generates/VBZ relevant/JJ and/CC coherent/JJ text/NN given/VBN auxiliary/JJ information/NN such/JJ as/IN a/DT sentiment/NN or/CC topic/NN ./.
Using/VBG a/DT simple/JJ input/NN replication/NN strategy/NN ,/, we/PRP preserve/VBP the/DT signal/NN of/IN auxiliary/JJ input/NN across/IN wider/JJR sequence/NN intervals/NNS than/IN can/MD feasibly/RB be/VB trained/VBN by/IN back/RB -/HYPH propagation/NN through/IN time/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ main/JJ results/NNS center/NN on/IN a/DT large/JJ corpus/NN of/IN 1.5/CD million/CD beer/NN reviews/NNS from/IN BeerAdvocate/NNP ./.
In/IN generative/JJ mode/NN ,/, our/PRP$ network/NN produces/VBZ reviews/NNS on/IN command/NN ,/, tailored/VBN to/IN a/DT star/NN rating/NN or/CC item/NN category/NN ./.
The/DT generative/JJ model/NN can/MD also/RB run/VB in/IN reverse/JJ ,/, performing/VBG classification/NN with/IN surprising/JJ accuracy/NN ./.
Performance/NN of/IN the/DT reverse/JJ model/NN provides/VBZ a/DT straightforward/JJ way/NN to/TO determine/VB what/WP the/DT generative/JJ model/NN knows/VBZ without/IN relying/VBG too/RB heavily/RB on/IN subjective/JJ analysis/NN ./.
Given/VBN a/DT review/NN ,/, the/DT model/NN can/MD accurately/RB determine/VB the/DT corresponding/VBG rating/NN and/CC infer/VBP the/DT beer/NN 's/POS category/NN (/-LRB- IPA/NN ,/, Stout/NNP ,/, etc./FW )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP exploit/VBP this/DT capability/NN ,/, tracking/VBG perceived/VBN sentiment/NN and/CC class/NN membership/NN as/IN each/DT character/NN in/IN a/DT review/NN is/VBZ processed/VBN ./.
Quantitative/JJ and/CC qualitative/JJ empirical/JJ evaluations/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT model/NN captures/VBZ meaning/VBG and/CC learns/VBZ nonlinear/JJ dynamics/NNS in/IN text/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT effect/NN of/IN negation/NN on/IN sentiment/NN ,/, despite/IN possessing/VBG no/DT a/FW priori/FW notion/NN of/IN words/NNS ./.
Because/IN the/DT model/NN operates/VBZ at/IN the/DT character/NN level/NN ,/, it/PRP handles/VBZ misspellings/NNS ,/, slang/NN ,/, and/CC large/JJ vocabularies/NNS without/IN any/DT machinery/NN explicitly/RB dedicated/VBN to/IN the/DT purpose/NN ./.
