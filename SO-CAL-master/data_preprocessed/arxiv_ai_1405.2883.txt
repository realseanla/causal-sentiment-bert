When/WRB autonomous/JJ agents/NNS are/VBP executing/VBG in/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN ,/, the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT objectives/NNS of/IN the/DT agent/NN may/MD change/VB from/IN the/DT agent/NN 's/POS original/JJ model/NN ./.
In/IN such/JJ cases/NNS ,/, the/DT agent/NN 's/POS planning/NN process/NN must/MD modify/VB the/DT plan/NN under/IN execution/NN to/TO make/VB it/PRP amenable/JJ to/IN the/DT new/JJ conditions/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO resume/VB execution/NN ./.
This/DT brings/VBZ up/RP the/DT replanning/NN problem/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT various/JJ techniques/NNS that/WDT have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO solve/VB it/PRP ./.
In/IN all/DT ,/, three/CD main/JJ techniques/NNS --/: based/VBN on/IN three/CD different/JJ metrics/NNS --/: have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN in/IN prior/JJ automated/VBN planning/NN work/NN ./.
An/DT open/JJ question/NN is/VBZ whether/IN these/DT metrics/NNS are/VBP interchangeable/JJ ;/: answering/VBG this/DT requires/VBZ a/DT normalized/VBN comparison/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ replanning/VBG quality/NN metrics/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO support/VB such/PDT a/DT comparison/NN by/IN compiling/VBG all/PDT the/DT respective/JJ techniques/NNS into/IN a/DT single/JJ substrate/NN ./.
Using/VBG this/DT novel/JJ compilation/NN ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN these/DT different/JJ metrics/NNS are/VBP not/RB interchangeable/JJ ,/, and/CC that/IN they/PRP are/VBP not/RB good/JJ surrogates/NNS for/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
Thus/RB we/PRP focus/VBP attention/NN on/IN the/DT incompatibility/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ replanning/NN flavors/NNS with/IN each/DT other/JJ ,/, founded/VBN in/IN the/DT differences/NNS between/IN the/DT metrics/NNS that/WDT they/PRP respectively/RB seek/VBP to/TO optimize/VB ./.
