It/PRP provides/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ mathematical/JJ model/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ deep/JJ network/NN learning/NN ./.
It/PRP implements/VBZ non-linear/JJ contractions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP optimized/VBN for/IN classification/NN ,/, with/IN an/DT unsupervised/JJ pair/NN matching/VBG algorithm/NN ,/, of/IN polynomial/JJ complexity/NN ./.
A/DT structured/JJ Haar/NNP scattering/VBG over/IN graph/NN data/NNS computes/VBZ permutation/NN invariant/JJ representations/NNS of/IN groups/NNS of/IN connected/JJ points/NNS in/IN the/DT graph/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT graph/NN connectivity/NN is/VBZ unknown/JJ ,/, unsupervised/JJ Haar/NNP pair/NN learning/NN can/MD provide/VB a/DT consistent/JJ estimation/NN of/IN connected/JJ dyadic/JJ groups/NNS of/IN points/NNS ./.
