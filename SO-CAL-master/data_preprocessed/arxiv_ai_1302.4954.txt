This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT probabilistic/JJ model/NN for/IN reasoning/NN about/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN a/DT system/NN as/IN it/PRP changes/VBZ over/IN time/NN ,/, both/CC due/IN to/IN exogenous/JJ and/CC endogenous/JJ influences/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ target/NN domain/NN is/VBZ a/DT class/NN of/IN medical/JJ prediction/NN problems/NNS that/WDT are/VBP neither/RB so/RB urgent/JJ as/IN to/TO preclude/VB careful/JJ diagnosis/NN nor/CC progress/NN so/RB slowly/RB as/IN to/TO allow/VB arbitrary/JJ testing/NN and/CC treatment/NN options/NNS ./.
In/IN these/DT domains/NNS there/RB is/VBZ typically/RB enough/JJ time/NN to/TO gather/VB information/NN about/IN the/DT patient/NN 's/POS state/NN and/CC consider/VB alternative/JJ diagnoses/NNS and/CC treatments/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT temporal/JJ interaction/NN between/IN the/DT timing/NN of/IN tests/NNS ,/, treatments/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT course/NN of/IN the/DT disease/NN must/MD also/RB be/VB considered/VBN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ to/TO elicit/VB a/DT qualitative/JJ structural/JJ model/NN of/IN the/DT patient/NN from/IN a/DT human/JJ expert/NN ---/, the/DT model/NN identifies/VBZ important/JJ attributes/NNS ,/, the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT exogenous/JJ changes/NNS affect/VBP attribute/NN values/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT way/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT patient/NN 's/POS condition/NN changes/NNS endogenously/RB ./.
We/PRP then/RB elicit/VBP probabilistic/JJ information/NN to/TO capture/VB the/DT expert/NN 's/POS uncertainty/NN about/IN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN tests/NNS and/CC treatments/NNS and/CC the/DT nature/NN and/CC timing/NN of/IN endogenous/JJ state/NN changes/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ the/DT model/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN a/DT problem/NN in/IN treating/VBG vehicle/NN accident/NN trauma/NN ,/, and/CC suggests/VBZ a/DT method/NN for/IN solving/VBG the/DT model/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT technique/NN of/IN sequential/JJ imputation/NN ./.
