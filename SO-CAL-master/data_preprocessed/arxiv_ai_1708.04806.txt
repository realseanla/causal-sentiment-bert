This/DT paper/NN continues/VBZ the/DT research/NN that/WDT considers/VBZ a/DT new/JJ cognitive/JJ model/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, it/PRP considers/VBZ the/DT neural/JJ binding/NN structure/NN of/IN an/DT earlier/JJR paper/NN ./.
To/TO help/VB with/IN this/DT ,/, the/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ some/DT new/JJ methods/NNS in/IN the/DT areas/NNS of/IN image/NN processing/NN and/CC high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN behaviour/NN simulation/NN ./.
The/DT work/NN is/VBZ all/DT based/VBN on/IN earlier/JJR research/NN by/IN the/DT author/NN and/CC the/DT new/JJ additions/NNS are/VBP intended/VBN to/TO fit/VB in/RP with/IN the/DT overall/JJ design/NN ./.
For/IN image/NN processing/NN ,/, a/DT grid/NN -/HYPH like/JJ structure/NN is/VBZ used/VBN with/IN '/`` full/JJ linking/VBG '/'' ./.
Each/DT cell/NN in/IN the/DT classifier/NN grid/NN stores/NNS a/DT list/NN of/IN all/DT other/JJ cells/NNS it/PRP gets/VBZ associated/VBN with/IN and/CC this/DT is/VBZ used/VBN as/IN the/DT learned/VBN image/NN that/WDT new/JJ input/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN to/IN ./.
For/IN the/DT behaviour/NN metric/JJ ,/, a/DT new/JJ prediction/NN equation/NN is/VBZ suggested/VBN ,/, as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT simulation/NN ,/, that/DT uses/VBZ feedback/NN and/CC history/NN to/IN dynamically/RB determine/VB its/PRP$ course/NN of/IN action/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT new/JJ methods/NNS are/VBP from/IN widely/RB different/JJ topics/NNS ,/, both/CC can/MD be/VB compared/VBN with/IN the/DT binary/JJ -/HYPH analog/NN type/NN of/IN interface/NN that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT main/JJ focus/NN of/IN the/DT paper/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ suggested/VBN that/IN the/DT simplest/JJS of/IN linking/VBG between/IN a/DT tree/NN and/CC ensemble/NN can/MD explain/VB neural/JJ binding/NN and/CC variable/JJ signal/NN strengths/NNS ./.
