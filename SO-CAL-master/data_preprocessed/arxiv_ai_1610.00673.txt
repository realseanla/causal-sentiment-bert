In/IN principle/NN ,/, reinforcement/NN learning/NN and/CC policy/NN search/NN methods/NNS can/MD enable/VB robots/NNS to/TO learn/VB highly/RB complex/JJ and/CC general/JJ skills/NNS that/WDT may/MD allow/VB them/PRP to/TO function/VB amid/IN the/DT complexity/NN and/CC diversity/NN of/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN ./.
