In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN extending/VBG binary/JJ qualitative/JJ direction/NN calculi/NN with/IN adjustable/JJ granularity/NN like/IN OPRAm/NNP or/CC the/DT star/NN calculus/NN with/IN a/DT granular/JJ distance/NN concept/NN ./.
This/DT method/NN is/VBZ similar/JJ to/IN the/DT concept/NN of/IN extending/VBG points/NNS with/IN an/DT internal/JJ reference/NN direction/NN to/TO get/VB oriented/VBN points/NNS which/WDT are/VBP the/DT basic/JJ entities/NNS in/IN the/DT OPRAm/NNP calculus/NN ./.
Even/RB if/IN the/DT spatial/JJ objects/NNS are/VBP from/IN a/DT geometrical/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN infinitesimal/JJ small/JJ points/NNS locally/RB available/JJ reference/NN measures/NNS are/VBP attached/VBN ./.
In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN OPRAm/NNP ,/, a/DT reference/NN direction/NN is/VBZ attached/VBN ./.
The/DT same/JJ principle/NN works/NNS also/RB with/IN local/JJ reference/NN distances/NNS which/WDT are/VBP called/VBN elevations/NNS ./.
The/DT principle/NN of/IN attaching/VBG references/NNS features/VBZ to/IN a/DT point/NN is/VBZ called/VBN hidden/JJ feature/NN attachment/NN ./.
