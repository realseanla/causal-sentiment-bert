Typical/JJ approaches/NNS to/TO plan/VB recognition/NN start/VB from/IN a/DT representation/NN of/IN an/DT agent/NN 's/POS possible/JJ plans/NNS ,/, and/CC reason/NN evidentially/RB from/IN observations/NNS of/IN the/DT agent/NN 's/POS actions/NNS to/TO assess/VB the/DT plausibility/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ candidates/NNS ./.
A/DT more/JJR expansive/JJ view/NN of/IN the/DT task/NN (/-LRB- consistent/JJ with/IN some/DT prior/JJ work/NN )/-RRB- accounts/VBZ for/IN the/DT context/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT plan/NN was/VBD generated/VBN ,/, the/DT mental/JJ state/NN and/CC planning/NN process/NN of/IN the/DT agent/NN ,/, and/CC consequences/NNS of/IN the/DT agent/NN 's/POS actions/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
