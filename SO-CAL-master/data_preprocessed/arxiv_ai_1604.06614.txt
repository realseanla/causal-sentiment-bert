One/CD of/IN the/DT better/JJR studied/VBN properties/NNS for/IN operators/NNS in/IN judgment/NN aggregation/NN is/VBZ independence/NN ,/, which/WDT essentially/RB dictates/VBZ that/IN the/DT collective/JJ judgment/NN on/IN one/CD issue/NN should/MD not/RB depend/VB on/IN the/DT individual/JJ judgments/NNS given/VBN on/IN some/DT other/JJ issue/NN (/-LRB- s/AFX )/-RRB- in/IN the/DT same/JJ agenda/NN ./.
Independence/NN ,/, although/IN considered/VBN a/DT desirable/JJ property/NN ,/, is/VBZ too/RB strong/JJ ,/, because/IN together/RB with/IN mild/JJ additional/JJ conditions/NNS it/PRP implies/VBZ dictatorship/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP here/RB a/DT weakening/NN of/IN independence/NN ,/, named/VBN agenda/NN separability/NN :/: a/DT judgment/NN aggregation/NN rule/NN satisfies/VBZ it/PRP if/IN ,/, whenever/WRB the/DT agenda/NN is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN several/JJ independent/JJ sub-agendas/NNS ,/, the/DT resulting/VBG collective/JJ judgment/NN sets/NNS can/MD be/VB computed/VBN separately/RB for/IN each/DT sub-agenda/NN and/CC then/RB put/VBN together/RB ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN this/DT property/NN is/VBZ discriminant/JJ ,/, in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/WDT among/IN judgment/NN aggregation/NN rules/NNS so/RB far/RB studied/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN ,/, some/DT satisfy/VBP it/PRP and/CC some/DT do/VBP not/RB ./.
