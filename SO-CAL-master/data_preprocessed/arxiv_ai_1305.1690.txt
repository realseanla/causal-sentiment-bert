Constraint/NN Programming/NN (/-LRB- CP/NN )/-RRB- solvers/NNS typically/RB tackle/VBP optimization/NN problems/NNS by/IN repeatedly/RB finding/VBG solutions/NNS to/IN a/DT problem/NN while/IN placing/VBG tighter/JJR and/CC tighter/JJR bounds/NNS on/IN the/DT solution/NN cost/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN is/VBZ somewhat/RB naive/JJ ,/, especially/RB for/IN soft/JJ -/HYPH constraint/NN optimization/NN problems/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT soft/JJ constraints/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB satisfied/JJ ./.
Unsatisfiable/JJ -/HYPH core/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN solving/VBG soft/JJ constraint/NN problems/NNS in/IN Boolean/NNP Satisfiability/NNP (/-LRB- e.g./FW MAXSAT/NN )/-RRB- force/NN all/DT soft/JJ constraints/NNS to/TO hold/VB initially/RB ./.
When/WRB solving/VBG fails/VBZ they/PRP return/VBP an/DT unsatisfiable/JJ core/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN soft/JJ constraints/NNS that/WDT can/MD not/RB hold/VB simultaneously/RB ./.
Using/VBG this/DT information/NN the/DT problem/NN is/VBZ relaxed/JJ to/TO allow/VB certain/JJ soft/JJ constraint/NN (/-LRB- s/AFX )/-RRB- to/TO be/VB violated/VBN and/CC solving/VBG continues/VBZ ./.
Since/IN Lazy/NNP Clause/NN Generation/NN (/-LRB- LCG/NN )/-RRB- solvers/NNS can/MD also/RB return/VB unsatisfiable/JJ cores/NNS we/PRP can/MD adapt/VB the/DT MAXSAT/NNP unsatisfiable/JJ core/NN approach/NN to/IN CP/NN ./.
We/PRP implement/VBP the/DT original/JJ MAXSAT/NNP unsatisfiable/JJ core/NN solving/VBG algorithms/NNS WPM1/NN ,/, MSU3/NN in/IN a/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN LCG/NN solver/NN and/CC show/VBP that/IN there/EX exist/VBP problems/NNS which/WDT benefit/VBP from/IN this/DT hybrid/NN approach/NN ./.
