With/IN the/DT increase/NN of/IN information/NN ,/, document/NN classification/NN as/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT methods/NNS of/IN text/NN mining/NN ,/, plays/VBZ vital/JJ role/NN in/IN many/JJ management/NN and/CC organizing/VBG information/NN ./.
Document/NN classification/NN is/VBZ the/DT process/NN of/IN assigning/VBG a/DT document/NN to/IN one/CD or/CC more/JJR predefined/JJ category/NN labels/NNS ./.
Document/NN classification/NN includes/VBZ different/JJ parts/NNS such/JJ as/IN text/NN processing/NN ,/, term/NN selection/NN ,/, term/NN weighting/NN and/CC final/JJ classification/NN ./.
The/DT accuracy/NN of/IN document/NN classification/NN is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ ./.
Thus/RB improvement/NN in/IN each/DT part/NN of/IN classification/NN should/MD lead/VB to/IN better/JJR results/NNS and/CC higher/JJR precision/NN ./.
Term/NN weighting/NN has/VBZ a/DT great/JJ impact/NN on/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT classification/NN ./.
Most/JJS of/IN the/DT existing/VBG weighting/NN methods/NNS exploit/VBP the/DT statistical/JJ information/NN of/IN terms/NNS in/IN documents/NNS and/CC do/VBP not/RB consider/VB semantic/JJ relations/NNS between/IN words/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, an/DT automated/VBN document/NN classification/NN system/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN that/IN uses/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ term/NN weighting/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN semantic/JJ relations/NNS between/IN terms/NNS ./.
To/TO evaluate/VB the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN ,/, three/CD standard/JJ Persian/JJ corpuses/NNS are/VBP used/VBN ./.
