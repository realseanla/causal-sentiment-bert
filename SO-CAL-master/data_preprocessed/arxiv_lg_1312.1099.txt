Nonparametric/JJ estimation/NN of/IN the/DT conditional/JJ distribution/NN of/IN a/DT response/NN given/VBN high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ features/NNS is/VBZ a/DT challenging/JJ problem/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ important/JJ to/TO allow/VB not/RB only/RB the/DT mean/NN but/CC also/RB the/DT variance/NN and/CC shape/NN of/IN the/DT response/NN density/NN to/TO change/VB flexibly/RB with/IN features/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP massive/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT multiscale/JJ dictionary/NN learning/NN model/NN ,/, which/WDT expresses/VBZ the/DT conditional/JJ response/NN density/NN as/IN a/DT convex/NN combination/NN of/IN dictionary/JJ densities/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT densities/NNS used/VBN and/CC their/PRP$ weights/NNS dependent/JJ on/IN the/DT path/NN through/IN a/DT tree/NN decomposition/NN of/IN the/DT feature/NN space/NN ./.
A/DT fast/JJ graph/NN partitioning/VBG algorithm/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/TO obtain/VB the/DT tree/NN decomposition/NN ,/, with/IN Bayesian/JJ methods/NNS then/RB used/VBD to/TO adaptively/RB prune/VB and/CC average/JJ over/IN different/JJ sub-trees/NNS in/IN a/DT soft/JJ probabilistic/JJ manner/NN ./.
