Feature/NN subset/NN selection/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT special/JJ case/NN of/IN the/DT general/JJ subset/NN selection/NN problem/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN the/DT topic/NN of/IN a/DT considerable/JJ number/NN of/IN studies/NNS due/IN to/IN the/DT growing/VBG importance/NN of/IN data/NN -/HYPH mining/NN applications/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT feature/NN subset/NN selection/NN problem/NN there/EX are/VBP two/CD main/JJ issues/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB addressed/VBN :/: (/-LRB- i/LS )/-RRB- Finding/VBG an/DT appropriate/JJ measure/NN function/NN than/IN can/MD be/VB fairly/RB fast/JJ and/CC robustly/RB computed/VBN for/IN high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ data/NNS ./.
(/-LRB- ii/LS )/-RRB- A/DT search/NN strategy/NN to/TO optimize/VB the/DT measure/NN over/IN the/DT subset/NN space/NN in/IN a/DT reasonable/JJ amount/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT article/NN mutual/JJ information/NN between/IN features/NNS and/CC class/NN labels/NNS is/VBZ considered/VBN to/TO be/VB the/DT measure/NN function/NN ./.
Two/CD series/NN expansions/NNS for/IN mutual/JJ information/NN are/VBP proposed/VBN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN most/JJS heuristic/NN criteria/NNS suggested/VBD in/IN the/DT literature/NN are/VBP truncated/VBN approximations/NNS of/IN these/DT expansions/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN that/IN searching/VBG the/DT whole/JJ subset/NN space/NN is/VBZ an/DT NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ problem/NN ./.
Here/RB ,/, instead/RB of/IN the/DT conventional/JJ sequential/JJ search/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, we/PRP suggest/VBP a/DT parallel/JJ search/NN strategy/NN based/VBN on/IN semidefinite/JJ programming/NN (/-LRB- SDP/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT can/MD search/VB through/IN the/DT subset/NN space/NN in/IN polynomial/JJ time/NN ./.
By/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT similarities/NNS between/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN and/CC an/DT instance/NN of/IN the/DT maximum/NN -/HYPH cut/NN problem/NN in/IN graph/NN theory/NN ,/, the/DT approximation/NN ratio/NN of/IN this/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN and/CC is/VBZ compared/VBN with/IN the/DT approximation/NN ratio/NN of/IN the/DT backward/JJ elimination/NN method/NN ./.
The/DT experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB misleading/VBG to/TO judge/VB the/DT quality/NN of/IN a/DT measure/NN solely/RB based/VBN on/IN the/DT classification/NN accuracy/NN ,/, without/IN taking/VBG the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT non-optimum/JJ search/NN strategy/NN into/IN account/NN ./.
