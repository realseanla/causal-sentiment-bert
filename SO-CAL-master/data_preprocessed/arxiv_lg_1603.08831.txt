In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP our/PRP$ study/NN on/IN a/DT recent/JJ and/CC effective/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, sparse/JJ filtering/NN ./.
The/DT aim/NN of/IN this/DT research/NN is/VBZ not/RB to/TO show/VB whether/IN or/CC how/WRB well/RB sparse/JJ filtering/NN works/NNS ,/, but/CC to/TO understand/VB why/WRB and/CC when/WRB sparse/JJ filtering/NN does/VBZ work/VB ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP a/DT thorough/JJ study/NN of/IN this/DT algorithm/NN through/IN a/DT conceptual/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN feature/NN distribution/NN learning/NN ,/, a/DT theoretical/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT properties/NNS of/IN sparse/JJ filtering/NN ,/, and/CC an/DT experimental/JJ validation/NN of/IN our/PRP$ conclusions/NNS ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN sparse/JJ filtering/NN works/NNS by/IN explicitly/RB maximizing/VBG the/DT informativeness/NN of/IN the/DT learned/VBN representation/NN through/IN the/DT maximization/NN of/IN the/DT proxy/NN of/IN sparsity/NN ,/, and/CC by/IN implicitly/RB preserving/VBG information/NN conveyed/VBN by/IN the/DT distribution/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ data/NNS through/IN the/DT constraint/NN of/IN structure/NN preservation/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN sparse/JJ filtering/NN preserves/VBZ the/DT cosine/NN neighborhoodness/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
We/PRP validate/VBP our/PRP$ statements/NNS on/IN artificial/JJ and/CC real/JJ data/NNS sets/NNS by/IN applying/VBG our/PRP$ theoretical/JJ understanding/NN to/IN the/DT explanation/NN of/IN the/DT success/NN of/IN sparse/JJ filtering/NN on/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN problems/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ work/NN provides/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ theoretical/JJ framework/NN for/IN understanding/VBG sparse/JJ filtering/NN ,/, it/PRP highlights/VBZ assumptions/NNS and/CC conditions/NNS for/IN success/NN behind/IN the/DT algorithm/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP provides/VBZ a/DT fresh/JJ insight/NN into/IN developing/VBG new/JJ feature/NN distribution/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
