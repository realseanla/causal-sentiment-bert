This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ the/DT Deep/JJ Recurrent/JJ Attentive/JJ Writer/NN (/-LRB- DRAW/VB )/-RRB- neural/JJ network/NN architecture/NN for/IN image/NN generation/NN ./.
DRAW/VB networks/NNS combine/VB a/DT novel/JJ spatial/JJ attention/NN mechanism/NN that/WDT mimics/VBZ the/DT foveation/NN of/IN the/DT human/JJ eye/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT sequential/JJ variational/JJ auto/NN -/HYPH encoding/VBG framework/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ for/IN the/DT iterative/JJ construction/NN of/IN complex/JJ images/NNS ./.
The/DT system/NN substantially/RB improves/VBZ on/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN for/IN generative/JJ models/NNS on/IN MNIST/NNP ,/, and/CC ,/, when/WRB trained/VBN on/IN the/DT Street/NNP View/NNP House/NNP Numbers/NNS dataset/NN ,/, it/PRP generates/VBZ images/NNS that/WDT can/MD not/RB be/VB distinguished/VBN from/IN real/JJ data/NNS with/IN the/DT naked/JJ eye/NN ./.
