The/DT focus/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ the/DT calculation/NN of/IN similarity/NN between/IN two/CD concepts/NNS from/IN an/DT ontology/NN for/IN a/DT Human/NNP -/HYPH Like/NNP Interaction/NNP system/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO facilitate/VB this/DT calculation/NN ,/, a/DT similarity/NN function/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN based/VBN on/IN five/CD dimensions/NNS (/-LRB- sort/RB ,/, compositional/JJ ,/, essential/JJ ,/, restrictive/JJ and/CC descriptive/JJ )/-RRB- constituting/VBG the/DT structure/NN of/IN ontological/JJ knowledge/NN ./.
The/DT paper/NN includes/VBZ a/DT proposal/NN for/IN computing/VBG a/DT similarity/NN function/NN for/IN each/DT dimension/NN of/IN knowledge/NN ./.
Later/RB on/RB ,/, the/DT similarity/NN values/NNS obtained/VBN are/VBP weighted/JJ and/CC aggregated/VBN to/TO obtain/VB a/DT global/JJ similarity/NN measure/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO calculate/VB those/DT weights/NNS associated/VBN to/IN each/DT dimension/NN ,/, four/CD training/NN methods/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN ./.
The/DT training/NN methods/NNS differ/VBP in/IN the/DT element/NN to/TO fit/VB :/: the/DT user/NN ,/, concepts/NNS or/CC pairs/NNS of/IN concepts/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT hybrid/NN approach/NN ./.

The/DT evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT proposal/NN is/VBZ carried/VBN out/RP through/IN the/DT comparison/NN of/IN system/NN responses/NNS with/IN those/DT given/VBN by/IN human/JJ test/NN subjects/NNS ,/, both/CC providing/VBG a/DT measure/NN of/IN the/DT soundness/NN of/IN the/DT procedure/NN and/CC revealing/VBG ways/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT proposal/NN may/MD be/VB improved/VBN ./.
