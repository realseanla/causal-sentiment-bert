A/DT popular/JJ approach/NN to/IN solving/VBG large/JJ probabilistic/JJ systems/NNS relies/VBZ on/IN aggregating/VBG states/NNS based/VBN on/IN a/DT measure/NN of/IN similarity/NN ./.
Many/JJ approaches/NNS in/IN the/DT literature/NN are/VBP heuristic/NN ./.
A/DT number/NN of/IN recent/JJ methods/NNS rely/VBP instead/RB on/IN metrics/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN bisimulation/NN ,/, or/CC behavioral/JJ equivalence/NN between/IN states/NNS (/-LRB- Givan/NNP et/FW al/FW ,/, 2001/CD ,/, 2003/CD ;/: Ferns/NNP et/FW al/FW ,/, 2004/CD )/-RRB- ./.
An/DT integral/JJ component/NN of/IN such/JJ metrics/NNS is/VBZ the/DT Kantorovich/NNP metric/NN between/IN probability/NN distributions/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, while/IN this/DT metric/JJ enables/VBZ many/JJ satisfying/VBG theoretical/JJ properties/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ costly/JJ to/TO compute/VB in/IN practice/NN ./.
