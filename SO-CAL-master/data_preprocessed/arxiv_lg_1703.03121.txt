We/PRP study/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN imitation/NN learning/NN from/IN demonstrations/NNS of/IN multiple/JJ coordinating/VBG agents/NNS ./.
One/CD key/NN challenge/NN in/IN this/DT setting/NN is/VBZ that/IN learning/VBG a/DT good/JJ model/NN of/IN coordination/NN can/MD be/VB difficult/JJ ,/, since/IN coordination/NN is/VBZ often/RB implicit/JJ in/IN the/DT demonstrations/NNS and/CC must/MD be/VB inferred/VBN as/IN a/DT latent/JJ variable/NN ./.
