The/DT tremendous/JJ success/NN of/IN features/NNS learnt/VBN using/VBG the/DT ImageNet/NNP classification/NN task/NN on/IN a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN transfer/NN tasks/NNS begs/VBZ the/DT question/NN :/: what/WP are/VBP the/DT intrinsic/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT ImageNet/NNP dataset/NN that/WDT are/VBP critical/JJ for/IN learning/VBG good/JJ ,/, general/JJ -/HYPH purpose/NN features/NNS ?/.
This/DT work/NN provides/VBZ an/DT empirical/JJ investigation/NN of/IN various/JJ facets/NNS of/IN this/DT question/NN :/: Is/VBZ more/JJR pre-training/JJ data/NNS always/RB better/RBR ?/.
How/WRB does/VBZ feature/NN quality/NN depend/VBP on/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN training/NN examples/NNS per/IN class/NN ?/.
