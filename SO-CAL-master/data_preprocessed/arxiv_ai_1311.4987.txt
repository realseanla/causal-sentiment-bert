Many/JJ optimization/NN tasks/NNS have/VBP to/TO be/VB handled/VBN in/IN noisy/JJ environments/NNS ,/, where/WRB we/PRP can/MD not/RB obtain/VB the/DT exact/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN a/DT solution/NN but/CC only/RB a/DT noisy/JJ one/NN ./.
For/IN noisy/JJ optimization/NN tasks/NNS ,/, evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS (/-LRB- EAs/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT kind/NN of/IN stochastic/JJ metaheuristic/JJ search/NN algorithm/NN ,/, have/VBP been/VBN widely/RB and/CC successfully/RB applied/VBD ./.
Previous/JJ work/NN mainly/RB focuses/VBZ on/IN empirical/JJ studying/VBG and/CC designing/VBG EAs/NNS for/IN noisy/JJ optimization/NN ,/, while/IN ,/, the/DT theoretical/JJ counterpart/NN has/VBZ been/VBN little/JJ investigated/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP a/DT largely/RB ignored/VBN question/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, whether/IN an/DT optimization/NN problem/NN will/MD always/RB become/VB harder/RBR for/IN EAs/NNS in/IN a/DT noisy/JJ environment/NN ./.
We/PRP prove/VBP that/IN the/DT answer/NN is/VBZ negative/JJ ,/, with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT measurement/NN of/IN the/DT expected/VBN running/NN time/NN ./.
The/DT result/NN implies/VBZ that/IN ,/, for/IN optimization/NN tasks/NNS that/WDT have/VBP already/RB been/VBN quite/RB hard/JJ to/TO solve/VB ,/, the/DT noise/NN may/MD not/RB have/VB a/DT negative/JJ effect/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT easier/JJR a/DT task/NN the/DT more/RBR negatively/RB affected/VBN by/IN the/DT noise/NN ./.
On/IN a/DT representative/JJ problem/NN where/WRB the/DT noise/NN has/VBZ a/DT strong/JJ negative/JJ effect/NN ,/, we/PRP examine/VBP two/CD commonly/RB employed/VBN mechanisms/NNS in/IN EAs/NNS dealing/VBG with/IN noise/NN ,/, the/DT re-evaluation/NN and/CC the/DT threshold/NN selection/NN strategies/NNS ./.
The/DT analysis/NN discloses/VBZ that/IN the/DT two/CD strategies/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, both/DT are/VBP not/RB effective/JJ ,/, i.e./FW ,/, they/PRP do/VBP not/RB make/VB the/DT EA/NNP more/RBR noise/NN tolerant/JJ ./.
We/PRP then/RB find/VBP that/IN a/DT small/JJ modification/NN of/IN the/DT threshold/NN selection/NN allows/VBZ it/PRP to/TO be/VB proven/VBN as/IN an/DT effective/JJ strategy/NN for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN the/DT noise/NN in/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.
