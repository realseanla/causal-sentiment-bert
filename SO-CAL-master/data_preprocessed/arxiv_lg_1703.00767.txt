Many/JJ problems/NNS in/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP and/CC Machine/NNP Learning/NNP can/MD be/VB reduced/VBN to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN quantitative/JJ comparison/NN of/IN two/CD entities/NNS ./.
In/IN Deep/JJ Learning/VBG the/DT ubiquitous/JJ architecture/NN used/VBN for/IN this/DT task/NN is/VBZ the/DT Siamese/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN which/WDT maps/VBZ each/DT entity/NN to/IN a/DT representation/NN through/IN a/DT learnable/JJ function/NN and/CC expresses/VBZ similarity/NN through/IN the/DT distances/NNS among/IN the/DT entities/NNS in/IN the/DT representation/NN space/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN such/PDT a/DT static/NN and/CC invariant/JJ mapping/NN is/VBZ both/DT naive/JJ and/CC unnatural/JJ ./.
We/PRP develop/VBP a/DT novel/JJ neural/JJ model/NN called/VBN Attentive/JJ Recurrent/JJ Comparators/NNS (/-LRB- ARCs/NNS )/-RRB- that/WDT dynamically/RB compares/VBZ two/CD entities/NNS and/CC test/VB the/DT model/NN extensively/RB on/IN the/DT Omniglot/NNP dataset/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN similarity/NN learning/NN ,/, our/PRP$ simplistic/JJ model/NN that/WDT does/VBZ not/RB use/VB any/DT convolutions/NNS performs/VBZ on/IN par/NN with/IN Deep/NNP Convolutional/NNP Siamese/JJ Networks/NNS and/CC significantly/RB better/JJR when/WRB convolutional/JJ layers/NNS are/VBP also/RB used/VBN ./.
In/IN the/DT challenging/JJ task/NN of/IN one/CD -/HYPH shot/NN learning/NN on/IN the/DT same/JJ dataset/NN ,/, an/DT ARC/NN based/VBN model/NN achieves/VBZ the/DT first/JJ super-human/JJ performance/NN for/IN a/DT neural/JJ method/NN with/IN an/DT error/NN rate/NN of/IN 1.5/CD \/SYM percent/NN ./.
