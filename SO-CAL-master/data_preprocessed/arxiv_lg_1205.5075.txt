Sparse/JJ feature/NN selection/NN has/VBZ been/VBN demonstrated/VBN to/TO be/VB effective/JJ in/IN handling/VBG high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ data/NNS ./.
While/IN promising/JJ ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT existing/JJ works/NNS use/VBP convex/JJ methods/NNS ,/, which/WDT may/MD be/VB suboptimal/JJ in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN feature/NN selection/NN and/CC parameter/NN estimation/NN ./.
