In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP Deep/JJ Extreme/NNP Feature/NN Extraction/NN (/-LRB- DEFE/NN )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT new/JJ ensemble/NN MVA/NN method/NN for/IN searching/VBG $/$ \/SYM tau/NN ^/SYM {/-LRB- }/-RRB- \/SYM tau/NN ^/SYM {/-LRB- -/HYPH }/-RRB- $/$ channel/NN of/IN Higgs/NNP bosons/NNS in/IN high/JJ energy/NN physics/NN ./.
DEFE/NNP can/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT deep/JJ ensemble/NN learning/NN scheme/NN that/WDT trains/VBZ a/DT strongly/RB diverse/JJ set/NN of/IN neural/JJ feature/NN learners/NNS without/IN explicitly/RB encouraging/VBG diversity/NN and/CC penalizing/VBG correlations/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ achieved/VBN by/IN adopting/VBG an/DT implicit/JJ neural/JJ controller/NN (/-LRB- not/RB involved/VBN in/IN feedforward/NN compuation/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT directly/RB controls/VBZ and/CC distributes/VBZ gradient/NN flows/NNS from/IN higher/JJR level/NN deep/JJ prediction/NN network/NN ./.
Such/JJ model/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ controller/NN results/NNS in/IN that/DT every/DT single/JJ local/JJ feature/NN learned/VBN are/VBP used/VBN in/IN the/DT feature/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH output/NN mapping/NN stage/NN ,/, avoiding/VBG the/DT blind/JJ averaging/NN of/IN features/NNS ./.
DEFE/NNP makes/VBZ the/DT ensembles/NNS '/POS deep/JJ '/'' in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN it/PRP allows/VBZ deep/JJ post-process/NNS of/IN these/DT features/NNS that/WDT tries/VBZ to/TO learn/VB to/IN select/JJ and/CC abstract/JJ the/DT ensemble/NN of/IN neural/JJ feature/NN learners/NNS ./.

In/IN comparison/NN of/IN the/DT Classic/NN Deep/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN ,/, DEFE/NN shows/VBZ a/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN performance/NN :/: the/DT error/NN rate/NN has/VBZ decreased/VBN by/IN about/IN 37/CD \/SYM percent/NN ,/, the/DT accuracy/NN has/VBZ broken/VBN through/RP 90/CD \/SYM percent/NN for/IN the/DT first/JJ time/NN ,/, along/IN with/IN the/DT discovery/NN significance/NN has/VBZ reached/VBN a/DT standard/JJ deviation/NN of/IN 6.0/CD $/$ \/CD sigma/CD $/$ ./.
