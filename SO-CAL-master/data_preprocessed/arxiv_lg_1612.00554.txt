Feature/NN selection/NN is/VBZ a/DT process/NN of/IN choosing/VBG a/DT subset/NN of/IN relevant/JJ features/NNS so/IN that/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN prediction/NN models/NNS can/MD be/VB improved/VBN ./.
An/DT extensive/JJ body/NN of/IN work/NN exists/VBZ on/IN information/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ feature/NN selection/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN maximizing/VBG Mutual/JJ Information/NN (/-LRB- MI/NN )/-RRB- between/IN subsets/NNS of/IN features/NNS and/CC class/NN labels/NNS ./.
The/DT prior/JJ methods/NNS use/VBP a/DT lower/JJR order/NN approximation/NN ,/, by/IN treating/VBG the/DT joint/JJ entropy/NN as/IN a/DT summation/NN of/IN several/JJ single/JJ variable/JJ entropies/NNS ./.
This/DT leads/VBZ to/IN locally/RB optimal/JJ selections/NNS and/CC misses/VBZ multi-way/JJ feature/NN combinations/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT higher/JJR order/NN MI/NN based/VBN approximation/NN technique/NN called/VBN Higher/JJR Order/NNP Feature/NN Selection/NN (/-LRB- HOFS/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Instead/RB of/IN producing/VBG a/DT single/JJ list/NN of/IN features/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN produces/VBZ a/DT ranked/VBN collection/NN of/IN feature/NN subsets/NNS that/WDT maximizes/VBZ MI/NN ,/, giving/VBG better/JJR comprehension/NN (/-LRB- feature/NN ranking/NN )/-RRB- as/IN to/TO which/WDT features/VBZ work/NN best/JJS together/RB when/WRB selected/VBN ,/, due/IN to/IN their/PRP$ underlying/VBG interdependent/JJ structure/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN performs/VBZ better/JJR than/IN existing/VBG feature/NN selection/NN approaches/NNS while/IN keeping/VBG similar/JJ running/NN times/NNS and/CC computational/JJ complexity/NN ./.
