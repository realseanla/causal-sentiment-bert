Recently/RB ,/, the/DT rapid/JJ development/NN of/IN word/NN embedding/NN and/CC neural/JJ networks/NNS has/VBZ brought/VBN new/JJ inspiration/NN to/IN various/JJ NLP/NN and/CC IR/NN tasks/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP describe/VBP a/DT staged/VBN hybrid/NN model/NN combining/VBG Recurrent/JJ Convolutional/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- RCNN/NNP )/-RRB- with/IN highway/NN layers/NNS ./.
The/DT highway/NN network/NN module/NN is/VBZ incorporated/VBN in/IN the/DT middle/NN takes/VBZ the/DT output/NN of/IN the/DT bi-directional/JJ Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- Bi-RNN/NN )/-RRB- module/NN in/IN the/DT first/JJ stage/NN and/CC provides/VBZ the/DT Convolutional/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- module/NN in/IN the/DT last/JJ stage/NN with/IN the/DT input/NN ./.
The/DT experiment/NN shows/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ model/NN outperforms/VBZ common/JJ neural/JJ network/NN models/NNS (/-LRB- CNN/NNP ,/, RNN/NNP ,/, Bi-RNN/NNP )/-RRB- on/IN a/DT sentiment/NN analysis/NN task/NN ./.
Besides/RB ,/, the/DT analysis/NN of/IN how/WRB sequence/NN length/NN influences/VBZ the/DT RCNN/NN with/IN highway/NN layers/NNS shows/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ model/NN could/MD learn/VB good/JJ representation/NN for/IN the/DT long/JJ text/NN ./.
