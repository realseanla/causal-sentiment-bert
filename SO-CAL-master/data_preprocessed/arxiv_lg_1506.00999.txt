This/DT paper/NN tackles/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN endogenous/JJ link/NN prediction/NN for/IN Knowledge/NN Base/NN completion/NN ./.
Knowledge/NN Bases/NNS can/MD be/VB represented/VBN as/IN directed/VBN graphs/NNS whose/WP$ nodes/NNS correspond/VBP to/IN entities/NNS and/CC edges/NNS to/IN relationships/NNS ./.
Previous/JJ attempts/NNS either/CC consist/VB of/IN powerful/JJ systems/NNS with/IN high/JJ capacity/NN to/TO model/VB complex/JJ connectivity/NN patterns/NNS ,/, which/WDT unfortunately/RB usually/RB end/VB up/RP overfitting/VBG on/IN rare/JJ relationships/NNS ,/, or/CC in/IN approaches/NNS that/WDT trade/VBP capacity/NN for/IN simplicity/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO fairly/RB model/VB all/DT relationships/NNS ,/, frequent/JJ or/CC not/RB ./.
