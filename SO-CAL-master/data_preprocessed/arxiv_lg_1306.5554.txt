This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ Correlated/VBN Nystrom/NNP Views/NNS (/-LRB- XNV/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT fast/JJ semi-supervised/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN regression/NN and/CC classification/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN draws/VBZ on/IN two/CD main/JJ ideas/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, it/PRP generates/VBZ two/CD views/NNS consisting/VBG of/IN computationally/RB inexpensive/JJ random/JJ features/NNS ./.
Second/RB ,/, XNV/NNP applies/VBZ multiview/JJ regression/NN using/VBG Canonical/JJ Correlation/NN Analysis/NN (/-LRB- CCA/NN )/-RRB- on/IN unlabeled/JJ data/NNS to/IN bias/NN the/DT regression/NN towards/IN useful/JJ features/NNS ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN that/IN ,/, if/IN the/DT views/NNS contains/VBZ accurate/JJ estimators/NNS ,/, CCA/NN regression/NN can/MD substantially/RB reduce/VB variance/NN with/IN a/DT minimal/JJ increase/NN in/IN bias/NN ./.
Random/NNP views/NNS are/VBP justified/VBN by/IN recent/JJ theoretical/JJ and/CC empirical/JJ work/NN showing/VBG that/IN regression/NN with/IN random/JJ features/NNS closely/RB approximates/VBZ kernel/NN regression/NN ,/, implying/VBG that/IN random/JJ views/NNS can/MD be/VB expected/VBN to/TO contain/VB accurate/JJ estimators/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN XNV/NNP consistently/RB outperforms/VBZ a/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN algorithm/NN for/IN semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN :/: substantially/RB improving/VBG predictive/JJ performance/NN and/CC reducing/VBG the/DT variability/NN of/IN performance/NN on/IN a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN datasets/NNS ,/, whilst/IN also/RB reducing/VBG runtime/NN by/IN orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN ./.
