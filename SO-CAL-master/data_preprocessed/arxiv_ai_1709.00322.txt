The/DT notions/NNS of/IN disintegration/NN and/CC Bayesian/JJ inversion/NN are/VBP fundamental/JJ in/IN conditional/JJ probability/NN theory/NN ./.
They/PRP produce/VBP channels/NNS ,/, as/IN conditional/JJ probabilities/NNS ,/, from/IN a/DT joint/JJ state/NN ,/, or/CC from/IN an/DT already/RB given/VBN channel/NN (/-LRB- in/IN opposite/JJ direction/NN )/-RRB- ./.
These/DT notions/NNS exist/VBP in/IN the/DT literature/NN ,/, in/IN concrete/JJ situations/NNS ,/, but/CC are/VBP presented/VBN here/RB in/IN abstract/JJ graphical/JJ formulations/NNS ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG abstract/JJ descriptions/NNS are/VBP used/VBN for/IN proving/VBG basic/JJ results/NNS in/IN conditional/JJ probability/NN theory/NN ./.
