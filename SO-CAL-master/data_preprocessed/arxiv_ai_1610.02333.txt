This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT systematic/JJ survey/NN on/IN existing/VBG literature/NN and/CC seminal/JJ works/NNS relevant/JJ to/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN ontologies/NNS in/IN different/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN Cloud/NN computing/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ hypothesis/NN is/VBZ that/IN ontologies/NNS along/IN with/IN their/PRP$ reasoning/NN capabilities/NNS can/MD have/VB significant/JJ impact/NN on/IN improving/VBG various/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT Cloud/NN computing/VBG phenomena/NNS ./.
Ontologies/NNS can/MD promote/VB intelligent/JJ decision/NN support/NN mechanisms/NNS for/IN various/JJ Cloud/NNP based/VBN services/NNS ./.
They/PRP can/MD also/RB provide/VB effective/JJ interoperability/NN among/IN the/DT Cloud/NNP based/VBN systems/NNS and/CC resources/NNS ./.
This/DT survey/NN can/MD promote/VB a/DT comprehensive/JJ understanding/NN on/IN the/DT roles/NNS and/CC significance/NN of/IN ontologies/NNS within/IN the/DT overall/JJ domain/NN of/IN Cloud/NNP Computing/NNP ./.
Also/RB ,/, this/DT project/NN can/MD potentially/RB form/VB the/DT basis/NN of/IN new/JJ research/NN area/NN and/CC possibilities/NNS for/IN both/DT ontology/NN and/CC Cloud/NN computing/VBG communities/NNS ./.
