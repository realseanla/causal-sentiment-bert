Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN (/-LRB- RNN/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ architectures/NNS used/VBN in/IN Natural/NNP Language/NNP Processsing/NNP (/-LRB- NLP/NNP )/-RRB- tasks/NNS because/IN its/PRP$ recurrent/JJ structure/NN is/VBZ very/RB suitable/JJ to/TO process/VB variable/JJ -/HYPH length/NN text/NN ./.
RNN/NN can/MD utilize/VB distributed/VBN representations/NNS of/IN words/NNS by/IN first/JJ converting/VBG the/DT tokens/NNS comprising/VBG each/DT text/NN into/IN vectors/NNS ,/, which/WDT form/VBP a/DT matrix/NN ./.
And/CC this/DT matrix/NN includes/VBZ two/CD dimensions/NNS :/: the/DT time/NN -/HYPH step/NN dimension/NN and/CC the/DT feature/NN vector/NN dimension/NN ./.
Then/RB most/RBS existing/JJ models/NNS usually/RB utilize/VBP one/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ (/-LRB- 1D/NN )/-RRB- max/NN pooling/VBG operation/NN or/CC attention/NN -/HYPH based/VBN operation/NN only/RB on/IN the/DT time/NN -/HYPH step/NN dimension/NN to/TO obtain/VB a/DT fixed/VBN -/HYPH length/NN vector/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT features/NNS on/IN the/DT feature/NN vector/NN dimension/NN are/VBP not/RB mutually/RB independent/JJ ,/, and/CC simply/RB applying/VBG 1D/NN pooling/VBG operation/NN over/IN the/DT time/NN -/HYPH step/NN dimension/NN independently/RB may/MD destroy/VB the/DT structure/NN of/IN the/DT feature/NN representation/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, applying/VBG two/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ (/-LRB- 2D/NN )/-RRB- pooling/VBG operation/NN over/IN the/DT two/CD dimensions/NNS may/MD sample/VB more/JJR meaningful/JJ features/NNS for/IN sequence/NN modeling/NN tasks/NNS ./.
To/TO integrate/VB the/DT features/NNS on/IN both/DT dimensions/NNS of/IN the/DT matrix/NN ,/, this/DT paper/NN explores/VBZ applying/VBG 2D/NN max/NN pooling/VBG operation/NN to/TO obtain/VB a/DT fixed/VBN -/HYPH length/NN representation/NN of/IN the/DT text/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN also/RB utilizes/VBZ 2D/NN convolution/NN to/IN sample/NN more/RBR meaningful/JJ information/NN of/IN the/DT matrix/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS are/VBP conducted/VBN on/IN six/CD text/NN classification/NN tasks/NNS ,/, including/VBG sentiment/NN analysis/NN ,/, question/NN classification/NN ,/, subjectivity/NN classification/NN and/CC newsgroup/NN classification/NN ./.
Compared/VBN with/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN models/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN models/NNS achieve/VBP excellent/JJ performance/NN on/IN 4/CD out/IN of/IN 6/CD tasks/NNS ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, one/CD of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN models/NNS achieves/VBZ highest/JJS accuracy/NN on/IN Stanford/NNP Sentiment/NN Treebank/NNP binary/JJ classification/NN and/CC fine/JJ -/HYPH grained/JJ classification/NN tasks/NNS ./.
