We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ discrepancy/NN score/NN between/IN two/CD distributions/NNS that/WDT gives/VBZ an/DT indication/NN on/IN their/PRP$ similarity/NN ./.
While/IN much/JJ research/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN to/TO determine/VB if/IN two/CD samples/NNS come/VBP from/IN exactly/RB the/DT same/JJ distribution/NN ,/, much/RB less/JJR research/NN considered/VBD the/DT problem/NN of/IN determining/VBG if/IN two/CD finite/JJ samples/NNS come/VBP from/IN similar/JJ distributions/NNS ./.
