We/PRP study/VBP classifiers/NNS operating/VBG under/IN severe/JJ classification/NN time/NN constraints/NNS ,/, corresponding/VBG to/IN 1/CD -/HYPH 1000/CD CPU/NN microseconds/NNS ,/, using/VBG Convolutional/NNP Tables/NNS Ensemble/NN (/-LRB- CTE/NN )/-RRB- ,/, an/DT inherently/RB fast/JJ architecture/NN for/IN object/NN category/NN recognition/NN ./.
The/DT architecture/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN convolutionally/RB -/HYPH applied/VBN sparse/JJ feature/NN extraction/NN ,/, using/VBG trees/NNS or/CC ferns/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT linear/JJ voting/NN layer/NN ./.
