Multi-mode/JJ resource/NN and/CC precedence/NN -/HYPH constrained/VBN project/NN scheduling/NN is/VBZ a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN challenging/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN optimisation/NN problem/NN ./.
An/DT important/JJ variant/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN requires/VBZ scheduling/NN of/IN activities/NNS for/IN multiple/JJ projects/NNS considering/VBG availability/NN of/IN local/JJ and/CC global/JJ resources/NNS while/IN respecting/VBG a/DT range/NN of/IN constraints/NNS ./.
This/DT problem/NN has/VBZ been/VBN addressed/VBN by/IN a/DT competition/NN ,/, and/CC associated/VBN set/NN of/IN benchmark/NN instances/NNS ,/, as/IN a/DT part/NN of/IN the/DT MISTA/NNP 2013/CD conference/NN ./.
A/DT critical/JJ aspect/NN of/IN the/DT benchmarks/NNS is/VBZ that/IN the/DT primary/JJ objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO minimise/VB the/DT sum/NN of/IN the/DT project/NN completion/NN times/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT usual/JJ makespan/NN minimisation/NN as/IN a/DT secondary/JJ objective/NN ./.
We/PRP observe/VBP that/IN this/DT leads/VBZ to/IN an/DT expected/VBN different/JJ overall/JJ structure/NN of/IN good/JJ solutions/NNS and/CC discuss/VB the/DT effects/NNS this/DT has/VBZ on/IN the/DT algorithm/NN design/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ the/DT resulting/VBG competition/NN winning/VBG approach/NN ;/: it/PRP is/VBZ a/DT carefully/RB designed/VBN hybrid/NN of/IN Monte/NNP -/HYPH Carlo/NNP tree/NN search/NN ,/, novel/JJ neighbourhood/NN moves/NNS ,/, memetic/JJ algorithms/NNS ,/, and/CC hyper/JJ -/HYPH heuristic/NN methods/NNS ./.
The/DT implementation/NN is/VBZ also/RB engineered/VBN to/TO increase/VB the/DT speed/NN with/IN which/WDT iterations/NNS are/VBP performed/VBN ,/, and/CC to/TO exploit/VB the/DT computing/NN power/NN of/IN multicore/NN machines/NNS ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG information/NN -/HYPH sharing/VBG multi-component/JJ algorithm/NN significantly/RB outperformed/VBD the/DT other/JJ approaches/NNS during/IN the/DT competition/NN ,/, producing/VBG the/DT best/JJS solution/NN for/IN 17/CD out/IN of/IN the/DT 20/CD test/NN instances/NNS and/CC performing/VBG the/DT best/JJS in/IN around/RB 90/CD percent/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT trials/NNS ./.
