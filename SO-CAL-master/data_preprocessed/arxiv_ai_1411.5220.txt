Finite/JJ chase/NN ,/, or/CC alternatively/RB chase/JJ termination/NN ,/, is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ condition/NN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT decidability/NN of/IN existential/JJ rule/NN languages/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT past/JJ few/JJ years/NNS ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN rule/NN languages/NNS with/IN finite/JJ chase/NN have/VBP been/VBN studied/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN for/IN classifying/VBG the/DT rule/NN languages/NNS with/IN finite/JJ chase/NN ./.
Using/VBG this/DT approach/NN ,/, a/DT family/NN of/IN decidable/JJ rule/NN languages/NNS ,/, which/WDT extend/VBP the/DT existing/VBG languages/NNS with/IN the/DT finite/JJ chase/NN property/NN ,/, are/VBP naturally/RB defined/VBN ./.
We/PRP then/RB study/VB the/DT complexity/NN of/IN these/DT languages/NNS ./.
Although/IN all/DT of/IN them/PRP are/VBP tractable/JJ for/IN data/NNS complexity/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN their/PRP$ combined/VBN complexity/NN can/MD be/VB arbitrarily/RB high/JJ ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN all/PDT the/DT rule/NN languages/NNS with/IN finite/JJ chase/NN that/WDT extend/VBP the/DT weakly/RB acyclic/JJ language/NN are/VBP of/IN the/DT same/JJ expressiveness/NN as/IN the/DT weakly/RB acyclic/JJ one/CD ,/, while/IN rule/NN languages/NNS with/IN higher/JJR combined/VBN complexity/NN are/VBP in/IN general/JJ more/RBR succinct/JJ than/IN those/DT with/IN lower/JJR combined/VBN complexity/NN ./.
