Fuzzy/JJ logic/NN is/VBZ an/DT alternate/JJ approach/NN for/IN quantifying/VBG uncertainty/NN relating/VBG to/IN activity/NN duration/NN ./.
The/DT fuzzy/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT backward/JJ recursion/NN has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN to/TO produce/VB results/NNS that/WDT incorrectly/RB amplify/VBP the/DT level/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT fuzzy/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT forward/JJ recursion/NN has/VBZ been/VBN widely/RB proposed/VBN as/IN an/DT approach/NN for/IN determining/VBG the/DT fuzzy/JJ set/NN of/IN critical/JJ path/NN lengths/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, the/DT direct/JJ application/NN of/IN the/DT extension/NN principle/NN leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT proposition/NN that/WDT must/MD be/VB satisfied/JJ in/IN fuzzy/JJ critical/JJ path/NN analysis/NN ./.
Using/VBG a/DT counterexample/NN it/PRP is/VBZ demonstrated/VBN that/IN the/DT fuzzy/JJ forward/JJ recursion/NN when/WRB discrete/JJ fuzzy/JJ sets/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO represent/VB activity/NN durations/NNS produces/VBZ results/NNS that/WDT are/VBP not/RB consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT theory/NN presented/VBN ./.
