Random/NNP Indexing/NN (/-LRB- RI/JJ )/-RRB- K/NN -/HYPH tree/NN is/VBZ the/DT combination/NN of/IN two/CD algorithms/NNS for/IN clustering/NN ./.
Many/JJ large/JJ scale/NN problems/NNS exist/VBP in/IN document/NN clustering/NN ./.
RI/JJ K/NN -/HYPH tree/NN scales/NNS well/RB with/IN large/JJ inputs/NNS due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ low/JJ complexity/NN ./.
It/PRP also/RB exhibits/VBZ features/NNS that/WDT are/VBP useful/JJ for/IN managing/VBG a/DT changing/VBG collection/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, it/PRP solves/VBZ previous/JJ issues/NNS with/IN sparse/JJ document/NN vectors/NNS when/WRB using/VBG K/NN -/HYPH tree/NN ./.
The/DT algorithms/NNS and/CC data/NNS structures/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN ,/, explained/VBD and/CC motivated/VBD ./.
Specific/JJ modifications/NNS to/IN K/NN -/HYPH tree/NN are/VBP made/VBN for/IN use/NN with/IN RI/JJ ./.
Experiments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN executed/VBN to/TO measure/VB quality/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN RI/JJ K/NN -/HYPH tree/NN improves/VBZ document/NN cluster/NN quality/NN over/IN the/DT original/JJ K/NN -/HYPH tree/NN algorithm/NN ./.
