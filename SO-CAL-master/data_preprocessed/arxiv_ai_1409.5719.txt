The/DT properties/NNS of/IN local/JJ optimal/JJ solutions/NNS in/IN multi-objective/JJ combinatorial/JJ optimization/NN problems/NNS are/VBP crucial/JJ for/IN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN local/JJ search/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, particularly/RB when/WRB these/DT algorithms/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN Pareto/NN dominance/NN ./.
Such/JJ local/JJ search/NN algorithms/NNS typically/RB return/VBP a/DT set/NN of/IN mutually/RB nondominated/JJ Pareto/NN local/JJ optimal/JJ (/-LRB- PLO/NNP )/-RRB- solutions/NNS ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, a/DT PLO/NNP -/HYPH set/VBN ./.
This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ two/CD aspects/NNS of/IN PLO/NNP -/HYPH sets/NNS by/IN means/NNS of/IN experiments/NNS with/IN Pareto/NN local/JJ search/NN (/-LRB- PLS/NN )/-RRB- ./.
First/RB ,/, we/PRP examine/VBP the/DT impact/NN of/IN several/JJ problem/NN characteristics/NNS on/IN the/DT properties/NNS of/IN PLO/NNP -/HYPH sets/NNS for/IN multi-objective/JJ NK/NNP -/HYPH landscapes/NNS with/IN correlated/VBN objectives/NNS ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP report/VBP that/IN either/CC increasing/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN objectives/NNS or/CC decreasing/VBG the/DT correlation/NN between/IN objectives/NNS leads/VBZ to/IN an/DT exponential/JJ increment/NN on/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN PLO/NNP -/HYPH sets/NNS ,/, whereas/IN the/DT variable/JJ correlation/NN has/VBZ only/RB a/DT minor/JJ effect/NN ./.
Second/RB ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT running/NN time/NN and/CC the/DT quality/NN reached/VBD when/WRB using/VBG bounding/VBG archiving/NN methods/NNS to/TO limit/VB the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT archive/NN handled/VBN by/IN PLS/NN ,/, and/CC thus/RB ,/, the/DT maximum/JJ size/NN of/IN the/DT PLO/NNP -/HYPH set/VBN found/VBN ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT clear/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT running/NN time/NN of/IN PLS/NN and/CC the/DT difficulty/NN of/IN a/DT problem/NN instance/NN ./.
