Explaining/VBG adaptive/JJ behavior/NN is/VBZ a/DT central/JJ problem/NN in/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN research/NN ./.
Here/RB we/PRP formalize/VBP adaptive/JJ agents/NNS as/IN mixture/NN distributions/NNS over/IN sequences/NNS of/IN inputs/NNS and/CC outputs/NNS (/-LRB- I/NN //HYPH O/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Each/DT distribution/NN of/IN the/DT mixture/NN constitutes/VBZ a/DT '/`` possible/JJ world/NN '/'' ,/, but/CC the/DT agent/NN does/VBZ not/RB know/VB which/WDT of/IN the/DT possible/JJ worlds/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ actually/RB facing/VBG ./.
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ to/TO adapt/VB the/DT I/NN //HYPH O/NN stream/NN in/IN a/DT way/NN that/WDT is/VBZ compatible/JJ with/IN the/DT true/JJ world/NN ./.
A/DT natural/JJ measure/NN of/IN adaptation/NN can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN by/IN the/DT Kullback/NNP -/HYPH Leibler/NNP (/-LRB- KL/NNP )/-RRB- divergence/NN between/IN the/DT I/NN //HYPH O/NN distribution/NN of/IN the/DT true/JJ world/NN and/CC the/DT I/NN //HYPH O/NN distribution/NN expected/VBN by/IN the/DT agent/NN that/WDT is/VBZ uncertain/JJ about/IN possible/JJ worlds/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN pure/JJ input/NN streams/NNS ,/, the/DT Bayesian/JJ mixture/NN provides/VBZ a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN solution/NN for/IN this/DT problem/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN I/PRP //SYM O/NN streams/NN this/DT solution/NN breaks/VBZ down/RP ,/, because/IN outputs/NNS are/VBP issued/VBN by/IN the/DT agent/NN itself/PRP and/CC require/VB a/DT different/JJ probabilistic/JJ syntax/NN as/IN provided/VBN by/IN intervention/NN calculus/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN this/DT calculus/NN ,/, we/PRP obtain/VBP a/DT Bayesian/JJ control/NN rule/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ modeling/NN adaptive/JJ behavior/NN with/IN mixture/NN distributions/NNS over/IN I/PRP //SYM O/NN streams/NN ./.
This/DT rule/NN might/MD allow/VB for/IN a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN to/IN adaptive/JJ control/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT minimum/JJ KL/NN -/HYPH principle/NN ./.
