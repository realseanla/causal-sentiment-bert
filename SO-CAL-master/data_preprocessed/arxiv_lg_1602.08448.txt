This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ adaptive/JJ allocation/NN of/IN measurement/NN effort/NN for/IN identifying/VBG the/DT best/JJS among/IN a/DT finite/NN set/NN of/IN options/NNS or/CC designs/NNS ./.
An/DT experimenter/NN sequentially/RB chooses/VBZ designs/NNS to/TO measure/VB and/CC observes/VBZ noisy/JJ signals/NNS of/IN their/PRP$ quality/NN with/IN the/DT goal/NN of/IN confidently/RB identifying/VBG the/DT best/JJS design/NN after/IN a/DT small/JJ number/NN of/IN measurements/NNS ./.
I/PRP propose/VBP three/CD simple/JJ Bayesian/JJ algorithms/NNS for/IN adaptively/RB allocating/VBG measurement/NN effort/NN ./.
One/CD is/VBZ Top/JJ -/HYPH Two/CD Probability/NN sampling/NN ,/, which/WDT computes/VBZ the/DT two/CD designs/NNS with/IN the/DT highest/JJS posterior/JJ probability/NN of/IN being/VBG optimal/JJ ,/, and/CC then/RB randomizes/VBZ to/TO select/VB among/IN these/DT two/CD ./.
One/CD is/VBZ a/DT variant/NN a/DT top/JJ -/HYPH two/CD sampling/NN which/WDT considers/VBZ not/RB only/RB the/DT probability/NN a/DT design/NN is/VBZ optimal/JJ ,/, but/CC the/DT expected/VBN amount/NN by/IN which/WDT it/PRP exceeds/VBZ other/JJ designs/NNS ./.
The/DT final/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ a/DT modified/VBN version/NN of/IN Thompson/NNP sampling/NN that/WDT is/VBZ tailored/VBN for/IN identifying/VBG the/DT best/JJS design/NN ./.
I/PRP prove/VBP that/IN these/DT simple/JJ algorithms/NNS satisfy/VBP a/DT strong/JJ optimality/NN property/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT frequestist/JJ setting/NN where/WRB the/DT true/JJ quality/NN of/IN the/DT designs/NNS is/VBZ fixed/VBN ,/, the/DT posterior/JJ is/VBZ said/VBN to/TO be/VB consistent/JJ if/IN it/PRP correctly/RB identifies/VBZ the/DT optimal/JJ design/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN that/IN the/DT posterior/JJ probability/NN assigned/VBN to/IN the/DT event/NN that/IN some/DT other/JJ design/NN is/VBZ optimal/JJ converges/NNS to/IN zero/CD as/IN measurements/NNS are/VBP collected/VBN ./.
I/PRP show/VBP that/IN under/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithms/NNS this/DT convergence/NN occurs/VBZ at/IN an/DT exponential/JJ rate/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT corresponding/VBG exponent/NN is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ among/IN all/DT allocation/NN
