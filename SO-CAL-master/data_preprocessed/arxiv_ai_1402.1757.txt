This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ multi-agent/JJ frequencybased/JJ patrolling/NN of/IN intersecting/VBG ,/, circle/NN graphs/NNS under/IN conditions/NNS where/WRB graph/NN nodes/NNS have/VBP non-uniform/JJ visitation/NN requirements/NNS and/CC agents/NNS have/VBP limited/VBN ability/NN to/TO communicate/VB ./.
The/DT task/NN is/VBZ modeled/VBN as/IN a/DT partially/RB observable/JJ Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT reinforcement/NN learning/NN solution/NN is/VBZ developed/VBN ./.
Each/DT agent/NN generates/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ policy/NN from/IN Markov/NNP chains/NNS ,/, and/CC policies/NNS are/VBP exchanged/VBN only/RB when/WRB agents/NNS occupy/VBP the/DT same/JJ or/CC adjacent/JJ nodes/NNS ./.
This/DT constraint/NN on/IN policy/NN exchange/NN models/NNS sparse/JJ communication/NN conditions/NNS over/IN large/JJ ,/, unstructured/JJ environments/NNS ./.
Empirical/JJ results/NNS provide/VBP perspectives/NNS on/IN convergence/NN properties/NNS ,/, agent/NN cooperation/NN ,/, and/CC generalization/NN of/IN learned/VBN patrolling/NN policies/NNS to/IN new/JJ instances/NNS of/IN the/DT task/NN ./.
The/DT emergent/JJ behavior/NN indicates/VBZ learned/VBN coordination/NN strategies/NNS between/IN heterogeneous/JJ agents/NNS for/IN patrolling/VBG large/JJ ,/, unstructured/JJ regions/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT ability/NN to/TO generalize/VB to/IN dynamic/JJ variation/NN in/IN node/NN visitation/NN requirements/NNS ./.
