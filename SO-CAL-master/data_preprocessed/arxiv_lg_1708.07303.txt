Learning/VBG to/TO interact/VB with/IN objects/NNS in/IN the/DT environment/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ AI/NN problem/NN involving/VBG perception/NN ,/, motion/NN planning/NN ,/, and/CC control/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, learning/VBG representations/NNS of/IN such/JJ interactions/NNS is/VBZ very/RB challenging/JJ due/IN to/IN a/DT high/JJ dimensional/JJ state/NN space/NN ,/, difficulty/NN in/IN collecting/VBG large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN data/NNS ,/, and/CC many/JJ variations/NNS of/IN an/DT object/NN 's/POS visual/JJ appearance/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW geometry/NN ,/, material/NN ,/, texture/NN ,/, and/CC illumination/NN )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN knowledge/NN of/IN 3D/JJ geometry/NN is/VBZ at/IN the/DT heart/NN of/IN grasping/VBG interactions/NNS and/CC propose/VB the/DT notion/NN of/IN a/DT geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ learning/NN agent/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ key/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ constraining/VBG and/CC regularizing/VBG interaction/NN learning/VBG through/IN 3D/JJ geometry/NN prediction/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP formulate/VBP the/DT learning/NN process/NN of/IN a/DT geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ agent/NN as/IN a/DT two/CD -/HYPH step/NN procedure/NN :/: First/RB ,/, the/DT agent/NN learns/VBZ to/TO construct/VB its/PRP$ geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT scene/NN from/IN 2D/NN sensory/JJ input/NN via/IN generative/JJ 3D/JJ shape/NN modeling/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, it/PRP learns/VBZ to/TO predict/VB grasping/VBG outcome/NN with/IN its/PRP$ built/VBN -/HYPH in/RP geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ representation/NN ./.
The/DT geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ representation/NN plays/VBZ a/DT key/JJ role/NN in/IN relating/VBG geometry/NN and/CC interaction/NN via/IN a/DT novel/JJ learning/NN -/HYPH free/JJ depth/NN projection/NN layer/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ contributions/NNS are/VBP threefold/RB :/: (/-LRB- 1/LS )/-RRB- we/PRP build/VBP a/DT grasping/VBG dataset/NN from/IN demonstrations/NNS in/IN virtual/JJ reality/NN (/-LRB- VR/NN )/-RRB- with/IN rich/JJ sensory/JJ and/CC interaction/NN annotations/NNS ;/: (/-LRB- 2/LS )/-RRB- we/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT learned/VBN geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ representation/NN results/NNS in/IN a/DT more/RBR robust/JJ grasping/VBG outcome/NN prediction/NN compared/VBN to/IN a/DT baseline/NN model/NN ;/: and/CC (/-LRB- 3/LS )/-RRB- we/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT benefits/NNS of/IN the/DT learned/VBN geometry/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ representation/NN in/IN grasping/VBG planning/NN ./.
