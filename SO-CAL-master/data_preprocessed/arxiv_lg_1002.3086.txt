Recently/RB ,/, new/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN adaptive/JJ control/NN have/VBP sought/VBN to/TO reformulate/VB the/DT problem/NN as/IN a/DT minimization/NN of/IN a/DT relative/JJ entropy/NN criterion/NN to/TO obtain/VB tractable/JJ solutions/NNS ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN that/IN minimizing/VBG the/DT expected/VBN deviation/NN from/IN the/DT causal/JJ input/NN -/HYPH output/NN dependencies/NNS of/IN the/DT true/JJ plant/NN leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT new/JJ promising/JJ stochastic/JJ control/NN rule/NN called/VBD the/DT Bayesian/JJ control/NN rule/NN ./.
This/DT work/NN proves/VBZ the/DT convergence/NN of/IN the/DT Bayesian/JJ control/NN rule/NN under/IN two/CD sufficient/JJ assumptions/NNS :/: boundedness/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT ergodicity/NN condition/NN ;/: and/CC consistency/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT instantiation/NN of/IN the/DT sure/JJ -/HYPH thing/NN principle/NN ./.
