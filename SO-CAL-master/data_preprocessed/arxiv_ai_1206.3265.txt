While/IN known/VBN algorithms/NNS for/IN sensitivity/NN analysis/NN and/CC parameter/NN tuning/NN in/IN probabilistic/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP a/DT running/NN time/NN that/WDT is/VBZ exponential/JJ in/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ,/, the/DT exact/JJ computational/JJ complexity/NN of/IN these/DT problems/NNS has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN established/VBN as/IN yet/RB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP study/VBP several/JJ variants/NNS of/IN the/DT tuning/NN problem/NN and/CC show/VBP that/IN these/DT problems/NNS are/VBP NPPP/NN -/HYPH complete/JJ in/IN general/JJ ./.
