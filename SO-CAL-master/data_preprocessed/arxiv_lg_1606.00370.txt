There/EX is/VBZ an/DT increasing/VBG consensus/NN among/IN re/IN -/HYPH searchers/NNS that/WDT making/VBG a/DT computer/NN emotionally/RB intelligent/JJ with/IN the/DT ability/NN to/TO decode/VB human/JJ affective/JJ states/NNS would/MD allow/VB a/DT more/RBR meaningful/JJ and/CC natural/JJ way/NN of/IN human/JJ -/HYPH computer/NN interactions/NNS (/-LRB- HCIs/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
One/CD unobtrusive/JJ and/CC non-invasive/JJ way/NN of/IN recognizing/VBG human/JJ affective/JJ states/NNS entails/VBZ the/DT exploration/NN of/IN how/WRB physiological/JJ signals/NNS vary/VBP under/IN different/JJ emotional/JJ experiences/NNS ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, this/DT paper/NN explores/VBZ the/DT correlation/NN between/IN autonomically/RB -/HYPH mediated/VBN changes/NNS in/IN multimodal/JJ body/NN signals/NNS and/CC discrete/JJ emotional/JJ states/NNS ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO fully/RB exploit/VB the/DT information/NN in/IN each/DT modality/NN ,/, we/PRP have/VBP provided/VBN an/DT innovative/JJ classification/NN approach/NN for/IN three/CD specific/JJ physiological/JJ signals/NNS including/VBG Electromyogram/NNP (/-LRB- EMG/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, Blood/NN Volume/NN Pressure/NN (/-LRB- BVP/NN )/-RRB- and/CC Galvanic/JJ Skin/NN Response/NN (/-LRB- GSR/NN )/-RRB- ./.
These/DT signals/NNS are/VBP analyzed/VBN as/IN inputs/NNS to/IN an/DT emotion/NN recognition/NN paradigm/NN based/VBN on/IN fusion/NN of/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN weak/JJ learners/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/VBN classification/NN approach/NN showed/VBD 88.1/CD percent/NN recognition/NN accuracy/NN ,/, which/WDT outperformed/VBD the/DT conventional/JJ Support/NN Vector/NNP Machine/NNP (/-LRB- SVM/NNP )/-RRB- classifier/NN with/IN 17/CD percent/NN accuracy/NN improvement/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO avoid/VB information/NN redundancy/NN and/CC the/DT resultant/JJ over-fitting/NN ,/, a/DT feature/NN reduction/NN method/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN based/VBN on/IN a/DT correlation/NN analysis/NN to/TO optimize/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN features/NNS required/VBN for/IN training/NN and/CC validating/VBG each/DT weak/JJ learner/NN ./.
