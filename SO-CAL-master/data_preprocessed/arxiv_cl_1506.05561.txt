Lambeks/NNP Syntactic/NNP Calculus/NNP ,/, commonly/RB referred/VBN to/IN as/IN the/DT Lambek/NNP calculus/NN ,/, was/VBD innovative/JJ in/IN many/JJ ways/NNS ,/, notably/RB as/IN a/DT precursor/NN of/IN linear/JJ logic/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRP also/RB showed/VBD that/IN we/PRP could/MD treat/VB our/PRP$ grammatical/JJ framework/NN as/IN a/DT logic/NN (/-LRB- as/IN opposed/VBN to/IN a/DT logical/JJ theory/NN )/-RRB- ./.
However/RB ,/, though/IN it/PRP was/VBD successful/JJ in/IN giving/VBG at/RB least/RBS a/DT basic/JJ treatment/NN of/IN many/JJ linguistic/JJ phenomena/NN ,/, it/PRP was/VBD also/RB clear/JJ that/IN a/DT slightly/RB more/RBR expressive/JJ logical/JJ calculus/NN was/VBD needed/VBN for/IN many/JJ other/JJ cases/NNS ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, many/JJ extensions/NNS and/CC variants/NNS of/IN the/DT Lambek/NNP calculus/NN have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN ,/, since/IN the/DT eighties/NNS and/CC up/IN until/IN the/DT present/JJ day/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ now/RB a/DT large/JJ class/NN of/IN calculi/NN ,/, each/DT with/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ empirical/JJ successes/NNS and/CC theoretical/JJ results/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB each/DT with/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ logical/JJ primitives/NNS ./.
This/DT raises/VBZ the/DT question/NN :/: how/WRB do/VBP we/PRP compare/VB and/CC evaluate/VB these/DT different/JJ logical/JJ formalisms/NNS ?/.
To/TO answer/VB this/DT question/NN ,/, I/PRP present/VBP two/CD unifying/JJ frameworks/NNS for/IN these/DT extended/VBN Lambek/NN calculi/NN ./.
Both/DT are/VBP proof/JJ net/JJ calculi/NN with/IN graph/NN contraction/NN criteria/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ calculus/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB general/JJ system/NN :/: you/PRP specify/VB the/DT structure/NN of/IN your/PRP$ sequents/NNS and/CC it/PRP gives/VBZ you/PRP the/DT connectives/NNS and/CC contractions/NNS which/WDT correspond/VBP to/IN it/PRP ./.
The/DT calculus/NN can/MD be/VB extended/VBN with/IN structural/JJ rules/NNS ,/, which/WDT translate/VB directly/RB into/IN graph/NN rewrite/VBP rules/NNS ./.
The/DT second/JJ calculus/NN is/VBZ first/JJ -/HYPH order/NN (/-LRB- multiplicative/JJ intuitionistic/JJ )/-RRB- linear/JJ logic/NN ,/, which/WDT turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO have/VB several/JJ other/JJ ,/, independently/RB proposed/VBN extensions/NNS of/IN the/DT Lambek/NNP calculus/NN as/IN fragments/NNS ./.
I/PRP will/MD illustrate/VB the/DT use/NN of/IN each/DT calculus/NN in/IN building/VBG bridges/NNS between/IN analyses/NNS proposed/VBN in/IN different/JJ frameworks/NNS ,/, in/IN highlighting/VBG differences/NNS and/CC in/IN helping/VBG to/TO identify/VB problems/NNS ./.
