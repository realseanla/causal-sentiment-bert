This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN for/IN fault/NN classification/NN and/CC section/NN identification/NN in/IN a/DT series/NN compensated/VBN transmission/NN line/NN based/VBN on/IN least/JJS square/JJ support/NN vector/NN machine/NN ./.
The/DT current/JJ signal/NN corresponding/VBG to/IN one/CD -/HYPH fourth/NN of/IN the/DT post/NN fault/NN cycle/NN is/VBZ used/VBN as/IN input/NN to/IN proposed/VBN modular/JJ LS/NN -/HYPH SVM/NN classifier/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN scheme/NN uses/VBZ four/CD binary/JJ classifier/NN ;/: three/CD for/IN selection/NN of/IN three/CD phases/NNS and/CC fourth/JJ for/IN ground/NN detection/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN classification/NN scheme/NN is/VBZ found/VBN to/TO be/VB accurate/JJ and/CC reliable/JJ in/IN presence/NN of/IN noise/NN as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT simulation/NN results/NNS validate/VBP the/DT efficacy/NN of/IN proposed/VBN scheme/NN for/IN accurate/JJ classification/NN of/IN fault/NN in/IN a/DT series/NN compensated/VBN transmission/NN line/NN ./.
