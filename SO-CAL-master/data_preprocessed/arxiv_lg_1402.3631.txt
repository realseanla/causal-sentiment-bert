In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP initiate/VBP the/DT systematic/JJ study/NN of/IN solving/VBG linear/JJ programs/NNS under/IN differential/JJ privacy/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ step/NN is/VBZ simply/RB to/TO define/VB the/DT problem/NN :/: to/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP several/JJ natural/JJ classes/NNS of/IN private/JJ linear/JJ programs/NNS that/WDT capture/VBP different/JJ ways/NNS sensitive/JJ data/NNS can/MD be/VB incorporated/VBN into/IN a/DT linear/JJ program/NN ./.
For/IN each/DT class/NN of/IN linear/JJ programs/NNS we/PRP give/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ ,/, differentially/RB private/JJ solver/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT multiplicative/JJ weights/NNS framework/NN ,/, or/CC we/PRP give/VBP an/DT impossibility/NN result/NN ./.
