Imagine/VB a/DT princess/NN asleep/JJ in/IN a/DT castle/NN ,/, waiting/VBG for/IN her/PRP$ prince/NN to/IN slay/NN the/DT dragon/NN and/CC rescue/VB her/PRP ./.
Tales/NNS like/IN the/DT famous/JJ Sleeping/VBG Beauty/NNP clearly/RB divide/VBP up/RP gender/NN roles/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT technique/NN that/WDT combines/VBZ natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN with/IN a/DT crowdsourced/VBN lexicon/NN of/IN stereotypes/NNS to/TO capture/VB gender/NN biases/NNS in/IN fiction/NN ./.
We/PRP apply/VBP this/DT technique/NN across/IN 1.8/CD billion/CD words/NNS of/IN fiction/NN from/IN the/DT Wattpad/NNP online/JJ writing/NN community/NN ,/, investigating/VBG gender/NN representation/NN in/IN stories/NNS ,/, how/WRB male/JJ and/CC female/JJ characters/NNS behave/VBP and/CC are/VBP described/VBN ,/, and/CC how/WRB authors/NNS '/POS use/NN of/IN gender/NN stereotypes/NNS is/VBZ associated/VBN with/IN the/DT community/NN 's/POS ratings/NNS ./.
We/PRP find/VBP that/IN male/JJ over-representation/NN and/CC traditional/JJ gender/NN stereotypes/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, dominant/JJ men/NNS and/CC submissive/JJ women/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP common/JJ throughout/IN nearly/RB every/DT genre/NN in/IN our/PRP$ corpus/NN ./.

Finally/RB ,/, despite/IN women/NNS often/RB being/VBG the/DT target/NN of/IN negative/JJ stereotypes/NNS ,/, female/JJ authors/NNS are/VBP equally/RB likely/JJ to/TO write/VB such/JJ stereotypes/NNS as/IN men/NNS ./.
