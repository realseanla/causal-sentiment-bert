The/DT IDP/NNP knowledge/NN base/NN system/NN currently/RB uses/VBZ MiniSAT/NN (/-LRB- ID/NN )/-RRB- as/IN its/PRP$ backend/JJ Constraint/NN Programming/NN (/-LRB- CP/NN )/-RRB- solver/NN ./.
A/DT few/JJ similar/JJ systems/NNS have/VBP used/VBN a/DT Mixed/JJ Integer/NN Programming/NN (/-LRB- MIP/NN )/-RRB- solver/NN as/IN backend/NN ./.
