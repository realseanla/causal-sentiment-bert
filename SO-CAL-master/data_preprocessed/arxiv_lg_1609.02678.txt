In/IN a/DT power/NN distribution/NN network/NN ,/, the/DT network/NN topology/NN information/NN is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN an/DT efficient/JJ operation/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
This/DT information/NN of/IN network/NN connectivity/NN is/VBZ not/RB accurately/RB available/JJ ,/, at/IN the/DT low/JJ voltage/NN level/NN ,/, due/IN to/IN uninformed/JJ changes/NNS that/WDT happen/VBP from/IN time/NN to/IN time/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ data/NNS --/: driven/VBN approach/NN to/TO identify/VB the/DT underlying/VBG network/NN topology/NN including/VBG the/DT load/NN phase/NN connectivity/NN from/IN time/NN series/NN of/IN energy/NN measurements/NNS ./.
