The/DT small/JJ body/NN of/IN previous/JJ work/NN considering/VBG the/DT design/NN of/IN wind/NN farms/NNS has/VBZ used/VBN arrays/NNS of/IN turbines/NNS originally/RB intended/VBN to/TO operate/VB alone/RB ,/, optimising/VBG the/DT layout/NN of/IN homogeneous/JJ turbines/NNS essentially/RB as/IN an/DT afterthought/NN in/IN the/DT design/NN process/NN ./.
