In/IN the/DT last/JJ two/CD years/NNS ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN numerous/JJ papers/NNS that/WDT have/VBP looked/VBN into/IN using/VBG Deep/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS to/TO replace/VB the/DT acoustic/JJ model/NN in/IN traditional/JJ statistical/JJ parametric/JJ speech/NN synthesis/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, far/RB less/JJR attention/NN has/VBZ been/VBN paid/VBN to/IN approaches/NNS like/IN DNN/NNP -/HYPH based/VBN postfiltering/NN where/WRB DNNs/NNS work/VBP in/IN conjunction/NN with/IN traditional/JJ acoustic/JJ models/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS as/IN a/DT potential/JJ postfilter/NN for/IN synthesis/NN ./.
We/PRP explore/VBP the/DT possibility/NN of/IN replacing/VBG existing/VBG postfilters/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN highlight/NN the/DT ease/NN with/IN which/WDT arbitrary/JJ new/JJ features/NNS can/MD be/VB added/VBN as/IN input/NN to/IN the/DT postfilter/NN ./.
