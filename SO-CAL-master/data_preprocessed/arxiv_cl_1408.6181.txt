This/DT paper/NN provides/VBZ a/DT method/NN for/IN improving/VBG tensor/NN -/HYPH based/VBN compositional/JJ distributional/JJ models/NNS of/IN meaning/VBG by/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN an/DT explicit/JJ disambiguation/NN step/NN prior/RB to/IN composition/NN ./.
In/IN contrast/NN with/IN previous/JJ research/NN where/WRB this/DT hypothesis/NN has/VBZ been/VBN successfully/RB tested/VBN against/IN relatively/RB simple/JJ compositional/JJ models/NNS ,/, in/IN our/PRP$ work/NN we/PRP use/VBP a/DT robust/JJ model/NN trained/VBN with/IN linear/JJ regression/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS we/PRP get/VBP in/IN two/CD experiments/NNS show/VBP the/DT superiority/NN of/IN the/DT prior/JJ disambiguation/NN method/NN and/CC suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN this/DT approach/NN is/VBZ model/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ ./.
