We/PRP study/VBP two/CD -/HYPH player/NN security/NN games/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN sequences/NNS of/IN nonzero/JJ -/HYPH sum/NN matrix/NN games/NNS played/VBN by/IN an/DT Attacker/NN and/CC a/DT Defender/NN ./.
The/DT evolution/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN a/DT stochastic/JJ fictitious/JJ play/NN process/NN ,/, where/WRB players/NNS do/VBP not/RB have/VB access/NN to/IN each/DT other/JJ 's/POS payoff/NN matrix/NN ./.
Each/DT has/VBZ to/TO observe/VB the/DT other/JJ 's/POS actions/NNS up/RP to/TO present/VB and/CC plays/VBZ the/DT action/NN generated/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT best/JJS response/NN to/IN these/DT observations/NNS ./.
In/IN a/DT regular/JJ fictitious/JJ play/NN process/NN ,/, each/DT player/NN makes/VBZ a/DT maximum/JJ likelihood/NN estimate/NN of/IN her/PRP$ opponent/NN 's/POS mixed/JJ strategy/NN ,/, which/WDT results/VBZ in/IN a/DT time/NN -/HYPH varying/VBG update/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT previous/JJ estimate/NN and/CC current/JJ action/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP explore/VBP an/DT alternative/JJ scheme/NN for/IN frequency/NN update/NN ,/, whose/WP$ mean/JJ dynamic/NN is/VBZ instead/RB time/NN -/HYPH invariant/JJ ./.
We/PRP examine/VBP convergence/NN properties/NNS of/IN the/DT mean/JJ dynamic/NN of/IN the/DT fictitious/JJ play/NN process/NN with/IN such/PDT an/DT update/NN scheme/NN ,/, and/CC establish/VB local/JJ stability/NN of/IN the/DT equilibrium/NN point/NN when/WRB both/DT players/NNS are/VBP restricted/VBN to/IN two/CD actions/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB propose/VBP an/DT adaptive/JJ algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN this/DT time/NN -/HYPH invariant/JJ frequency/NN update/NN ./.
