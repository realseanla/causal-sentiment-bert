Many/JJ paralinguistic/JJ tasks/NNS are/VBP closely/RB related/JJ and/CC thus/RB representations/NNS learned/VBN in/IN one/CD domain/NN can/MD be/VB leveraged/VBN for/IN another/DT ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP how/WRB knowledge/NN can/MD be/VB transferred/VBN between/IN three/CD paralinguistic/JJ tasks/NNS :/: speaker/NN ,/, emotion/NN ,/, and/CC gender/NN recognition/NN ./.
Further/RB ,/, we/PRP extend/VBP this/DT problem/NN to/IN cross-dataset/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, asking/VBG how/WRB knowledge/NN captured/VBN in/IN one/CD emotion/NN dataset/NN can/MD be/VB transferred/VBN to/IN another/DT ./.
We/PRP focus/VBP on/IN progressive/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS and/CC compare/VB these/DT networks/NNS to/IN the/DT conventional/JJ deep/JJ learning/NN method/NN of/IN pre-training/JJ and/CC fine/JJ -/HYPH tuning/NN ./.
Progressive/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS provide/VBP a/DT way/NN to/TO transfer/VB knowledge/NN and/CC avoid/VB the/DT forgetting/VBG effect/NN present/JJ when/WRB pre-training/VBG neural/JJ networks/NNS on/IN different/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS demonstrate/VBP that/IN :/: (/-LRB- 1/LS )/-RRB- emotion/NN recognition/NN can/MD benefit/VB from/IN using/VBG representations/NNS originally/RB learned/VBD for/IN different/JJ paralinguistic/JJ tasks/NNS and/CC (/-LRB- 2/LS )/-RRB- transfer/NN learning/NN can/MD effectively/RB leverage/VB additional/JJ datasets/NNS to/TO improve/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN emotion/NN recognition/NN systems/NNS ./.
