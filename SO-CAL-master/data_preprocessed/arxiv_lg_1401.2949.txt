Modern/JJ learning/NN classifier/NN systems/NNS typically/RB exploit/VBP a/DT niched/JJ genetic/JJ algorithm/NN to/TO facilitate/VB rule/NN discovery/NN ./.
When/WRB used/VBN for/IN reinforcement/NN learning/NN ,/, such/JJ rules/NNS represent/VBP generalisations/NNS over/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH action/NN -/HYPH reward/NN space/NN ./.
