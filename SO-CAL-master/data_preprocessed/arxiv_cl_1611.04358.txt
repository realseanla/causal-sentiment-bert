This/DT article/NN provides/VBZ an/DT interesting/JJ exploration/NN of/IN character/NN -/HYPH level/NN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN solving/VBG Chinese/JJ corpus/NN text/NN classification/NN problem/NN ./.
We/PRP constructed/VBD a/DT large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN Chinese/JJ language/NN dataset/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT result/NN shows/VBZ that/IN character/NN -/HYPH level/NN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN works/VBZ better/RBR on/IN Chinese/JJ corpus/NN than/IN its/PRP$ corresponding/VBG pinyin/NNP format/NN dataset/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ time/NN that/WDT character/NN -/HYPH level/NN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN applied/VBD to/IN text/NN classification/NN problem/NN ./.
