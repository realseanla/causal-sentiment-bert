In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP going/VBG to/TO focus/VB on/IN speed/NN up/IN of/IN the/DT Word/NNP Sense/NN Disambiguation/NN procedure/NN by/IN filtering/VBG the/DT relevant/JJ senses/NNS of/IN an/DT ambiguous/JJ word/NN through/IN Part/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH Speech/NNP Tagging/NNP ./.
First/RB ,/, this/DT proposed/VBD approach/NN performs/VBZ the/DT Part/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH Speech/NNP Tagging/NNP operation/NN before/IN the/DT disambiguation/NN procedure/NN using/VBG Bigram/NNP approximation/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, the/DT exact/JJ Part/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH Speech/NNP of/IN the/DT ambiguous/JJ word/NN at/IN a/DT particular/JJ text/NN instance/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN ./.
