We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/IN value/NN function/NN approximation/NN which/WDT combines/VBZ linear/JJ temporal/JJ difference/NN reinforcement/NN learning/VBG with/IN subspace/NN identification/NN ./.
In/IN practical/JJ applications/NNS ,/, reinforcement/NN learning/NN (/-LRB- RL/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ complicated/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN state/NN is/VBZ either/RB high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ or/CC partially/RB observable/JJ ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, RL/NN methods/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO work/VB with/IN features/NNS of/IN state/NN rather/RB than/IN state/NN itself/PRP ,/, and/CC the/DT success/NN or/CC failure/NN of/IN learning/NN is/VBZ often/RB determined/VBN by/IN the/DT suitability/NN of/IN the/DT selected/VBN features/NNS ./.
By/IN comparison/NN ,/, subspace/NN identification/NN (/-LRB- SSID/NN )/-RRB- methods/NNS are/VBP designed/VBN to/TO select/VB a/DT feature/NN set/NN which/WDT preserves/VBZ as/RB much/JJ information/NN as/IN possible/JJ about/IN state/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP connect/VBP the/DT two/CD approaches/NNS ,/, looking/VBG at/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN reinforcement/NN learning/VBG with/IN a/DT large/JJ set/NN of/IN features/NNS ,/, each/DT of/IN which/WDT may/MD only/RB be/VB marginally/RB useful/JJ for/IN value/NN function/NN approximation/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN this/DT situation/NN ,/, called/VBN Predictive/JJ State/NN Temporal/JJ Difference/NN (/-LRB- PSTD/NNP )/-RRB- learning/NN ./.
As/IN in/IN SSID/NNP for/IN predictive/JJ state/NN representations/NNS ,/, PSTD/NNP finds/VBZ a/DT linear/JJ compression/NN operator/NN that/WDT projects/VBZ a/DT large/JJ set/NN of/IN features/NNS down/IN to/IN a/DT small/JJ set/NN that/WDT preserves/VBZ the/DT maximum/JJ amount/NN of/IN predictive/JJ information/NN ./.
As/IN in/IN RL/NNP ,/, PSTD/NNP then/RB uses/VBZ a/DT Bellman/NNP recursion/NN to/TO estimate/VB a/DT value/NN function/NN ./.
We/PRP discuss/VBP the/DT connection/NN between/IN PSTD/NNP and/CC prior/JJ approaches/NNS in/IN RL/NNP and/CC SSID/NNP ./.
We/PRP prove/VBP that/IN PSTD/NNP is/VBZ statistically/RB consistent/JJ ,/, perform/VB several/JJ experiments/NNS that/WDT illustrate/VBP its/PRP$ properties/NNS ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VB its/PRP$ potential/NN on/IN a/DT difficult/JJ optimal/JJ stopping/NN problem/NN ./.
