Relational/JJ Continuous/JJ Models/NNS (/-LRB- RCMs/NNS )/-RRB- represent/VBP joint/JJ probability/NN densities/NNS over/IN attributes/NNS of/IN objects/NNS ,/, when/WRB the/DT attributes/NNS have/VBP continuous/JJ domains/NNS ./.
With/IN relational/JJ representations/NNS ,/, they/PRP can/MD model/VB joint/JJ probability/NN distributions/NNS over/IN large/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN variables/NNS compactly/RB in/IN a/DT natural/JJ way/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ exact/JJ lifted/VBN inference/NN algorithm/NN for/IN RCMs/NNS ,/, thus/RB it/PRP scales/VBZ up/RP to/IN large/JJ models/NNS of/IN real/JJ world/NN applications/NNS ./.

When/WRB a/DT relational/JJ model/NN has/VBZ Gaussian/JJ potentials/NNS ,/, it/PRP takes/VBZ only/RB linear/JJ -/HYPH time/NN compared/VBN to/IN cubic/JJ time/NN of/IN previous/JJ methods/NNS ./.
