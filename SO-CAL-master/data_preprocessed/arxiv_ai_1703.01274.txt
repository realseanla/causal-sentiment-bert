This/DT paper/NN contributes/VBZ a/DT first/JJ study/NN into/IN how/WRB different/JJ human/JJ users/NNS deliver/VBP simultaneous/JJ control/NN and/CC feedback/NN signals/NNS during/IN human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN interaction/NN ./.
As/IN part/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP formalize/VBP and/CC present/VBP a/DT general/JJ interactive/JJ learning/NN framework/NN for/IN online/JJ cooperation/NN between/IN humans/NNS and/CC reinforcement/NN learning/VBG agents/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ human/JJ -/HYPH machine/NN interaction/NN settings/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT growing/VBG gap/NN between/IN the/DT degrees/NNS -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH freedom/NN of/IN complex/JJ semi-autonomous/JJ systems/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN human/JJ control/NN channels/NNS ./.
Simple/JJ human/JJ control/NN and/CC feedback/NN mechanisms/NNS are/VBP required/VBN to/TO close/VB this/DT gap/NN and/CC allow/VB for/IN better/JJR collaboration/NN between/IN humans/NNS and/CC machines/NNS on/IN complex/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
To/TO better/RBR inform/VB the/DT design/NN of/IN concurrent/JJ control/NN and/CC feedback/NN interfaces/VBZ ,/, we/PRP present/VBP experimental/JJ results/NNS from/IN a/DT human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN collaborative/JJ domain/NN wherein/WRB the/DT human/NN must/MD simultaneously/RB deliver/VB both/DT control/NN and/CC feedback/NN signals/NNS to/IN interactively/RB train/VB an/DT actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN reinforcement/NN learning/VBG robot/NN ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP three/CD experimental/JJ conditions/NNS :/: 1/LS )/-RRB- human/JJ delivered/VBN control/NN signals/NNS ,/, 2/CD )/-RRB- reward/NN -/HYPH shaping/VBG feedback/NN signals/NNS ,/, and/CC 3/LS )/-RRB- simultaneous/JJ control/NN and/CC feedback/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN subjects/NNS provide/VBP less/JJR feedback/NN when/WRB simultaneously/RB delivering/VBG feedback/NN and/CC control/NN signals/NNS and/CC that/IN control/NN signal/NN quality/NN is/VBZ not/RB significantly/RB diminished/VBN ./.
Our/PRP$ data/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN subjects/NNS may/MD also/RB modify/VB when/WRB and/CC how/WRB they/PRP provide/VBP feedback/NN ./.
Through/IN algorithmic/JJ development/NN and/CC tuning/NN informed/VBN by/IN this/DT study/NN ,/, we/PRP expect/VBP semi-autonomous/JJ actions/NNS of/IN robotic/JJ agents/NNS can/MD be/VB better/JJR shaped/VBN by/IN human/JJ feedback/NN ,/, allowing/VBG for/IN seamless/JJ collaboration/NN and/CC improved/VBN performance/NN in/IN difficult/JJ interactive/JJ domains/NNS ./.
