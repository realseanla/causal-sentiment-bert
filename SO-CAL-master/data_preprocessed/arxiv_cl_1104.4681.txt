This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ the/DT performance/NN evaluation/NN of/IN statistical/JJ approaches/NNS for/IN TextIndependent/NNP speaker/NN recognition/NN system/NN using/VBG source/NN feature/NN ./.
Linear/NNP prediction/NN LP/NN residual/JJ is/VBZ used/VBN as/IN a/DT representation/NN of/IN excitation/NN information/NN in/IN speech/NN ./.
The/DT speaker/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ information/NN in/IN the/DT excitation/NN of/IN voiced/VBN speech/NN is/VBZ captured/VBN using/VBG statistical/JJ approaches/NNS such/JJ as/IN Gaussian/NNP Mixture/NNP Models/NNPS GMMs/NNPS and/CC Hidden/NNP Markov/NNP Models/NNPS HMMs/NNPS ./.
The/DT decrease/NN in/IN the/DT error/NN during/IN training/NN and/CC recognizing/VBG speakers/NNS during/IN testing/NN phase/NN close/NN to/IN 100/CD percent/NN accuracy/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN the/DT excitation/NN component/NN of/IN speech/NN contains/VBZ speaker/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ information/NN and/CC is/VBZ indeed/RB being/VBG effectively/RB captured/VBN by/IN continuous/JJ Ergodic/JJ HMM/NN than/IN GMM/NNP ./.
The/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT speaker/NN recognition/NN system/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN on/IN GMM/NNP and/CC 2/CD state/NN ergodic/JJ HMM/NN with/IN different/JJ mixture/NN components/NNS and/CC test/NN speech/NN duration/NN ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT speaker/NN recognition/NN studies/NNS on/IN TIMIT/NNP database/NN for/IN both/DT GMM/NNP and/CC Ergodic/NNP HMM/NNP ./.
