The/DT ability/NN to/TO reason/VB under/IN uncertainty/NN and/CC with/IN incomplete/JJ information/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ requirement/NN of/IN decision/NN support/NN technology/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN the/DT concentration/NN on/IN theoretical/JJ techniques/NNS for/IN the/DT evaluation/NN and/CC selection/NN of/IN decision/NN options/NNS has/VBZ distracted/VBN attention/NN from/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT wider/JJR issues/NNS in/IN decision/NN making/NN ./.
Although/IN numerical/JJ methods/NNS of/IN reasoning/NN under/IN uncertainty/NN have/VBP strong/JJ theoretical/JJ foundations/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP representationally/RB weak/JJ and/CC only/JJ deal/NN with/IN a/DT small/JJ part/NN of/IN the/DT decision/NN process/NN ./.
Knowledge/NN based/VBN systems/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, offer/NN greater/JJR flexibility/NN but/CC have/VBP not/RB been/VBN accompanied/VBN by/IN a/DT clear/JJ decision/NN theory/NN ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP here/RB work/VB which/WDT is/VBZ under/IN way/NN towards/IN providing/VBG a/DT theoretical/JJ framework/NN for/IN symbolic/JJ decision/NN procedures/NNS ./.
A/DT central/JJ proposal/NN is/VBZ an/DT extended/JJ form/NN of/IN inference/NN which/WDT we/PRP call/VBP argumentation/NN ;/: reasoning/NN for/IN and/CC against/IN decision/NN options/NNS from/IN generalised/VBN domain/NN theories/NNS ./.
The/DT approach/NN has/VBZ been/VBN successfully/RB used/VBN in/IN several/JJ decision/NN support/NN applications/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP is/VBZ argued/VBN that/IN a/DT comprehensive/JJ decision/NN theory/NN must/MD cover/VB autonomous/JJ decision/NN making/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT agent/NN can/MD formulate/VB questions/NNS as/RB well/RB as/IN take/VB decisions/NNS ./.
A/DT major/JJ theoretical/JJ challenge/NN for/IN this/DT theory/NN is/VBZ to/TO capture/VB the/DT idea/NN of/IN reflection/NN to/TO permit/VB decision/NN agents/NNS to/IN reason/NN about/IN their/PRP$ goals/NNS ,/, what/WP they/PRP believe/VBP and/CC why/WRB ,/, and/CC what/WP they/PRP need/VBP to/TO know/VB or/CC do/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB their/PRP$ goals/NNS ./.
