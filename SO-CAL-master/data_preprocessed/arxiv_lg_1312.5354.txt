We/PRP studied/VBD classification/NN of/IN human/JJ ECGs/NNS labelled/VBN as/IN normal/JJ sinus/NN rhythm/NN ,/, ventricular/JJ fibrillation/NN and/CC ventricular/JJ tachycardia/NN by/IN means/NNS of/IN support/NN vector/NN machines/NNS in/IN different/JJ representation/NN spaces/NNS ,/, using/VBG different/JJ observation/NN lengths/NNS ./.
ECG/NN waveform/NN segments/NNS of/IN duration/NN 0.5/CD -/HYPH 4/CD s/NN ,/, their/PRP$ Fourier/NNP magnitude/NN spectra/NN ,/, and/CC lower/JJR dimensional/JJ projections/NNS of/IN Fourier/NNP magnitude/NN spectra/NNS were/VBD used/VBN for/IN classification/NN ./.

We/PRP found/VBD that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO discriminate/VB between/IN ventricular/JJ tachycardia/NN and/CC ventricular/JJ fibrillation/NN by/IN the/DT present/JJ approach/NN with/IN much/JJ shorter/JJR runs/NNS of/IN ECG/NN (/-LRB- 2/CD s/NN ,/, minimum/JJ 86/CD percent/NN sensitivity/NN per/IN class/NN )/-RRB- than/IN previously/RB imagined/VBN ./.
Ensembles/NNS of/IN classifiers/NNS acting/VBG on/IN 1/CD s/NN segments/NNS taken/VBN over/IN 5/CD s/NN observation/NN windows/NNS gave/VBD best/JJS results/NNS ,/, with/IN sensitivities/NNS of/IN detection/NN for/IN all/DT classes/NNS exceeding/VBG 93/CD percent/NN ./.
