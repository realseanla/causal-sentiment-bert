Several/JJ studies/NNS on/IN sentence/NN processing/NN suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT mental/JJ lexicon/NN keeps/VBZ track/NN of/IN the/DT mutual/JJ expectations/NNS between/IN words/NNS ./.
Current/JJ DSMs/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, represent/VBP context/NN words/NNS as/IN separate/JJ features/NNS ,/, which/WDT causes/VBZ the/DT loss/NN of/IN important/JJ information/NN for/IN word/NN expectations/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN word/NN order/NN and/CC interrelations/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT DSM/NNP which/WDT addresses/VBZ the/DT issue/NN by/IN defining/VBG verb/VB contexts/NNS as/IN joint/JJ dependencies/NNS ./.
We/PRP test/VBP our/PRP$ representation/NN in/IN a/DT verb/VB similarity/NN task/NN on/IN two/CD datasets/NNS ,/, showing/VBG that/IN joint/JJ contexts/NNS are/VBP more/RBR efficient/JJ than/IN single/JJ dependencies/NNS ,/, even/RB with/IN a/DT relatively/RB small/JJ amount/NN of/IN training/NN data/NNS ./.
