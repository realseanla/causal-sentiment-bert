Matrix/NN factorization/NN (/-LRB- MF/NN )/-RRB- and/CC Autoencoder/NN (/-LRB- AE/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP among/IN the/DT most/RBS successful/JJ approaches/NNS of/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN ./.
While/IN MF/NNP based/VBN models/NNS have/VBP been/VBN extensively/RB exploited/VBN in/IN the/DT graph/NN modeling/NN and/CC link/NN prediction/NN literature/NN ,/, the/DT AE/NN family/NN has/VBZ not/RB gained/VBN much/JJ attention/NN ./.
