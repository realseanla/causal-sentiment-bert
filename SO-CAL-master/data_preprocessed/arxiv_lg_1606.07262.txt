We/PRP study/VBP the/DT theoretical/JJ capacity/NN to/TO statistically/RB learn/VB local/JJ landscape/NN information/NN by/IN Evolution/NN Strategies/NNS (/-LRB- ESs/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT covariance/NN matrix/NN when/WRB constructed/VBN by/IN ESs/NNS operating/VBG with/IN the/DT selection/NN operator/NN alone/RB ./.
