Object/NN recognition/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ task/NN in/IN image/NN processing/NN and/CC computer/NN vision/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT perfect/JJ method/NN for/IN object/NN recognition/NN with/IN full/JJ boundary/NN detection/NN by/IN combining/VBG affine/NN scale/NN invariant/JJ feature/NN transform/VB (/-LRB- ASIFT/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC a/DT region/NN merging/VBG algorithm/NN ./.
ASIFT/NN is/VBZ a/DT fully/RB affine/JJ invariant/JJ algorithm/NN that/WDT means/VBZ features/NNS are/VBP invariant/JJ to/IN six/CD affine/JJ parameters/NNS namely/RB translation/NN (/-LRB- 2/CD parameters/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, zoom/NN ,/, rotation/NN and/CC two/CD camera/NN axis/NN orientations/NNS ./.
The/DT features/NNS are/VBP very/RB reliable/JJ and/CC give/VB us/PRP strong/JJ keypoints/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN matching/VBG between/IN different/JJ images/NNS of/IN an/DT object/NN ./.
We/PRP trained/VBD an/DT object/NN in/IN several/JJ images/NNS with/IN different/JJ aspects/NNS for/IN finding/VBG best/JJS keypoints/NNS of/IN it/PRP ./.
Then/RB ,/, a/DT robust/JJ region/NN merging/VBG algorithm/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO recognize/VB and/CC detect/VB the/DT object/NN with/IN full/JJ boundary/NN in/IN the/DT other/JJ images/NNS based/VBN on/IN ASIFT/NNP keypoints/NNS and/CC a/DT similarity/NN measure/NN for/IN merging/VBG regions/NNS in/IN the/DT image/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT presented/VBN method/NN is/VBZ very/RB efficient/JJ and/CC powerful/JJ to/TO recognize/VB the/DT object/NN and/CC detect/VB it/PRP with/IN high/JJ accuracy/NN ./.
