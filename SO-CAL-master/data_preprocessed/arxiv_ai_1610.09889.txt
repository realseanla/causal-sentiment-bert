Chinese/JJ poetry/NN generation/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB challenging/JJ task/NN in/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ two/CD -/HYPH stage/NN poetry/NN generating/NN method/NN which/WDT first/RB plans/VBZ the/DT sub-topics/NNS of/IN the/DT poem/NN according/VBG to/IN the/DT user/NN 's/POS writing/NN intent/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB generates/VBZ each/DT line/NN of/IN the/DT poem/NN sequentially/RB ,/, using/VBG a/DT modified/VBN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN encoder/NN -/HYPH decoder/NN framework/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN planning/NN -/HYPH based/VBN method/NN can/MD ensure/VB that/IN the/DT generated/VBN poem/NN is/VBZ coherent/JJ and/CC semantically/RB consistent/JJ with/IN the/DT user/NN 's/POS intent/NN ./.
A/DT comprehensive/JJ evaluation/NN with/IN human/JJ judgments/NNS demonstrates/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN approach/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN poetry/NN generating/VBG methods/NNS and/CC the/DT poem/NN quality/NN is/VBZ somehow/RB comparable/JJ to/IN human/JJ poets/NNS ./.
