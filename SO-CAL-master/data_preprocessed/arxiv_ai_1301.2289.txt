Many/JJ real/JJ life/NN domains/NNS contain/VBP a/DT mixture/NN of/IN discrete/JJ and/CC continuous/JJ variables/NNS and/CC can/MD be/VB modeled/VBN as/IN hybrid/JJ Bayesian/JJ Networks/NNS ./.
Animportant/JJ subclass/NN of/IN hybrid/NN BNs/NNS are/VBP conditional/JJ linear/JJ Gaussian/NNP (/-LRB- CLG/NNP )/-RRB- networks/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT conditional/JJ distribution/NN of/IN the/DT continuous/JJ variables/NNS given/VBN an/DT assignment/NN to/IN the/DT discrete/JJ variables/NNS is/VBZ a/DT multivariate/JJ Gaussian/NNP ./.
