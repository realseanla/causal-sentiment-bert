This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN to/IN modeling/VBG curiosity/NN in/IN a/DT mobile/JJ robot/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ useful/JJ for/IN monitoring/NN and/CC adaptive/JJ data/NNS collection/NN tasks/NNS ,/, especially/RB in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN long/JJ term/NN autonomous/JJ missions/NNS where/WRB pre-programmed/JJ missions/NNS are/VBP likely/JJ to/TO have/VB limited/VBN utility/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP a/DT realtime/NN topic/NN modeling/NN technique/NN to/TO build/VB a/DT semantic/JJ perception/NN model/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, using/VBG which/WDT ,/, we/PRP plan/VBP a/DT path/NN through/IN the/DT locations/NNS in/IN the/DT world/NN with/IN high/JJ semantic/JJ information/NN content/NN ./.
The/DT life/NN -/HYPH long/JJ learning/NN behavior/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN perception/NN model/NN makes/VBZ it/PRP suitable/JJ for/IN long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN exploration/NN missions/NNS ./.
We/PRP validate/VBP the/DT approach/NN using/VBG simulated/VBN exploration/NN experiments/NNS using/VBG aerial/JJ and/CC underwater/JJ data/NNS ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP an/DT implementation/NN on/IN the/DT Aqua/NNP underwater/JJ robot/NN in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN scenarios/NNS ./.
We/PRP find/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN exploration/NN paths/NNS that/WDT are/VBP biased/JJ towards/IN locations/NNS with/IN high/JJ topic/NN perplexity/NN ,/, produce/VB better/JJR terrain/NN models/NNS with/IN high/JJ discriminative/JJ power/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN implemented/VBN on/IN Aqua/NNP robot/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO do/VB tasks/NNS such/JJ as/IN coral/NN reef/NN inspection/NN ,/, diver/NN following/VBG ,/, and/CC sea/NN floor/NN exploration/NN ,/, without/IN any/DT prior/JJ training/NN or/CC preparation/NN ./.
