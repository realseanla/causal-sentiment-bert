The/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN machine/NN -/HYPH learning/NN techniques/NNS to/IN compilation/NN tasks/NNS can/MD be/VB largely/RB attributed/VBN to/IN the/DT recent/JJ development/NN and/CC advancement/NN of/IN program/NN characterization/NN ,/, a/DT process/NN that/WDT numerically/RB or/CC structurally/RB quantifies/VBZ a/DT target/NN program/NN ./.
While/IN great/JJ achievements/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN in/IN identifying/VBG key/JJ features/NNS to/TO characterize/VB programs/NNS ,/, choosing/VBG a/DT correct/JJ set/NN of/IN features/NNS for/IN a/DT specific/JJ compiler/NN task/NN remains/VBZ an/DT ad/FW hoc/FW procedure/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO guarantee/VB a/DT comprehensive/JJ coverage/NN of/IN features/NNS ,/, compiler/NN engineers/NNS usually/RB need/VBP to/TO select/VB excessive/JJ number/NN of/IN features/NNS ./.
This/DT ,/, unfortunately/RB ,/, would/MD potentially/RB lead/VB to/IN a/DT selection/NN of/IN multiple/JJ similar/JJ features/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN turn/NN could/MD create/VB a/DT new/JJ problem/NN of/IN bias/NN that/WDT emphasizes/VBZ certain/JJ aspects/NNS of/IN a/DT program/NN 's/POS characteristics/NNS ,/, hence/RB reducing/VBG the/DT accuracy/NN and/CC performance/NN of/IN the/DT target/NN compiler/NN task/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP FEAture/NN Selection/NN for/IN compilation/NN Tasks/NNS (/-LRB- FEAST/NN )/-RRB- ,/, an/DT efficient/JJ and/CC automated/VBN framework/NN for/IN determining/VBG the/DT most/RBS relevant/JJ and/CC representative/JJ features/NNS from/IN a/DT feature/NN pool/NN ./.
