Answer/NN Set/VBN Programming/NN (/-LRB- ASP/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ logic/NN programming/NN under/IN the/DT stable/JJ model/NN or/CC answer/NN set/VBN semantics/NNS ./.
During/IN the/DT last/JJ decade/NN ,/, this/DT paradigm/NN has/VBZ seen/VBN several/JJ extensions/NNS by/IN generalizing/VBG the/DT notion/NN of/IN atom/NN used/VBN in/IN these/DT programs/NNS ./.
Among/IN these/DT ,/, there/EX are/VBP aggregate/JJ atoms/NNS ,/, HEX/NN atoms/NNS ,/, generalized/VBN quantifiers/NNS ,/, and/CC abstract/JJ constraints/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP refer/VBP to/IN these/DT constructs/NNS collectively/RB as/IN generalized/VBN atoms/NNS ./.
The/DT idea/NN common/JJ to/IN all/DT of/IN these/DT constructs/NNS is/VBZ that/IN their/PRP$ satisfaction/NN depends/VBZ on/IN the/DT truth/NN values/NNS of/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN (/-LRB- non-generalized/JJ )/-RRB- atoms/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN the/DT truth/NN value/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ (/-LRB- non-generalized/JJ )/-RRB- atom/NN ./.
Motivated/VBN by/IN several/JJ examples/NNS ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN for/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT more/JJR intricate/JJ generalized/VBN atoms/NNS ,/, the/DT previously/RB suggested/VBN semantics/NNS provide/VBP unintuitive/JJ results/NNS and/CC provide/VB an/DT alternative/JJ semantics/NNS ,/, which/WDT we/PRP call/VBP supportedly/RB stable/JJ or/CC SFLP/NN answer/NN sets/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/IN the/DT major/JJ previously/RB proposed/VBN semantics/NNS for/IN programs/NNS with/IN convex/NN generalized/VBN atoms/NNS ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRP in/IN general/JJ admits/VBZ more/RBR intended/JJ models/NNS than/IN other/JJ semantics/NNS in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN non-convex/JJ generalized/VBN atoms/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT complexity/NN of/IN supportedly/NN stable/JJ models/NNS is/VBZ on/IN the/DT second/JJ level/NN of/IN the/DT polynomial/JJ hierarchy/NN ,/, similar/JJ to/IN previous/JJ proposals/NNS and/CC to/IN stable/JJ models/NNS of/IN disjunctive/JJ logic/NN programs/NNS ./.
Given/VBN these/DT complexity/NN results/NNS ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP a/DT compilation/NN method/NN that/WDT compactly/RB transforms/VBZ programs/NNS with/IN generalized/VBN atoms/NNS in/IN disjunctive/JJ normal/JJ form/NN to/IN programs/NNS without/IN generalized/VBN atoms/NNS ./.
Variants/NNS are/VBP given/VBN for/IN the/DT new/JJ supportedly/NN stable/JJ and/CC the/DT existing/VBG FLP/NN semantics/NNS ,/, for/IN which/WDT a/DT similar/JJ compilation/NN technique/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN known/VBN so/RB far/RB ./.
