In/IN a/DT supervisory/JJ control/NN system/NN the/DT human/JJ agent/NN knowledge/NN of/IN past/NN ,/, current/JJ ,/, and/CC future/JJ system/NN behavior/NN is/VBZ critical/JJ for/IN system/NN performance/NN ./.
Being/VBG able/JJ to/TO reason/VB about/IN that/DT knowledge/NN in/IN a/DT precise/JJ and/CC structured/JJ manner/NN is/VBZ central/JJ to/IN effective/JJ system/NN design/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT application/NN of/IN a/DT well/RB -/HYPH established/VBN formal/JJ approach/NN to/IN reasoning/NN about/IN knowledge/NN to/IN the/DT modeling/NN and/CC analysis/NN of/IN complex/JJ human/JJ -/HYPH automation/NN systems/NNS ./.
An/DT intuitive/JJ notion/NN of/IN knowledge/NN in/IN human/JJ -/HYPH automation/NN systems/NNS is/VBZ sketched/JJ and/CC then/RB cast/VBD as/IN a/DT formal/JJ model/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT case/NN study/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT approach/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO model/VB and/CC reason/VB about/RB a/DT classic/JJ problem/NN from/IN the/DT human/JJ -/HYPH automation/NN systems/NNS literature/NN ;/: the/DT results/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ analysis/NN provide/VB evidence/NN for/IN the/DT validity/NN and/CC value/NN of/IN reasoning/NN about/IN complex/NN systems/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN agents/NNS ./.
To/TO conclude/VB ,/, we/PRP discuss/VBP research/NN directions/NNS that/WDT will/MD extend/VB this/DT approach/NN ,/, and/CC note/VB several/JJ systems/NNS in/IN the/DT aviation/NN and/CC human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN team/NN domains/NNS that/WDT are/VBP of/IN particular/JJ interest/NN ./.
