Tissue/NN segmentation/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ pre-requisite/NN for/IN efficient/JJ and/CC accurate/JJ diagnostics/NNS in/IN digital/JJ pathology/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ well/RB known/VBN that/IN whole/JJ -/HYPH slide/NN scanners/NNS can/MD fail/VB in/IN detecting/VBG all/DT tissue/NN regions/NNS ,/, for/IN example/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT tissue/NN type/NN ,/, or/CC due/IN to/IN weak/JJ staining/NN because/IN their/PRP$ tissue/NN detection/NN algorithms/NNS are/VBP not/RB robust/JJ enough/RB ./.
