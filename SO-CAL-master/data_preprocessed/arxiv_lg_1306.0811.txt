Multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN problems/NNS are/VBP receiving/VBG a/DT great/JJ deal/NN of/IN attention/NN because/IN they/PRP adequately/RB formalize/VB the/DT exploration/NN -/HYPH exploitation/NN trade/NN -/HYPH offs/NNS arising/VBG in/IN several/JJ industrially/RB relevant/JJ applications/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN online/JJ advertisement/NN and/CC ,/, more/RBR generally/RB ,/, recommendation/NN systems/NNS ./.
