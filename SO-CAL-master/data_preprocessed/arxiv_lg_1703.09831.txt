We/PRP tackle/VBP a/DT task/NN where/WRB an/DT agent/NN learns/VBZ to/TO navigate/VB in/IN a/DT 2D/NN maze/NN -/HYPH like/JJ environment/NN called/VBN XWORLD/NNP ./.

Our/PRP$ deep/JJ framework/NN for/IN the/DT agent/NN is/VBZ trained/VBN end/NN to/IN end/NN :/: it/PRP learns/VBZ simultaneously/RB the/DT visual/JJ representations/NNS of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, the/DT syntax/NN and/CC semantics/NNS of/IN the/DT language/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT action/NN module/NN that/IN outputs/NNS actions/NNS ./.
