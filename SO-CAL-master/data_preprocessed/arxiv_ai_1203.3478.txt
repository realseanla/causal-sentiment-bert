In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT class/NN of/IN Markov/NNP decision/NN processes/NNS that/WDT arise/VBP as/IN a/DT natural/JJ model/NN for/IN many/JJ renewable/JJ resource/NN allocation/NN problems/NNS ./.
Upon/IN extending/VBG results/NNS from/IN the/DT inventory/NN control/NN literature/NN ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN they/PRP admit/VBP a/DT closed/JJ form/NN solution/NN and/CC we/PRP show/VBP how/WRB to/TO exploit/VB this/DT structure/NN to/TO speed/VB up/RP its/PRP$ computation/NN ./.
We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN framework/NN to/IN several/JJ problems/NNS arising/VBG in/IN very/RB different/JJ domains/NNS ,/, and/CC as/IN part/NN of/IN the/DT ongoing/JJ effort/NN in/IN the/DT emerging/VBG field/NN of/IN Computational/JJ Sustainability/NN we/PRP discuss/VBP in/IN detail/NN its/PRP$ application/NN to/IN the/DT Northern/NNP Pacific/NNP Halibut/NNP marine/NNP fishery/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/IN a/DT model/NN based/VBN on/IN real/JJ world/NN data/NNS ,/, obtaining/VBG a/DT policy/NN with/IN a/DT guaranteed/VBN lower/JJR bound/VBN on/IN the/DT utility/NN function/NN that/WDT is/VBZ structurally/RB very/RB different/JJ from/IN the/DT one/CD currently/RB employed/VBN ./.
