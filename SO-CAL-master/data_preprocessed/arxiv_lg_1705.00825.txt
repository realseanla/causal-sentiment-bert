Feature/NN selection/NN is/VBZ a/DT useful/JJ technique/NN for/IN alleviating/VBG the/DT curse/NN of/IN dimensionality/NN in/IN multi-view/JJ learning/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP unsupervised/JJ feature/NN selection/NN for/IN multi-view/JJ data/NNS ,/, as/IN class/NN labels/NNS are/VBP usually/RB expensive/JJ to/TO obtain/VB ./.
Traditional/JJ feature/NN selection/NN methods/NNS are/VBP mostly/RB designed/VBN for/IN single/JJ -/HYPH view/NN data/NNS and/CC can/MD not/RB fully/RB exploit/VB the/DT rich/JJ information/NN from/IN multi-view/JJ data/NNS ./.
