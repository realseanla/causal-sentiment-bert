Deep/JJ learning/NN methods/NNS have/VBP resulted/VBN in/IN significant/JJ performance/NN improvements/NNS in/IN several/JJ application/NN domains/NNS and/CC as/IN such/JJ several/JJ software/NN frameworks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN developed/VBN to/TO facilitate/VB their/PRP$ implementation/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT comparative/JJ study/NN of/IN four/CD deep/JJ learning/NN frameworks/NNS ,/, namely/RB Caffe/NNP ,/, Neon/NNP ,/, Theano/NNP ,/, and/CC Torch/NNP ,/, on/IN three/CD aspects/NNS :/: extensibility/NN ,/, hardware/NN utilization/NN ,/, and/CC speed/NN ./.
The/DT study/NN is/VBZ performed/VBN on/IN several/JJ types/NNS of/IN deep/JJ learning/NN architectures/NNS and/CC we/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT above/JJ frameworks/NNS when/WRB employed/VBN on/IN a/DT single/JJ machine/NN for/IN both/DT (/-LRB- multi-threaded/JJ )/-RRB- CPU/NN and/CC GPU/NN (/-LRB- Nvidia/NNP Titan/NNP X/NNP )/-RRB- settings/NNS ./.
