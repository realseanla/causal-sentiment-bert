Top/JJ -/HYPH down/JJ induction/NN of/IN decision/NN trees/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN observed/VBN to/TO suffer/VB from/IN the/DT inadequate/JJ functioning/NN of/IN the/DT pruning/NN phase/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ known/VBN that/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT resulting/VBG tree/NN grows/VBZ linearly/RB with/IN the/DT sample/NN size/NN ,/, even/RB though/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT tree/NN does/VBZ not/RB improve/VB ./.
Reduced/VBN Error/NN Pruning/NN is/VBZ an/DT algorithm/NN that/WDT has/VBZ been/VBN used/VBN as/IN a/DT representative/NN technique/NN in/IN attempts/NNS to/TO explain/VB the/DT problems/NNS of/IN decision/NN tree/NN learning/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP analyses/NNS of/IN Reduced/VBN Error/NN Pruning/NN in/IN three/CD different/JJ settings/NNS ./.
First/RB we/PRP study/VBP the/DT basic/JJ algorithmic/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT method/NN ,/, properties/NNS that/WDT hold/VBP independent/JJ of/IN the/DT input/NN decision/NN tree/NN and/CC pruning/NN examples/NNS ./.
Then/RB we/PRP examine/VBP a/DT situation/NN that/WDT intuitively/RB should/MD lead/VB to/IN the/DT subtree/NN under/IN consideration/NN to/TO be/VB replaced/VBN by/IN a/DT leaf/NN node/NN ,/, one/CD in/IN which/WDT the/DT class/NN label/NN and/CC attribute/NN values/NNS of/IN the/DT pruning/NN examples/NNS are/VBP independent/JJ of/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
This/DT analysis/NN is/VBZ conducted/VBN under/IN two/CD different/JJ assumptions/NNS ./.
The/DT general/JJ analysis/NN shows/VBZ that/IN the/DT pruning/NN probability/NN of/IN a/DT node/NN fitting/VBG pure/JJ noise/NN is/VBZ bounded/VBN by/IN a/DT function/NN that/WDT decreases/VBZ exponentially/RB as/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT tree/NN grows/VBZ ./.
In/IN a/DT specific/JJ analysis/NN we/PRP assume/VBP that/IN the/DT examples/NNS are/VBP distributed/VBN uniformly/RB to/IN the/DT tree/NN ./.
This/DT assumption/NN lets/VBZ us/PRP approximate/JJ the/DT number/NN of/IN subtrees/NNS that/WDT are/VBP pruned/VBN because/IN they/PRP do/VBP not/RB receive/VB any/DT pruning/NN examples/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN clarifies/VBZ the/DT different/JJ variants/NNS of/IN the/DT Reduced/VBN Error/NN Pruning/NN algorithm/NN ,/, brings/VBZ new/JJ insight/NN to/IN its/PRP$ algorithmic/JJ properties/NNS ,/, analyses/NNS the/DT algorithm/NN with/IN less/JJR imposed/VBN assumptions/NNS than/IN before/RB ,/, and/CC includes/VBZ the/DT previously/RB overlooked/VBN empty/JJ subtrees/NNS to/IN the/DT analysis/NN ./.
