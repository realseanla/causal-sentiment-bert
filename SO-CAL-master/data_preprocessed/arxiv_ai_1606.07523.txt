Information/NN delivery/NN in/IN a/DT network/NN of/IN agents/NNS is/VBZ a/DT key/JJ issue/NN for/IN large/JJ ,/, complex/JJ systems/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO do/VB so/RB in/IN a/DT predictable/JJ ,/, efficient/JJ manner/NN ./.
The/DT delivery/NN of/IN information/NN in/IN such/JJ multi-agent/JJ systems/NNS is/VBZ typically/RB implemented/VBN through/IN routing/NN protocols/NNS that/WDT determine/VBP how/WRB information/NN flows/VBZ through/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
