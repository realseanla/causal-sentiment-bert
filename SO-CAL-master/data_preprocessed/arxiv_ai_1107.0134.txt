A/DT time/NN series/NN consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN values/NNS or/CC events/NNS obtained/VBN over/IN repeated/VBN measurements/NNS in/IN time/NN ./.
Analysis/NN of/IN time/NN series/NN represents/VBZ and/CC important/JJ tool/NN in/IN many/JJ application/NN areas/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN stock/NN market/NN analysis/NN ,/, process/NN and/CC quality/NN control/NN ,/, observation/NN of/IN natural/JJ phenomena/NN ,/, medical/JJ treatments/NNS ,/, etc/FW ./.
A/DT vital/JJ component/NN in/IN many/JJ types/NNS of/IN time/NN -/HYPH series/NN analysis/NN is/VBZ the/DT choice/NN of/IN an/DT appropriate/JJ distance/NN //HYPH similarity/NN measure/NN ./.
Numerous/JJ measures/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/IN date/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT most/RBS successful/JJ ones/NNS based/VBN on/IN dynamic/JJ programming/NN ./.
Being/VBG of/IN quadratic/JJ time/NN complexity/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, global/JJ constraints/NNS are/VBP often/RB employed/VBN to/TO limit/VB the/DT search/NN space/NN in/IN the/DT matrix/NN during/IN the/DT dynamic/JJ programming/NN procedure/NN ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO speed/VB up/RP computation/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP two/CD representative/JJ time/NN -/HYPH series/NN distance/NN //HYPH similarity/NN measures/NNS based/VBN on/IN dynamic/JJ programming/NN ,/, Dynamic/JJ Time/NN Warping/NN (/-LRB- DTW/NN )/-RRB- and/CC Longest/NNP Common/NNP Subsequence/NNP (/-LRB- LCS/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC the/DT effects/NNS of/IN global/JJ constraints/NNS on/IN them/PRP ./.
Through/IN extensive/JJ experiments/NNS on/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN time/NN -/HYPH series/NN data/NNS sets/NNS ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP how/WRB global/JJ constrains/VBZ can/MD significantly/RB reduce/VB the/DT computation/NN time/NN of/IN DTW/NN and/CC LCS/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB show/VBP that/IN ,/, if/IN the/DT constraint/NN parameter/NN is/VBZ tight/JJ enough/RB (/-LRB- less/JJR than/IN 10/CD -/SYM 15/CD percent/NN of/IN time/NN -/HYPH series/NN length/NN )/-RRB- ,/, the/DT constrained/JJ measure/NN becomes/VBZ significantly/RB different/JJ from/IN its/PRP$ unconstrained/JJ counterpart/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN producing/VBG qualitatively/RB different/JJ 1/CD -/HYPH nearest/JJS neighbor/NN graphs/NNS ./.
This/DT observation/NN explains/VBZ the/DT potential/NN for/IN accuracy/NN gains/NNS when/WRB using/VBG constrained/VBN measures/NNS ,/, highlighting/VBG the/DT need/NN for/IN careful/JJ tuning/NN of/IN constraint/NN parameters/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB a/DT good/JJ trade/NN -/HYPH off/NN between/IN speed/NN and/CC accuracy/NN ./.
