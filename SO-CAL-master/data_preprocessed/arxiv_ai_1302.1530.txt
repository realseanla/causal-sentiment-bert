This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT induction/NN if/IN complex/JJ finite/JJ state/NN automata/NN from/IN samples/NNS of/IN behavior/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN information/NN theoretic/JJ principles/NNS ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN reduces/VBZ the/DT search/NN space/NN by/IN many/JJ orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN over/IN what/WP was/VBD previously/RB thought/VBN possible/JJ ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP the/DT algorithm/NN with/IN some/DT existing/VBG induction/NN techniques/NNS for/IN finite/JJ state/NN automata/NN and/CC show/VBP that/IN the/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ much/JJ superior/JJ in/IN both/CC run/VB time/NN and/CC quality/NN of/IN inductions/NNS ./.
