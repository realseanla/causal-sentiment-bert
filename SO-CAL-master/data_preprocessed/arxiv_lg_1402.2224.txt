In/IN 2008/CD ,/, Kasiviswanathan/NNP et/FW al./FW defined/VBN private/JJ learning/NN as/IN a/DT combination/NN of/IN PAC/NN learning/NN and/CC differential/JJ privacy/NN ./.
Informally/RB ,/, a/DT private/JJ learner/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN to/IN a/DT collection/NN of/IN labeled/VBN individual/JJ information/NN and/CC outputs/NNS a/DT hypothesis/NN while/IN preserving/VBG the/DT privacy/NN of/IN each/DT individual/NN ./.
Kasiviswanathan/NNP et/FW al./FW gave/VBD a/DT generic/JJ construction/NN of/IN private/JJ learners/NNS for/IN (/-LRB- finite/NN )/-RRB- concept/NN classes/NNS ,/, with/IN sample/NN complexity/NN logarithmic/JJ in/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT concept/NN class/NN ./.
This/DT sample/NN complexity/NN is/VBZ higher/JJR than/IN what/WP is/VBZ needed/VBN for/IN non-private/JJ learners/NNS ,/, hence/RB leaving/VBG open/JJ the/DT possibility/NN that/IN the/DT sample/NN complexity/NN of/IN private/JJ learning/NN may/MD be/VB sometimes/RB significantly/RB higher/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN non-private/JJ learning/NN ./.
