In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, concepts/NNS and/CC methods/NNS of/IN complex/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN employed/VBN to/TO tackle/VB the/DT word/NN sense/NN disambiguation/NN (/-LRB- WSD/NN )/-RRB- task/NN by/IN representing/VBG words/NNS as/IN nodes/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP connected/VBN if/IN they/PRP are/VBP semantically/RB similar/JJ ./.
Despite/IN the/DT increasingly/RB number/NN of/IN studies/NNS carried/VBD out/RP with/IN such/JJ models/NNS ,/, most/JJS of/IN them/PRP use/VBP networks/NNS just/RB to/TO represent/VB the/DT data/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT pattern/NN recognition/NN performed/VBN on/IN the/DT attribute/NN space/NN is/VBZ performed/VBN using/VBG traditional/JJ learning/NN techniques/NNS ./.
In/IN other/JJ words/NNS ,/, the/DT structural/JJ relationship/NN between/IN words/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN explicitly/RB used/VBN in/IN the/DT pattern/NN recognition/NN process/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, only/RB a/DT few/JJ investigations/NNS have/VBP probed/VBN the/DT suitability/NN of/IN representations/NNS based/VBN on/IN bipartite/JJ networks/NNS and/CC graphs/NNS (/-LRB- bigraphs/NNS )/-RRB- for/IN the/DT problem/NN ,/, as/IN many/JJ approaches/NNS consider/VBP all/DT possible/JJ links/NNS between/IN words/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, we/PRP assess/VBP the/DT relevance/NN of/IN a/DT bipartite/JJ network/NN model/NN representing/VBG both/CC feature/NN words/NNS (/-LRB- i.e./FW the/DT words/NNS characterizing/VBG the/DT context/NN )/-RRB- and/CC target/NN (/-LRB- ambiguous/JJ )/-RRB- words/NNS to/TO solve/VB ambiguities/NNS in/IN written/VBN texts/NNS ./.
Here/RB ,/, we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN the/DT semantical/JJ relationships/NNS between/IN these/DT two/CD type/NN of/IN words/NNS ,/, disregarding/VBG the/DT relationships/NNS between/IN feature/NN words/NNS ./.
In/IN special/JJ ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN not/RB only/RB serves/VBZ to/TO represent/VB texts/NNS as/IN graphs/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB constructs/VBZ a/DT structure/NN on/IN which/WDT the/DT discrimination/NN of/IN senses/NNS is/VBZ accomplished/VBN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS revealed/VBD that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN learning/NN algorithm/NN in/IN such/JJ bipartite/JJ networks/NNS provides/VBZ excellent/JJ results/NNS mostly/RB when/WRB topical/JJ features/NNS are/VBP employed/VBN to/TO characterize/VB the/DT context/NN ./.
Surprisingly/RB ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN even/RB outperformed/VBD the/DT support/NN vector/NN machine/NN algorithm/NN in/IN particular/JJ cases/NNS ,/, with/IN the/DT advantage/NN of/IN being/VBG robust/JJ even/RB if/IN a/DT small/JJ training/NN dataset/NN is/VBZ available/JJ ./.
Taken/VBN together/RB ,/, the/DT results/NNS obtained/VBN here/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN representation/NN //HYPH classification/NN method/NN might/MD be/VB useful/JJ to/TO improve/VB the/DT semantical/JJ characterization/NN of/IN written/VBN texts/NNS ./.
