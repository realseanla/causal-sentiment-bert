We/PRP study/VBP the/DT design/NN of/IN pricing/NN mechanisms/NNS and/CC auctions/NNS when/WRB the/DT mechanism/NN designer/NN does/VBZ not/RB know/VB the/DT distribution/NN of/IN buyers/NNS '/POS values/NNS ./.
Instead/RB the/DT mechanism/NN designer/NN receives/VBZ a/DT set/NN of/IN samples/NNS from/IN this/DT distribution/NN and/CC his/PRP$ goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO use/VB the/DT sample/NN to/TO design/VB a/DT pricing/NN mechanism/NN or/CC auction/NN with/IN high/JJ expected/VBN profit/NN ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP generalization/NN guarantees/NNS which/WDT bound/VBD the/DT difference/NN between/IN average/JJ profit/NN on/IN the/DT sample/NN and/CC expected/VBD profit/NN over/IN the/DT distribution/NN ./.
These/DT bounds/NNS are/VBP directly/RB proportional/JJ to/IN the/DT intrinsic/JJ complexity/NN of/IN the/DT mechanism/NN class/NN the/DT designer/NN is/VBZ optimizing/VBG over/RP ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT single/JJ ,/, overarching/JJ theorem/NN that/WDT uses/VBZ empirical/JJ Rademacher/NNP complexity/NN to/TO measure/VB the/DT intrinsic/JJ complexity/NN of/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN widely/RB -/HYPH studied/VBN single/JJ -/HYPH and/CC multi-item/JJ auction/NN classes/NNS ,/, including/VBG affine/JJ maximizer/NN auctions/NNS ,/, mixed/JJ -/HYPH bundling/VBG auctions/NNS ,/, and/CC second/JJ -/HYPH price/NN item/NN auctions/NNS ./.
Despite/IN the/DT extensive/JJ applicability/NN of/IN our/PRP$ main/JJ theorem/NN ,/, we/PRP match/VBP and/CC improve/VBP over/IN the/DT best/RBS -/HYPH known/VBN generalization/NN guarantees/NNS for/IN many/JJ auction/NN classes/NNS ./.
This/DT all/RB -/HYPH encompassing/VBG theorem/NN also/RB applies/VBZ to/IN multi/JJ -/HYPH and/CC single/JJ -/HYPH item/NN pricing/NN mechanisms/NNS in/IN both/DT multi/JJ -/HYPH and/CC single/JJ -/HYPH unit/NN settings/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN linear/JJ and/CC non-linear/JJ pricing/NN mechanisms/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, our/PRP$ central/JJ theorem/NN allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO easily/RB derive/VB generalization/NN guarantees/NNS for/IN every/DT class/NN in/IN several/JJ finely/RB grained/VBN hierarchies/NNS of/IN auction/NN and/CC pricing/NN mechanism/NN classes/NNS ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP how/WRB to/TO determine/VB the/DT precise/JJ level/NN in/IN a/DT hierarchy/NN with/IN the/DT optimal/JJ tradeoff/NN between/IN profit/NN and/CC generalization/NN using/VBG structural/JJ profit/NN maximization/NN ./.
The/DT mechanism/NN classes/NNS we/PRP study/VBP are/VBP significantly/RB different/JJ from/IN well/RB -/HYPH understood/VBN function/NN classes/NNS typically/RB found/VBN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN ,/, so/RB bounding/VBG their/PRP$ complexity/NN requires/VBZ a/DT sharp/JJ understanding/NN of/IN the/DT interplay/NN between/IN mechanism/NN parameters/NNS and/CC buyer/NN valuations/NNS ./.
