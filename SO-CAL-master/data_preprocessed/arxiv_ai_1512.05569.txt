In/IN multi-criteria/JJ decision/NN making/VBG (/-LRB- MCDM/NNP )/-RRB- problems/NNS ,/, ratings/NNS are/VBP assigned/VBN to/IN the/DT alternatives/NNS on/IN different/JJ criteria/NNS by/IN the/DT expert/NN group/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT thermodynamically/RB consistent/JJ model/NN for/IN MCDM/NNP using/VBG the/DT analogies/NNS for/IN thermodynamical/JJ indicators/NNS -/HYPH energy/NN ,/, exergy/NN and/CC entropy/NN ./.
The/DT most/RBS commonly/RB used/VBN method/NN for/IN analysing/VBG MCDM/NNP problem/NN is/VBZ Technique/NN for/IN Order/NNP of/IN Preference/NNP by/IN Similarity/NNP to/IN Ideal/NNP Solution/NNP (/-LRB- TOPSIS/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT conventional/JJ TOPSIS/NN method/NN uses/VBZ a/DT measure/NN similar/JJ to/IN that/DT of/IN energy/NN for/IN the/DT ranking/NN of/IN alternatives/NNS ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT ranking/NN of/IN the/DT alternatives/NNS is/VBZ more/RBR meaningful/JJ if/IN we/PRP use/VBP exergy/NN in/IN place/NN of/IN energy/NN ./.
The/DT use/NN of/IN exergy/NN is/VBZ superior/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN a/DT factor/NN accounting/NN for/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT ratings/NNS by/IN the/DT expert/NN group/NN ./.
The/DT unevenness/NN in/IN the/DT ratings/NNS by/IN the/DT experts/NNS is/VBZ measured/VBN by/IN entropy/NN ./.
The/DT procedure/NN for/IN the/DT calculation/NN of/IN the/DT thermodynamical/JJ indicators/NNS is/VBZ explained/VBN in/IN both/CC crisp/JJ and/CC fuzzy/JJ environment/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, two/CD case/NN studies/NNS are/VBP carried/VBN out/RP to/TO demonstrate/VB effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN model/NN ./.
