This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ information/NN directed/VBN sampling/NN --/: a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN balancing/VBG between/IN exploration/NN and/CC exploitation/NN in/IN online/JJ optimization/NN problems/NNS in/IN which/WDT a/DT decision/NN -/HYPH maker/NN must/MD learn/VB from/IN partial/JJ feedback/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN quantifies/VBZ the/DT amount/NN learned/VBN by/IN selecting/VBG an/DT action/NN through/IN an/DT information/NN theoretic/JJ measure/NN :/: the/DT mutual/JJ information/NN between/IN the/DT true/JJ optimal/JJ action/NN and/CC the/DT algorithm/NN 's/POS next/JJ observation/NN ./.
Actions/NNS are/VBP then/RB selected/VBN by/IN optimizing/VBG a/DT myopic/JJ objective/NN that/WDT balances/VBZ earning/VBG high/JJ immediate/JJ reward/NN and/CC acquiring/VBG information/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP this/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ provably/RB efficient/JJ and/CC is/VBZ empirically/RB efficient/JJ in/IN simulation/NN trials/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP novel/JJ and/CC general/JJ regret/NN bounds/NNS that/WDT scale/VBP with/IN the/DT entropy/NN of/IN the/DT optimal/JJ action/NN distribution/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, as/IN we/PRP highlight/VBP through/IN several/JJ examples/NNS ,/, information/NN directed/VBN sampling/NN sometimes/RB dramatically/RB outperforms/VBZ popular/JJ approaches/NNS like/IN UCB/NNP algorithms/NNS and/CC Thompson/NNP sampling/NN which/WDT do/VBP n't/RB quantify/VB the/DT information/NN provided/VBN by/IN different/JJ actions/NNS ./.
