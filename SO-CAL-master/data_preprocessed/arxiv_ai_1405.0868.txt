Outlier/NN detection/NN in/IN a/DT large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN database/NN is/VBZ a/DT significant/JJ and/CC complex/JJ issue/NN in/IN knowledge/NN discovering/VBG field/NN ./.
As/IN the/DT data/NNS distributions/NNS are/VBP obscure/JJ and/CC uncertain/JJ in/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ space/NN ,/, most/JJS existing/VBG solutions/NNS try/VBP to/TO solve/VB the/DT issue/NN taking/VBG into/IN account/NN the/DT two/CD intuitive/JJ points/NNS :/: first/RB ,/, outliers/NNS are/VBP extremely/RB far/RB away/RB from/IN other/JJ points/NNS in/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ space/NN ;/: second/RB ,/, outliers/NNS are/VBP detected/VBN obviously/RB different/JJ in/IN projected/VBN -/HYPH dimensional/JJ subspaces/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, for/IN a/DT complicated/JJ case/NN that/WDT outliers/NNS are/VBP hidden/VBN inside/IN the/DT normal/JJ points/NNS in/IN all/DT dimensions/NNS ,/, existing/VBG detection/NN methods/NNS fail/VBP to/TO find/VB such/JJ inner/JJ outliers/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN with/IN twice/RB dimension/NN -/HYPH projections/NNS ,/, which/WDT integrates/VBZ primary/JJ subspace/NN outlier/NN detection/NN and/CC secondary/JJ point/NN -/HYPH projection/NN between/IN subspaces/NNS ,/, and/CC sums/NNS up/IN the/DT multiple/JJ weight/NN values/NNS for/IN each/DT point/NN ./.
The/DT points/NNS are/VBP computed/VBN with/IN local/JJ density/NN ratio/NN separately/RB in/IN twice/RB -/HYPH projected/VBN dimensions/NNS ./.
After/IN the/DT process/NN ,/, outliers/NNS are/VBP those/DT points/NNS scoring/VBG the/DT largest/JJS values/NNS of/IN weight/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN succeeds/VBZ to/TO find/VB all/DT inner/JJ outliers/NNS on/IN the/DT synthetic/JJ test/NN datasets/NNS with/IN the/DT dimension/NN varying/VBG from/IN 100/CD to/IN 10000/CD ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS also/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN can/MD work/VB in/IN low/JJ dimensional/JJ space/NN and/CC can/MD achieve/VB perfect/JJ performance/NN in/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ space/NN ./.
As/IN for/IN this/DT reason/NN ,/, our/PRP$ proposed/VBN approach/NN has/VBZ considerable/JJ potential/NN to/TO apply/VB it/PRP in/IN multimedia/NN applications/NNS helping/VBG to/TO process/VB images/NNS or/CC video/NN with/IN large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN attributes/NNS ./.
