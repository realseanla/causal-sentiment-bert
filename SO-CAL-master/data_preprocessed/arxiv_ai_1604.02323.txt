Objects/NNS or/CC structures/NNS that/WDT are/VBP regular/JJ take/NN uniform/NN dimensions/NNS ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT concepts/NNS of/IN regular/JJ models/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ previous/JJ research/NN work/NN has/VBZ developed/VBN a/DT system/NN of/IN a/DT regular/JJ ontology/NN that/WDT models/NNS learning/VBG structures/NNS in/IN a/DT multiagent/JJ system/NN for/IN uniform/JJ pre-assessments/NNS in/IN a/DT learning/NN environment/NN ./.
This/DT regular/JJ ontology/NN has/VBZ led/VBN to/IN the/DT modelling/NN of/IN a/DT classified/JJ rules/NNS learning/VBG algorithm/NN that/WDT predicts/VBZ the/DT actual/JJ number/NN of/IN rules/NNS needed/VBN for/IN inductive/JJ learning/NN processes/NNS and/CC decision/NN making/VBG in/IN a/DT multiagent/JJ system/NN ./.

Thus/RB this/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT system/NN of/IN polynomial/JJ equation/NN that/WDT can/MD estimate/VB and/CC predict/VB the/DT required/VBN number/NN of/IN rules/NNS of/IN a/DT non-regular/JJ ontology/NN model/NN given/VBN some/DT defined/VBN parameters/NNS ./.
