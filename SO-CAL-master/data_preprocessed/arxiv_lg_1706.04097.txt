Non-negative/JJ matrix/NN factorization/NN is/VBZ a/DT basic/JJ tool/NN for/IN decomposing/VBG data/NNS into/IN the/DT feature/NN and/CC weight/NN matrices/NNS under/IN non-negativity/NN constraints/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN practice/NN is/VBZ often/RB solved/VBN in/IN the/DT alternating/VBG minimization/NN framework/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ unclear/JJ whether/IN such/JJ algorithms/NNS can/MD recover/VB the/DT ground/NN -/HYPH truth/NN feature/NN matrix/NN when/WRB the/DT weights/NNS for/IN different/JJ features/NNS are/VBP highly/RB correlated/VBN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ common/JJ in/IN applications/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ and/CC natural/JJ alternating/VBG gradient/NN descent/NN based/VBN algorithm/NN ,/, and/CC shows/VBZ that/IN with/IN a/DT mild/JJ initialization/NN it/PRP provably/RB recovers/VBZ the/DT ground/NN -/HYPH truth/NN in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN strong/JJ correlations/NNS ./.
