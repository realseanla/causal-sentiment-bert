Statistical/JJ Relational/JJ Learning/NN (/-LRB- SRL/NN )/-RRB- methods/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN that/IN classification/NN accuracy/NN can/MD be/VB improved/VBN by/IN integrating/VBG relations/NNS between/IN samples/NNS ./.
Techniques/NNS such/JJ as/IN iterative/JJ classification/NN or/CC relaxation/NN labeling/NN achieve/VB this/DT by/IN propagating/VBG information/NN between/IN related/JJ samples/NNS during/IN the/DT inference/NN process/NN ./.
When/WRB only/RB a/DT few/JJ samples/NNS are/VBP labeled/VBN and/CC connections/NNS between/IN samples/NNS are/VBP sparse/JJ ,/, collective/JJ inference/NN methods/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN large/JJ improvements/NNS over/IN standard/JJ feature/NN -/HYPH based/VBN ML/NNP methods/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN contrast/NN to/IN feature/NN based/VBN ML/NNP ,/, collective/JJ inference/NN methods/NNS require/VBP complex/JJ inference/NN procedures/NNS and/CC often/RB depend/VBP on/IN the/DT strong/JJ assumption/NN of/IN label/NN consistency/NN among/IN related/JJ samples/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP new/JJ relational/JJ features/NNS for/IN standard/JJ ML/NNP methods/NNS by/IN extracting/VBG information/NN from/IN direct/JJ and/CC indirect/JJ relations/NNS ./.
