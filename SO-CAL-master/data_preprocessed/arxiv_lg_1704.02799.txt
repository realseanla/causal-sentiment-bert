Improving/VBG the/DT precision/NN of/IN heart/NN diseases/NNS detection/NN has/VBZ been/VBN investigated/VBN by/IN many/JJ researchers/NNS in/IN the/DT literature/NN ./.
Such/JJ improvement/NN induced/VBN by/IN the/DT overwhelming/JJ health/NN care/NN expenditures/NNS and/CC erroneous/JJ diagnosis/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, various/JJ methodologies/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO analyze/VB the/DT disease/NN factors/NNS aiming/VBG to/TO decrease/VB the/DT physicians/NNS practice/NN variation/NN and/CC reduce/VB medical/JJ costs/NNS and/CC errors/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, our/PRP$ main/JJ motivation/NN is/VBZ to/TO develop/VB an/DT effective/JJ intelligent/JJ medical/JJ decision/NN support/NN system/NN based/VBN on/IN data/NNS mining/NN techniques/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT context/NN ,/, five/CD data/NNS mining/NN classifying/VBG algorithms/NNS ,/, with/IN large/JJ datasets/NNS ,/, have/VBP been/VBN utilized/VBN to/TO assess/VB and/CC analyze/VB the/DT risk/NN factors/NNS statistically/RB related/VBN to/IN heart/NN diseases/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO compare/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT implemented/VBN classifiers/NNS (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, Na/NN \/SYM "/`` ive/VB Bayes/NNS ,/, Decision/NN Tree/NNP ,/, Discriminant/NNP ,/, Random/NNP Forest/NNP ,/, and/CC Support/NN Vector/NNP Machine/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
To/TO underscore/VB the/DT practical/JJ viability/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN ,/, the/DT selected/VBN classifiers/NNS have/VBP been/VBN implemented/VBN using/VBG MATLAB/NNP tool/NN with/IN two/CD datasets/NNS ./.

However/RB ,/, the/DT decision/NN tree/NN outperforms/VBZ other/JJ classifiers/NNS with/IN an/DT accuracy/NN rate/NN of/IN 99.0/CD percent/NN followed/VBN by/IN Random/NNP forest/NN ./.
That/DT is/VBZ the/DT case/NN because/IN both/DT of/IN them/PRP have/VBP relatively/RB same/JJ mechanism/NN but/CC the/DT Random/NNP forest/NN can/MD build/VB ensemble/NN of/IN decision/NN tree/NN ./.
Although/IN ensemble/NN learning/NN has/VBZ been/VBN proved/VBN to/TO produce/VB superior/JJ results/NNS ,/, but/CC in/IN our/PRP$ case/NN the/DT decision/NN tree/NN has/VBZ outperformed/VBN its/PRP$ ensemble/NN version/NN ./.
