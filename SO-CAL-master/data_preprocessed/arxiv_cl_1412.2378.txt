Attributes/NNS of/IN words/NNS and/CC relations/NNS between/IN two/CD words/NNS are/VBP central/JJ to/IN numerous/JJ tasks/NNS in/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP such/JJ as/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN ,/, similarity/NN measurement/NN ,/, and/CC analogy/NN detection/NN ./.
Often/RB when/WRB two/CD words/NNS share/VBP one/CD or/CC more/JJR attributes/NNS in/IN common/JJ ,/, they/PRP are/VBP connected/VBN by/IN some/DT semantic/JJ relations/NNS ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, if/IN there/EX are/VBP numerous/JJ semantic/JJ relations/NNS between/IN two/CD words/NNS ,/, we/PRP can/MD expect/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT attributes/NNS of/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT words/NNS to/TO be/VB inherited/VBN by/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.
Motivated/VBN by/IN this/DT close/JJ connection/NN between/IN attributes/NNS and/CC relations/NNS ,/, given/VBN a/DT relational/JJ graph/NN in/IN which/WDT words/NNS are/VBP inter/AFX -/HYPH connected/VBN via/IN numerous/JJ semantic/JJ relations/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN to/TO learn/VB a/DT latent/JJ representation/NN for/IN the/DT individual/JJ words/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN considers/VBZ not/RB only/RB the/DT co-occurrences/NNS of/IN words/NNS as/RB done/VBN by/IN existing/VBG approaches/NNS for/IN word/NN representation/NN learning/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB the/DT semantic/JJ relations/NNS in/IN which/WDT two/CD words/NNS co-occur/NN ./.
To/TO evaluate/VB the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT word/NN representations/NNS learnt/VBN using/VBG the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN ,/, we/PRP use/VBP the/DT learnt/VBN word/NN representations/NNS to/TO solve/VB semantic/JJ word/NN analogy/NN problems/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO learn/VB better/JJR word/NN representations/NNS by/IN using/VBG semantic/JJ semantics/NNS between/IN words/NNS ./.
