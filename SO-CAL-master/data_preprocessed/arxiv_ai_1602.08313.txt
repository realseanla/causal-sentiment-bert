Mutation/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS important/JJ stages/NNS of/IN the/DT genetic/JJ algorithm/NN because/IN of/IN its/PRP$ impact/NN on/IN the/DT exploration/NN of/IN global/JJ optima/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO overcome/VB premature/JJ convergence/NN ./.
There/EX are/VBP many/JJ types/NNS of/IN mutation/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT problem/NN lies/VBZ in/IN selection/NN of/IN the/DT appropriate/JJ type/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT decision/NN becomes/VBZ more/RBR difficult/JJ and/CC needs/VBZ more/JJR trial/NN and/CC error/NN ./.
