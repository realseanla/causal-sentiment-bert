Recent/JJ work/NN in/IN automatic/JJ recognition/NN of/IN conversational/JJ telephone/NN speech/NN (/-LRB- CTS/NNP )/-RRB- has/VBZ achieved/VBN accuracy/NN levels/NNS comparable/JJ to/IN human/JJ transcribers/NNS ,/, although/IN there/EX is/VBZ some/DT debate/NN how/WRB to/TO precisely/RB quantify/VB human/JJ performance/NN on/IN this/DT task/NN ,/, using/VBG the/DT NIST/NNP 2000/CD CTS/NNP evaluation/NN set/NN ./.
This/DT raises/VBZ the/DT question/NN what/WDT systematic/JJ differences/NNS ,/, if/IN any/DT ,/, may/MD be/VB found/VBN differentiating/VBG human/JJ from/IN machine/NN transcription/NN errors/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP approach/VBP this/DT question/NN by/IN comparing/VBG the/DT output/NN of/IN our/PRP$ most/RBS accurate/JJ CTS/NNP recognition/NN system/NN to/IN that/DT of/IN a/DT standard/JJ speech/NN transcription/NN vendor/NN pipeline/NN ./.
We/PRP find/VBP that/IN the/DT most/RBS frequent/JJ substitution/NN ,/, deletion/NN and/CC insertion/NN error/NN types/NNS of/IN both/DT outputs/NNS show/VBP a/DT high/JJ degree/NN of/IN overlap/NN ./.
The/DT only/JJ notable/JJ exception/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT automatic/JJ recognizer/NN tends/VBZ to/TO confuse/VB filled/VBN pauses/VBZ (/-LRB- "/`` uh/UH "/'' )/-RRB- and/CC backchannel/NN acknowledgments/NNS (/-LRB- "/`` uhhuh/FW "/'' )/-RRB- ./.
Humans/NNS tend/VBP not/RB to/TO make/VB this/DT error/NN ,/, presumably/RB due/IN to/IN the/DT distinctive/JJ and/CC opposing/VBG pragmatic/JJ functions/NNS attached/VBN to/IN these/DT words/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP quantify/VBP the/DT correlation/NN between/IN human/JJ and/CC machine/NN errors/NNS at/IN the/DT speaker/NN level/NN ,/, and/CC investigate/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN speaker/NN overlap/NN between/IN training/NN and/CC test/NN data/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP report/VBP on/IN an/DT informal/JJ "/`` Turing/NN test/NN "/'' asking/VBG humans/NNS to/TO discriminate/VB between/IN automatic/JJ and/CC human/JJ transcription/NN error/NN cases/NNS ./.
