Deontic/JJ logic/NN is/VBZ a/DT very/RB well/RB researched/VBN branch/NN of/IN mathematical/JJ logic/NN and/CC philosophy/NN ./.
Various/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN deontic/JJ logics/NNS are/VBP discussed/VBN for/IN different/JJ application/NN domains/NNS like/IN argumentation/NN theory/NN ,/, legal/JJ reasoning/NN ,/, and/CC acts/VBZ in/IN multi-agent/JJ systems/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP how/WRB standard/JJ deontic/JJ logic/NN can/MD be/VB stepwise/JJ transformed/VBN into/IN description/NN logic/NN and/CC DL/NN -/HYPH clauses/NNS ,/, such/JJ that/IN it/PRP can/MD be/VB processed/VBN by/IN Hyper/NNP ,/, a/DT high/JJ performance/NN theorem/NN prover/NN which/WDT uses/VBZ a/DT hypertableau/NN calculus/NN ./.
Two/CD use/NN cases/NNS ,/, one/CD from/IN multi-agent/JJ research/NN and/CC one/CD from/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN normative/JJ system/NN are/VBP investigated/VBN ./.
