In/IN the/DT recent/JJ decade/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT enormous/JJ growth/NN of/IN digital/JJ content/NN in/IN internet/NN and/CC databases/NNS ,/, sentiment/NN analysis/NN has/VBZ received/VBN more/RBR and/CC more/RBR attention/NN between/IN information/NN retrieval/NN and/CC natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN researchers/NNS ./.
Sentiment/NN analysis/NN aims/VBZ to/TO use/VB automated/VBN tools/NNS to/TO detect/VB subjective/JJ information/NN from/IN reviews/NNS ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ challenges/NNS in/IN sentiment/NN analysis/NN is/VBZ feature/NN selection/NN ./.
Feature/NN selection/NN is/VBZ widely/RB used/VBN as/IN the/DT first/JJ stage/NN of/IN analysis/NN and/CC classification/NN tasks/NNS to/TO reduce/VB the/DT dimension/NN of/IN problem/NN ,/, and/CC improve/VB speed/NN by/IN the/DT elimination/NN of/IN irrelevant/JJ and/CC redundant/JJ features/NNS ./.
Up/IN to/IN now/RB as/RB there/EX are/VBP few/JJ researches/NNS conducted/VBN on/IN feature/NN selection/NN in/IN sentiment/NN analysis/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP very/RB rare/JJ works/NNS for/IN Persian/JJ sentiment/NN analysis/NN ./.
