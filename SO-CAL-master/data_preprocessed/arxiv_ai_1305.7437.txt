In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP an/DT agent/NN -/HYPH based/VBN model/NN which/WDT integrates/VBZ four/CD important/JJ elements/NNS ,/, i.e./FW organisational/JJ energy/NN management/NN policies/NNS //, regulations/NNS ,/, energy/NN management/NN technologies/NNS ,/, electric/JJ appliances/NNS and/CC equipment/NN ,/, and/CC human/JJ behaviour/NN ,/, to/IN simulate/VB the/DT electricity/NN consumption/NN in/IN office/NN buildings/NNS ./.
Based/VBN on/IN a/DT case/NN study/NN ,/, we/PRP use/VBP this/DT model/NN to/TO test/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN different/JJ electricity/NN management/NN strategies/NNS ,/, and/CC solve/VB practical/JJ office/NN electricity/NN consumption/NN problems/NNS ./.
