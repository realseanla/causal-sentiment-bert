Planning/VBG for/IN ad/FW hoc/FW teamwork/NN is/VBZ challenging/JJ because/IN it/PRP involves/VBZ agents/NNS collaborating/VBG without/IN any/DT prior/JJ coordination/NN or/CC communication/NN ./.
The/DT focus/NN is/VBZ on/IN principled/JJ methods/NNS for/IN a/DT single/JJ agent/NN to/TO cooperate/VB with/IN others/NNS ./.
This/DT motivates/VBZ investigating/VBG the/DT ad/FW hoc/FW teamwork/NN problem/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN individual/JJ decision/NN making/VBG frameworks/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, individual/JJ decision/NN making/VBG in/IN multiagent/JJ settings/NNS faces/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN having/VBG to/TO reason/VB about/IN other/JJ agents/NNS '/POS actions/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN turn/NN involves/VBZ reasoning/NN about/IN others/NNS ./.
An/DT established/VBN approximation/NN that/WDT operationalizes/VBZ this/DT approach/NN is/VBZ to/IN bound/VBN the/DT infinite/JJ nesting/VBG from/IN below/RB by/IN introducing/VBG level/NN 0/CD models/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN a/DT consequence/NN of/IN the/DT finitely/RB -/HYPH nested/VBN modeling/NN is/VBZ that/IN we/PRP may/MD not/RB obtain/VB optimal/JJ team/NN solutions/NNS in/IN cooperative/JJ settings/NNS ./.
We/PRP address/VBP this/DT limitation/NN by/IN including/VBG models/NNS at/IN level/NN 0/CD whose/WP$ solutions/NNS involve/VBP learning/NN ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN the/DT learning/NN integrated/VBN into/IN planning/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN interactive/JJ dynamic/JJ influence/NN diagrams/NNS facilitates/VBZ optimal/JJ team/NN behavior/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ applicable/JJ to/TO ad/FW hoc/FW teamwork/NN ./.
