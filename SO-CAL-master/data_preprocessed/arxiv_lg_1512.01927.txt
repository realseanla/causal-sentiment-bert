The/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN optimizing/VBG a/DT class/NN of/IN composite/JJ functions/NNS on/IN Riemannian/NNP manifolds/NNS and/CC a/DT new/JJ first/JJ order/NN optimization/NN algorithm/NN (/-LRB- FOA/NN )/-RRB- with/IN a/DT fast/JJ convergence/NN rate/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
Through/IN the/DT theoretical/JJ analysis/NN for/IN FOA/NNP ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN proved/VBN that/IN the/DT algorithm/NN has/VBZ quadratic/JJ convergence/NN ./.
The/DT experiments/NNS in/IN the/DT matrix/NN completion/NN task/NN show/NN that/WDT FOA/NNP has/VBZ better/JJR performance/NN than/IN other/JJ first/JJ order/NN optimization/NN methods/NNS on/IN Riemannian/NNP manifolds/NNS ./.
A/DT fast/JJ subspace/NN pursuit/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN FOA/NNP is/VBZ proposed/VBN to/TO solve/VB the/DT low/JJ -/HYPH rank/NN representation/NN model/NN based/VBN on/IN augmented/VBN Lagrange/NNP method/NN on/IN the/DT low/JJ rank/NN matrix/NN variety/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS on/IN synthetic/JJ and/CC real/JJ data/NNS sets/NNS are/VBP presented/VBN to/TO demonstrate/VB that/IN both/DT FOA/NNP and/CC SP/NNP -/HYPH RPRG/NNP (/-LRB- ALM/NNP )/-RRB- can/MD achieve/VB superior/JJ performance/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN faster/RBR convergence/NN and/CC higher/JJR accuracy/NN ./.
