Deep/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/NN (/-LRB- DRL/NN )/-RRB- brings/VBZ the/DT power/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS to/TO bear/VB on/IN the/DT generic/JJ task/NN of/IN trial/NN -/HYPH and/CC -/HYPH error/NN learning/NN ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ effectiveness/NN has/VBZ been/VBN convincingly/RB demonstrated/VBN on/IN tasks/NNS such/JJ as/IN Atari/NNP video/NN games/NNS and/CC the/DT game/NN of/IN Go/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, contemporary/JJ DRL/NN systems/NNS inherit/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN shortcomings/NNS from/IN the/DT current/JJ generation/NN of/IN deep/JJ learning/NN techniques/NNS ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, they/PRP require/VBP very/RB large/JJ datasets/NNS to/TO work/VB effectively/RB ,/, entailing/VBG that/IN they/PRP are/VBP slow/JJ to/TO learn/VB even/RB when/WRB such/JJ datasets/NNS are/VBP available/JJ ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, they/PRP lack/VBP the/DT ability/NN to/TO reason/VB on/IN an/DT abstract/JJ level/NN ,/, which/WDT makes/VBZ it/PRP difficult/JJ to/TO implement/VB high/JJ -/HYPH level/NN cognitive/JJ functions/NNS such/JJ as/IN transfer/NN learning/NN ,/, analogical/JJ reasoning/NN ,/, and/CC hypothesis/NN -/HYPH based/VBN reasoning/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, their/PRP$ operation/NN is/VBZ largely/RB opaque/JJ to/IN humans/NNS ,/, rendering/VBG them/PRP unsuitable/JJ for/IN domains/NNS in/IN which/WDT verifiability/NN is/VBZ important/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN reinforcement/NN learning/VBG architecture/NN comprising/VBG a/DT neural/JJ back/NN end/NN and/CC a/DT symbolic/JJ front/JJ end/NN with/IN the/DT potential/NN to/TO overcome/VB each/DT of/IN these/DT shortcomings/NNS ./.
As/IN proof/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH concept/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT preliminary/JJ implementation/NN of/IN the/DT architecture/NN and/CC apply/VB it/PRP to/IN several/JJ variants/NNS of/IN a/DT simple/JJ video/NN game/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT resulting/VBG system/NN --/: though/IN just/RB a/DT prototype/NN --/: learns/VBZ effectively/RB ,/, and/CC ,/, by/IN acquiring/VBG a/DT set/NN of/IN symbolic/JJ rules/NNS that/WDT are/VBP easily/RB comprehensible/JJ to/IN humans/NNS ,/, dramatically/RB outperforms/VBZ a/DT conventional/JJ ,/, fully/RB neural/JJ DRL/NN system/NN on/IN a/DT stochastic/JJ variant/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN ./.
