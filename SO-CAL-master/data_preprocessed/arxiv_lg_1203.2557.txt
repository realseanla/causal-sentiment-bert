This/DT work/NN explores/VBZ the/DT effects/NNS of/IN relevant/JJ and/CC irrelevant/JJ boolean/JJ variables/NNS on/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN classifiers/NNS ./.
The/DT analysis/NN uses/VBZ the/DT assumption/NN that/IN the/DT variables/NNS are/VBP conditionally/RB independent/JJ given/VBN the/DT class/NN ,/, and/CC focuses/VBZ on/IN a/DT natural/JJ family/NN of/IN learning/VBG algorithms/NNS for/IN such/JJ sources/NNS when/WRB the/DT relevant/JJ variables/NNS have/VBP a/DT small/JJ advantage/NN over/IN random/JJ guessing/VBG ./.
The/DT main/JJ result/NN is/VBZ that/IN algorithms/NNS relying/VBG predominately/RB on/IN irrelevant/JJ variables/NNS have/VBP error/NN probabilities/NNS that/WDT quickly/RB go/VBP to/IN 0/CD in/IN situations/NNS where/WRB algorithms/NNS that/WDT limit/VBP the/DT use/NN of/IN irrelevant/JJ variables/NNS have/VBP errors/NNS bounded/VBD below/RB by/IN a/DT positive/JJ constant/JJ ./.
We/PRP also/RB show/VBP that/IN accurate/JJ learning/NN is/VBZ possible/JJ even/RB when/WRB there/EX are/VBP so/RB few/JJ examples/NNS that/WDT one/PRP can/MD not/RB determine/VB with/IN high/JJ confidence/NN whether/IN or/CC not/RB any/DT individual/JJ variable/NN is/VBZ relevant/JJ ./.
