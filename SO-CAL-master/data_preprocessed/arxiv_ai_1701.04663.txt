A/DT compact/JJ information/NN -/HYPH rich/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, also/RB called/VBD a/DT feature/NN abstraction/NN ,/, can/MD simplify/VB a/DT robot/NN 's/POS task/NN of/IN mapping/VBG its/PRP$ raw/JJ sensory/JJ inputs/NNS to/IN useful/JJ action/NN sequences/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN environments/NNS that/WDT are/VBP non-stationary/JJ and/CC only/RB partially/RB observable/JJ ,/, a/DT single/JJ abstraction/NN is/VBZ probably/RB not/RB sufficient/JJ to/TO encode/VB most/JJS variations/NNS ./.
