This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT cognitive/JJ architecture/NN for/IN a/DT humanoid/JJ robot/NN to/TO engage/VB in/IN a/DT proactive/JJ ,/, mixed/JJ -/HYPH initiative/NN exploration/NN and/CC manipulation/NN of/IN its/PRP$ environment/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT initiative/NN can/MD originate/VB from/IN both/PDT the/DT human/JJ and/CC the/DT robot/NN ./.
The/DT framework/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN a/DT biologically/RB -/HYPH grounded/VBN theory/NN of/IN the/DT brain/NN and/CC mind/NN ,/, integrates/VBZ a/DT reactive/JJ interaction/NN engine/NN ,/, a/DT number/NN of/IN state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT art/NN perceptual/JJ and/CC motor/JJ learning/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN planning/VBG abilities/NNS and/CC an/DT autobiographical/JJ memory/NN ./.
The/DT architecture/NN as/IN a/DT whole/JJ drives/NNS the/DT robot/NN behavior/NN to/TO solve/VB the/DT symbol/NN grounding/NN problem/NN ,/, acquire/VBP language/NN capabilities/NNS ,/, execute/VB goal/NN -/HYPH oriented/VBN behavior/NN ,/, and/CC express/VB a/DT verbal/JJ narrative/NN of/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ experience/NN in/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
We/PRP validate/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN in/IN a/DT human/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN interaction/NN experiment/NN with/IN the/DT iCub/NNP humanoid/JJ robot/NN ,/, showing/VBG that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN cognitive/JJ architecture/NN can/MD be/VB applied/VBN in/IN real/JJ time/NN within/IN a/DT realistic/JJ scenario/NN ./.
