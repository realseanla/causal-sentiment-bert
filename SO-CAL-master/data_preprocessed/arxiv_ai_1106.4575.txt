In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP analyze/VBP the/DT decision/NN version/NN of/IN the/DT NK/NNP landscape/NN model/NN from/IN the/DT perspective/NN of/IN threshold/NN phenomena/NN and/CC phase/NN transitions/NNS under/IN two/CD random/JJ distributions/NNS ,/, the/DT uniform/JJ probability/NN model/NN and/CC the/DT fixed/VBN ratio/NN model/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT uniform/JJ probability/NN model/NN ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN the/DT phase/NN transition/NN is/VBZ easy/JJ in/IN the/DT sense/NN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ a/DT polynomial/JJ algorithm/NN that/WDT can/MD solve/VB a/DT random/JJ instance/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN with/IN the/DT probability/NN asymptotic/JJ to/IN 1/CD as/IN the/DT problem/NN size/NN tends/VBZ to/TO infinity/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT fixed/VBN ratio/NN model/NN ,/, we/PRP establish/VBP several/JJ upper/JJ bounds/NNS for/IN the/DT solubility/NN threshold/NN ,/, and/CC prove/VB that/DT random/JJ instances/NNS with/IN parameters/NNS above/IN these/DT upper/JJ bounds/NNS can/MD be/VB solved/VBN polynomially/RB ./.
This/DT ,/, together/RB with/IN our/PRP$ empirical/JJ study/NN for/IN random/JJ instances/NNS generated/VBN below/RB and/CC in/IN the/DT phase/NN transition/NN region/NN ,/, suggests/VBZ that/IN the/DT phase/NN transition/NN of/IN the/DT fixed/VBN ratio/NN model/NN is/VBZ also/RB easy/JJ ./.
