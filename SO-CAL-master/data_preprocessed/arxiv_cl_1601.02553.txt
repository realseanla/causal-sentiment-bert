We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN architecture/NN for/IN speech/NN recognition/NN that/WDT explicitly/RB employs/VBZ knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT background/NN environmental/JJ noise/NN within/IN a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN acoustic/JJ model/NN ./.
A/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO predict/VB the/DT acoustic/JJ environment/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT system/NN in/IN being/VBG used/VBN ./.
The/DT discriminative/JJ embedding/NN generated/VBN at/IN the/DT bottleneck/NN layer/NN of/IN this/DT network/NN is/VBZ then/RB concatenated/VBN with/IN traditional/JJ acoustic/JJ features/NNS as/IN input/NN to/IN a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN acoustic/JJ model/NN ./.
