Regularization/NN is/VBZ key/JJ for/IN deep/JJ learning/NN since/IN it/PRP allows/VBZ training/VBG more/RBR complex/JJ models/NNS while/IN keeping/VBG lower/JJR levels/NNS of/IN overfitting/VBG ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT most/RBS prevalent/JJ regularizations/NNS do/VBP not/RB leverage/VB all/PDT the/DT capacity/NN of/IN the/DT models/NNS since/IN they/PRP rely/VBP on/IN reducing/VBG the/DT effective/JJ number/NN of/IN parameters/NNS ./.
Feature/NN decorrelation/NN is/VBZ an/DT alternative/NN for/IN using/VBG the/DT full/JJ capacity/NN of/IN the/DT models/NNS but/CC the/DT overfitting/VBG reduction/NN margins/NNS are/VBP too/RB narrow/JJ given/VBN the/DT overhead/NN it/PRP introduces/VBZ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN regularizing/VBG negatively/RB correlated/JJ features/NNS is/VBZ an/DT obstacle/NN for/IN effective/JJ decorrelation/NN and/CC present/JJ OrthoReg/NNP ,/, a/DT novel/JJ regularization/NN technique/NN that/WDT locally/RB enforces/VBZ feature/NN orthogonality/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, imposing/VBG locality/NN constraints/NNS in/IN feature/NN decorrelation/NN removes/VBZ interferences/NNS between/IN negatively/RB correlated/JJ features/NNS ,/, allowing/VBG the/DT regularizer/NN to/TO reach/VB higher/JJR decorrelation/NN bounds/NNS ,/, and/CC reducing/VBG the/DT overfitting/VBG more/RBR effectively/RB ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT models/NNS regularized/VBN with/IN OrthoReg/NNP have/VBP higher/JJR accuracy/NN bounds/NNS even/RB when/WRB batch/NN normalization/NN and/CC dropout/NN present/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, since/IN our/PRP$ regularization/NN is/VBZ directly/RB performed/VBN on/IN the/DT weights/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ especially/RB suitable/JJ for/IN fully/RB convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT weight/NN space/NN is/VBZ constant/JJ compared/VBN to/IN the/DT feature/NN map/NN space/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT overfitting/NN of/IN state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN CNNs/NNS on/IN CIFAR/NN -/HYPH 10/CD ,/, CIFAR/NN -/HYPH 100/CD ,/, and/CC SVHN/NNP ./.
