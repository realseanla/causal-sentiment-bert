This/DT paper/NN adapts/VBZ a/DT recently/RB developed/VBN regularized/VBN stochastic/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT Broyden/NNP ,/, Fletcher/NNP ,/, Goldfarb/NNP ,/, and/CC Shanno/NNP (/-LRB- BFGS/NNP )/-RRB- quasi-Newton/NNP method/NN for/IN the/DT solution/NN of/IN support/NN vector/NN machine/NN classification/NN problems/NNS ./.
