We/PRP study/VBP sequential/JJ prediction/NN of/IN real/JJ -/HYPH valued/VBN ,/, arbitrary/JJ and/CC unknown/JJ sequences/NNS under/IN the/DT squared/JJ error/NN loss/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN the/DT best/JJS parametric/JJ predictor/NN out/IN of/IN a/DT large/JJ ,/, continuous/JJ class/NN of/IN predictors/NNS ./.
