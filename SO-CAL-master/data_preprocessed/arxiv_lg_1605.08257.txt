We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ Riemannian/JJ manifold/NN preconditioning/VBG approach/NN for/IN the/DT tensor/NN completion/NN problem/NN with/IN rank/NN constraint/NN ./.
A/DT novel/JJ Riemannian/NNP metric/JJ or/CC inner/JJ product/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN that/IN exploits/NNS the/DT least/RBS -/HYPH squares/NNS structure/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN function/NN and/CC takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN the/DT structured/JJ symmetry/NN that/WDT exists/VBZ in/IN Tucker/NNP decomposition/NN ./.
The/DT specific/JJ metric/JJ allows/VBZ to/TO use/VB the/DT versatile/JJ framework/NN of/IN Riemannian/NNP optimization/NN on/IN quotient/NN manifolds/NNS to/TO develop/VB preconditioned/VBN nonlinear/JJ conjugate/JJ gradient/NN and/CC stochastic/JJ gradient/NN descent/NN algorithms/NNS for/IN batch/NN and/CC online/JJ setups/NNS ,/, respectively/RB ./.
