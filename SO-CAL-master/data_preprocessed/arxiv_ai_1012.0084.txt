Gesture/NN recognition/NN is/VBZ mainly/RB apprehensive/JJ on/IN analyzing/VBG the/DT functionality/NN of/IN human/JJ wits/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ goal/NN of/IN gesture/NN recognition/NN is/VBZ to/TO create/VB a/DT system/NN which/WDT can/MD recognize/VB specific/JJ human/JJ gestures/NNS and/CC use/VB them/PRP to/TO convey/VB information/NN or/CC for/IN device/NN control/NN ./.
Hand/NN gestures/NNS provide/VBP a/DT separate/JJ complementary/JJ modality/NN to/IN speech/NN for/IN expressing/VBG ones/NNS ideas/NNS ./.
Information/NN associated/VBN with/IN hand/NN gestures/NNS in/IN a/DT conversation/NN is/VBZ degree/NN ,/, discourse/NN structure/NN ,/, spatial/JJ and/CC temporal/JJ structure/NN ./.
The/DT approaches/NNS present/VBP can/MD be/VB mainly/RB divided/VBN into/IN Data/NNP -/HYPH Glove/NNP Based/NNP and/CC Vision/NNP Based/NNP approaches/VBZ ./.
An/DT important/JJ face/NN feature/NN point/NN is/VBZ the/DT nose/NN tip/NN ./.
Since/IN nose/NN is/VBZ the/DT highest/JJS protruding/VBG point/NN from/IN the/DT face/NN ./.
Besides/IN that/DT ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ not/RB affected/VBN by/IN facial/JJ expressions.Another/NN important/JJ function/NN of/IN the/DT nose/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO indicate/VB the/DT head/NN pose/NN ./.
Knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT nose/NN location/NN will/MD enable/VB us/PRP to/TO align/VB an/DT unknown/JJ 3D/NN face/NN with/IN those/DT in/IN a/DT face/NN database/NN ./.
Eye/NNP detection/NN is/VBZ divided/VBN into/IN eye/NN position/NN detection/NN and/CC eye/NN contour/NN detection/NN ./.
Existing/VBG works/NNS in/IN eye/NN detection/NN can/MD be/VB classified/VBN into/IN two/CD major/JJ categories/NNS :/: traditional/JJ image/NN -/HYPH based/VBN passive/JJ approaches/NNS and/CC the/DT active/JJ IR/NN based/VBN approaches/NNS ./.
The/DT former/JJ uses/VBZ intensity/NN and/CC shape/NN of/IN eyes/NNS for/IN detection/NN and/CC the/DT latter/JJ works/NNS on/IN the/DT assumption/NN that/IN eyes/NNS have/VBP a/DT reflection/NN under/IN near/JJ IR/NN illumination/NN and/CC produce/VBP bright/JJ //HYPH dark/JJ pupil/NN effect/NN ./.
The/DT traditional/JJ methods/NNS can/MD be/VB broadly/RB classified/VBN into/IN three/CD categories/NNS :/: template/NN based/VBN methods/NNS ,/, appearance/NN based/VBN methods/NNS and/CC feature/NN based/VBN methods/NNS ./.
The/DT purpose/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO compare/VB various/JJ human/JJ Gesture/NN recognition/NN systems/NNS for/IN interfacing/NN machines/NNS directly/RB to/IN human/JJ wits/NNS without/IN any/DT corporeal/JJ media/NNS in/IN an/DT ambient/JJ environment/NN ./.
