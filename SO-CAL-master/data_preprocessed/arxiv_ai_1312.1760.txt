The/DT normalized/VBN edit/NN distance/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT distances/NNS derived/VBN from/IN the/DT edit/NN distance/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ useful/JJ in/IN some/DT applications/NNS because/IN it/PRP takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN the/DT lengths/NNS of/IN the/DT two/CD strings/NNS compared/VBN ./.
The/DT normalized/VBN edit/NN distance/NN is/VBZ not/RB defined/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN edit/NN operations/NNS but/CC rather/RB in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT edit/NN path/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ derivative/NN of/IN the/DT edit/NN distance/NN that/WDT also/RB takes/VBZ into/IN consideration/NN the/DT lengths/NNS of/IN the/DT two/CD strings/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT new/JJ distance/NN is/VBZ related/VBN directly/RB to/IN the/DT edit/NN distance/NN ./.
The/DT particularity/NN of/IN the/DT new/JJ distance/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP uses/VBZ the/DT genetic/JJ algorithms/NNS to/TO set/VB the/DT values/NNS of/IN the/DT parameters/NNS it/PRP uses/VBZ ./.
We/PRP conduct/VBP experiments/NNS to/TO test/VB the/DT new/JJ distance/NN and/CC we/PRP obtain/VBP promising/JJ results/NNS ./.
