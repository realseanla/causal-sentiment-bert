Online/NN learning/NN with/IN delayed/VBN feedback/NN has/VBZ received/VBN increasing/VBG attention/NN recently/RB due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ several/JJ applications/NNS in/IN distributed/VBN ,/, web/NN -/HYPH based/VBN learning/NN problems/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP provide/VBP a/DT systematic/JJ study/NN of/IN the/DT topic/NN ,/, and/CC analyze/VB the/DT effect/NN of/IN delay/NN on/IN the/DT regret/NN of/IN online/JJ learning/NN algorithms/NNS ./.

We/PRP give/VBP meta/NN -/HYPH algorithms/NNS that/WDT transform/VBP ,/, in/IN a/DT black/JJ -/HYPH box/NN fashion/NN ,/, algorithms/NNS developed/VBN for/IN the/DT non-delayed/JJ case/NN into/IN ones/NNS that/WDT can/MD handle/VB the/DT presence/NN of/IN delays/NNS in/IN the/DT feedback/NN loop/NN ./.
