One/CD essential/JJ task/NN in/IN information/NN extraction/NN from/IN the/DT medical/JJ corpus/NN is/VBZ drug/NN name/NN recognition/NN ./.
Compared/VBN with/IN text/NN sources/NNS come/VBP from/IN other/JJ domains/NNS ,/, the/DT medical/JJ text/NN is/VBZ special/JJ and/CC has/VBZ unique/JJ characteristics/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT medical/JJ text/NN mining/NN poses/VBZ more/JJR challenges/NNS ,/, e.g./FW ,/, more/JJR unstructured/JJ text/NN ,/, the/DT fast/JJ growing/NN of/IN new/JJ terms/NNS addition/NN ,/, a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN name/NN variation/NN for/IN the/DT same/JJ drug/NN ./.
The/DT mining/NN is/VBZ even/RB more/RBR challenging/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN labeled/VBN dataset/NN sources/NNS and/CC external/JJ knowledge/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN multiple/JJ token/JJ representations/NNS for/IN a/DT single/JJ drug/NN name/NN that/WDT is/VBZ more/RBR common/JJ in/IN the/DT real/JJ application/NN setting/NN ./.
Although/IN many/JJ approaches/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO overwhelm/VB the/DT task/NN ,/, some/DT problems/NNS remained/VBD with/IN poor/JJ F/NN -/HYPH score/NN performance/NN (/-LRB- less/JJR than/IN 0.75/CD )/-RRB- ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ treatment/NN in/IN data/NNS representation/NN techniques/NNS to/TO overcome/VB some/DT of/IN those/DT challenges/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP three/CD data/NNS representation/NN techniques/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN word/NN distribution/NN and/CC word/NN similarities/NNS as/IN a/DT result/NN of/IN word/NN embedding/NN training/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ technique/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN with/IN the/DT standard/JJ NN/NNP model/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, MLP/NNP (/-LRB- Multi-Layer/NNP Perceptrons/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT second/JJ technique/NN involves/VBZ two/CD deep/JJ network/NN classifiers/NNS ,/, i.e./FW ,/, DBN/NN (/-LRB- Deep/NNP Belief/NNP Networks/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC SAE/NNP (/-LRB- Stacked/VBN Denoising/NNP Encoders/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT third/JJ technique/NN represents/VBZ the/DT sentence/NN as/IN a/DT sequence/NN that/WDT is/VBZ evaluated/VBN with/IN a/DT recurrent/JJ NN/NNP model/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, LSTM/NN (/-LRB- Long/JJ Short/JJ Term/NN Memory/NN )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN extracting/VBG the/DT drug/NN name/NN entities/NNS ,/, the/DT third/JJ technique/NN gives/VBZ the/DT best/JJS F/NN -/HYPH score/NN performance/NN compared/VBN to/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ,/, with/IN its/PRP$ average/JJ F/NN -/HYPH score/NN being/VBG 0.8645/CD ./.
