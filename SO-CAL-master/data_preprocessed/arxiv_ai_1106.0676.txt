Designing/NNP the/DT dialogue/NN policy/NN of/IN a/DT spoken/VBN dialogue/NN system/NN involves/VBZ many/JJ nontrivial/JJ choices/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT reinforcement/NN learning/VBG approach/NN for/IN automatically/RB optimizing/VBG a/DT dialogue/NN policy/NN ,/, which/WDT addresses/VBZ the/DT technical/JJ challenges/NNS in/IN applying/VBG reinforcement/NN learning/VBG to/IN a/DT working/VBG dialogue/NN system/NN with/IN human/JJ users/NNS ./.
We/PRP report/VBP on/IN the/DT design/NN ,/, construction/NN and/CC empirical/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN NJFun/NNP ,/, an/DT experimental/JJ spoken/VBN dialogue/NN system/NN that/WDT provides/VBZ users/NNS with/IN access/NN to/IN information/NN about/IN fun/JJ things/NNS to/TO do/VB in/IN New/NNP Jersey/NNP ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN by/IN optimizing/VBG its/PRP$ performance/NN via/IN reinforcement/NN learning/NN ,/, NJFun/NNP measurably/RB improves/VBZ system/NN performance/NN ./.
