Some/DT existing/VBG notions/NNS of/IN redundancy/NN among/IN association/NN rules/NNS allow/VBP for/IN a/DT logical/JJ -/HYPH style/NN characterization/NN and/CC lead/VB to/IN irredundant/JJ bases/NNS of/IN absolutely/RB minimum/JJ size/NN ./.
One/PRP can/MD push/VB the/DT intuition/NN of/IN redundancy/NN further/RB and/CC find/VB an/DT intuitive/JJ notion/NN of/IN interest/NN of/IN an/DT association/NN rule/NN ,/, in/IN terms/NNS of/IN its/PRP$ "/`` novelty/NN "/'' with/IN respect/NN to/IN other/JJ rules/NNS ./.
Namely/RB :/: an/DT irredundant/JJ rule/NN is/VBZ so/RB because/IN its/PRP$ confidence/NN is/VBZ higher/JJR than/IN what/WP the/DT rest/NN of/IN the/DT rules/NNS would/MD suggest/VB ;/: then/RB ,/, one/PRP can/MD ask/VB :/: how/WRB much/RB higher/JJR ?/.
We/PRP propose/VBP to/TO measure/VB such/PDT a/DT sort/NN of/IN "/`` novelty/NN "/'' through/IN the/DT confidence/NN boost/NN of/IN a/DT rule/NN ,/, which/WDT encompasses/VBZ two/CD previous/JJ similar/JJ notions/NNS (/-LRB- confidence/NN width/NN and/CC rule/NN blocking/NN ,/, of/IN which/WDT the/DT latter/JJ is/VBZ closely/RB related/VBN to/IN the/DT earlier/JJR measure/NN "/'' improvement/NN "/'' )/-RRB- ./.
Acting/VBG as/IN a/DT complement/NN to/IN confidence/NN and/CC support/NN ,/, the/DT confidence/NN boost/NN helps/VBZ to/TO obtain/VB small/JJ and/CC crisp/JJ sets/NNS of/IN mined/VBN association/NN rules/NNS ,/, and/CC solves/VBZ the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN problem/NN that/WDT ,/, in/IN certain/JJ cases/NNS ,/, rules/NNS of/IN negative/JJ correlation/NN may/MD pass/VB the/DT confidence/NN bound/VBN ./.
We/PRP analyze/VBP the/DT properties/NNS of/IN two/CD versions/NNS of/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN confidence/NN boost/NN ,/, one/CD of/IN them/PRP a/DT natural/JJ generalization/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.
We/PRP develop/VBP efficient/JJ algorithmics/NNS to/IN filter/NN rules/NNS according/VBG to/IN their/PRP$ confidence/NN boost/NN ,/, compare/VB the/DT concept/NN to/IN some/DT similar/JJ notions/NNS in/IN the/DT bibliography/NN ,/, and/CC describe/VB the/DT results/NNS of/IN some/DT experimentation/NN employing/VBG the/DT new/JJ notions/NNS on/IN standard/JJ benchmark/NN datasets/NNS ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP an/DT open/JJ -/HYPH source/NN association/NN mining/NN tool/NN that/WDT embodies/VBZ one/CD of/IN our/PRP$ variants/NNS of/IN confidence/NN boost/NN in/IN such/PDT a/DT way/NN that/IN the/DT data/NNS mining/NN process/NN does/VBZ not/RB require/VB the/DT user/NN to/TO select/VB any/DT value/NN for/IN any/DT parameter/NN ./.
