Accurately/RB segmenting/VBG a/DT citation/NN string/NN into/IN fields/NNS for/IN authors/NNS ,/, titles/NNS ,/, etc./FW is/VBZ a/DT challenging/JJ task/NN because/IN the/DT output/NN typically/RB obeys/VBZ various/JJ global/JJ constraints/NNS ./.
Previous/JJ work/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN modeling/VBG soft/JJ constraints/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT model/NN is/VBZ encouraged/VBN ,/, but/CC not/RB require/VB to/TO obey/VB the/DT constraints/NNS ,/, can/MD substantially/RB improve/VB segmentation/NN performance/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, for/IN imposing/VBG hard/JJ constraints/NNS ,/, dual/JJ decomposition/NN is/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ technique/NN for/IN efficient/JJ prediction/NN given/VBN existing/VBG algorithms/NNS for/IN unconstrained/JJ inference/NN ./.
We/PRP extend/VBP the/DT technique/NN to/TO perform/VB prediction/NN subject/NN to/IN soft/JJ constraints/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, with/IN a/DT technique/NN for/IN performing/VBG inference/NN given/VBN soft/JJ constraints/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO automatically/RB generate/VB large/JJ families/NNS of/IN constraints/NNS and/CC learn/VB their/PRP$ costs/NNS with/IN a/DT simple/JJ convex/NN optimization/NN problem/NN during/IN training/NN ./.
This/DT allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO obtain/VB substantial/JJ gains/NNS in/IN accuracy/NN on/IN a/DT new/JJ ,/, challenging/JJ citation/NN extraction/NN dataset/NN ./.
