Drawing/VBG a/DT sample/NN from/IN a/DT discrete/JJ distribution/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT building/NN components/NNS for/IN Monte/NNP Carlo/NNP methods/NNS ./.
Like/IN other/JJ sampling/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, discrete/JJ sampling/NN also/RB suffers/VBZ from/IN high/JJ computational/JJ burden/NN in/IN large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN inference/NN problems/NNS ./.
We/PRP study/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN sampling/VBG a/DT discrete/JJ random/JJ variable/JJ with/IN a/DT high/JJ degree/NN of/IN dependency/NN that/WDT is/VBZ typical/JJ in/IN large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN Bayesian/JJ inference/NN and/CC graphical/JJ models/NNS ,/, and/CC propose/VB an/DT efficient/JJ approximate/JJ solution/NN with/IN a/DT subsampling/JJ approach/NN ./.
We/PRP make/VBP a/DT novel/JJ connection/NN between/IN the/DT discrete/JJ sampling/NN and/CC Multi-Armed/JJ Bandits/NNPS problems/NNS with/IN a/DT finite/JJ reward/NN population/NN and/CC provide/VB three/CD algorithms/NNS with/IN theoretical/JJ guarantees/NNS ./.
