Efficiency/NN of/IN single/JJ -/HYPH objective/JJ optimization/NN can/MD be/VB improved/VBN by/IN introducing/VBG some/DT auxiliary/JJ objectives/NNS ./.
Ideally/RB ,/, auxiliary/JJ objectives/NNS should/MD be/VB helpful/JJ ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN practice/NN ,/, objectives/NNS may/MD be/VB efficient/JJ on/IN some/DT optimization/NN stages/NNS but/CC obstructive/NN on/IN others/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT modification/NN of/IN the/DT EA/NNP RL/NN method/NN which/WDT dynamically/RB selects/VBZ optimized/VBN objectives/NNS using/VBG reinforcement/NN learning/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN modification/NN prevents/VBZ from/IN losing/VBG the/DT best/JJS found/VBN solution/NN ./.
