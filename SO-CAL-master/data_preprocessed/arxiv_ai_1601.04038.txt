We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN Task/NNP Assignment/NN and/CC Sequencing/NN (/-LRB- TAS/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT adds/VBZ the/DT timeline/NN perspective/NN to/IN expert/NN crowdsourcing/VBG optimization/NN ./.
Expert/NNP crowdsourcing/VBG involves/VBZ macrotasks/NNS ,/, like/IN document/NN writing/NN ,/, product/NN design/NN ,/, or/CC web/NN development/NN ,/, which/WDT take/VBP more/JJR time/NN than/IN typical/JJ binary/JJ microtasks/NNS ,/, require/VBP expert/JJ skills/NNS ,/, assume/VB varying/VBG degrees/NNS of/IN knowledge/NN over/IN a/DT topic/NN ,/, and/CC require/VBP crowd/NN workers/NNS to/TO build/VB on/IN each/DT other/JJ 's/POS contributions/NNS ./.
Current/JJ works/NNS usually/RB assume/VBP offline/RB optimization/NN models/NNS ,/, which/WDT consider/VBP worker/NN and/CC task/NN arrivals/NNS known/VBN and/CC do/VBP not/RB take/VB into/IN account/NN the/DT element/NN of/IN time/NN ./.
Realistically/RB however/RB ,/, time/NN is/VBZ critical/JJ :/: tasks/NNS have/VBP deadlines/NNS ,/, expert/JJ workers/NNS are/VBP available/JJ only/RB at/IN specific/JJ time/NN slots/NNS ,/, and/CC worker/NN //HYPH task/NN arrivals/NNS are/VBP not/RB known/VBN a-priori/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ work/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ to/TO address/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN optimal/JJ task/NN sequencing/NN for/IN online/JJ ,/, heterogeneous/JJ ,/, time/NN -/HYPH constrained/VBN macrotasks/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP tas/IN -/HYPH online/NN ,/, an/DT online/JJ algorithm/NN that/WDT aims/VBZ to/TO complete/VB as/IN many/JJ tasks/NNS as/IN possible/JJ within/IN budget/NN ,/, required/VBN quality/NN and/CC a/DT given/VBN timeline/NN ,/, without/IN future/JJ input/NN information/NN regarding/VBG job/NN release/NN dates/NNS or/CC worker/NN availabilities/NNS ./.

This/DT work/NN has/VBZ practical/JJ implications/NNS for/IN improving/VBG the/DT Quality/NN of/IN Service/NN of/IN current/JJ crowdsourcing/NN platforms/NNS ,/, allowing/VBG them/PRP to/TO offer/VB cost/NN ,/, quality/NN and/CC time/NN improvements/NNS for/IN expert/NN tasks/NNS ./.
