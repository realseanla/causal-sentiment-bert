We/PRP know/VBP ,/, however/RB ,/, that/IN humans/NNS (/-LRB- even/RB pre-school/NN children/NNS )/-RRB- can/MD abstract/JJ over/IN raw/JJ data/NNS to/TO perform/VB certain/JJ types/NNS of/IN higher/JJR -/HYPH level/NN reasoning/NN ,/, expressed/VBN in/IN natural/JJ language/NN by/IN function/NN words/NNS ./.

From/IN formal/JJ semantics/NNS and/CC cognitive/JJ linguistics/NNS ,/, we/PRP know/VBP that/IN quantifiers/NNS are/VBP relations/NNS over/IN sets/NNS which/WDT ,/, as/IN a/DT simplification/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD see/VB as/IN proportions/NNS ./.
