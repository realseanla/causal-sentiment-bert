In/IN this/DT article/NN we/PRP present/VBP two/CD ways/NNS of/IN structuring/VBG bodies/NNS of/IN evidence/NN ,/, which/WDT allow/VBP us/PRP to/TO reduce/VB the/DT complexity/NN of/IN the/DT operations/NNS usually/RB performed/VBN in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN evidence/NN theory/NN ./.
The/DT first/JJ structure/NN just/RB partitions/VBZ the/DT focal/JJ elements/NNS in/IN a/DT body/NN of/IN evidence/NN by/IN their/PRP$ cardinality/NN ./.
With/IN this/DT structure/NN we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT complexity/NN on/IN the/DT calculation/NN of/IN the/DT belief/NN functions/VBZ Bel/NNP ,/, Pl/NN ,/, and/CC Q/NN ./.
The/DT other/JJ structure/NN proposed/VBN here/RB ,/, the/DT Hierarchical/JJ Trees/NNS ,/, permits/VBZ us/PRP to/TO reduce/VB the/DT complexity/NN of/IN the/DT calculation/NN of/IN Bel/NNP ,/, Pl/NN ,/, and/CC Q/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN of/IN the/DT Dempster/NNP 's/POS rule/NN of/IN combination/NN in/IN relation/NN to/IN the/DT brute/JJ -/HYPH force/NN algorithm/NN ./.
Both/PDT these/DT structures/NNS do/VBP not/RB require/VB the/DT generation/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT subsets/NNS of/IN the/DT reference/NN domain/NN ./.
