Developing/VBG predictive/JJ modelling/NN solutions/NNS for/IN risk/NN estimation/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB challenging/JJ in/IN health/NN -/HYPH care/NN informatics/NNS ./.
Risk/NN estimation/NN involves/VBZ integration/NN of/IN heterogeneous/JJ clinical/JJ sources/NNS having/VBG different/JJ representation/NN from/IN different/JJ health/NN -/HYPH care/NN provider/NN making/VBG the/DT task/NN increasingly/RB complex/JJ ./.
Such/JJ sources/NNS are/VBP typically/RB voluminous/JJ ,/, diverse/JJ ,/, and/CC significantly/RB change/VB over/IN the/DT time/NN ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, distributed/VBN and/CC parallel/JJ computing/NN tools/NNS collectively/RB termed/VBN big/JJ data/NNS tools/NNS are/VBP in/IN need/NN which/WDT can/MD synthesize/VB and/CC assist/VB the/DT physician/NN to/TO make/VB right/JJ clinical/JJ decisions/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN we/PRP propose/VBP multi-model/JJ predictive/JJ architecture/NN ,/, a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN for/IN combining/VBG the/DT predictive/JJ ability/NN of/IN multiple/JJ models/NNS for/IN better/JJR prediction/NN accuracy/NN ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT effectiveness/NN and/CC efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN work/NN on/IN data/NNS from/IN Framingham/NNP Heart/NNP study/NN ./.

By/IN modelling/VBG the/DT error/NN of/IN predictive/JJ models/NNS we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO choose/VB sub/NN set/NN of/IN models/NNS which/WDT yields/VBZ accurate/JJ results/NNS ./.
