Many/JJ studies/NNS in/IN heuristic/NN search/NN suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT heuristic/NN used/VBN has/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ impact/NN on/IN improving/VBG the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT search/NN ./.
In/IN another/DT direction/NN ,/, historical/JJ research/NN perceives/VBZ that/IN the/DT performance/NN of/IN heuristic/NN search/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN A/DT */NFP and/CC IDA/NNP */NFP ,/, can/MD be/VB improved/VBN by/IN requiring/VBG the/DT heuristics/NNS to/TO be/VB consistent/JJ --/: a/DT property/NN satisfied/VBN by/IN any/DT perfect/JJ heuristic/NN ./.
