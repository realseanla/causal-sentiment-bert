This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ anytime/NN algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT marginal/JJ MAP/NN problem/NN in/IN graphical/JJ models/NNS ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN is/VBZ described/VBN in/IN detail/NN ,/, its/PRP$ complexity/NN and/CC convergence/NN rate/NN are/VBP studied/VBN ,/, and/CC relations/NNS to/IN previous/JJ theoretical/JJ results/NNS for/IN the/DT problem/NN are/VBP discussed/VBN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN the/DT algorithm/NN runs/VBZ in/IN polynomial/JJ -/HYPH time/NN if/IN the/DT underlying/JJ graph/NN of/IN the/DT model/NN has/VBZ bounded/VBN tree/NN -/HYPH width/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRP provides/VBZ guarantees/NNS to/IN the/DT lower/JJR and/CC upper/JJ bounds/NNS obtained/VBN within/IN a/DT fixed/VBN amount/NN of/IN computational/JJ resources/NNS ./.
Experiments/NNS with/IN both/DT real/JJ and/CC synthetic/JJ generated/VBN models/NNS highlight/VBP its/PRP$ main/JJ characteristics/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN it/PRP compares/VBZ favorably/RB against/IN Park/NNP and/CC Darwiche/NNP 's/POS systematic/JJ search/NN ,/, particularly/RB in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN problems/NNS with/IN many/JJ MAP/NN variables/NNS and/CC moderate/JJ tree/NN -/HYPH width/NN ./.
