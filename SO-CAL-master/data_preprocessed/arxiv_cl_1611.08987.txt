Identifying/VBG and/CC correcting/VBG grammatical/JJ errors/NNS in/IN the/DT text/NN written/VBN by/IN non-native/JJ writers/NNS has/VBZ received/VBN increasing/VBG attention/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.
Although/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN annotated/VBN corpora/NNS have/VBP been/VBN established/VBN to/TO facilitate/VB data/NNS -/HYPH driven/VBN grammatical/JJ error/NN detection/NN and/CC correction/NN approaches/NNS ,/, they/PRP are/VBP still/RB limited/VBN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN quantity/NN and/CC coverage/NN because/IN human/JJ annotation/NN is/VBZ labor/NN -/HYPH intensive/JJ ,/, time/NN -/HYPH consuming/VBG ,/, and/CC expensive/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP to/TO utilize/VB unlabeled/JJ data/NNS to/TO train/VB neural/JJ network/NN based/VBN grammatical/JJ error/NN detection/NN models/NNS ./.
The/DT basic/JJ idea/NN is/VBZ to/TO cast/VB error/NN detection/NN as/IN a/DT binary/JJ classification/NN problem/NN and/CC derive/VBP positive/JJ and/CC negative/JJ training/NN examples/NNS from/IN unlabeled/JJ data/NNS ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP an/DT attention/NN -/HYPH based/VBN neural/JJ network/NN to/TO capture/VB long/RB -/HYPH distance/NN dependencies/NNS that/WDT influence/VBP the/DT word/NN being/VBG detected/VBN ./.
Experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ SVMs/NNS and/CC convolutional/JJ networks/NNS with/IN fixed/VBN -/HYPH size/NN context/NN window/NN ./.
