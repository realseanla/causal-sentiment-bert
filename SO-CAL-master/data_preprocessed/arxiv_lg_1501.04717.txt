Developing/VBG a/DT reliable/JJ and/CC practical/JJ face/NN recognition/NN system/NN is/VBZ a/DT long/JJ -/HYPH standing/NN goal/NN in/IN computer/NN vision/NN research/NN ./.
Existing/VBG literature/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN pixel-wise/JJ face/NN alignment/NN is/VBZ the/DT key/NN to/TO achieve/VB high/JJ -/HYPH accuracy/NN face/NN recognition/NN ./.
By/IN assuming/VBG a/DT human/JJ face/NN as/IN piece-wise/JJ planar/NN surfaces/NNS ,/, where/WRB each/DT surface/NN corresponds/VBZ to/IN a/DT facial/JJ part/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP in/IN this/DT paper/NN a/DT Constrained/VBN Part/NN -/HYPH based/VBN Alignment/NNP (/-LRB- CPA/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN for/IN face/NN recognition/NN across/IN pose/NN and/CC //HYPH or/CC expression/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/VBN algorithm/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN a/DT trainable/JJ CPA/NN model/NN ,/, which/WDT learns/VBZ appearance/NN evidence/NN of/IN individual/JJ parts/NNS and/CC a/DT tree/NN -/HYPH structured/VBN shape/NN configuration/NN among/IN different/JJ parts/NNS ./.
Given/VBN a/DT probe/NN face/NN ,/, CPA/NN simultaneously/RB aligns/VBZ all/PDT its/PRP$ parts/NNS by/IN fitting/VBG them/PRP to/IN the/DT appearance/NN evidence/NN with/IN consideration/NN of/IN the/DT constraint/NN from/IN the/DT tree/NN -/HYPH structured/VBN shape/NN configuration/NN ./.
This/DT objective/NN is/VBZ formulated/VBN as/IN a/DT norm/NN minimization/NN problem/NN regularized/VBN by/IN graph/NN likelihoods/NNS ./.
CPA/NN can/MD be/VB easily/RB integrated/VBN with/IN many/JJ existing/VBG classifiers/NNS to/TO perform/VB part/NN -/HYPH based/VBN face/NN recognition/NN ./.
Extensive/JJ experiments/NNS on/IN benchmark/NN face/NN datasets/NNS show/VBP that/IN CPA/NN outperforms/VBZ or/CC is/VBZ on/IN par/NN with/IN existing/VBG methods/NNS for/IN robust/JJ face/NN recognition/NN across/IN pose/NN ,/, expression/NN ,/, and/CC //HYPH or/CC illumination/NN changes/NNS ./.
