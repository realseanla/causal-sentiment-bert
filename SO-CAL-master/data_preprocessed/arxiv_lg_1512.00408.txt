Electric/JJ water/NN heaters/NNS have/VBP the/DT ability/NN to/TO store/VB energy/NN in/IN their/PRP$ water/NN buffer/NN without/IN impacting/VBG the/DT comfort/NN of/IN the/DT end/NN user/NN ./.
This/DT feature/NN makes/VBZ them/PRP a/DT prime/JJ candidate/NN for/IN residential/JJ demand/NN response/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT stochastic/JJ and/CC nonlinear/JJ dynamics/NNS of/IN electric/JJ water/NN heaters/NNS ,/, makes/VBZ it/PRP challenging/JJ to/IN harness/NN their/PRP$ flexibility/NN ./.
Driven/VBN by/IN this/DT challenge/NN ,/, this/DT paper/NN formulates/VBZ the/DT underlying/VBG sequential/JJ decision/NN -/HYPH making/VBG problem/NN as/IN a/DT Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN and/CC uses/VBZ techniques/NNS from/IN reinforcement/NN learning/NN ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP an/DT auto/NN -/HYPH encoder/NN network/NN to/TO find/VB a/DT compact/JJ feature/NN representation/NN of/IN the/DT sensor/NN measurements/NNS ,/, which/WDT helps/VBZ to/TO mitigate/VB the/DT curse/NN of/IN dimensionality/NN ./.
A/DT wellknown/JJ batch/NN reinforcement/NN learning/VBG technique/NN ,/, fitted/VBN Q/NN -/HYPH iteration/NN ,/, is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO find/VB a/DT control/NN policy/NN ,/, given/VBN this/DT feature/NN representation/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT simulation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN experiment/NN using/VBG an/DT electric/JJ water/NN heater/NN with/IN 50/CD temperature/NN sensors/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO achieve/VB good/JJ policies/NNS much/JJ faster/JJR than/IN when/WRB using/VBG the/DT full/JJ state/NN information/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT lab/NN experiment/NN ,/, we/PRP apply/VBP fitted/VBN Q/NN -/HYPH iteration/NN to/IN an/DT electric/JJ water/NN heater/NN with/IN eight/CD temperature/NN sensors/NNS ./.
Further/JJ reducing/VBG the/DT state/NN vector/NN did/VBD not/RB improve/VB the/DT results/NNS of/IN fitted/VBN Q/NN -/HYPH iteration/NN ./.
The/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT lab/NN experiment/NN ,/, spanning/VBG 40/CD days/NNS ,/, indicate/VBP that/IN compared/VBN to/IN a/DT thermostat/NN controller/NN ,/, the/DT presented/VBN approach/NN was/VBD able/JJ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT total/JJ cost/NN of/IN energy/NN consumption/NN of/IN the/DT electric/JJ water/NN heater/NN by/IN 15/CD percent/NN ./.
