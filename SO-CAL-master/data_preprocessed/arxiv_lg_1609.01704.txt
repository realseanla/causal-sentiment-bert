Learning/VBG both/DT hierarchical/JJ and/CC temporal/JJ representation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN among/IN the/DT long/JJ -/HYPH standing/NN challenges/NNS of/IN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Multiscale/NNP recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS have/VBP been/VBN considered/VBN as/IN a/DT promising/JJ approach/NN to/TO resolve/VB this/DT issue/NN ,/, yet/CC there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT lack/NN of/IN empirical/JJ evidence/NN showing/VBG that/IN this/DT type/NN of/IN models/NNS can/MD actually/RB capture/VB the/DT temporal/JJ dependencies/NNS by/IN discovering/VBG the/DT latent/JJ hierarchical/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT sequence/NN ./.
