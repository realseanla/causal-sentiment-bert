This/DT paper/NN deals/NNS with/IN the/DT distributed/VBN processing/NN in/IN the/DT search/NN for/IN an/DT optimum/JJ classification/NN model/NN using/VBG evolutionary/JJ product/NN unit/NN neural/JJ networks/NNS ./.
For/IN this/DT distributed/VBN search/NN we/PRP used/VBD a/DT cluster/NN of/IN computers/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ objective/NN is/VBZ to/TO obtain/VB a/DT more/RBR efficient/JJ design/NN than/IN those/DT net/JJ architectures/NNS which/WDT do/VBP not/RB use/VB a/DT distributed/VBN process/NN and/CC which/WDT thus/RB result/VBP in/IN simpler/JJR designs/NNS ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO get/VB the/DT best/JJS classification/NN models/NNS we/PRP use/VBP evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS to/TO train/VB and/CC design/VB neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, which/WDT require/VBP a/DT very/RB time/NN consuming/VBG computation/NN ./.
The/DT reasons/NNS behind/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN this/DT distribution/NN are/VBP various/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ complicated/VBN to/TO train/VB this/DT type/NN of/IN nets/NNS because/IN of/IN the/DT difficulty/NN entailed/VBN in/IN determining/VBG their/PRP$ architecture/NN due/IN to/IN the/DT complex/JJ error/NN surface/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT use/NN of/IN evolutionary/JJ algorithms/NNS involves/VBZ running/VBG a/DT great/JJ number/NN of/IN tests/NNS with/IN different/JJ seeds/NNS and/CC parameters/NNS ,/, thus/RB resulting/VBG in/IN a/DT high/JJ computational/JJ cost/NN
