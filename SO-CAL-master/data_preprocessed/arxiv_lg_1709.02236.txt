The/DT instability/NN of/IN myoelectric/JJ signals/NNS over/IN time/NN complicates/VBZ their/PRP$ use/NN to/TO control/VB highly/RB articulated/JJ prostheses/NNS ./.
To/TO address/VB this/DT problem/NN ,/, studies/NNS have/VBP tried/VBN to/TO combine/VB surface/NN electromyography/NN with/IN modalities/NNS that/WDT are/VBP less/RBR affected/VBN by/IN the/DT amputation/NN and/CC environment/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN accelerometry/NN or/CC gaze/NN information/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT latter/JJ case/NN ,/, the/DT hypothesis/NN is/VBZ that/IN a/DT subject/NN looks/VBZ at/IN the/DT object/NN he/PRP or/CC she/PRP intends/VBZ to/TO manipulate/VB and/CC that/IN knowing/VBG this/DT object/NN 's/POS affordances/NNS allows/VBZ to/IN constrain/VB the/DT set/NN of/IN possible/JJ grasps/VBZ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP an/DT automated/VBN way/NN to/TO detect/VB stable/JJ fixations/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN gaze/NN information/NN is/VBZ indeed/RB helpful/JJ in/IN predicting/VBG hand/NN movements/NNS ./.
