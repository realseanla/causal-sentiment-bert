A/DT typical/JJ modern/JJ optimization/NN technique/NN is/VBZ usually/RB either/DT heuristic/NN or/CC metaheuristic/JJ ./.
This/DT technique/NN has/VBZ managed/VBN to/TO solve/VB some/DT optimization/NN problems/NNS in/IN the/DT research/NN area/NN of/IN science/NN ,/, engineering/NN ,/, and/CC industry/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, implementation/NN strategy/NN of/IN metaheuristic/JJ for/IN accuracy/NN improvement/NN on/IN convolution/NN neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, a/DT famous/JJ deep/JJ learning/NN method/NN ,/, is/VBZ still/RB rarely/RB investigated/VBN ./.
Deep/JJ learning/NN relates/VBZ to/IN a/DT type/NN of/IN machine/NN learning/NN technique/NN ,/, where/WRB its/PRP$ aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO move/VB closer/RBR to/IN the/DT goal/NN of/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN of/IN creating/VBG a/DT machine/NN that/WDT could/MD successfully/RB perform/VB any/DT intellectual/JJ tasks/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB carried/VBN out/RP by/IN a/DT human/JJ ./.
