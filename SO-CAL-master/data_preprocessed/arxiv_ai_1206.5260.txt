Most/JJS real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN dynamic/JJ systems/NNS are/VBP composed/VBN of/IN different/JJ components/NNS that/WDT often/RB evolve/VBP at/IN very/RB different/JJ rates/NNS ./.
In/IN traditional/JJ temporal/JJ graphical/JJ models/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN dynamic/JJ Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ,/, time/NN is/VBZ modeled/VBN at/IN a/DT fixed/VBN granularity/NN ,/, generally/RB selected/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT rate/NN at/IN which/WDT the/DT fastest/JJS component/NN evolves/VBZ ./.
Inference/NN must/MD then/RB be/VB performed/VBN at/IN this/DT fastest/JJS granularity/NN ,/, potentially/RB at/IN significant/JJ computational/JJ cost/NN ./.
Continuous/JJ Time/NN Bayesian/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- CTBNs/NNS )/-RRB- avoid/VB time/NN -/HYPH slicing/VBG in/IN the/DT representation/NN by/IN modeling/VBG the/DT system/NN as/IN evolving/VBG continuously/RB over/IN time/NN ./.
The/DT expectation/NN -/HYPH propagation/NN (/-LRB- EP/NN )/-RRB- inference/NN algorithm/NN of/IN Nodelman/NNP et/FW al./FW (/-LRB- 2005/CD )/-RRB- can/MD then/RB vary/VB the/DT inference/NN granularity/NN over/IN time/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT granularity/NN is/VBZ uniform/JJ across/IN all/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT system/NN ,/, and/CC must/MD be/VB selected/VBN in/IN advance/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP a/DT new/JJ EP/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT utilizes/VBZ a/DT general/JJ cluster/NN graph/NN architecture/NN where/WRB clusters/NNS contain/VBP distributions/NNS that/WDT can/MD overlap/VB in/IN both/DT space/NN (/-LRB- set/NN of/IN variables/NNS )/-RRB- and/CC time/NN ./.
This/DT architecture/NN allows/VBZ different/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT system/NN to/TO be/VB modeled/VBN at/IN very/RB different/JJ time/NN granularities/NNS ,/, according/VBG to/IN their/PRP$ current/JJ rate/NN of/IN evolution/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB provide/VBP an/DT information/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ criterion/NN for/IN dynamically/RB re-partitioning/VBG the/DT clusters/NNS during/IN inference/NN to/IN tune/VB the/DT level/NN of/IN approximation/NN to/IN the/DT current/JJ rate/NN of/IN evolution/NN ./.
This/DT avoids/VBZ the/DT need/NN to/TO hand/VB -/: select/VB the/DT appropriate/JJ granularity/NN ,/, and/CC allows/VBZ the/DT granularity/NN to/TO adapt/VB as/IN information/NN is/VBZ transmitted/VBN across/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP experiments/NNS demonstrating/VBG that/IN this/DT approach/NN can/MD result/VB in/IN significant/JJ computational/JJ savings/NNS ./.
