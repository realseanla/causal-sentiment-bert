In/IN this/DT thesis/NN ,/, the/DT uses/NNS of/IN Artificial/NNP Immune/NNP Systems/NNPS (/-LRB- AIS/NNP )/-RRB- in/IN Machine/NN learning/NN is/VBZ studded/VBN ./.
the/DT thesis/NN focus/NN on/IN some/DT of/IN immune/JJ inspired/JJ algorithms/NNS such/JJ as/IN clonal/JJ selection/NN algorithm/NN and/CC artificial/JJ immune/JJ network/NN ./.
The/DT effect/NN of/IN changing/VBG the/DT algorithm/NN parameter/NN on/IN its/PRP$ performance/NN is/VBZ studded/VBN ./.
Then/RB a/DT new/JJ immune/JJ inspired/VBN algorithm/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ classification/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
The/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN clonal/JJ selection/NN principle/NN and/CC named/VBN Unsupervised/JJ Clonal/JJ Selection/NN Classification/NN (/-LRB- UCSC/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT new/JJ proposed/VBN algorithm/NN is/VBZ almost/RB parameter/NN free/JJ ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN parameters/NNS are/VBP data/NNS driven/VBN and/CC it/PRP adjusts/VBZ itself/PRP to/TO make/VB the/DT classification/NN as/RB fast/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.
The/DT performance/NN of/IN UCSC/NNP is/VBZ evaluated/VBN ./.
The/DT experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN UCSC/NNP algorithm/NN has/VBZ a/DT good/JJ performance/NN and/CC more/JJR reliable/JJ ./.
