In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, the/DT problem/NN of/IN multi-view/JJ embedding/NN from/IN different/JJ visual/JJ cues/NNS and/CC modalities/NNS is/VBZ considered/VBN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT unified/JJ solution/NN for/IN subspace/NN learning/NN methods/NNS using/VBG the/DT Rayleigh/NNP quotient/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ extensible/JJ for/IN multiple/JJ views/NNS ,/, supervised/VBD learning/NN ,/, and/CC non-linear/JJ embeddings/NNS ./.
Numerous/JJ methods/NNS including/VBG Canonical/JJ Correlation/NN Analysis/NN ,/, Partial/JJ Least/JJS Sqaure/NN regression/NN and/CC Linear/NNP Discriminant/NNP Analysis/NNP are/VBP studied/VBN using/VBG specific/JJ intrinsic/JJ and/CC penalty/NN graphs/NNS within/IN the/DT same/JJ framework/NN ./.
Non-linear/JJ extensions/NNS based/VBN on/IN kernels/NNS and/CC (/-LRB- deep/JJ )/-RRB- neural/JJ networks/NNS are/VBP derived/VBN ,/, achieving/VBG better/JJR performance/NN than/IN the/DT linear/JJ ones/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, a/DT novel/JJ variant/NN of/IN multi-view/JJ Linear/NNP Discriminant/NNP Analysis/NNP is/VBZ proposed/VBN by/IN taking/VBG the/DT view/NN difference/NN into/IN consideration/NN ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN multi-view/NN embedding/NN methods/NNS on/IN visual/JJ object/NN recognition/NN and/CC cross-modal/JJ image/NN retrieval/NN ,/, and/CC obtain/VB superior/JJ results/NNS in/IN both/DT applications/NNS compared/VBN to/IN related/JJ methods/NNS ./.
