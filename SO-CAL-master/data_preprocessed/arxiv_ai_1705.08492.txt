Randomized/JJ experiments/NNS have/VBP been/VBN used/VBN to/TO assist/VB decision/NN -/HYPH making/VBG in/IN many/JJ areas/NNS ./.
They/PRP help/VBP people/NNS select/VB the/DT optimal/JJ treatment/NN for/IN the/DT test/NN population/NN with/IN certain/JJ statistical/JJ guarantee/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, subjects/NNS can/MD show/VB significant/JJ heterogeneity/NN in/IN response/NN to/IN treatments/NNS ./.
The/DT problem/NN of/IN customizing/VBG treatment/NN assignment/NN based/VBN on/IN subject/JJ characteristics/NNS is/VBZ known/VBN as/IN uplift/NN modeling/NN ,/, differential/JJ response/NN analysis/NN ,/, or/CC personalized/VBN treatment/NN learning/NN in/IN literature/NN ./.
A/DT key/JJ feature/NN for/IN uplift/NN modeling/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT data/NNS is/VBZ unlabeled/JJ ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ impossible/JJ to/TO know/VB whether/IN the/DT chosen/VBN treatment/NN is/VBZ optimal/JJ for/IN an/DT individual/JJ subject/NN because/IN response/NN under/IN alternative/JJ treatments/NNS is/VBZ unobserved/JJ ./.
