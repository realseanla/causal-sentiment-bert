Person/NN knowledge/NN extraction/NN is/VBZ the/DT foundation/NN of/IN the/DT Tibetan/JJ knowledge/NN graph/NN construction/NN ,/, which/WDT provides/VBZ support/NN for/IN Tibetan/JJ question/NN answering/VBG system/NN ,/, information/NN retrieval/NN ,/, information/NN extraction/NN and/CC other/JJ researches/NNS ,/, and/CC promotes/VBZ national/JJ unity/NN and/CC social/JJ stability/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT SVM/NN and/CC template/NN based/VBN approach/NN to/IN Tibetan/JJ person/NN knowledge/NN extraction/NN ./.
Through/IN constructing/VBG the/DT training/NN corpus/NN ,/, we/PRP build/VBP the/DT templates/NNS based/VBN the/DT shallow/JJ parsing/VBG analysis/NN of/IN Tibetan/JJ syntactic/JJ ,/, semantic/JJ features/NNS and/CC verbs/NNS ./.
Using/VBG the/DT training/NN corpus/NN ,/, we/PRP design/VBP a/DT hierarchical/JJ SVM/NN classifier/NN to/TO realize/VB the/DT entity/NN knowledge/NN extraction/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, experimental/JJ results/NNS prove/VBP the/DT method/NN has/VBZ greater/JJR improvement/NN in/IN Tibetan/JJ person/NN knowledge/NN extraction/NN ./.
