Storytelling/NN serves/VBZ many/JJ different/JJ social/JJ functions/NNS ,/, e.g./FW stories/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO persuade/VB ,/, share/VB troubles/NNS ,/, establish/VB shared/VBN values/NNS ,/, learn/VB social/JJ behaviors/NNS ,/, and/CC entertain/VB ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, stories/NNS are/VBP often/RB told/VBN conversationally/RB through/IN dialog/NN ,/, and/CC previous/JJ work/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN information/NN provided/VBN dialogically/RB is/VBZ more/RBR engaging/JJ than/IN when/WRB provided/VBN in/IN monolog/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP algorithms/NNS for/IN converting/VBG a/DT deep/JJ representation/NN of/IN a/DT story/NN into/IN a/DT dialogic/JJ storytelling/NN ,/, that/WDT can/MD vary/VB aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT telling/NN ,/, including/VBG the/DT personality/NN of/IN the/DT storytellers/NNS ./.
We/PRP conduct/VBP several/JJ experiments/NNS to/TO test/VB whether/IN dialogic/JJ storytellings/NNS are/VBP more/RBR engaging/JJ ,/, and/CC whether/IN automatically/RB generated/VBN variants/NNS in/IN linguistic/JJ form/NN that/WDT correspond/VBP to/IN personality/NN differences/NNS can/MD be/VB recognized/VBN in/IN an/DT extended/JJ storytelling/NN dialog/NN ./.
