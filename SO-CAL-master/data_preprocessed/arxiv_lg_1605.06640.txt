There/EX are/VBP families/NNS of/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS that/WDT can/MD learn/VB to/TO compute/VB any/DT function/NN ,/, provided/VBN sufficient/JJ training/NN data/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, given/VBN that/IN in/IN practice/NN training/NN data/NNS is/VBZ scarce/JJ for/IN all/DT but/IN a/DT small/JJ set/NN of/IN problems/NNS ,/, a/DT core/NN question/NN is/VBZ how/WRB to/TO incorporate/VB prior/JJ knowledge/NN into/IN a/DT model/NN ./.
Here/RB we/PRP consider/VBP the/DT case/NN of/IN prior/JJ procedural/JJ knowledge/NN such/JJ as/IN knowing/VBG the/DT overall/JJ recursive/JJ structure/NN of/IN a/DT sequence/NN transduction/NN program/NN or/CC the/DT fact/NN that/IN a/DT program/NN will/MD likely/RB use/VB arithmetic/NN operations/NNS on/IN real/JJ numbers/NNS to/TO solve/VB a/DT task/NN ./.
To/IN this/DT end/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT differentiable/JJ interpreter/NN for/IN the/DT programming/NN language/NN Forth/NNP ./.
Through/IN a/DT neural/JJ implementation/NN of/IN the/DT dual/JJ stack/NN machine/NN that/WDT underlies/VBZ Forth/NNP ,/, programmers/NNS can/MD write/VB program/NN sketches/NNS with/IN slots/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB filled/VBN with/IN learnable/JJ behaviour/NN ./.
As/IN the/DT program/NN interpreter/NN is/VBZ end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN differentiable/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD optimize/VB this/DT behaviour/NN directly/RB through/IN gradient/NN descent/NN techniques/NNS on/IN user/NN specified/VBN objectives/NNS ,/, and/CC also/RB integrate/VB the/DT program/NN into/IN any/DT larger/JJR neural/JJ computation/NN graph/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP empirically/RB that/IN our/PRP$ interpreter/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO effectively/RB leverage/VB different/JJ levels/NNS of/IN prior/JJ program/NN structure/NN and/CC learn/VB complex/JJ transduction/NN tasks/NNS such/JJ as/IN sequence/NN sorting/NN or/CC addition/NN with/IN substantially/RB less/JJR data/NNS and/CC better/JJR generalisation/NN over/IN problem/NN sizes/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP neural/JJ program/NN optimisations/NNS based/VBN on/IN symbolic/JJ computation/NN and/CC parallel/JJ branching/NN that/WDT lead/VBP to/IN significant/JJ speed/NN improvements/NNS ./.
