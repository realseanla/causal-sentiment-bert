In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP three/CD connection/NN games/NNS among/IN the/DT most/RBS widely/RB played/VBN :/: Havannah/NNP ,/, Twixt/NNP ,/, and/CC Slither/NNP ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN determining/VBG the/DT outcome/NN of/IN an/DT arbitrary/JJ input/NN position/NN is/VBZ PSPACE/NNP -/HYPH complete/JJ in/IN all/DT three/CD cases/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ reductions/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT popular/JJ graph/NN problem/NN Generalized/VBN Geography/NNP and/CC on/IN Hex/NN itself/PRP ./.
We/PRP also/RB consider/VBP the/DT complexity/NN of/IN generalizations/NNS of/IN Hex/NN parameterized/VBN by/IN the/DT length/NN of/IN the/DT solution/NN and/CC establish/VB that/IN while/IN Short/JJ Generalized/VBN Hex/NN is/VBZ W/JJ [/-LRB- 1/CD ]/-RRB- -/HYPH hard/JJ ,/, Short/JJ Hex/NN is/VBZ FPT/NNP ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN the/DT ultra-weak/NN solution/NN to/IN the/DT empty/JJ starting/NN position/NN in/IN hex/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB fully/RB adapted/VBN to/IN any/DT of/IN these/DT three/CD games/NNS ./.
