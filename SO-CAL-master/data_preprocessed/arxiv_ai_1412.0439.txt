Human/JJ Motion/NN Analysis/NN (/-LRB- HMA/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ currently/RB one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS popularly/RB active/JJ research/NN domains/NNS as/IN such/JJ significant/JJ research/NN interests/NNS are/VBP motivated/VBN by/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN real/JJ world/NN applications/NNS such/JJ as/IN video/NN surveillance/NN ,/, sports/NNS analysis/NN ,/, healthcare/NN monitoring/NN and/CC so/RB on/RB ./.
However/RB ,/, most/JJS of/IN these/DT real/JJ world/NN applications/NNS face/VBP high/JJ levels/NNS of/IN uncertainties/NNS that/WDT can/MD affect/VB the/DT operations/NNS of/IN such/JJ applications/NNS ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP aim/VBP at/IN reviewing/VBG the/DT fuzzy/JJ set/NN oriented/VBN approaches/NNS for/IN HMA/NNP ,/, individuating/VBG how/WRB the/DT fuzzy/JJ set/NN may/MD improve/VB the/DT HMA/NNP ,/, envisaging/VBG and/CC delineating/VBG the/DT future/JJ perspectives/NNS ./.
