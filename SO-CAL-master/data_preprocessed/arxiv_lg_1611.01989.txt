We/PRP develop/VBP a/DT first/JJ line/NN of/IN attack/NN for/IN solving/VBG programming/NN competition/NN -/HYPH style/NN problems/NNS from/IN input/NN -/HYPH output/NN examples/NNS using/VBG deep/JJ learning/NN ./.
The/DT approach/NN is/VBZ to/TO train/VB a/DT neural/JJ network/NN to/TO predict/VB properties/NNS of/IN the/DT program/NN that/WDT generated/VBD the/DT outputs/NNS from/IN the/DT inputs/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP the/DT neural/JJ network/NN 's/POS predictions/NNS to/TO augment/VB search/NN techniques/NNS from/IN the/DT programming/NN languages/NNS community/NN ,/, including/VBG enumerative/JJ search/NN and/CC an/DT SMT/NN -/HYPH based/VBN solver/NN ./.
Empirically/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN leads/VBZ to/IN an/DT order/NN of/IN magnitude/NN speedup/NN over/IN the/DT strong/JJ non-augmented/JJ baselines/NNS and/CC a/DT Recurrent/JJ Neural/JJ Network/NN approach/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN we/PRP are/VBP able/JJ to/TO solve/VB problems/NNS of/IN difficulty/NN comparable/JJ to/IN the/DT simplest/JJS problems/NNS on/IN programming/NN competition/NN websites/NNS ./.
