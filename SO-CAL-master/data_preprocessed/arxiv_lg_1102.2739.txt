This/DT study/NN is/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN the/DT development/NN of/IN the/DT cortex/NN -/HYPH like/JJ visual/JJ object/NN recognition/NN system/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT general/JJ framework/NN ,/, which/WDT consists/VBZ of/IN three/CD hierarchical/JJ levels/NNS (/-LRB- modules/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
These/DT modules/NNS functionally/RB correspond/VBP to/IN the/DT V1/NN ,/, V4/NN and/CC IT/NN areas/NNS ./.
Both/DT bottom/NN -/HYPH up/NN and/CC top/JJ -/HYPH down/JJ connections/NNS between/IN the/DT hierarchical/JJ levels/NNS V4/NN and/CC IT/PRP are/VBP employed/VBN ./.
The/DT higher/JJR the/DT degree/NN of/IN matching/VBG between/IN the/DT input/NN and/CC the/DT preferred/JJ stimulus/NN ,/, the/DT shorter/JJR the/DT response/NN time/NN of/IN the/DT neuron/NN ./.
Therefore/RB information/NN about/IN a/DT single/JJ stimulus/NN is/VBZ distributed/VBN in/IN time/NN and/CC is/VBZ transmitted/VBN by/IN the/DT waves/NNS of/IN spikes/NNS ./.
The/DT reciprocal/JJ connections/NNS and/CC waves/NNS of/IN spikes/NNS implement/VB predictive/JJ coding/NN :/: an/DT initial/JJ hypothesis/NN is/VBZ generated/VBN on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN information/NN delivered/VBN by/IN the/DT first/JJ wave/NN of/IN spikes/NNS and/CC is/VBZ tested/VBN with/IN the/DT information/NN carried/VBN by/IN the/DT consecutive/JJ waves/NNS ./.
The/DT development/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN as/IN extraction/NN and/CC accumulation/NN of/IN features/NNS in/IN V4/NN and/CC objects/NNS in/IN IT/NN ./.
Once/IN stored/VBN a/DT feature/NN can/MD be/VB disposed/VBN ,/, if/IN rarely/RB activated/VBN ./.
This/DT cause/NN update/NN of/IN feature/NN repository/NN ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, objects/NNS in/IN IT/PRP are/VBP also/RB updated/VBN ./.
This/DT illustrates/VBZ the/DT growing/VBG process/NN and/CC dynamical/JJ change/NN of/IN topological/JJ structures/NNS of/IN V4/NN ,/, IT/NN and/CC connections/NNS between/IN these/DT areas/NNS ./.
