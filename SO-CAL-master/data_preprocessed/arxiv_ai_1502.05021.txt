This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ an/DT idea/NN of/IN inductive/JJ learning/NN use/NN for/IN rule/NN generation/NN from/IN ontologies/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ purpose/NN of/IN the/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO evaluate/VB the/DT possibility/NN of/IN inductive/JJ learning/NN use/NN in/IN rule/NN generation/NN from/IN ontologies/NNS and/CC to/TO develop/VB the/DT way/NN how/WRB this/DT can/MD be/VB done/VBN ./.
Generated/VBN rules/NNS are/VBP necessary/JJ to/TO supplement/VB or/CC even/RB to/TO develop/VB the/DT Semantic/JJ Web/NN Expert/NNP System/NNP (/-LRB- SWES/NNP )/-RRB- knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
The/DT SWES/NN emerges/VBZ as/IN the/DT result/NN of/IN evolution/NN of/IN expert/NN system/NN concept/NN toward/IN the/DT Web/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT SWES/NNP is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT Semantic/JJ Web/NN technologies/NNS ./.
Available/JJ publications/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN rule/NN generation/NN from/IN ontologies/NNS based/VBN on/IN inductive/JJ learning/NN is/VBZ not/RB investigated/VBN deeply/RB enough/JJ ./.
