Recent/JJ works/NNS have/VBP explored/VBN deep/JJ architectures/NNS for/IN learning/VBG multimodal/JJ speech/NN representation/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW audio/NN and/CC images/NNS ,/, articulation/NN and/CC audio/NN )/-RRB- in/IN a/DT supervised/JJ way/NN ./.
Here/RB we/PRP investigate/VB the/DT role/NN of/IN combining/VBG different/JJ speech/NN modalities/NNS ,/, i.e./FW audio/NN and/CC visual/JJ information/NN representing/VBG the/DT lips/NNS movements/NNS ,/, in/IN a/DT weakly/RB supervised/JJ way/NN using/VBG Siamese/JJ networks/NNS and/CC lexical/JJ same/JJ -/HYPH different/JJ side/NN information/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP ask/VBP whether/IN one/CD modality/NN can/MD benefit/VB from/IN the/DT other/JJ to/TO provide/VB a/DT richer/JJR representation/NN for/IN phone/NN recognition/NN in/IN a/DT weakly/RB supervised/JJ setting/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP mono/NN -/HYPH task/NN and/CC multi-task/VB methods/NNS for/IN merging/VBG speech/NN and/CC visual/JJ modalities/NNS for/IN phone/NN recognition/NN ./.
The/DT mono/NN -/HYPH task/NN learning/NN consists/VBZ in/IN applying/VBG a/DT Siamese/JJ network/NN on/IN the/DT concatenation/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD modalities/NNS ,/, while/IN the/DT multi-task/VB learning/NN receives/VBZ several/JJ different/JJ combinations/NNS of/IN modalities/NNS at/IN train/NN time/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/WDT multi-task/VBP learning/NN enhances/VBZ discriminability/NN for/IN visual/JJ and/CC multimodal/JJ inputs/NNS while/IN minimally/RB impacting/VBG auditory/JJ inputs/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT qualitative/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT obtained/VBN phone/NN embeddings/NNS ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN cross-modal/JJ visual/JJ input/NN can/MD improve/VB the/DT discriminability/NN of/IN phonological/JJ features/NNS which/WDT are/VBP visually/RB discernable/JJ (/-LRB- rounding/NN ,/, open/JJ //HYPH close/NN ,/, labial/JJ place/NN of/IN articulation/NN )/-RRB- ,/, resulting/VBG in/IN representations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP closer/RBR to/IN abstract/JJ linguistic/JJ features/NNS than/IN those/DT based/VBN on/IN audio/NN only/RB ./.
