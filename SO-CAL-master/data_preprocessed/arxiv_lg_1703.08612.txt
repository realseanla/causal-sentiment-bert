The/DT ability/NN of/IN robots/NNS to/TO estimate/VB their/PRP$ location/NN is/VBZ crucial/JJ for/IN a/DT wide/JJ variety/NN of/IN autonomous/JJ operations/NNS ./.
In/IN settings/NNS where/WRB GPS/NNP is/VBZ unavailable/JJ ,/, range/NN -/HYPH or/CC bearing/NN -/HYPH only/JJ observations/NNS relative/JJ to/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN fixed/VBN beacons/NNS provide/VBP an/DT effective/JJ means/NNS of/IN estimating/VBG a/DT robot/NN 's/POS location/NN as/IN it/PRP navigates/VBZ ./.
The/DT accuracy/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT beacon/NN -/HYPH based/VBN localization/NN system/NN depends/VBZ both/DT on/IN how/WRB beacons/NNS are/VBP spatially/RB distributed/VBN in/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, and/CC how/WRB the/DT robot/NN 's/POS location/NN is/VBZ inferred/VBN based/VBN on/IN noisy/JJ measurements/NNS of/IN range/NN or/CC bearing/NN ./.
