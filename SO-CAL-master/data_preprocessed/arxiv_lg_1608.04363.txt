The/DT ability/NN of/IN deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- to/TO learn/VB discriminative/JJ spectro/NN -/HYPH temporal/JJ patterns/NNS makes/VBZ them/PRP well/RB suited/JJ to/IN environmental/JJ sound/NN classification/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT relative/JJ scarcity/NN of/IN labeled/VBN data/NNS has/VBZ impeded/VBN the/DT exploitation/NN of/IN this/DT family/NN of/IN high/JJ -/HYPH capacity/NN models/NNS ./.
