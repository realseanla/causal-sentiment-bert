We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN architecture/NN for/IN automated/VBN road/NN surface/NN wetness/NN detection/NN from/IN audio/NN of/IN tire/NN -/HYPH surface/NN interaction/NN ./.
The/DT robustness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN on/IN 785,826/CD bins/NNS of/IN audio/NN that/WDT span/VBP an/DT extensive/JJ range/NN of/IN vehicle/NN speeds/NNS ,/, noises/NNS from/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, road/NN surface/NN types/NNS ,/, and/CC pavement/NN conditions/NNS including/VBG international/JJ roughness/NN index/NN (/-LRB- IRI/NN )/-RRB- values/NNS from/IN 25/CD in/IN //HYPH mi/NNP to/IN 1400/CD in/IN //HYPH mi/NNP ./.
The/DT training/NN and/CC evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT model/NN are/VBP performed/VBN on/IN different/JJ roads/NNS to/TO minimize/VB the/DT impact/NN of/IN environmental/JJ and/CC other/JJ external/JJ factors/NNS on/IN the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT classification/NN ./.
We/PRP achieve/VBP an/DT unweighted/JJ average/JJ recall/NN (/-LRB- UAR/NNP )/-RRB- of/IN 93.2/CD percent/NN across/IN all/DT vehicle/NN speeds/NNS including/VBG 0/CD mph/NN ./.
The/DT classifier/NN still/RB works/VBZ at/IN 0/CD mph/NN because/IN the/DT discriminating/VBG signal/NN is/VBZ present/JJ in/IN the/DT sound/NN of/IN other/JJ vehicles/NNS driving/VBG by/IN ./.
Removing/VBG audio/JJ segments/NNS at/IN speeds/NNS below/IN 2.9/CD mph/NN from/IN consideration/NN improves/VBZ the/DT UAR/NNP to/TO 100/CD percent/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT case/NN when/WRB the/DT vehicle/NN speed/NN is/VBZ below/IN 2.9/CD mph/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO discriminate/VB between/IN wet/JJ and/CC dry/JJ road/NN surfaces/NNS from/IN ambient/JJ noises/NNS and/CC achieve/VB 74.5/CD percent/NN UAR/NNP ./.
