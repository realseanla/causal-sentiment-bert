With/IN the/DT increasing/VBG popularity/NN of/IN online/JJ learning/NN ,/, intelligent/JJ tutoring/NN systems/NNS are/VBP regaining/VBG increased/VBN attention/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP adaptive/JJ algorithms/NNS for/IN personalized/VBN assignment/NN of/IN learning/VBG tasks/NNS to/IN student/NN so/IN that/IN to/TO improve/VB his/PRP$ performance/NN in/IN online/JJ learning/NN environments/NNS ./.
As/IN main/JJ contribution/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT a/DT novel/JJ Skill/NN -/HYPH Based/VBN Task/NNP Selector/NNP (/-LRB- SBTS/NNP )/-RRB- algorithm/NN which/WDT is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO approximate/VB a/DT student/NN 's/POS skill/NN level/NN based/VBN on/IN his/PRP$ performance/NN and/CC consequently/RB suggest/VBP adequate/JJ assignments/NNS ./.
The/DT SBTS/NNP is/VBZ inspired/VBN by/IN the/DT class/NN of/IN multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN contrast/NN to/IN standard/JJ multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN approaches/NNS ,/, the/DT SBTS/NNP aims/VBZ at/IN acquiring/VBG two/CD criteria/NNS related/VBN to/IN student/NN learning/NN ,/, namely/RB :/: which/WDT topics/NNS should/MD the/DT student/NN work/NN on/IN ,/, and/CC what/WDT level/NN of/IN difficulty/NN should/MD the/DT task/NN be/VB ./.
The/DT SBTS/NNP centers/NNS on/IN innovative/JJ reward/NN and/CC punishment/NN schemes/NNS in/IN a/DT task/NN and/CC skill/NN matrix/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT student/NN behaviour/NN ./.
