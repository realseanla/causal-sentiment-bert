This/DT paper/NN argues/VBZ that/IN a/DT combined/JJ treatment/NN of/IN probabilities/NNS ,/, time/NN and/CC actions/NNS is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN an/DT appropriate/JJ logical/JJ account/NN of/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN probability/NN ;/: and/CC ,/, based/VBN on/IN this/DT intuition/NN ,/, describes/VBZ an/DT expressive/JJ probabilistic/JJ temporal/JJ logic/NN for/IN reasoning/NN about/IN actions/NNS with/IN uncertain/JJ outcomes/NNS ./.
The/DT logic/NN is/VBZ modal/JJ and/CC higher/RBR -/HYPH order/NN :/: modalities/NNS annotated/VBN by/IN actions/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO express/VB possibility/NN and/CC necessity/NN of/IN propositions/NNS in/IN the/DT next/JJ states/NNS resulting/VBG from/IN the/DT actions/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT higher/JJR -/HYPH order/NN function/NN is/VBZ needed/VBN to/TO express/VB the/DT probability/NN operator/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN logic/NN is/VBZ shown/VBN to/TO be/VB an/DT adequate/JJ extension/NN of/IN classical/JJ mathematical/JJ probability/NN theory/NN ,/, and/CC its/PRP$ expressiveness/NN is/VBZ illustrated/VBN through/IN the/DT formalization/NN of/IN the/DT Monty/NNP Hall/NNP problem/NN ./.
