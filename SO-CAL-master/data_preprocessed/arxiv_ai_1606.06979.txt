This/DT paper/NN contributes/VBZ a/DT preliminary/JJ report/NN on/IN the/DT advantages/NNS and/CC disadvantages/NNS of/IN incorporating/VBG simultaneous/JJ human/JJ control/NN and/CC feedback/NN signals/NNS in/IN the/DT training/NN of/IN a/DT reinforcement/NN learning/VBG robotic/JJ agent/NN ./.
While/IN robotic/JJ human/JJ -/HYPH machine/NN interfaces/VBZ have/VBP become/VBN increasingly/RB complex/JJ in/IN both/CC form/NN and/CC function/NN ,/, control/NN remains/VBZ challenging/JJ for/IN users/NNS ./.
This/DT has/VBZ resulted/VBN in/IN an/DT increasing/VBG gap/NN between/IN user/NN control/NN approaches/NNS and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN robotic/JJ motors/NNS which/WDT can/MD be/VB controlled/VBN ./.
One/CD way/NN to/TO address/VB this/DT gap/NN is/VBZ to/TO shift/VB some/DT autonomy/NN to/IN the/DT robot/NN ./.
Semi-autonomous/JJ actions/NNS of/IN the/DT robotic/JJ agent/NN can/MD then/RB be/VB shaped/VBN by/IN human/JJ feedback/NN ,/, simplifying/VBG user/NN control/NN ./.
Most/JJS prior/JJ work/NN on/IN agent/NN shaping/NN by/IN humans/NNS has/VBZ incorporated/VBN training/NN with/IN feedback/NN ,/, or/CC has/VBZ included/VBN indirect/JJ control/NN signals/NNS ./.
By/IN contrast/NN ,/, in/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP explore/VBP how/WRB a/DT human/NN can/MD provide/VB concurrent/JJ feedback/NN signals/NNS and/CC real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN myoelectric/JJ control/NN signals/NNS to/TO train/VB a/DT robot/NN 's/POS actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN reinforcement/NN learning/VBG control/NN system/NN ./.
Using/VBG both/CC a/DT physical/JJ and/CC a/DT simulated/VBN robotic/JJ system/NN ,/, we/PRP compare/VBP training/NN performance/NN on/IN a/DT simple/JJ movement/NN task/NN when/WRB reward/NN is/VBZ derived/VBN from/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, when/WRB reward/NN is/VBZ provided/VBN by/IN the/DT human/JJ ,/, and/CC combinations/NNS of/IN these/DT two/CD approaches/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN some/DT benefit/NN can/MD be/VB gained/VBN with/IN the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN human/JJ generated/VBN feedback/NN ./.
