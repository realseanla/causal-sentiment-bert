This/DT paper/NN explores/VBZ the/DT contributions/NNS of/IN Answer/NN Set/VBN Programming/NN (/-LRB- ASP/NN )/-RRB- to/IN the/DT study/NN of/IN an/DT established/VBN theory/NN from/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN Second/JJ Language/NNP Acquisition/NNP :/: Input/NNP Processing/NNP ./.
The/DT theory/NN describes/VBZ default/NN strategies/NNS that/WDT learners/NNS of/IN a/DT second/JJ language/NN use/NN in/IN extracting/VBG meaning/VBG out/IN of/IN a/DT text/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN their/PRP$ knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT second/JJ language/NN and/CC their/PRP$ background/NN knowledge/NN about/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
We/PRP formalized/VBD this/DT theory/NN in/IN ASP/NN ,/, and/CC as/IN a/DT result/NN we/PRP were/VBD able/JJ to/TO determine/VB opportunities/NNS for/IN refining/VBG its/PRP$ natural/JJ language/NN description/NN ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN directions/NNS for/IN future/JJ theory/NN development/NN ./.
We/PRP applied/VBD our/PRP$ model/NN to/IN automating/VBG the/DT prediction/NN of/IN how/WRB learners/NNS of/IN English/NNP would/MD interpret/VB sentences/NNS containing/VBG the/DT passive/JJ voice/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT system/NN ,/, PIas/NNP ,/, that/DT uses/VBZ these/DT predictions/NNS to/TO assist/VB language/NN instructors/NNS in/IN designing/VBG teaching/NN materials/NNS ./.
To/TO appear/VB in/IN Theory/NN and/CC Practice/NN of/IN Logic/NNP Programming/NNP (/-LRB- TPLP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
