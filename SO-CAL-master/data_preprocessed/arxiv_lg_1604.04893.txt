K/NN -/HYPH means/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS widely/RB used/VBN clustering/NN algorithms/NNS in/IN various/JJ disciplines/NNS ,/, especially/RB for/IN large/JJ datasets/NNS ./.
However/RB the/DT method/NN is/VBZ known/VBN to/TO be/VB highly/RB sensitive/JJ to/IN initial/JJ seed/NN selection/NN of/IN cluster/NN centers/NNS ./.
K/NN -/HYPH means/NN has/VBZ been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO overcome/VB this/DT problem/NN and/CC has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN to/TO have/VB better/JJR accuracy/NN and/CC computational/JJ efficiency/NN than/IN k/CD -/HYPH means/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ clustering/NN problems/NNS though/IN -/HYPH such/JJ as/IN when/WRB classifying/VBG georeferenced/VBN data/NNS for/IN mapping/NN applications/NNS -/, standardization/NN of/IN clustering/NN methodology/NN ,/, specifically/RB ,/, the/DT ability/NN to/TO arrive/VB at/IN the/DT same/JJ cluster/NN assignment/NN for/IN every/DT run/NN of/IN the/DT method/NN i.e./FW replicability/FW of/IN the/DT methodology/NN ,/, may/MD be/VB of/IN greater/JJR significance/NN than/IN any/DT perceived/VBN measure/NN of/IN accuracy/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB the/DT solution/NN is/VBZ known/VBN to/TO be/VB non-unique/JJ ,/, as/IN in/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN k/CD -/HYPH means/NN clustering/NN ./.
Here/RB we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT simple/JJ initial/JJ seed/NN selection/NN algorithm/NN for/IN k/CD -/HYPH means/NN clustering/NN along/IN one/CD attribute/NN that/WDT draws/VBZ initial/JJ cluster/NN boundaries/NNS along/IN the/DT '/`` deepest/JJS valleys/NNS '/POS or/CC greatest/JJS gaps/NNS in/IN dataset/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, it/PRP incorporates/VBZ a/DT measure/NN to/TO maximize/VB distance/NN between/IN consecutive/JJ cluster/NN centers/NNS which/WDT augments/VBZ the/DT conventional/JJ k/NN -/HYPH means/NN optimization/NN for/IN minimum/JJ distance/NN between/IN cluster/NN center/NN and/CC cluster/NN members/NNS ./.
Unlike/IN existing/VBG initialization/NN methods/NNS ,/, no/DT additional/JJ parameters/NNS or/CC degrees/NNS of/IN freedom/NN are/VBP introduced/VBN to/IN the/DT clustering/NN algorithm/NN ./.
This/DT improves/VBZ the/DT replicability/NN of/IN cluster/NN assignments/NNS by/IN as/RB much/JJ as/IN 100/CD percent/NN over/IN k/CD -/HYPH means/NNS and/CC k/CD -/HYPH means/NNS ,/, virtually/RB reducing/VBG the/DT variance/NN over/IN different/JJ runs/NNS to/IN zero/CD ,/, without/IN introducing/VBG any/DT additional/JJ parameters/NNS to/IN the/DT clustering/NN process/NN ./.
Further/RB ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ more/RBR computationally/RB efficient/JJ than/IN k/CD -/HYPH means/NNS and/CC in/IN some/DT cases/NNS ,/, more/RBR accurate/JJ ./.
