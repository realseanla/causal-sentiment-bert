We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT task/NN of/IN forecasting/VBG an/DT infinite/JJ sequence/NN of/IN future/JJ observation/NN based/VBN on/IN some/DT number/NN of/IN past/JJ observations/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT probability/NN measure/NN generating/VBG the/DT observations/NNS is/VBZ "/`` suspected/VBN "/'' to/TO satisfy/VB one/CD or/CC more/JJR of/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN incomplete/JJ models/NNS ,/, i.e./FW convex/FW sets/NNS in/IN the/DT space/NN of/IN probability/NN measures/NNS ./.
This/DT setting/NN is/VBZ in/IN some/DT sense/NN intermediate/JJ between/IN the/DT realizable/JJ setting/NN where/WRB the/DT probability/NN measure/NN comes/VBZ from/IN some/DT known/VBN set/NN of/IN probability/NN measures/NNS (/-LRB- which/WDT can/MD be/VB addressed/VBN using/VBG e.g./FW Bayesian/JJ inference/NN )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT unrealizable/JJ setting/NN where/WRB the/DT probability/NN measure/NN is/VBZ completely/RB arbitrary/JJ ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP a/DT method/NN of/IN forecasting/NN which/WDT guarantees/VBZ that/IN ,/, whenever/WRB the/DT true/JJ probability/NN measure/NN satisfies/VBZ an/DT incomplete/JJ model/NN in/IN a/DT given/VBN countable/JJ set/NN ,/, the/DT forecast/NN converges/VBZ to/IN the/DT same/JJ incomplete/JJ model/NN in/IN the/DT (/-LRB- appropriately/RB normalized/VBN )/-RRB- Kantorovich/NNP -/HYPH Rubinstein/NNP metric/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ analogous/JJ to/IN merging/VBG of/IN opinions/NNS for/IN Bayesian/JJ inference/NN ,/, except/IN that/IN convergence/NN in/IN the/DT Kantorovich/NNP -/HYPH Rubinstein/NNP metric/NN is/VBZ weaker/JJR than/IN convergence/NN in/IN total/JJ variation/NN ./.
