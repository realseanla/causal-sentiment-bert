Item/NN neighbourhood/NN methods/NNS for/IN collaborative/JJ filtering/NN learn/VBP a/DT weighted/JJ graph/NN over/IN the/DT set/NN of/IN items/NNS ,/, where/WRB each/DT item/NN is/VBZ connected/VBN to/IN those/DT it/PRP is/VBZ most/RBS similar/JJ to/IN ./.
The/DT prediction/NN of/IN a/DT user/NN 's/POS rating/NN on/IN an/DT item/NN is/VBZ then/RB given/VBN by/IN that/DT rating/NN of/IN neighbouring/VBG items/NNS ,/, weighted/VBN by/IN their/PRP$ similarity/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ neighbourhood/NN approach/NN which/WDT we/PRP call/VBP item/NN fields/NNS ,/, whereby/WRB an/DT undirected/JJ graphical/JJ model/NN is/VBZ formed/VBN over/IN the/DT item/NN graph/NN ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG prediction/NN rule/NN is/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ generalization/NN of/IN the/DT classical/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, which/WDT takes/VBZ into/IN account/NN non-local/JJ information/NN in/IN the/DT graph/NN ,/, allowing/VBG its/PRP$ best/JJS results/NNS to/TO be/VB obtained/VBN when/WRB using/VBG drastically/RB fewer/JJR edges/NNS than/IN other/JJ neighbourhood/NN approaches/NNS ./.
A/DT fast/JJ approximate/JJ maximum/NN entropy/NN training/NN method/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT Bethe/NNP approximation/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN ,/, which/WDT uses/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ gradient/NN ascent/NN procedure/NN ./.
When/WRB using/VBG precomputed/VBN sufficient/JJ statistics/NNS on/IN the/DT Movielens/NNPS datasets/NNS ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ faster/JJR than/IN maximum/JJ likelihood/NN approaches/NNS by/IN two/CD orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN ./.
