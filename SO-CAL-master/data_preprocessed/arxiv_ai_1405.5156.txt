The/DT Collective/JJ Graphical/JJ Model/NN (/-LRB- CGM/NN )/-RRB- models/NNS a/DT population/NN of/IN independent/JJ and/CC identically/RB distributed/VBN individuals/NNS when/WRB only/RB collective/JJ statistics/NNS (/-LRB- i.e./FW ,/, counts/NNS of/IN individuals/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP observed/VBN ./.
Exact/JJ inference/NN in/IN CGMs/NN is/VBZ intractable/JJ ,/, and/CC previous/JJ work/NN has/VBZ explored/VBN Markov/NNP Chain/NNP Monte/NNP Carlo/NNP (/-LRB- MCMC/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC MAP/NN approximations/NNS for/IN learning/NN and/CC inference/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT population/NN grows/VBZ large/JJ ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT CGM/NNP distribution/NN converges/VBZ to/IN a/DT multivariate/JJ Gaussian/JJ distribution/NN (/-LRB- GCGM/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT maintains/VBZ the/DT conditional/JJ independence/NN properties/NNS of/IN the/DT original/JJ CGM/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT observations/NNS are/VBP exact/JJ marginals/NNS of/IN the/DT CGM/NN or/CC marginals/NNS that/WDT are/VBP corrupted/VBN by/IN Gaussian/JJ noise/NN ,/, inference/NN in/IN the/DT GCGM/NN approximation/NN can/MD be/VB computed/VBN efficiently/RB in/IN closed/JJ form/NN ./.
If/IN the/DT observations/NNS follow/VBP a/DT different/JJ noise/NN model/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW ,/, Poisson/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, then/RB expectation/NN propagation/NN provides/VBZ efficient/JJ and/CC accurate/JJ approximate/JJ inference/NN ./.
The/DT accuracy/NN and/CC speed/NN of/IN GCGM/NNP inference/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN to/IN the/DT MCMC/NNP and/CC MAP/NN methods/NNS on/IN a/DT simulated/JJ bird/NN migration/NN problem/NN ./.
