Circumscription/NN and/CC logic/NN programs/NNS under/IN the/DT stable/JJ model/NN semantics/NNS are/VBP two/CD well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN nonmonotonic/JJ formalisms/NNS ./.
The/DT former/JJ has/VBZ served/VBN as/IN a/DT basis/NN of/IN classical/JJ logic/NN based/VBN action/NN formalisms/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT situation/NN calculus/NN ,/, the/DT event/NN calculus/NN and/CC temporal/JJ action/NN logics/NNS ;/: the/DT latter/JJ has/VBZ served/VBN as/IN a/DT basis/NN of/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN action/NN languages/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN language/NN A/NN and/CC several/JJ of/IN its/PRP$ descendants/NNS ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT discovery/NN that/WDT circumscription/NN and/CC the/DT stable/JJ model/NN semantics/NNS coincide/VBP on/IN a/DT class/NN of/IN canonical/JJ formulas/NNS ,/, we/PRP reformulate/VBP the/DT situation/NN calculus/NN and/CC the/DT event/NN calculus/NN in/IN the/DT general/JJ theory/NN of/IN stable/JJ models/NNS ./.
