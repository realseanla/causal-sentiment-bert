We/PRP present/VBP Solrex/NNP ,/, an/DT automated/VBN solver/NN for/IN the/DT game/NN of/IN Reverse/JJ Hex.Reverse/NN Hex/NN ,/, also/RB known/VBN as/IN Rex/NNP ,/, or/CC Misere/NNP Hex/NNP ,/, is/VBZ the/DT variant/NN of/IN the/DT game/NN of/IN Hex/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT player/NN who/WP joins/VBZ her/PRP$ two/CD sides/NNS loses/VBZ the/DT game/NN ./.
Solrex/NNP performs/VBZ a/DT mini-max/JJ search/NN of/IN the/DT state/NN space/NN using/VBG Scalable/JJ Parallel/JJ Depth/NN First/NNP Proof/NNP Number/NNP Search/NNP ,/, enhanced/VBN by/IN the/DT pruning/NN of/IN inferior/JJ moves/NNS and/CC the/DT early/JJ detection/NN of/IN certain/JJ winning/VBG strategies/NNS ./.
Solrex/NNP is/VBZ implemented/VBN on/IN the/DT same/JJ code/NN base/NN as/IN the/DT Hex/NN program/NN Solver/NNP ,/, and/CC can/MD solve/VB arbitrary/JJ positions/NNS on/IN board/NN sizes/VBZ up/RP to/IN 6x6/NN ,/, with/IN the/DT hardest/JJS position/NN taking/VBG less/JJR than/IN four/CD hours/NNS on/IN four/CD threads/NNS ./.
