We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ training/NN method/NN for/IN a/DT feedforward/JJ neural/JJ network/NN having/VBG the/DT activation/NN functions/VBZ with/IN the/DT geometric/JJ contraction/NN property/NN ./.
The/DT method/NN consists/VBZ of/IN constructing/VBG a/DT new/JJ functional/JJ that/IN is/VBZ less/RBR nonlinear/JJ in/IN comparison/NN with/IN the/DT classical/JJ functional/JJ by/IN removing/VBG the/DT nonlinearity/NN of/IN the/DT activation/NN functions/VBZ from/IN the/DT output/NN layer/NN ./.
We/PRP validate/VBP this/DT new/JJ method/NN by/IN a/DT series/NN of/IN experiments/NNS that/WDT show/VBP an/DT improved/VBN learning/NN speed/NN and/CC also/RB a/DT better/JJR classification/NN error/NN ./.
