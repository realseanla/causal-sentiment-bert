Gibbs/NNP sampling/NN is/VBZ a/DT Markov/NNP Chain/NNP Monte/NNP Carlo/NNP sampling/NN technique/NN that/WDT iteratively/RB samples/NNS variables/NNS from/IN their/PRP$ conditional/JJ distributions/NNS ./.
There/EX are/VBP two/CD common/JJ scan/NN orders/NNS for/IN the/DT variables/NNS :/: random/JJ scan/NN and/CC systematic/JJ scan/NN ./.
Due/IN to/IN the/DT benefits/NNS of/IN locality/NN in/IN hardware/NN ,/, systematic/JJ scan/NN is/VBZ commonly/RB used/VBN ,/, even/RB though/IN most/JJS statistical/JJ guarantees/NNS are/VBP only/RB for/IN random/JJ scan/NN ./.
While/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN conjectured/VBN that/IN the/DT mixing/VBG times/NNS of/IN random/JJ scan/NN and/CC systematic/JJ scan/NN do/VBP not/RB differ/VB by/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT logarithmic/JJ factor/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP by/IN counterexample/NN that/IN this/DT is/VBZ not/RB the/DT case/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN that/IN the/DT mixing/VBG times/NNS do/VBP not/RB differ/VB by/IN more/JJR than/IN a/DT polynomial/JJ factor/NN under/IN mild/JJ conditions/NNS ./.
To/TO prove/VB these/DT relative/JJ bounds/NNS ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT method/NN of/IN augmenting/VBG the/DT state/NN space/NN to/TO study/VB systematic/JJ scan/NN using/VBG conductance/NN ./.
