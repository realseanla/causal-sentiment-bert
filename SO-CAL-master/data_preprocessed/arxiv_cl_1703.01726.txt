Computation/NN of/IN semantic/JJ similarity/NN between/IN concepts/NNS is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ foundation/NN for/IN many/JJ research/NN works/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN IC/NN computing/NN methods/NNS and/CC IC/NN measures/NNS ,/, which/WDT estimate/VBP the/DT semantic/JJ similarities/NNS between/IN concepts/NNS by/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT topological/JJ parameters/NNS of/IN the/DT taxonomy/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN analyzing/VBG representative/JJ IC/NN computing/NN methods/NNS and/CC typical/JJ semantic/JJ similarity/NN measures/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ hybrid/NN IC/NN computing/NN method/NN ./.
Through/IN adopting/VBG the/DT parameter/NN dhyp/NN and/CC lch/NN ,/, we/PRP utilize/VBP the/DT new/JJ IC/NN computing/NN method/NN and/CC propose/VB a/DT novel/JJ comprehensive/JJ measure/NN of/IN semantic/JJ similarity/NN between/IN concepts/NNS ./.
An/DT experiment/NN based/VBN on/IN WordNet/NNP "/'' is/VBZ a/DT "/`` taxonomy/NN has/VBZ been/VBN designed/VBN to/TO test/VB representative/JJ measures/NNS and/CC our/PRP$ measure/NN on/IN benchmark/NN dataset/NN R&amp;G/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT results/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ measure/NN can/MD obviously/RB improve/VB the/DT similarity/NN accuracy/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN by/IN comparing/VBG the/DT correlation/NN coefficients/NNS between/IN five/CD measures/NNS and/CC the/DT artificial/JJ data/NNS ./.
