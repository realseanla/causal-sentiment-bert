We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN automatically/RB answering/VBG questions/NNS about/IN images/NNS by/IN bringing/VBG together/RB recent/JJ advances/NNS from/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN and/CC computer/NN vision/NN ./.
We/PRP combine/VBP discrete/JJ reasoning/NN with/IN uncertain/JJ predictions/NNS by/IN a/DT multi-world/JJ approach/NN that/WDT represents/VBZ uncertainty/NN about/IN the/DT perceived/VBN world/NN in/IN a/DT bayesian/JJ framework/NN ./.

We/PRP establish/VBP a/DT first/JJ benchmark/NN for/IN this/DT task/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DT modern/JJ attempt/NN at/IN a/DT visual/JJ turing/NN test/NN ./.
