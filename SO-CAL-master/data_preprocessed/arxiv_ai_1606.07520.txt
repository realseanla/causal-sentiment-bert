The/DT impossibility/NN theorem/NN of/IN Dekel/NNP ,/, Lipman/NNP and/CC Rustichini/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN thought/VBN to/TO demonstrate/VB that/IN standard/JJ state/NN -/HYPH space/NN models/NNS can/MD not/RB be/VB used/VBN to/TO represent/VB unawareness/NN ./.
We/PRP first/RB show/VBP that/IN Dekel/NNP ,/, Lipman/NNP and/CC Rustichini/NNP do/VBP not/RB establish/VB this/DT claim/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB distinguish/VBP three/CD notions/NNS of/IN awareness/NN ,/, and/CC argue/VBP that/IN although/IN one/CD of/IN them/PRP may/MD not/RB be/VB adequately/RB modeled/VBN using/VBG standard/JJ state/NN spaces/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ no/DT reason/NN to/TO think/VB that/IN standard/JJ state/NN spaces/NNS can/MD not/RB provide/VB models/NNS of/IN the/DT other/JJ two/CD notions/NNS ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, standard/JJ space/NN models/NNS of/IN these/DT forms/NNS of/IN awareness/NN are/VBP attractively/RB simple/JJ ./.
They/PRP allow/VBP us/PRP to/TO prove/VB completeness/NN and/CC decidability/NN results/NNS with/IN ease/NN ,/, to/TO carry/VB over/RP standard/JJ techniques/NNS from/IN decision/NN theory/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO add/VB propositional/JJ quantifiers/NNS straightforwardly/RB ./.
