The/DT problem/NN of/IN makespan/NN optimal/JJ solving/NN of/IN cooperative/JJ path/NN finding/NN (/-LRB- CPF/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ addressed/VBN in/IN this/DT paper/NN ./.
The/DT task/NN in/IN CPF/NNP is/VBZ to/TO relocate/VB a/DT group/NN of/IN agents/NNS in/IN a/DT non-colliding/JJ way/NN so/IN that/IN each/DT agent/NN eventually/RB reaches/VBZ its/PRP$ goal/NN location/NN from/IN the/DT given/VBN initial/JJ location/NN ./.
The/DT abstraction/NN adopted/VBN in/IN this/DT work/NN assumes/VBZ that/IN agents/NNS are/VBP discrete/JJ items/NNS moving/VBG in/IN an/DT undirected/JJ graph/NN by/IN traversing/VBG edges/NNS ./.
Makespan/JJ optimal/JJ solving/NN of/IN CPF/NN means/VBZ to/TO generate/VB solutions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP as/IN short/JJ as/IN possi/NN -/HYPH ble/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT total/JJ number/NN of/IN time/NN steps/NNS required/VBN for/IN the/DT execution/NN of/IN the/DT solution/NN ./.
