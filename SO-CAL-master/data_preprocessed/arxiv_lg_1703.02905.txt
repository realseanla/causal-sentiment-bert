Being/VBG able/JJ to/TO fall/VB safely/RB is/VBZ a/DT necessary/JJ motor/NN skill/NN for/IN humanoids/NNS performing/VBG highly/RB dynamic/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN running/VBG and/CC jumping/VBG ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ method/NN to/TO learn/VB a/DT policy/NN that/WDT minimizes/VBZ the/DT maximal/JJ impulse/NN during/IN the/DT fall/NN ./.
The/DT optimization/NN solves/VBZ for/IN both/CC a/DT discrete/JJ contact/NN planning/NN problem/NN and/CC a/DT continuous/JJ optimal/JJ control/NN problem/NN ./.
Once/IN trained/VBN ,/, the/DT policy/NN can/MD compute/VB the/DT optimal/JJ next/JJ contacting/VBG body/NN part/NN (/-LRB- e.g./FW left/VBD foot/NN ,/, right/JJ foot/NN ,/, or/CC hands/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, contact/NN location/NN and/CC timing/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT required/VBN joint/NN actuation/NN ./.
We/PRP represent/VBP the/DT policy/NN as/IN a/DT mixture/NN of/IN actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN neural/JJ network/NN ,/, which/WDT consists/VBZ of/IN n/NN control/NN policies/NNS and/CC the/DT corresponding/JJ value/NN functions/NNS ./.
Each/DT pair/NN of/IN actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN is/VBZ associated/VBN with/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT n/NN possible/JJ contacting/VBG body/NN parts/NNS ./.
During/IN execution/NN ,/, the/DT policy/NN corresponding/VBG to/IN the/DT highest/JJS value/NN function/NN will/MD be/VB executed/VBN while/IN the/DT associated/VBN body/NN part/NN will/MD be/VB the/DT next/JJ contact/NN with/IN the/DT ground/NN ./.
With/IN this/DT mixture/NN of/IN actor/NN -/HYPH critic/NN architecture/NN ,/, the/DT discrete/JJ contact/NN sequence/NN planning/NN is/VBZ solved/VBN through/IN the/DT selection/NN of/IN the/DT best/JJS critics/NNS while/IN the/DT continuous/JJ control/NN problem/NN is/VBZ solved/VBN by/IN the/DT optimization/NN of/IN actors/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ policy/NN can/MD achieve/VB comparable/JJ ,/, sometimes/RB even/RB higher/JJR ,/, rewards/NNS than/IN a/DT recursive/JJ search/NN of/IN the/DT action/NN space/NN using/VBG dynamic/JJ programming/NN ,/, while/IN enjoying/VBG 50/CD to/IN 400/CD times/NNS of/IN speed/NN gain/NN during/IN online/JJ execution/NN ./.
