Knowledge/NN bases/NNS of/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN facts/NNS about/IN entities/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ relationships/NNS are/VBP useful/JJ resources/NNS for/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN tasks/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, because/IN knowledge/NN bases/NNS are/VBP typically/RB incomplete/JJ ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ useful/JJ to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO perform/VB link/NN prediction/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, predict/VBP whether/IN a/DT relationship/NN not/RB in/IN the/DT knowledge/NN base/NN is/VBZ likely/JJ to/TO be/VB true/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN combines/VBZ insights/NNS from/IN several/JJ previous/JJ link/NN prediction/NN models/NNS into/IN a/DT new/JJ embedding/NN model/NN STransE/NN that/WDT represents/VBZ each/DT entity/NN as/IN a/DT low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ vector/NN ,/, and/CC each/DT relation/NN by/IN two/CD matrices/NNS and/CC a/DT translation/NN vector/NN ./.
STransE/NNP is/VBZ a/DT simple/JJ combination/NN of/IN the/DT SE/NNP and/CC TransE/NN models/NNS ,/, but/CC it/PRP obtains/VBZ better/JJR link/NN prediction/NN performance/NN on/IN two/CD benchmark/NN datasets/NNS than/IN previous/JJ embedding/NN models/NNS ./.
Thus/RB ,/, STransE/NNP can/MD serve/VB as/IN a/DT new/JJ baseline/NN for/IN the/DT more/RBR complex/JJ models/NNS in/IN the/DT link/NN prediction/NN task/NN ./.
