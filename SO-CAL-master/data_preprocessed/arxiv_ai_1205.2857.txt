Soft/JJ sets/NNS ,/, as/IN a/DT mathematical/JJ tool/NN for/IN dealing/VBG with/IN uncertainty/NN ,/, have/VBP recently/RB gained/VBN considerable/JJ attention/NN ,/, including/VBG some/DT successful/JJ applications/NNS in/IN information/NN processing/NN ,/, decision/NN ,/, demand/NN analysis/NN ,/, and/CC forecasting/NN ./.
To/TO construct/VB new/JJ soft/JJ sets/NNS from/IN given/JJ soft/JJ sets/NNS ,/, some/DT operations/NNS on/IN soft/JJ sets/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, such/JJ operations/NNS can/MD not/RB keep/VB all/DT classical/JJ set/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ laws/NNS true/JJ for/IN soft/JJ sets/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP redefine/VBP the/DT intersection/NN ,/, complement/NN ,/, and/CC difference/NN of/IN soft/JJ sets/NNS and/CC investigate/VB the/DT algebraic/JJ properties/NNS of/IN these/DT operations/NNS along/IN with/IN a/DT known/VBN union/NN operation/NN ./.
