Term/NN frequency/NN normalization/NN is/VBZ a/DT serious/JJ issue/NN since/IN lengths/NNS of/IN documents/NNS are/VBP various/JJ ./.
Generally/RB ,/, documents/NNS become/VBP long/RB due/JJ to/IN two/CD different/JJ reasons/NNS -/HYPH verbosity/NN and/CC multi-topicality/NN ./.
First/RB ,/, verbosity/NN means/VBZ that/IN the/DT same/JJ topic/NN is/VBZ repeatedly/RB mentioned/VBN by/IN terms/NNS related/VBN to/IN the/DT topic/NN ,/, so/IN that/IN term/NN frequency/NN is/VBZ more/RBR increased/VBN than/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH summarized/VBN one/CD ./.
Second/RB ,/, multi-topicality/NN indicates/VBZ that/IN a/DT document/NN has/VBZ a/DT broad/JJ discussion/NN of/IN multi-topics/NNS ,/, rather/RB than/IN single/JJ topic/NN ./.
Although/IN these/DT document/NN characteristics/NNS should/MD be/VB differently/RB handled/VBN ,/, all/DT previous/JJ methods/NNS of/IN term/NN frequency/NN normalization/NN have/VBP ignored/VBN these/DT differences/NNS and/CC have/VBP used/VBN a/DT simplified/JJ length/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN approach/NN which/WDT decreases/VBZ the/DT term/NN frequency/NN by/IN only/RB the/DT length/NN of/IN a/DT document/NN ,/, causing/VBG an/DT unreasonable/JJ penalization/NN ./.
To/TO attack/VB this/DT problem/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ TF/NN normalization/NN method/NN which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT type/NN of/IN partially/RB -/HYPH axiomatic/JJ approach/NN ./.
We/PRP first/RB formulate/VB two/CD formal/JJ constraints/NNS that/WDT the/DT retrieval/NN model/NN should/MD satisfy/VB for/IN documents/NNS having/VBG verbose/JJ and/CC multi-topicality/JJ characteristic/JJ ,/, respectively/RB ./.
Then/RB ,/, we/PRP modify/VBP language/NN modeling/NN approaches/VBZ to/TO better/RBR satisfy/VB these/DT two/CD constraints/NNS ,/, and/CC derive/VBP novel/JJ smoothing/NN methods/NNS ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN increases/VBZ significantly/RB the/DT precision/NN for/IN keyword/JJ queries/NNS ,/, and/CC substantially/RB improves/VBZ MAP/NN (/-LRB- Mean/NNP Average/NNP Precision/NNP )/-RRB- for/IN verbose/JJ queries/NNS ./.
