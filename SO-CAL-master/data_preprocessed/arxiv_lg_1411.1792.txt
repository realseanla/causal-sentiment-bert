Many/JJ deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS trained/VBN on/IN natural/JJ images/NNS exhibit/VBP a/DT curious/JJ phenomenon/NN in/IN common/JJ :/: on/IN the/DT first/JJ layer/NN they/PRP learn/VBP features/NNS similar/JJ to/IN Gabor/NNP filters/NNS and/CC color/NN blobs/NNS ./.
Such/JJ first/JJ -/HYPH layer/NN features/NNS appear/VBP not/RB to/TO be/VB specific/JJ to/IN a/DT particular/JJ dataset/NN or/CC task/NN ,/, but/CC general/JJ in/IN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP applicable/JJ to/IN many/JJ datasets/NNS and/CC tasks/NNS ./.
Features/NNS must/MD eventually/RB transition/VB from/IN general/JJ to/IN specific/JJ by/IN the/DT last/JJ layer/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ,/, but/CC this/DT transition/NN has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN studied/VBN extensively/RB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP experimentally/RB quantify/VBP the/DT generality/NN versus/IN specificity/NN of/IN neurons/NNS in/IN each/DT layer/NN of/IN a/DT deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN and/CC report/VB a/DT few/JJ surprising/JJ results/NNS ./.
Transferability/NN is/VBZ negatively/RB affected/VBN by/IN two/CD distinct/JJ issues/NNS :/: (/-LRB- 1/LS )/-RRB- the/DT specialization/NN of/IN higher/JJR layer/NN neurons/NNS to/IN their/PRP$ original/JJ task/NN at/IN the/DT expense/NN of/IN performance/NN on/IN the/DT target/NN task/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD expected/VBN ,/, and/CC (/-LRB- 2/LS )/-RRB- optimization/NN difficulties/NNS related/VBN to/IN splitting/NN networks/NNS between/IN co-adapted/JJ neurons/NNS ,/, which/WDT was/VBD not/RB expected/VBN ./.
In/IN an/DT example/NN network/NN trained/VBN on/IN ImageNet/NNP ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN either/DT of/IN these/DT two/CD issues/NNS may/MD dominate/VB ,/, depending/VBG on/IN whether/IN features/NNS are/VBP transferred/VBN from/IN the/DT bottom/NN ,/, middle/NN ,/, or/CC top/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB document/VBP that/IN the/DT transferability/NN of/IN features/NNS decreases/VBZ as/IN the/DT distance/NN between/IN the/DT base/NN task/NN and/CC target/NN task/NN increases/NNS ,/, but/CC that/IN transferring/VBG features/NNS even/RB from/IN distant/JJ tasks/NNS can/MD be/VB better/JJR than/IN using/VBG random/JJ features/NNS ./.
A/DT final/JJ surprising/JJ result/NN is/VBZ that/IN initializing/VBG a/DT network/NN with/IN transferred/VBN features/NNS from/IN almost/RB any/DT number/NN of/IN layers/NNS can/MD produce/VB a/DT boost/NN to/IN generalization/NN that/WDT lingers/VBZ even/RB after/IN fine/JJ -/HYPH tuning/NN to/IN the/DT target/NN dataset/NN ./.
