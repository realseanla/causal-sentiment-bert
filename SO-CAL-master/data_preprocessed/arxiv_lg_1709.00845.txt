This/DT work/NN presents/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN approach/NN for/IN data/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN modeling/NN of/IN asset/NN failures/NNS when/WRB health/NN status/NN is/VBZ only/RB partially/RB known/VBN in/IN historical/JJ data/NNS ./.
We/PRP combine/VBP a/DT generative/JJ model/NN parameterized/VBN by/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS with/IN non-linear/JJ embedding/NN technique/NN ./.
It/PRP allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO build/VB prognostic/JJ models/NNS with/IN the/DT limited/JJ amount/NN of/IN health/NN status/NN information/NN for/IN the/DT precise/JJ prediction/NN of/IN future/JJ asset/NN reliability/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN on/IN a/DT publicly/RB available/JJ dataset/NN for/IN remaining/VBG useful/JJ life/NN (/-LRB- RUL/NN )/-RRB- estimation/NN ,/, which/WDT shows/VBZ significant/JJ improvement/NN even/RB when/WRB a/DT fraction/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS with/IN known/JJ health/NN status/NN is/VBZ as/IN sparse/JJ as/IN 1/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT total/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ study/NN suggests/VBZ that/IN the/DT non-linear/JJ embedding/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT deep/JJ generative/JJ model/NN can/MD efficiently/RB regularize/VB a/DT complex/JJ model/NN with/IN deep/JJ architectures/NNS while/IN achieving/VBG high/JJ prediction/NN accuracy/NN that/WDT is/VBZ far/RB less/RBR sensitive/JJ to/IN the/DT availability/NN of/IN health/NN status/NN information/NN ./.
