We/PRP view/VBP the/DT syntax/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approaches/NNS to/IN default/NN reasoning/NN as/IN a/DT model/NN -/HYPH based/VBN diagnosis/NN problem/NN ,/, where/WRB each/DT source/NN giving/VBG a/DT piece/NN of/IN information/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN as/IN a/DT component/NN ./.

This/DT probability/NN assignment/NN induces/VBZ a/DT Dempster/NNP -/HYPH Shafer/NNP belief/NN function/NN which/WDT measures/VBZ the/DT probability/NN that/IN a/DT proposition/NN can/MD be/VB deduced/VBN from/IN the/DT evidence/NN ./.
