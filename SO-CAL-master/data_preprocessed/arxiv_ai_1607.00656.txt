This/DT article/NN presents/VBZ an/DT agent/NN architecture/NN for/IN controlling/VBG an/DT autonomous/JJ agent/NN in/IN stochastic/JJ environments/NNS ./.
The/DT architecture/NN combines/VBZ the/DT partially/RB observable/JJ Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN (/-LRB- POMDP/NN )/-RRB- model/NN with/IN the/DT belief/NN -/HYPH desire/NN -/HYPH intention/NN (/-LRB- BDI/NN )/-RRB- framework/NN ./.
The/DT Hybrid/NN POMDP/NN -/HYPH BDI/NN agent/NN architecture/NN takes/VBZ the/DT best/JJS features/NNS from/IN the/DT two/CD approaches/NNS ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, the/DT online/JJ generation/NN of/IN reward/NN -/HYPH maximizing/VBG courses/NNS of/IN action/NN from/IN POMDP/NN theory/NN ,/, and/CC sophisticated/JJ multiple/JJ goal/NN management/NN from/IN BDI/NNP theory/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT advances/NNS made/VBN since/IN the/DT introduction/NN of/IN the/DT basic/JJ architecture/NN ,/, including/VBG (/-LRB- i/LS )/-RRB- the/DT ability/NN to/TO pursue/VB multiple/JJ goals/NNS simultaneously/RB and/CC (/-LRB- ii/LS )/-RRB- a/DT plan/NN library/NN for/IN storing/VBG pre-written/JJ plans/NNS and/CC for/IN storing/VBG recently/RB generated/VBN plans/NNS for/IN future/NN reuse/VBP ./.
A/DT version/NN of/IN the/DT architecture/NN without/IN the/DT plan/NN library/NN is/VBZ implemented/VBN and/CC is/VBZ evaluated/VBN using/VBG simulations/NNS ./.
The/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT simulation/NN experiments/NNS indicate/VBP that/IN the/DT approach/NN is/VBZ feasible/JJ ./.
