We/PRP study/VBP several/JJ questions/NNS in/IN the/DT reliable/JJ agnostic/JJ learning/NN framework/NN of/IN Kalai/NNP et/FW al./FW (/-LRB- 2009/CD )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT captures/VBZ learning/VBG tasks/NNS in/IN which/WDT one/CD type/NN of/IN error/NN is/VBZ costlier/JJR than/IN others/NNS ./.
A/DT positive/JJ reliable/JJ classifier/NN is/VBZ one/CD that/WDT makes/VBZ no/DT false/JJ positive/JJ errors/NNS ./.
The/DT goal/NN in/IN the/DT positive/JJ reliable/JJ agnostic/JJ framework/NN is/VBZ to/IN output/NN a/DT hypothesis/NN with/IN the/DT following/VBG properties/NNS :/: (/-LRB- i/LS )/-RRB- its/PRP$ false/JJ positive/JJ error/NN rate/NN is/VBZ at/IN most/RBS $/$ \/CD epsilon/CD $/$ ,/, (/-LRB- ii/LS )/-RRB- its/PRP$ false/JJ negative/JJ error/NN rate/NN is/VBZ at/IN most/RBS $/$ \/CD epsilon/CD $/$ more/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT best/JJS positive/JJ reliable/JJ classifier/NN from/IN the/DT class/NN ./.
A/DT closely/RB related/JJ notion/NN is/VBZ fully/RB reliable/JJ agnostic/JJ learning/NN ,/, which/WDT considers/VBZ partial/JJ classifiers/NNS that/WDT are/VBP allowed/VBN to/TO predict/VB "/`` unknown/JJ "/'' on/IN some/DT inputs/NNS ./.
The/DT best/JJS fully/RB reliable/JJ partial/JJ classifier/NN is/VBZ one/CD that/WDT makes/VBZ no/DT errors/NNS and/CC minimizes/VBZ the/DT probability/NN of/IN predicting/VBG "/`` unknown/JJ "/'' ,/, and/CC the/DT goal/NN in/IN fully/RB reliable/JJ learning/NN is/VBZ to/IN output/NN a/DT hypothesis/NN that/IN is/VBZ almost/RB as/RB good/JJ as/IN the/DT best/JJS fully/RB reliable/JJ partial/JJ classifier/NN from/IN a/DT class/NN ./.
