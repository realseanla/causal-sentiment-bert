The/DT currently/RB most/RBS efficient/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN inference/NN with/IN a/DT probabilistic/JJ network/NN builds/VBZ upon/IN a/DT triangulation/NN of/IN a/DT network/NN 's/POS graph/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN pre-processing/NN can/MD help/VB in/IN finding/VBG good/JJ triangulations/NNS forprobabilistic/JJ networks/NNS ,/, that/DT is/VBZ ,/, triangulations/NNS with/IN a/DT minimal/JJ maximum/NN clique/NN size/NN ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP a/DT set/NN of/IN rules/NNS for/IN stepwise/JJ reducing/VBG a/DT graph/NN ,/, without/IN losing/VBG optimality/NN ./.
This/DT reduction/NN allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO solve/VB the/DT triangulation/NN problem/NN on/IN a/DT smaller/JJR graph/NN ./.
From/IN the/DT smaller/JJR graph/NN 's/POS triangulation/NN ,/, a/DT triangulation/NN of/IN the/DT original/JJ graph/NN is/VBZ obtained/VBN by/IN reversing/VBG the/DT reduction/NN steps/NNS ./.
