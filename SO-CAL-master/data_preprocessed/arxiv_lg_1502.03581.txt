Due/IN to/IN the/DT rapid/JJ growth/NN in/IN technology/NN employed/VBN by/IN the/DT spammers/NNS ,/, there/EX is/VBZ a/DT need/NN of/IN classifiers/NNS that/WDT are/VBP more/RBR efficient/JJ ,/, generic/JJ and/CC highly/RB adaptive/JJ ./.
Neural/JJ Network/NN based/VBN technologies/NNS have/VBP high/JJ ability/NN of/IN adaption/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN generalization/NN ./.
As/IN per/IN our/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, very/RB little/JJ work/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN in/IN this/DT field/NN using/VBG neural/JJ network/NN ./.
