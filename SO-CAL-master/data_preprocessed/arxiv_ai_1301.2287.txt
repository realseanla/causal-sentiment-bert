This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN knowledge/NN -/HYPH based/VBN model/NN construction/NN in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN about/IN the/DT association/NN of/IN domain/NN entities/NNS to/IN random/JJ variables/NNS ./.
Multi-entity/NN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- MEBNs/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP defined/VBN as/IN a/DT representation/NN for/IN knowledge/NN in/IN domains/NNS characterized/VBN by/IN uncertainty/NN in/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN relevant/JJ entities/NNS ,/, their/PRP$ interrelationships/NNS ,/, and/CC their/PRP$ association/NN with/IN observables/NNS ./.
An/DT MEBN/NNP implicitly/RB specifies/VBZ a/DT probability/NN distribution/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN a/DT hierarchically/RB structured/VBN collection/NN of/IN Bayesian/JJ network/NN fragments/NNS that/WDT together/RB encode/VBP a/DT joint/JJ probability/NN distribution/NN over/IN arbitrarily/RB many/JJ interrelated/JJ hypotheses/NNS ./.
Although/IN a/DT finite/JJ query/NN -/HYPH complete/JJ model/NN can/MD always/RB be/VB constructed/VBN ,/, association/NN uncertainty/NN typically/RB makes/VBZ exact/JJ model/NN construction/NN and/CC evaluation/NN intractable/JJ ./.
The/DT objective/NN of/IN hypothesis/NN management/NN is/VBZ to/TO balance/VB tractability/NN against/IN accuracy/NN ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP an/DT application/NN to/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN using/VBG intelligence/NN reports/NNS to/IN infer/VB the/DT organization/NN and/CC activities/NNS of/IN groups/NNS of/IN military/JJ vehicles/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN to/IN related/JJ work/NN in/IN the/DT tracking/NN and/CC fusion/NN literature/NN ./.
