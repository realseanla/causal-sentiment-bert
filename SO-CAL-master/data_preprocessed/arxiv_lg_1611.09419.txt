The/DT recently/RB introduced/VBN Intelligent/NNP Trial/NNP -/HYPH and/CC -/HYPH Error/NN (/-LRB- IT&amp;E/NN )/-RRB- algorithm/NN showed/VBD that/IN robots/NNS can/MD adapt/VB to/IN damage/NN in/IN a/DT matter/NN of/IN a/DT few/JJ trials/NNS ./.
The/DT success/NN of/IN this/DT algorithm/NN relies/VBZ on/IN two/CD components/NNS :/: prior/JJ knowledge/NN acquired/VBN through/IN simulation/NN with/IN an/DT intact/JJ robot/NN ,/, and/CC Bayesian/JJ optimization/NN (/-LRB- BO/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT operates/VBZ on/IN -/HYPH line/NN ,/, on/IN the/DT damaged/VBN robot/NN ./.
While/IN IT&amp;E/NN leads/VBZ to/IN fast/JJ damage/NN recovery/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB incorporate/VB any/DT safety/NN constraints/NNS that/WDT prevent/VBP the/DT robot/NN from/IN attempting/VBG harmful/JJ behaviors/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP this/DT limitation/NN by/IN replacing/VBG the/DT BO/NNP component/NN with/IN a/DT constrained/VBN BO/NN procedure/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN on/IN a/DT simulated/VBN damaged/VBN humanoid/JJ robot/NN that/WDT needs/VBZ to/TO crawl/VB as/RB fast/RB as/IN possible/JJ ,/, while/IN performing/VBG as/IN few/JJ unsafe/JJ trials/NNS as/IN possible/JJ ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP our/PRP$ new/JJ "/`` safety/NN -/HYPH aware/JJ IT&amp;E/NN "/'' algorithm/NN to/IN IT&amp;E/NNP and/CC a/DT multi-objective/JJ version/NN of/IN IT&amp;E/NNP in/IN which/WDT the/DT safety/NN constraints/NNS are/VBP dealt/VBN as/IN separate/JJ objectives/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN outperforms/VBZ the/DT other/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, both/CC in/IN crawling/VBG speed/NN within/IN the/DT safe/JJ regions/NNS and/CC number/NN of/IN unsafe/JJ trials/NNS ./.
