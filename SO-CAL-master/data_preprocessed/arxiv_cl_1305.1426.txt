Form/NN about/IN four/CD decades/NNS human/JJ beings/NNS have/VBP been/VBN dreaming/VBG of/IN an/DT intelligent/JJ machine/NN which/WDT can/MD master/VB the/DT natural/JJ speech/NN ./.
In/IN its/PRP$ simplest/JJS form/NN ,/, this/DT machine/NN should/MD consist/VB of/IN two/CD subsystems/NNS ,/, namely/RB automatic/JJ speech/NN recognition/NN (/-LRB- ASR/NN )/-RRB- and/CC speech/NN understanding/NN (/-LRB- SU/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT goal/NN of/IN ASR/NNP is/VBZ to/TO transcribe/VB natural/JJ speech/NN while/IN SU/NNP is/VBZ to/TO understand/VB the/DT meaning/NN of/IN the/DT transcription/NN ./.
Recognizing/VBG and/CC understanding/VBG a/DT spoken/VBN sentence/NN is/VBZ obviously/RB a/DT knowledge/NN -/HYPH intensive/JJ process/NN ,/, which/WDT must/MD take/VB into/IN account/NN all/DT variable/JJ information/NN about/IN the/DT speech/NN communication/NN process/NN ,/, from/IN acoustics/NNS to/IN semantics/NNS and/CC pragmatics/NNS ./.
While/IN developing/VBG an/DT Automatic/NNP Speech/NNP Recognition/NNP System/NNP ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ observed/VBN that/IN some/DT adverse/JJ conditions/NNS degrade/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN the/DT Speech/NNP Recognition/NNP System/NNP ./.
In/IN this/DT contribution/NN ,/, speech/NN enhancement/NN system/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN for/IN enhancing/VBG speech/NN signals/NNS corrupted/VBN by/IN additive/JJ noise/NN and/CC improving/VBG the/DT performance/NN of/IN Automatic/NNP Speech/NNP Recognizers/NNPS in/IN noisy/JJ conditions/NNS ./.
Automatic/JJ speech/NN recognition/NN experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN replacing/VBG noisy/JJ speech/NN signals/NNS by/IN the/DT corresponding/VBG enhanced/VBN speech/NN signals/NNS leads/VBZ to/IN an/DT improvement/NN in/IN the/DT recognition/NN accuracies/NNS ./.
The/DT amount/NN of/IN improvement/NN varies/VBZ with/IN the/DT type/NN of/IN the/DT corrupting/VBG noise/NN ./.
