In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ unsupervised/JJ learning/NN method/NN for/IN the/DT lexical/JJ acquisition/NN of/IN words/NNS related/VBN to/IN places/NNS visited/VBN by/IN robots/NNS ,/, from/IN human/JJ continuous/JJ speech/NN signals/NNS ./.
We/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN learning/VBG novel/JJ words/NNS by/IN a/DT robot/NN that/WDT has/VBZ no/DT prior/JJ knowledge/NN of/IN these/DT words/NNS except/IN for/IN a/DT primitive/JJ acoustic/JJ model/NN ./.
Further/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT method/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ a/DT robot/NN to/TO effectively/RB use/VB the/DT learned/VBN words/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ meanings/NNS for/IN self/NN -/HYPH localization/NN tasks/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ nonparametric/JJ Bayesian/JJ spatial/JJ concept/NN acquisition/NN method/NN (/-LRB- SpCoA/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT integrates/VBZ the/DT generative/JJ model/NN for/IN self/NN -/HYPH localization/NN and/CC the/DT unsupervised/JJ word/NN segmentation/NN in/IN uttered/VBN sentences/NNS via/IN latent/NN variables/NNS related/VBN to/IN the/DT spatial/JJ concept/NN ./.
We/PRP implemented/VBD the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN SpCoA/NN on/IN SIGVerse/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT simulation/NN environment/NN ,/, and/CC TurtleBot2/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT mobile/JJ robot/NN in/IN a/DT real/JJ environment/NN ./.
