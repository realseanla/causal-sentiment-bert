The/DT thyroid/NN ,/, an/DT endocrine/JJ gland/NN that/WDT secretes/VBZ hormones/NNS in/IN the/DT blood/NN ,/, circulates/VBZ its/PRP$ products/NNS to/IN all/DT tissues/NNS of/IN the/DT body/NN ,/, where/WRB they/PRP control/VBP vital/JJ functions/NNS in/IN every/DT cell/NN ./.
Normal/JJ levels/NNS of/IN thyroid/NN hormone/NN help/VB the/DT brain/NN ,/, heart/NN ,/, intestines/NNS ,/, muscles/NNS and/CC reproductive/JJ system/NN function/NN normally/RB ./.
Thyroid/NN hormones/NNS control/VBP the/DT metabolism/NN of/IN the/DT body/NN ./.
Abnormalities/NNS of/IN thyroid/NN function/NN are/VBP usually/RB related/VBN to/IN production/NN of/IN too/RB little/JJ thyroid/NN hormone/NN (/-LRB- hypothyroidism/NN )/-RRB- or/CC production/NN of/IN too/RB much/JJ thyroid/NN hormone/NN (/-LRB- hyperthyroidism/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT correct/JJ diagnosis/NN of/IN these/DT diseases/NNS is/VBZ very/RB important/JJ topic/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT study/NN ,/, Linguistic/JJ Hedges/NNP Neural/JJ -/HYPH Fuzzy/JJ Classifier/NN with/IN Selected/VBN Features/NNS (/-LRB- LHNFCSF/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ presented/VBN for/IN diagnosis/NN of/IN thyroid/NN diseases/NNS ./.
The/DT performance/NN evaluation/NN of/IN this/DT system/NN is/VBZ estimated/VBN by/IN using/VBG classification/NN accuracy/NN and/CC k-fold/RB cross-validation/NN ./.

After/IN applying/VBG feature/NN selection/NN algorithm/NN ,/, LHNFCSF/NNP achieved/VBD 100/CD percent/NN for/IN all/DT cluster/NN sizes/NNS during/IN training/NN phase/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT testing/NN phase/NN LHNFCSF/NNP achieved/VBD 88.3721/CD percent/NN using/VBG one/CD cluster/NN for/IN each/DT class/NN ,/, 90.6977/CD percent/NN using/VBG two/CD clusters/NNS ,/, 91.8605/CD percent/NN using/VBG three/CD clusters/NNS and/CC 97.6744/CD percent/NN using/VBG four/CD clusters/NNS for/IN each/DT class/NN and/CC 12/CD fuzzy/JJ rules/NNS ./.
The/DT obtained/VBN classification/NN accuracy/NN was/VBD very/RB promising/JJ with/IN regard/NN to/IN the/DT other/JJ classification/NN applications/NNS in/IN literature/NN for/IN this/DT problem/NN ./.
