We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT logical/JJ //HYPH mathematical/JJ framework/NN for/IN statistical/JJ parameter/NN learning/NN of/IN parameterized/JJ logic/NN programs/NNS ,/, i.e./FW definite/JJ clause/NN programs/NNS containing/VBG probabilistic/JJ facts/NNS with/IN a/DT parameterized/JJ distribution/NN ./.
