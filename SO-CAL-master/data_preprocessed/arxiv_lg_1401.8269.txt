Inference/NN in/IN natural/JJ language/NN often/RB involves/VBZ recognizing/VBG lexical/JJ entailment/NN (/-LRB- RLE/NN )/-RRB- ;/: that/DT is/VBZ ,/, identifying/VBG whether/IN one/CD word/NN entails/VBZ another/DT ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, "/`` buy/VB "/'' entails/VBZ "/`` own/JJ "/'' ./.
Two/CD general/JJ strategies/NNS for/IN RLE/NN have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN :/: One/CD strategy/NN is/VBZ to/TO manually/RB construct/VB an/DT asymmetric/JJ similarity/NN measure/NN for/IN context/NN vectors/NNS (/-LRB- directional/JJ similarity/NN )/-RRB- and/CC another/DT is/VBZ to/TO treat/VB RLE/NN as/IN a/DT problem/NN of/IN learning/NN to/TO recognize/VB semantic/JJ relations/NNS using/VBG supervised/JJ machine/NN learning/NN techniques/NNS (/-LRB- relation/NN classification/NN )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP experiment/VBP with/IN two/CD recent/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN representatives/NNS of/IN the/DT two/CD general/JJ strategies/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ an/DT asymmetric/JJ similarity/NN measure/NN (/-LRB- an/DT instance/NN of/IN the/DT directional/JJ similarity/NN strategy/NN )/-RRB- ,/, designed/VBN to/TO capture/VB the/DT degree/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT contexts/NNS of/IN a/DT word/NN ,/, a/DT ,/, form/VB a/DT subset/NN of/IN the/DT contexts/NNS of/IN another/DT word/NN ,/, b/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ approach/NN (/-LRB- an/DT instance/NN of/IN the/DT relation/NN classification/NN strategy/NN )/-RRB- represents/VBZ a/DT word/NN pair/NN ,/, a/DT :/: b/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT feature/NN vector/NN that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT concatenation/NN of/IN the/DT context/NN vectors/NNS of/IN a/DT and/CC b/NN ,/, and/CC then/RB applies/VBZ supervised/JJ learning/NN to/IN a/DT training/NN set/NN of/IN labeled/VBN feature/NN vectors/NNS ./.
Additionally/RB ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT third/JJ approach/NN that/WDT is/VBZ a/DT new/JJ instance/NN of/IN the/DT relation/NN classification/NN strategy/NN ./.
The/DT third/JJ approach/NN represents/VBZ a/DT word/NN pair/NN ,/, a/DT :/: b/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT feature/NN vector/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT features/NNS are/VBP the/DT differences/NNS in/IN the/DT similarities/NNS of/IN a/DT and/CC b/NN to/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN reference/NN words/NNS ./.
All/DT three/CD approaches/NNS use/VBP vector/NN space/NN models/NNS (/-LRB- VSMs/NNS )/-RRB- of/IN semantics/NNS ,/, based/VBN on/IN word/NN -/HYPH context/NN matrices/NNS ./.
We/PRP perform/VBP an/DT extensive/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN the/DT three/CD approaches/NNS using/VBG three/CD different/JJ datasets/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN new/JJ approach/NN (/-LRB- similarity/NN differences/NNS )/-RRB- performs/VBZ significantly/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT other/JJ two/CD approaches/NNS on/IN some/DT datasets/NNS and/CC there/EX is/VBZ no/DT dataset/NN for/IN which/WDT it/PRP is/VBZ significantly/RB worse/JJR ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS suggest/VBP it/PRP is/VBZ beneficial/JJ to/TO make/VB connections/NNS between/IN the/DT research/NN in/IN lexical/JJ entailment/NN and/CC the/DT research/NN in/IN semantic/JJ relation/NN classification/NN ./.
