Content/NN -/: Centric/NNP Networking/VBG (/-LRB- CCN/NN )/-RRB- research/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT mismatch/NN between/IN the/DT modern/JJ usage/NN of/IN the/DT Internet/NN and/CC its/PRP$ outdated/JJ architecture/NN ./.
Importantly/RB ,/, CCN/NN routers/NNS may/MD locally/RB cache/NN frequently/RB requested/VBD content/NN in/IN order/NN to/TO speed/VB up/RP delivery/NN to/TO end/VB users/NNS ./.
Thus/RB ,/, the/DT issue/NN of/IN caching/VBG strategies/NNS arises/VBZ ,/, i.e./FW ,/, which/WDT content/NN shall/MD be/VB stored/VBN and/CC when/WRB it/PRP should/MD be/VB replaced/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP employ/VBP novel/JJ techniques/NNS towards/IN intelligent/JJ administration/NN of/IN CCN/NN routers/NNS that/WDT autonomously/RB switch/VBP between/IN existing/VBG strategies/NNS in/IN response/NN to/IN changing/VBG content/NN request/NN patterns/NNS ./.
