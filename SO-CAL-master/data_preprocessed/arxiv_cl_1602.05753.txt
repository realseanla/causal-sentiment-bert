Creating/VBG linguistic/JJ annotations/NNS requires/VBZ more/JJR than/IN just/RB a/DT reliable/JJ annotation/NN scheme/NN ./.
Annotation/NN can/MD be/VB a/DT complex/JJ endeavour/NN potentially/RB involving/VBG many/JJ people/NNS ,/, stages/NNS ,/, and/CC tools/NNS ./.
This/DT chapter/NN outlines/VBZ the/DT process/NN of/IN creating/VBG end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN linguistic/JJ annotations/NNS ,/, identifying/VBG specific/JJ tasks/NNS that/WDT researchers/NNS often/RB perform/VBP ./.
Because/IN tool/NN support/NN is/VBZ so/RB central/JJ to/IN achieving/VBG high/JJ quality/NN ,/, reusable/JJ annotations/NNS with/IN low/JJ cost/NN ,/, the/DT focus/NN is/VBZ on/IN identifying/VBG capabilities/NNS that/WDT are/VBP necessary/JJ or/CC useful/JJ for/IN annotation/NN tools/NNS ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN common/JJ problems/NNS these/DT tools/NNS present/VBP that/DT reduce/VB their/PRP$ utility/NN ./.
Although/IN examples/NNS of/IN specific/JJ tools/NNS are/VBP provided/VBN in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, this/DT chapter/NN concentrates/VBZ more/RBR on/IN abstract/JJ capabilities/NNS and/CC problems/NNS because/IN new/JJ tools/NNS appear/VBP continuously/RB ,/, while/IN old/JJ tools/NNS disappear/VBP into/IN disuse/NN or/CC disrepair/NN ./.
The/DT two/CD core/NN capabilities/NNS tools/NNS must/MD have/VB are/VBP support/NN for/IN the/DT chosen/VBN annotation/NN scheme/NN and/CC the/DT ability/NN to/TO work/VB on/IN the/DT language/NN under/IN study/NN ./.
Additional/JJ capabilities/NNS are/VBP organized/VBN into/IN three/CD categories/NNS :/: those/DT that/WDT are/VBP widely/RB provided/VBN ;/: those/DT that/WDT often/RB useful/JJ but/CC found/VBN in/IN only/RB a/DT few/JJ tools/NNS ;/, and/CC those/DT that/WDT have/VBP as/RB yet/RB little/JJ or/CC no/DT available/JJ tool/NN support/NN ./.
