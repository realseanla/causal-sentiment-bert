A/DT central/JJ task/NN in/IN many/JJ applications/NNS is/VBZ reasoning/NN about/IN processes/NNS that/WDT change/VBP in/IN a/DT continuous/JJ time/NN ./.
The/DT mathematical/JJ framework/NN of/IN Continuous/JJ Time/NN Markov/NN Processes/NNS provides/VBZ the/DT basic/JJ foundations/NNS for/IN modeling/VBG such/JJ systems/NNS ./.
Recently/RB ,/, Nodelman/NNP et/FW al/FW introduced/VBD continuous/JJ time/NN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CTBNs/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT allow/VBP a/DT compact/JJ representation/NN of/IN continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN processes/NNS over/IN a/DT factored/JJ state/NN space/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP continuous/JJ time/NN Markov/NNP networks/NNS (/-LRB- CTMNs/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, an/DT alternative/JJ representation/NN language/NN that/WDT represents/VBZ a/DT different/JJ type/NN of/IN continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN dynamics/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ real/JJ life/NN processes/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN biological/JJ and/CC chemical/JJ systems/NNS ,/, the/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN the/DT process/NN can/MD be/VB naturally/RB described/VBN as/IN an/DT interplay/NN between/IN two/CD forces/NNS -/: the/DT tendency/NN of/IN each/DT entity/NN to/TO change/VB its/PRP$ state/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT overall/JJ fitness/NN or/CC energy/NN function/NN of/IN the/DT entire/JJ system/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ model/NN ,/, the/DT first/JJ force/NN is/VBZ described/VBN by/IN a/DT continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN proposal/NN process/NN that/WDT suggests/VBZ possible/JJ local/JJ changes/NNS to/IN the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN at/IN different/JJ rates/NNS ./.
The/DT second/JJ force/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN by/IN a/DT Markov/NNP network/NN that/WDT encodes/VBZ the/DT fitness/NN ,/, or/CC desirability/NN ,/, of/IN different/JJ states/NNS ;/: a/DT proposed/JJ local/JJ change/NN is/VBZ then/RB accepted/VBN with/IN a/DT probability/NN that/WDT is/VBZ a/DT function/NN of/IN the/DT change/NN in/IN the/DT fitness/NN distribution/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT fitness/NN distribution/NN is/VBZ also/RB the/DT stationary/JJ distribution/NN of/IN the/DT Markov/NNP process/NN ,/, so/IN that/IN this/DT representation/NN provides/VBZ a/DT characterization/NN of/IN a/DT temporal/JJ process/NN whose/WP$ stationary/JJ distribution/NN has/VBZ a/DT compact/JJ graphical/JJ representation/NN ./.
This/DT allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO naturally/RB capture/VB a/DT different/JJ type/NN of/IN structure/NN in/IN complex/JJ dynamical/JJ processes/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN evolving/VBG biological/JJ sequences/NNS ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP the/DT semantics/NNS of/IN the/DT representation/NN ,/, its/PRP$ basic/JJ properties/NNS ,/, and/CC how/WRB it/PRP compares/VBZ to/IN CTBNs/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB provide/VBP algorithms/NNS for/IN learning/VBG such/JJ models/NNS from/IN data/NNS ,/, and/CC discuss/VB its/PRP$ applicability/NN to/IN biological/JJ sequence/NN evolution/NN ./.
