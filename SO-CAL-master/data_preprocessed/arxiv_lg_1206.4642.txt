The/DT kernel/NN method/NN is/VBZ a/DT potential/JJ approach/NN to/IN analyzing/VBG structured/JJ data/NNS such/JJ as/IN sequences/NNS ,/, trees/NNS ,/, and/CC graphs/NNS ;/: however/RB ,/, unordered/JJ trees/NNS have/VBP not/RB been/VBN investigated/VBN extensively/RB ./.
Kimura/NNP et/FW al./FW (/-LRB- 2011/CD )/-RRB- proposed/VBD a/DT kernel/NN function/NN for/IN unordered/JJ trees/NNS on/IN the/DT basis/NN of/IN their/PRP$ subpaths/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP vertical/JJ substructures/NNS of/IN trees/NNS responsible/JJ for/IN hierarchical/JJ information/NN in/IN them/PRP ./.
Their/PRP$ kernel/NN exhibits/VBZ practically/RB good/JJ performance/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN accuracy/NN and/CC speed/NN ;/: however/RB ,/, linear/JJ -/HYPH time/NN computation/NN is/VBZ not/RB guaranteed/VBN theoretically/RB ,/, unlike/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ unordered/JJ tree/NN kernel/NN proposed/VBN by/IN Vishwanathan/NNP and/CC Smola/NNP (/-LRB- 2003/CD )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT theoretically/RB guaranteed/VBN linear/JJ -/HYPH time/NN kernel/NN computation/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT is/VBZ practically/RB fast/RB ,/, and/CC we/PRP present/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ prediction/NN algorithm/NN whose/WP$ running/NN time/NN depends/VBZ only/RB on/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT input/NN tree/NN ./.
