The/DT causal/JJ graph/NN of/IN a/DT planning/NN instance/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ tool/NN for/IN planning/VBG both/CC in/IN practice/NN and/CC in/IN theory/NN ./.
The/DT theoretical/JJ studies/NNS of/IN causal/JJ graphs/NNS have/VBP largely/RB analysed/VBN the/DT computational/JJ complexity/NN of/IN planning/VBG for/IN instances/NNS where/WRB the/DT causal/JJ graph/NN has/VBZ a/DT certain/JJ structure/NN ,/, often/RB in/IN combination/NN with/IN other/JJ parameters/NNS like/IN the/DT domain/NN size/NN of/IN the/DT variables/NNS ./.
Chen/NNP and/CC Gimand/NNP #/NN 233/CD ;/: nez/NN ignored/VBN even/RB the/DT structure/NN and/CC considered/VBN only/RB the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT weakly/RB connected/VBN components/NNS ./.
They/PRP proved/VBD that/IN planning/NN is/VBZ tractable/JJ if/IN the/DT components/NNS are/VBP bounded/VBN by/IN a/DT constant/JJ and/CC otherwise/RB intractable/JJ ./.
Their/PRP$ intractability/NN result/NN was/VBD ,/, however/RB ,/, conditioned/VBN by/IN an/DT assumption/NN from/IN parameterised/VBN complexity/NN theory/NN that/WDT has/VBZ no/DT known/JJ useful/JJ relationship/NN with/IN the/DT standard/JJ complexity/NN classes/NNS ./.
We/PRP approach/VBP the/DT same/JJ problem/NN from/IN the/DT perspective/NN of/IN standard/JJ complexity/NN classes/NNS ,/, and/CC prove/VB that/IN planning/NN is/VBZ NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ for/IN classes/NNS with/IN unbounded/JJ components/NNS under/IN an/DT additional/JJ restriction/NN we/PRP refer/VBP to/IN as/IN SP/NN -/HYPH closed/VBN ./.
We/PRP then/RB argue/VBP that/IN most/JJS NP/NN -/HYPH hardness/NN theorems/NNS for/IN causal/JJ graphs/NNS are/VBP difficult/JJ to/TO apply/VB and/CC ,/, thus/RB ,/, prove/VB a/DT more/RBR general/JJ result/NN ;/: even/RB if/IN the/DT component/NN sizes/VBZ grow/VB slowly/RB and/CC the/DT class/NN is/VBZ not/RB densely/RB populated/VBN with/IN graphs/NNS ,/, planning/VBG still/RB can/MD not/RB be/VB tractable/JJ unless/IN the/DT polynomial/JJ hierachy/NN collapses/NNS ./.
Both/PDT these/DT results/NNS still/RB hold/VBP when/WRB restricted/VBN to/IN the/DT class/NN of/IN acyclic/JJ causal/JJ graphs/NNS ./.
We/PRP finally/RB give/VBP a/DT partial/JJ characterization/NN of/IN the/DT borderline/NN between/IN NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ and/CC NP/NNP -/HYPH intermediate/JJ classes/NNS ,/, giving/VBG further/JJ insight/NN into/IN the/DT problem/NN ./.
