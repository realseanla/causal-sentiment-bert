In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP tackle/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN transferring/VBG policy/NN from/IN multiple/JJ partially/RB observable/JJ source/NN environments/NNS to/IN a/DT partially/RB observable/JJ target/NN environment/NN modeled/VBN as/IN predictive/JJ state/NN representation/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ an/DT entirely/RB new/JJ approach/NN with/IN no/DT previous/JJ work/NN ,/, other/JJ than/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN transfer/NN in/IN fully/RB observable/JJ domains/NNS ./.
We/PRP develop/VBP algorithms/NNS to/TO successfully/RB achieve/VB policy/NN transfer/NN when/WRB we/PRP have/VBP the/DT model/NN of/IN both/CC the/DT source/NN and/CC target/NN tasks/NNS and/CC discuss/VB in/IN detail/NN their/PRP$ performance/NN and/CC shortcomings/NNS ./.
