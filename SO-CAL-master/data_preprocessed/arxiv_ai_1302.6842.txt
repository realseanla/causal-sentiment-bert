Independence/NN -/HYPH based/VBN (/-LRB- IB/NNP )/-RRB- assignments/NNS to/IN Bayesian/JJ belief/NN networks/NNS were/VBD originally/RB proposed/VBN as/IN abductive/JJ explanations/NNS ./.
IB/NNP assignments/NNS assign/VBP fewer/JJR variables/NNS in/IN abductive/JJ explanations/NNS than/IN do/VBP schemes/NNS assigning/VBG values/NNS to/IN all/DT evidentially/RB supported/VBN variables/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP IB/NNP assignments/NNS to/TO approximate/VB marginal/JJ probabilities/NNS in/IN Bayesian/JJ belief/NN networks/NNS ./.
Recent/JJ work/NN in/IN belief/NN updating/VBG for/IN Bayes/NNP networks/NNS attempts/VBZ to/TO approximate/VB posterior/JJ probabilities/NNS by/IN finding/VBG a/DT small/JJ number/NN of/IN the/DT highest/JJS probability/NN complete/JJ (/-LRB- or/CC perhaps/RB evidentially/RB supported/VBN )/-RRB- assignments/NNS ./.
Under/IN certain/JJ assumptions/NNS ,/, the/DT probability/NN mass/NN in/IN the/DT union/NN of/IN these/DT assignments/NNS is/VBZ sufficient/JJ to/TO obtain/VB a/DT good/JJ approximation/NN ./.
Such/JJ methods/NNS are/VBP especially/RB useful/JJ for/IN highly/RB -/HYPH connected/VBN networks/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT maximum/JJ clique/NN size/NN or/CC the/DT cutset/NN size/NN make/VBP the/DT standard/JJ algorithms/NNS intractable/JJ ./.
Since/IN IB/NNP assignments/NNS contain/VBP fewer/JJR assigned/VBN variables/NNS ,/, the/DT probability/NN mass/NN in/IN each/DT assignment/NN is/VBZ greater/JJR than/IN in/IN the/DT respective/JJ complete/JJ assignment/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, fewer/JJR IB/NNP assignments/NNS are/VBP sufficient/JJ ,/, and/CC a/DT good/JJ approximation/NN can/MD be/VB obtained/VBN more/RBR efficiently/RB ./.
IB/NNP assignments/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN efficiently/RB approximating/VBG posterior/JJ node/NN probabilities/NNS even/RB in/IN cases/NNS which/WDT do/VBP not/RB obey/VB the/DT rather/RB strict/JJ skewness/NN assumptions/NNS used/VBN in/IN previous/JJ research/NN ./.
Two/CD algorithms/NNS for/IN finding/VBG the/DT high/JJ probability/NN IB/NNP assignments/NNS are/VBP suggested/VBN :/: one/CD by/IN doing/VBG a/DT best/RBS -/HYPH first/JJ heuristic/NN search/NN ,/, and/CC another/DT by/IN special/JJ -/HYPH purpose/NN integer/NN linear/JJ programming/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN this/DT approach/NN is/VBZ feasible/JJ for/IN highly/RB connected/JJ belief/NN networks/NNS ./.
