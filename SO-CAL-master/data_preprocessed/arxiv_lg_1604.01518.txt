The/DT Support/NN Vector/NNP Machine/NNP using/VBG Privileged/NNP Information/NNP (/-LRB- SVM/NNP )/-RRB- has/VBZ been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO train/VB a/DT classifier/NN to/TO utilize/VB the/DT additional/JJ privileged/JJ information/NN that/WDT is/VBZ only/RB available/JJ in/IN the/DT training/NN phase/NN but/CC not/RB available/JJ in/IN the/DT test/NN phase/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ solution/NN for/IN SVM/NNP by/IN simply/RB utilizing/VBG the/DT squared/JJ hinge/NN loss/NN instead/RB of/IN the/DT hinge/NN loss/NN as/IN in/IN the/DT existing/VBG SVM/NN formulation/NN ,/, which/WDT interestingly/RB leads/VBZ to/IN a/DT dual/JJ form/NN with/IN less/JJR variables/NNS and/CC in/IN the/DT same/JJ form/NN with/IN the/DT dual/JJ of/IN the/DT standard/JJ SVM/NNP ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN algorithm/NN is/VBZ utilized/VBN to/IN leverage/NN the/DT additional/JJ web/NN knowledge/NN that/WDT is/VBZ only/RB available/JJ during/IN training/NN for/IN the/DT image/NN categorization/NN tasks/NNS ./.
The/DT extensive/JJ experimental/JJ results/NNS on/IN both/DT Caltech101/NN andWebQueries/NNS datasets/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ proposed/JJ method/NN can/MD achieve/VB a/DT factor/NN of/IN up/RB to/IN hundred/CD times/NNS speedup/NN with/IN the/DT comparable/JJ accuracy/NN when/WRB compared/VBN with/IN the/DT existing/VBG SVM/NN method/NN ./.
