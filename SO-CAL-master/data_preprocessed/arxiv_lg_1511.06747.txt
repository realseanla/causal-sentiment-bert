We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT unified/VBN framework/NN for/IN neural/JJ net/JJ normalization/NN ,/, regularization/NN and/CC optimization/NN ,/, which/WDT includes/VBZ Path/NN -/HYPH SGD/NN and/CC Batch/NN -/HYPH Normalization/NN and/CC interpolates/VBZ between/IN them/PRP across/IN two/CD different/JJ dimensions/NNS ./.
Through/IN this/DT framework/NN we/PRP investigate/VBP issue/NN of/IN invariance/NN of/IN the/DT optimization/NN ,/, data/NNS dependence/NN and/CC the/DT connection/NN with/IN natural/JJ gradients/NNS ./.
