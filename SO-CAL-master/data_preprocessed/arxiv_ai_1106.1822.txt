This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN planning/VBG under/IN uncertainty/NN in/IN large/JJ Markov/NNP Decision/NN Processes/NNS (/-LRB- MDPs/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
Factored/VBN MDPs/NNS represent/VBP a/DT complex/JJ state/NN space/NN using/VBG state/NN variables/NNS and/CC the/DT transition/NN model/NN using/VBG a/DT dynamic/JJ Bayesian/JJ network/NN ./.
This/DT representation/NN often/RB allows/VBZ an/DT exponential/JJ reduction/NN in/IN the/DT representation/NN size/NN of/IN structured/JJ MDPs/NNS ,/, but/CC the/DT complexity/NN of/IN exact/JJ solution/NN algorithms/NNS for/IN such/JJ MDPs/NNS can/MD grow/VB exponentially/RB in/IN the/DT representation/NN size/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP two/CD approximate/JJ solution/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT exploit/VBP structure/NN in/IN factored/JJ MDPs/NNS ./.
Both/DT use/VBP an/DT approximate/JJ value/NN function/NN represented/VBN as/IN a/DT linear/JJ combination/NN of/IN basis/NN functions/NNS ,/, where/WRB each/DT basis/NN function/NN involves/VBZ only/RB a/DT small/JJ subset/NN of/IN the/DT domain/NN variables/NNS ./.
A/DT key/JJ contribution/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP shows/VBZ how/WRB the/DT basic/JJ operations/NNS of/IN both/DT algorithms/NNS can/MD be/VB performed/VBN efficiently/RB in/IN closed/JJ form/NN ,/, by/IN exploiting/VBG both/DT additive/JJ and/CC context/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ structure/NN in/IN a/DT factored/JJ MDP/NN ./.
A/DT central/JJ element/NN of/IN our/PRP$ algorithms/NNS is/VBZ a/DT novel/JJ linear/JJ program/NN decomposition/NN technique/NN ,/, analogous/JJ to/IN variable/JJ elimination/NN in/IN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ,/, which/WDT reduces/VBZ an/DT exponentially/RB large/JJ LP/NN to/IN a/DT provably/RB equivalent/JJ ,/, polynomial/JJ -/HYPH sized/JJ one/NN ./.
One/CD algorithm/NN uses/VBZ approximate/JJ linear/JJ programming/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT second/JJ approximate/JJ dynamic/JJ programming/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ dynamic/JJ programming/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ novel/JJ in/IN that/IN it/PRP uses/VBZ an/DT approximation/NN based/VBN on/IN max/NN -/HYPH norm/NN ,/, a/DT technique/NN that/WDT more/RBR directly/RB minimizes/VBZ the/DT terms/NNS that/WDT appear/VBP in/IN error/NN bounds/NNS for/IN approximate/JJ MDP/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP experimental/JJ results/NNS on/IN problems/NNS with/IN over/IN 10/CD ^/SYM 40/CD states/NNS ,/, demonstrating/VBG a/DT promising/JJ indication/NN of/IN the/DT scalability/NN of/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN ,/, and/CC compare/VB our/PRP$ algorithm/NN to/IN an/DT existing/VBG state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN approach/NN ,/, showing/VBG ,/, in/IN some/DT problems/NNS ,/, exponential/JJ gains/NNS in/IN computation/NN time/NN ./.
