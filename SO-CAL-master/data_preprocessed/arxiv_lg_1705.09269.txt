Machine/NN learning/NN and/CC data/NNS analysis/NN now/RB finds/VBZ both/DT scientific/JJ and/CC industrial/JJ application/NN in/IN biology/NN ,/, chemistry/NN ,/, geology/NN ,/, medicine/NN ,/, and/CC physics/NN ./.
These/DT applications/NNS rely/VBP on/IN large/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN data/NNS gathered/VBN from/IN automated/VBN sensors/NNS and/CC user/NN input/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT dimensionality/NN of/IN many/JJ datasets/NNS is/VBZ extreme/JJ :/: more/JJR details/NNS are/VBP being/VBG gathered/VBN about/IN single/JJ user/NN interactions/NNS or/CC sensor/NN readings/NNS ./.
