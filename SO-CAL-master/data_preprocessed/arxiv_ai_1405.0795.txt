Belief/NN revision/NN is/VBZ an/DT operation/NN that/WDT aims/VBZ at/IN modifying/VBG old/JJ beliefs/NNS so/IN that/IN they/PRP become/VBP consistent/JJ with/IN new/JJ ones/NNS ./.
The/DT issue/NN of/IN belief/NN revision/NN has/VBZ been/VBN studied/VBN in/IN various/JJ formalisms/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, in/IN qualitative/JJ algebras/NN (/-LRB- QAs/NNS )/-RRB- in/IN which/WDT the/DT result/NN is/VBZ a/DT disjunction/NN of/IN belief/NN bases/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB necessarily/RB representable/JJ in/IN a/DT QA/NN ./.
This/DT motivates/VBZ the/DT study/NN of/IN belief/NN revision/NN in/IN formalisms/NNS extending/VBG QAs/NNS ,/, namely/RB ,/, their/PRP$ propositional/JJ closures/NNS :/: in/IN such/PDT a/DT closure/NN ,/, the/DT result/NN of/IN belief/NN revision/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN the/DT formalism/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, this/DT makes/VBZ it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO define/VB a/DT contraction/NN operator/NN thanks/NNS to/IN the/DT Harper/NNP identity/NN ./.
Belief/NN revision/NN in/IN the/DT propositional/JJ closure/NN of/IN QAs/NNS is/VBZ studied/VBN ,/, an/DT algorithm/NN for/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN revision/NN operators/NNS is/VBZ designed/VBN ,/, and/CC an/DT open/JJ -/HYPH source/NN implementation/NN is/VBZ made/VBN freely/RB available/JJ on/IN the/DT web/NN ./.
