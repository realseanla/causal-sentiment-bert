The/DT belief/NN network/NN is/VBZ a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN graphical/JJ structure/NN for/IN representing/VBG independences/NNS in/IN a/DT joint/JJ probability/NN distribution/NN ./.
The/DT methods/NNS ,/, which/WDT perform/VBP probabilistic/JJ inference/NN in/IN belief/NN networks/NNS ,/, often/RB treat/VBP the/DT conditional/JJ probabilities/NNS which/WDT are/VBP stored/VBN in/IN the/DT network/NN as/IN certain/JJ values/NNS ./.
