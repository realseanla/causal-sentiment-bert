As/IN historically/RB acknowledged/VBN in/IN the/DT Reasoning/NN about/IN Actions/NNS and/CC Change/VB community/NN ,/, intuitiveness/NN of/IN a/DT logical/JJ domain/NN description/NN can/MD not/RB be/VB fully/RB automated/VBN ./.

The/DT present/JJ work/NN is/VBZ about/IN changing/VBG action/NN domain/NN descriptions/NNS in/IN multimodal/JJ logic/NN ./.
Its/PRP$ contribution/NN is/VBZ threefold/RB :/: first/RB we/PRP revisit/VBP the/DT semantics/NNS of/IN action/NN theory/NN contraction/NN proposed/VBN in/IN previous/JJ work/NN ,/, giving/VBG more/JJR robust/JJ operators/NNS that/WDT express/VBP minimal/JJ change/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT notion/NN of/IN distance/NN between/IN Kripke/NNP -/HYPH models/NNS ./.
Second/RB we/PRP give/VBP algorithms/NNS for/IN syntactical/JJ action/NN theory/NN contraction/NN and/CC establish/VB their/PRP$ correctness/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN our/PRP$ semantics/NNS for/IN those/DT action/NN theories/NNS that/WDT satisfy/VBP a/DT principle/NN of/IN modularity/NN investigated/VBN in/IN previous/JJ work/NN ./.
Since/IN modularity/NN can/MD be/VB ensured/VBN for/IN every/DT action/NN theory/NN and/CC ,/, as/IN we/PRP show/VBP here/RB ,/, needs/VBZ to/TO be/VB computed/VBN at/IN most/RBS once/RB during/IN the/DT evolution/NN of/IN a/DT domain/NN description/NN ,/, it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB represent/VB a/DT limitation/NN at/IN all/DT to/IN the/DT method/NN here/RB studied/VBD ./.
Finally/RB we/PRP state/VBP AGM/NNP -/HYPH like/JJ postulates/NNS for/IN action/NN theory/NN contraction/NN and/CC assess/VB the/DT behavior/NN of/IN our/PRP$ operators/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/IN them/PRP ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP also/RB address/VBP the/DT revision/NN counterpart/NN of/IN action/NN theory/NN change/NN ,/, showing/VBG that/IN it/PRP benefits/VBZ from/IN our/PRP$ semantics/NNS for/IN contraction/NN ./.
