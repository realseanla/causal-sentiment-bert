Inductive/JJ learning/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN inferring/VBG a/DT general/JJ rule/NN from/IN a/DT finite/JJ data/NNS set/VBN and/CC using/VBG it/PRP to/TO label/VB new/JJ data/NNS ./.
In/IN transduction/NN one/CD attempts/VBZ to/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN using/VBG a/DT labeled/VBN training/NN set/NN to/TO label/VB a/DT set/NN of/IN unlabeled/JJ points/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP given/VBN to/IN the/DT learner/NN prior/JJ to/IN learning/NN ./.
Although/IN transduction/NN seems/VBZ at/IN the/DT outset/NN to/TO be/VB an/DT easier/JJR task/NN than/IN induction/NN ,/, there/EX have/VBP not/RB been/VBN many/JJ provably/RB useful/JJ algorithms/NNS for/IN transduction/NN ./.

The/DT main/JJ theoretical/JJ developments/NNS related/VBN to/IN transduction/NN were/VBD presented/VBN by/IN Vapnik/NNP more/RBR than/IN twenty/CD years/NNS ago/RB ./.
One/CD of/IN Vapnik/NNP 's/POS basic/JJ results/NNS is/VBZ a/DT rather/RB tight/JJ error/NN bound/VBN for/IN transductive/JJ classification/NN based/VBN on/IN an/DT exact/JJ computation/NN of/IN the/DT hypergeometric/JJ tail/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ first/JJ contribution/NN is/VBZ a/DT somewhat/RB looser/JJR but/CC explicit/JJ characterization/NN of/IN a/DT slightly/RB extended/VBN PAC/NN -/HYPH Bayesian/JJ version/NN of/IN Vapnik/NNP 's/POS transductive/NN bound/VBN ./.

The/DT main/JJ observation/NN used/VBN for/IN deriving/VBG these/DT new/JJ error/NN bounds/NNS and/CC algorithms/NNS is/VBZ that/IN the/DT unlabeled/JJ test/NN points/NNS ,/, which/WDT in/IN the/DT transductive/JJ setting/NN are/VBP known/VBN in/IN advance/NN ,/, can/MD be/VB used/VBN in/IN order/NN to/TO construct/VB useful/JJ data/NNS dependent/JJ prior/JJ distributions/NNS over/IN the/DT hypothesis/NN space/NN ./.
