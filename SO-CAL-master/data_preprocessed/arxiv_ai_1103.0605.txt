We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/IN the/DT theoretical/JJ analysis/NN of/IN Loopy/NNP Belief/NNP Propagation/NNP (/-LRB- LBP/NN )/-RRB- and/CC the/DT Bethe/NNP free/JJ energy/NN (/-LRB- BFE/NN )/-RRB- by/IN establishing/VBG a/DT formula/NN to/TO connect/VB LBP/NN and/CC BFE/NN with/IN a/DT graph/NN zeta/NN function/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN is/VBZ applicable/JJ to/IN a/DT wide/JJ class/NN of/IN models/NNS including/VBG multinomial/JJ and/CC Gaussian/JJ types/NNS ./.
The/DT connection/NN derives/VBZ a/DT number/NN of/IN new/JJ theoretical/JJ results/NNS on/IN LBP/NN and/CC BFE/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN focuses/VBZ two/CD of/IN such/JJ topics/NNS ./.
One/CD is/VBZ the/DT analysis/NN of/IN the/DT region/NN where/WRB the/DT Hessian/NNP of/IN the/DT Bethe/NNP free/JJ energy/NN is/VBZ positive/JJ definite/JJ ,/, which/WDT derives/VBZ the/DT non-convexity/NN of/IN BFE/NNP for/IN graphs/NNS with/IN multiple/JJ cycles/NNS ,/, and/CC a/DT condition/NN of/IN convexity/NN on/IN a/DT restricted/VBN set/NN ./.
This/DT analysis/NN also/RB gives/VBZ a/DT new/JJ condition/NN for/IN the/DT uniqueness/NN of/IN the/DT LBP/NN fixed/VBN point/NN ./.
The/DT other/JJ result/NN is/VBZ to/TO clarify/VB the/DT relation/NN between/IN the/DT local/JJ stability/NN of/IN a/DT fixed/VBN point/NN of/IN LBP/NN and/CC local/JJ minima/NN of/IN the/DT BFE/NNP ,/, which/WDT implies/VBZ ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, that/IN a/DT locally/RB stable/JJ fixed/VBN point/NN of/IN the/DT Gaussian/NNP LBP/NNP is/VBZ a/DT local/JJ minimum/NN of/IN the/DT Gaussian/NNP Bethe/NNP free/JJ energy/NN ./.
