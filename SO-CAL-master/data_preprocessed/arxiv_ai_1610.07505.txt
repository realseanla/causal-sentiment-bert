We/PRP develop/VBP a/DT Bayesian/JJ model/NN for/IN decision/NN -/HYPH making/VBG under/IN time/NN pressure/NN with/IN endogenous/JJ information/NN acquisition/NN ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ model/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN maker/NN decides/VBZ when/WRB to/TO observe/VB (/-LRB- costly/JJ )/-RRB- information/NN by/IN sampling/VBG an/DT underlying/VBG continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN stochastic/JJ process/NN (/-LRB- time/NN series/NN )/-RRB- that/WDT conveys/VBZ information/NN about/IN the/DT potential/JJ occurrence/NN or/CC non-occurrence/NN of/IN an/DT adverse/JJ event/NN which/WDT will/MD terminate/VB the/DT decision/NN -/HYPH making/VBG process/NN ./.
In/IN her/PRP$ attempt/NN to/TO predict/VB the/DT occurrence/NN of/IN the/DT adverse/JJ event/NN ,/, the/DT decision/NN -/HYPH maker/NN follows/VBZ a/DT policy/NN that/WDT determines/VBZ when/WRB to/TO acquire/VB information/NN from/IN the/DT time/NN series/NN (/-LRB- continuation/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC when/WRB to/TO stop/VB acquiring/VBG information/NN and/CC make/VB a/DT final/JJ prediction/NN (/-LRB- stopping/VBG )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT optimal/JJ policy/NN has/VBZ a/DT rendezvous/NN structure/NN ,/, i.e./FW a/DT structure/NN in/IN which/WDT whenever/WRB a/DT new/JJ information/NN sample/NN is/VBZ gathered/VBN from/IN the/DT time/NN series/NN ,/, the/DT optimal/JJ "/`` date/NN "/'' for/IN acquiring/VBG the/DT next/JJ sample/NN becomes/VBZ computable/JJ ./.
The/DT optimal/JJ interval/NN between/IN two/CD information/NN samples/NNS balances/VBZ a/DT trade/NN -/HYPH off/NN between/IN the/DT decision/NN maker/NN 's/POS surprise/NN ,/, i.e./FW the/DT drift/NN in/IN her/PRP$ posterior/JJ belief/NN after/IN observing/VBG new/JJ information/NN ,/, and/CC suspense/NN ,/, i.e./FW the/DT probability/NN that/IN the/DT adverse/JJ event/NN occurs/VBZ in/IN the/DT time/NN interval/NN between/IN two/CD information/NN samples/NNS ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP characterize/VBP the/DT continuation/NN and/CC stopping/VBG regions/NNS in/IN the/DT decision/NN -/HYPH maker/NN 's/POS state/NN -/HYPH space/NN ,/, and/CC show/VBP that/IN they/PRP depend/VBP not/RB only/RB on/IN the/DT decision/NN -/HYPH maker/NN 's/POS beliefs/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB on/IN the/DT context/NN ,/, i.e./FW the/DT current/JJ realization/NN of/IN the/DT time/NN series/NN ./.
