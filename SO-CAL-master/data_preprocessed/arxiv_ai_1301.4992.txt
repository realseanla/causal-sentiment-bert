This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT method/NN to/TO compute/VB automatically/RB topological/JJ relations/NNS using/VBG SWRL/NN rules/NNS ./.
The/DT calculation/NN of/IN these/DT rules/NNS is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT definition/NN of/IN a/DT Selective/JJ Nef/NNP Complexes/NNPS Nef/NNP Polyhedra/NNP structure/NN generated/VBN from/IN standard/JJ Polyhedron/NNP ./.
The/DT Selective/JJ Nef/NNP Complexes/NNPS is/VBZ a/DT data/NN model/NN providing/VBG a/DT set/NN of/IN binary/JJ Boolean/JJ operators/NNS such/JJ as/IN Union/NNP ,/, Difference/NN ,/, Intersection/NN and/CC Symmetric/JJ difference/NN ,/, and/CC unary/JJ operators/NNS such/JJ as/IN Interior/NNP ,/, Closure/NNP and/CC Boundary/NNP ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, these/DT operators/NNS are/VBP used/VBN to/TO compute/VB topological/JJ relations/NNS between/IN objects/NNS defined/VBN by/IN the/DT constraints/NNS of/IN the/DT 9/CD Intersection/NN Model/NN (/-LRB- 9/CD -/SYM IM/NN )/-RRB- from/IN Egenhofer/NNP ./.
With/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN these/DT constraints/NNS ,/, we/PRP defined/VBD a/DT procedure/NN to/IN compute/VB the/DT topological/JJ relations/NNS on/IN Nef/NNP polyhedra/NNP ./.
These/DT topological/JJ relationships/NNS are/VBP Disjoint/NN ,/, Meets/VBZ ,/, Contains/VBZ ,/, Inside/NNP ,/, Covers/VBZ ,/, CoveredBy/NNP ,/, Equals/VBZ and/CC Overlaps/VBZ ,/, and/CC defined/VBN in/IN a/DT top/JJ -/HYPH level/NN ontology/NN with/IN a/DT specific/JJ semantic/JJ definition/NN on/IN relation/NN such/JJ as/IN Transitive/JJ ,/, Symmetric/JJ ,/, Asymmetric/JJ ,/, Functional/JJ ,/, Reflexive/JJ ,/, and/CC Irreflexive/NNP ./.
The/DT results/NNS of/IN the/DT computation/NN of/IN topological/JJ relationships/NNS are/VBP stored/VBN in/IN an/DT OWL/NN -/HYPH DL/NN ontology/NN allowing/VBG after/IN what/WP to/IN infer/VB on/IN these/DT new/JJ relationships/NNS between/IN objects/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, logic/NN rules/NNS based/VBN on/IN the/DT Semantic/JJ Web/NN Rule/NNP Language/NNP allows/VBZ the/DT definition/NN of/IN logic/NN programs/NNS that/WDT define/VBP which/WDT topological/JJ relationships/NNS have/VBP to/TO be/VB computed/VBN on/IN which/WDT kind/NN of/IN objects/NNS with/IN specific/JJ attributes/NNS ./.
For/IN instance/NN ,/, a/DT "/`` Building/NN "/'' that/WDT overlaps/VBZ a/DT "/`` Railway/NNP "/'' is/VBZ a/DT "/`` RailStation/NNP "/'' ./.
