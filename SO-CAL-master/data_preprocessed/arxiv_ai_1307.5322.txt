Ontology/NNP Matching/NNP aims/VBZ to/TO find/VB a/DT set/NN of/IN semantic/JJ correspondences/NNS ,/, called/VBD an/DT alignment/NN ,/, between/IN related/JJ ontologies/NNS ./.
In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT growing/VBG interest/NN in/IN efficient/JJ and/CC effective/JJ matching/NN methods/NNS for/IN large/JJ ontologies/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, most/JJS of/IN the/DT alignments/NNS produced/VBN for/IN large/JJ ontologies/NNS are/VBP logically/RB incoherent/JJ ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ technique/NN for/IN detecting/VBG incoherent/JJ concepts/NNS based/VBN on/IN ontology/NN modularization/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT new/JJ repair/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT minimizes/VBZ the/DT incoherence/NN of/IN the/DT resulting/VBG alignment/NN and/CC the/DT number/NN of/IN matches/NNS removed/VBN from/IN the/DT input/NN alignment/NN ./.
An/DT implementation/NN was/VBD done/VBN as/IN part/NN of/IN a/DT lightweight/JJ version/NN of/IN AgreementMaker/NNP system/NN ,/, a/DT successful/JJ ontology/NN matching/VBG platform/NN ,/, and/CC evaluated/VBN using/VBG a/DT set/NN of/IN four/CD benchmark/NN biomedical/JJ ontology/NN matching/VBG tasks/NNS ./.
