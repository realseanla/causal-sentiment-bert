The/DT Isabelle/NNP //HYPH PIDE/NNP platform/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT question/NN whether/IN proof/NN assistants/NNS of/IN the/DT LCF/NN family/NN are/VBP suitable/JJ as/IN technological/JJ basis/NN for/IN educational/JJ tools/NNS ./.
The/DT traditionally/RB strong/JJ logical/JJ foundations/NNS of/IN systems/NNS like/IN HOL/NNP ,/, Coq/NNP ,/, or/CC Isabelle/NNP have/VBP so/RB far/RB been/VBN counter-balanced/VBN by/IN somewhat/RB inaccessible/JJ interaction/NN via/IN the/DT TTY/NN (/-LRB- or/CC minor/JJ variations/NNS like/IN the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN Proof/NNP General/NNP //HYPH Emacs/NNP interface/NN )/-RRB- ./.
