Despite/IN the/DT overwhelming/JJ success/NN of/IN deep/JJ learning/NN in/IN various/JJ speech/NN processing/NN tasks/NNS ,/, the/DT problem/NN of/IN separating/VBG simultaneous/JJ speakers/NNS in/IN a/DT mixture/NN remains/VBZ challenging/JJ ./.
Two/CD major/JJ difficulties/NNS in/IN such/JJ systems/NNS are/VBP the/DT arbitrary/JJ source/NN permutation/NN and/CC unknown/JJ number/NN of/IN sources/NNS in/IN the/DT mixture/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ deep/JJ learning/NN framework/NN for/IN single/JJ channel/NN speech/NN separation/NN by/IN creating/VBG attractor/NN points/NNS in/IN high/JJ dimensional/JJ embedding/NN space/NN of/IN the/DT acoustic/JJ signals/NNS which/WDT pull/VBP together/RB the/DT time/NN -/HYPH frequency/NN bins/NNS corresponding/VBG to/IN each/DT source/NN ./.
Attractor/NN points/NNS in/IN this/DT study/NN are/VBP created/VBN by/IN finding/VBG the/DT centroids/NNS of/IN the/DT sources/NNS in/IN the/DT embedding/NN space/NN ,/, which/WDT are/VBP subsequently/RB used/VBN to/TO determine/VB the/DT similarity/NN of/IN each/DT bin/NN in/IN the/DT mixture/NN to/IN each/DT source/NN ./.
The/DT network/NN is/VBZ then/RB trained/VBN to/TO minimize/VB the/DT reconstruction/NN error/NN of/IN each/DT source/NN by/IN optimizing/VBG the/DT embeddings/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN model/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN prior/JJ works/NNS in/IN that/IN it/PRP implements/VBZ an/DT end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN training/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB depend/VB on/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN sources/NNS in/IN the/DT mixture/NN ./.
Two/CD strategies/NNS are/VBP explored/VBN in/IN the/DT test/NN time/NN ,/, K/NN -/HYPH means/NNS and/CC fixed/VBN attractor/NN points/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT latter/JJ requires/VBZ no/DT post-processing/JJ and/CC can/MD be/VB implemented/VBN in/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluated/VBD our/PRP$ system/NN on/IN Wall/NNP Street/NNP Journal/NNP dataset/NN and/CC show/NN 5.49/CD \/SYM percent/NN improvement/NN over/IN the/DT previous/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN methods/NNS ./.
