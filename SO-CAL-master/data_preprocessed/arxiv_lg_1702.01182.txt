Reinforcement/NN learning/NN can/MD enable/VB complex/JJ ,/, adaptive/JJ behavior/NN to/TO be/VB learned/VBN automatically/RB for/IN autonomous/JJ robotic/JJ platforms/NNS ./.

A/DT successful/JJ learning/NN method/NN must/MD therefore/RB proceed/VB cautiously/RB ,/, experiencing/VBG only/RB low/JJ -/HYPH speed/NN collisions/NNS until/IN it/PRP gains/VBZ confidence/NN ./.
