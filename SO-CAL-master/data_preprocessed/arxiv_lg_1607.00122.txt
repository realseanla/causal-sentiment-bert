A/DT catastrophic/JJ forgetting/VBG problem/NN makes/VBZ deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS forget/VBP the/DT previously/RB learned/VBN information/NN ,/, when/WRB learning/VBG data/NNS collected/VBN in/IN new/JJ environments/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN by/IN different/JJ sensors/NNS or/CC in/IN different/JJ light/NN conditions/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT new/JJ method/NN for/IN alleviating/VBG the/DT catastrophic/JJ forgetting/VBG problem/NN ./.
Unlike/IN previous/JJ research/NN ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN does/VBZ not/RB use/VB any/DT information/NN from/IN the/DT source/NN domain/NN ./.
Surprisingly/RB ,/, our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ very/RB effective/JJ to/TO forget/VB less/JJR of/IN the/DT information/NN in/IN the/DT source/NN domain/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP show/VBP the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ method/NN using/VBG several/JJ experiments/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP observed/VBD that/IN the/DT forgetting/VBG problem/NN occurs/VBZ between/IN mini-batches/NNS when/WRB performing/VBG general/JJ training/NN processes/NNS using/VBG stochastic/JJ gradient/NN descent/NN methods/NNS ,/, and/CC this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT factors/NNS that/WDT degrades/VBZ generalization/NN performance/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB try/VBP to/TO solve/VB this/DT problem/NN using/VBG the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP our/PRP$ less/RBR -/HYPH forgetting/VBG learning/NN method/NN is/VBZ also/RB helpful/JJ to/TO improve/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN recognition/NN rates/NNS ./.
