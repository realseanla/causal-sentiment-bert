Two/CD major/JJ goals/NNS in/IN machine/NN learning/NN are/VBP the/DT discovery/NN and/CC improvement/NN of/IN solutions/NNS to/IN complex/JJ problems/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN complexification/NN ,/, i.e./FW the/DT incremental/JJ elaboration/NN of/IN solutions/NNS through/IN adding/VBG new/JJ structure/NN ,/, achieves/VBZ both/CC these/DT goals/NNS ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT power/NN of/IN complexification/NN through/IN the/DT NeuroEvolution/NNP of/IN Augmenting/VBG Topologies/NNP (/-LRB- NEAT/NNP )/-RRB- method/NN ,/, which/WDT evolves/VBZ increasingly/RB complex/JJ neural/JJ network/NN architectures/NNS ./.
