A/DT kidney/NN exchange/NN is/VBZ an/DT organized/JJ barter/NN market/NN where/WRB patients/NNS in/IN need/NN of/IN a/DT kidney/NN swap/NN willing/JJ but/CC incompatible/JJ donors/NNS ./.
Determining/VBG an/DT optimal/JJ set/NN of/IN exchanges/NNS is/VBZ theoretically/RB and/CC empirically/RB hard/RB ./.
Traditionally/RB ,/, exchanges/NNS took/VBD place/NN in/IN cycles/NNS ,/, with/IN each/DT participating/VBG patient/NN -/HYPH donor/NN pair/NN both/CC giving/VBG and/CC receiving/VBG a/DT kidney/NN ./.
The/DT recent/JJ introduction/NN of/IN chains/NNS ,/, where/WRB a/DT donor/NN without/IN a/DT paired/VBN patient/NN triggers/VBZ a/DT sequence/NN of/IN donations/NNS without/IN requiring/VBG a/DT kidney/NN in/IN return/NN ,/, increased/VBD the/DT efficacy/NN of/IN fielded/VBN kidney/NN exchanges/NNS ---/, while/IN also/RB dramatically/RB raising/VBG the/DT empirical/JJ computational/JJ hardness/NN of/IN clearing/VBG the/DT market/NN in/IN practice/NN ./.
While/IN chains/NNS can/MD be/VB quite/RB long/RB ,/, unbounded/JJ -/HYPH length/NN chains/NNS are/VBP not/RB desirable/JJ :/: planned/JJ donations/NNS can/MD fail/VB before/IN transplant/NN for/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN reasons/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT failure/NN of/IN a/DT single/JJ donation/NN causes/VBZ the/DT rest/NN of/IN that/DT chain/NN to/TO fail/VB ,/, so/RB parallel/JJ shorter/JJR chains/NNS are/VBP better/JJR in/IN practice/NN ./.
