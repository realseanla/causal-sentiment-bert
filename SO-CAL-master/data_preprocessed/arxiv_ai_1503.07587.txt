This/DT note/NN revisits/VBZ the/DT concepts/NNS of/IN task/NN and/CC difficulty/NN ./.
The/DT notion/NN of/IN cognitive/JJ task/NN and/CC its/PRP$ use/NN for/IN the/DT evaluation/NN of/IN intelligent/JJ systems/NNS is/VBZ still/RB replete/JJ with/IN issues/NNS ./.
The/DT view/NN of/IN tasks/NNS as/IN MDP/NNP in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN reinforcement/NN learning/NN has/VBZ been/VBN especially/RB useful/JJ for/IN the/DT formalisation/NN of/IN learning/VBG tasks/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT alternate/JJ interaction/NN does/VBZ not/RB accommodate/VB well/RB for/IN some/DT other/JJ tasks/NNS that/WDT are/VBP usual/JJ in/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN and/CC ,/, most/JJS especially/RB ,/, in/IN animal/NN and/CC human/JJ evaluation/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP want/VBP to/TO have/VB a/DT more/RBR general/JJ account/NN of/IN episodes/NNS ,/, rewards/NNS and/CC responses/NNS ,/, and/CC ,/, most/JJS especially/RB ,/, the/DT computational/JJ complexity/NN of/IN the/DT algorithm/NN behind/IN an/DT agent/NN solving/VBG a/DT task/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ crucial/JJ for/IN the/DT determination/NN of/IN the/DT difficulty/NN of/IN a/DT task/NN as/IN the/DT (/-LRB- logarithm/NN of/IN the/DT )/-RRB- number/NN of/IN computational/JJ steps/NNS required/VBN to/TO acquire/VB an/DT acceptable/JJ policy/NN for/IN the/DT task/NN ,/, which/WDT includes/VBZ the/DT exploration/NN of/IN policies/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ verification/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT notion/NN of/IN asynchronous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN stochastic/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
Based/VBN on/IN this/DT interpretation/NN ,/, we/PRP can/MD see/VB what/WP task/NN difficulty/NN is/VBZ ,/, what/WP instance/NN difficulty/NN is/VBZ (/-LRB- relative/JJ to/IN a/DT task/NN )/-RRB- and/CC also/RB what/WP task/NN compositions/NNS and/CC decompositions/NNS are/VBP ./.
