Uncertainty/NN plays/VBZ a/DT central/JJ role/NN in/IN spoken/VBN dialogue/NN systems/NNS ./.
Some/DT stochastic/JJ models/NNS like/IN Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN (/-LRB- MDP/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP used/VBN to/TO model/VB the/DT dialogue/NN manager/NN ./.
But/CC the/DT partially/RB observable/JJ system/NN state/NN and/CC user/NN intention/NN hinder/VBP the/DT natural/JJ representation/NN of/IN the/DT dialogue/NN state/NN ./.

We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ dialogue/NN model/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT partially/RB observable/JJ Markov/NNP decision/NN process/NN (/-LRB- POMDP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP use/VBP hidden/JJ system/NN states/NNS and/CC user/NN intentions/NNS as/IN the/DT state/NN set/NN ,/, parser/NN results/NNS and/CC low/JJ -/HYPH level/NN information/NN as/IN the/DT observation/NN set/NN ,/, domain/NN actions/NNS and/CC dialogue/NN repair/NN actions/NNS as/IN the/DT action/NN set/NN ./.
