Convolutional/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNNs/NNS )/-RRB- were/VBD recently/RB shown/VBN to/TO provide/VB state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN results/NNS for/IN object/NN category/NN viewpoint/NN estimation/NN ./.
However/RB different/JJ ways/NNS of/IN formulating/VBG this/DT problem/NN have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN and/CC the/DT competing/VBG approaches/NNS have/VBP been/VBN explored/VBN with/IN very/RB different/JJ design/NN choices/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT comparison/NN of/IN these/DT approaches/NNS in/IN a/DT unified/JJ setting/NN as/RB well/RB as/IN a/DT detailed/JJ analysis/NN of/IN the/DT key/JJ factors/NNS that/WDT impact/VBP performance/NN ./.
Followingly/RB ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ joint/JJ training/NN method/NN with/IN the/DT detection/NN task/NN and/CC demonstrate/VBP its/PRP$ benefit/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB highlight/VBD the/DT superiority/NN of/IN classification/NN approaches/VBZ over/IN regression/NN approaches/NNS ,/, quantify/VB the/DT benefits/NNS of/IN deeper/JJR architectures/NNS and/CC extended/JJ training/NN data/NNS ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP that/IN synthetic/JJ data/NNS is/VBZ beneficial/JJ even/RB when/WRB using/VBG ImageNet/NNP training/NN data/NNS ./.
By/IN combining/VBG all/PDT these/DT elements/NNS ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP an/DT improvement/NN of/IN approximately/RB 5/CD percent/NN mAVP/NN over/IN previous/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN results/NNS on/IN the/DT Pascal3D/NN dataset/NN ./.
In/IN particular/JJ for/IN their/PRP$ most/RBS challenging/JJ 24/CD view/NN classification/NN task/NN we/PRP improve/VBP the/DT results/NNS from/IN 31.1/CD percent/NN to/IN 36.1/CD percent/NN mAVP/NN ./.
