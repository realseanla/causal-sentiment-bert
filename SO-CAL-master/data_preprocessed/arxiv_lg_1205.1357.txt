The/DT battle/NN between/IN email/NN service/NN providers/NNS and/CC senders/NNS of/IN mass/JJ unsolicited/JJ emails/NNS (/-LRB- Spam/NNP )/-RRB- continues/VBZ to/TO gain/VB traction/NN ./.
Vast/JJ numbers/NNS of/IN Spam/NNP emails/NNS are/VBP sent/VBN mainly/RB from/IN automatic/JJ botnets/NNS distributed/VBN over/IN the/DT world/NN ./.
One/CD method/NN for/IN mitigating/VBG Spam/NNP in/IN a/DT computationally/RB efficient/JJ manner/NN is/VBZ fast/JJ and/CC accurate/JJ blacklisting/NN of/IN the/DT senders/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ sender/NN reputation/NN mechanism/NN that/WDT is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN an/DT aggregated/VBN historical/JJ data/NN -/HYPH set/NN which/WDT encodes/VBZ the/DT behavior/NN of/IN mail/NN transfer/NN agents/NNS over/IN time/NN ./.
A/DT historical/JJ data/NN -/HYPH set/NN is/VBZ created/VBN from/IN labeled/VBN logs/NNS of/IN received/VBN emails/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP machine/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS to/TO build/VB a/DT model/NN that/WDT predicts/VBZ the/DT \/NN emph/NN {/-LRB- spammingness/NN }/-RRB- of/IN mail/NN transfer/NN agents/NNS in/IN the/DT near/JJ future/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN mechanism/NN is/VBZ targeted/VBN mainly/RB at/IN large/JJ enterprises/NNS and/CC email/NN service/NN providers/NNS and/CC can/MD be/VB used/VBN for/IN updating/VBG both/CC the/DT black/JJ and/CC the/DT white/JJ lists/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT proposed/VBN mechanism/NN using/VBG 9.5/CD M/NN anonymized/JJ log/NN entries/NNS obtained/VBN from/IN the/DT biggest/JJS Internet/NN service/NN provider/NN in/IN Europe/NNP ./.
Experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN proposed/JJ method/NN detects/VBZ more/JJR than/IN 94/CD percent/NN of/IN the/DT Spam/NN emails/NNS that/WDT escaped/VBD the/DT blacklist/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW ,/, TPR/NN )/-RRB- ,/, while/IN having/VBG less/JJR than/IN 0.5/CD percent/NN false/JJ -/HYPH alarms/NNS ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN is/VBZ much/RB higher/JJR than/IN of/IN previously/RB reported/VBN reputation/NN mechanisms/NNS ,/, which/WDT rely/VBP on/IN emails/NNS logs/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/JJ method/NN ,/, when/WRB used/VBN for/IN updating/VBG both/CC the/DT black/JJ and/CC white/JJ lists/NNS ,/, eliminated/VBD the/DT need/NN in/IN automatic/JJ content/NN inspection/NN of/IN 4/CD out/IN of/IN 5/CD incoming/JJ emails/NNS ,/, which/WDT resulted/VBD in/IN dramatic/JJ reduction/NN in/IN the/DT filtering/VBG computational/JJ load/NN ./.
