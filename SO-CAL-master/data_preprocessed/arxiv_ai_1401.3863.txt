The/DT Hamiltonian/JJ cycle/NN problem/NN (/-LRB- HCP/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ combinatorial/JJ problem/NN with/IN applications/NNS in/IN many/JJ areas/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ among/IN the/DT first/JJ problems/NNS used/VBN for/IN studying/VBG intrinsic/JJ properties/NNS ,/, including/VBG phase/NN transitions/NNS ,/, of/IN combinatorial/JJ problems/NNS ./.
While/IN thorough/JJ theoretical/JJ and/CC experimental/JJ analyses/NNS have/VBP been/VBN made/VBN on/IN the/DT HCP/NN in/IN undirected/JJ graphs/NNS ,/, a/DT limited/JJ amount/NN of/IN work/NN has/VBZ been/VBN done/VBN for/IN the/DT HCP/NN in/IN directed/VBN graphs/NNS (/-LRB- DHCP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT main/JJ contribution/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ an/DT effective/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT DHCP/NNP ./.
Our/PRP$ algorithm/NN explores/VBZ and/CC exploits/VBZ the/DT close/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT DHCP/NNP and/CC the/DT Assignment/NN Problem/NNP (/-LRB- AP/NN )/-RRB- and/CC utilizes/VBZ a/DT technique/NN based/VBN on/IN Boolean/NNP satisfiability/NN (/-LRB- SAT/NN )/-RRB- ./.
By/IN combining/VBG effective/JJ algorithms/NNS for/IN the/DT AP/NN and/CC SAT/VBD ,/, our/PRP$ algorithm/NN significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ previous/JJ exact/JJ DHCP/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, including/VBG an/DT algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT award/NN -/HYPH winning/VBG Concorde/NNP TSP/NNP algorithm/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ result/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ study/NN is/VBZ an/DT experimental/JJ analysis/NN of/IN phase/NN transitions/NNS of/IN the/DT DHCP/NNP ,/, verifying/VBG and/CC refining/VBG a/DT known/JJ phase/NN transition/NN of/IN the/DT DHCP/NNP ./.
