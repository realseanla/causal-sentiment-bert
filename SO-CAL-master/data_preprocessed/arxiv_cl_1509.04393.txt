In/IN the/DT recent/JJ issue/NN of/IN PNAS/NNP ,/, Futrell/NNP et/FW al./FW claims/NNS that/IN their/PRP$ study/NN of/IN 37/CD languages/NNS gives/VBZ the/DT first/JJ large/JJ scale/NN cross-language/JJ evidence/NN for/IN Dependency/NN Length/NN Minimization/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ an/DT overstatement/NN that/WDT ignores/VBZ similar/JJ previous/JJ researches/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, this/DT study/NN seems/VBZ to/TO pay/VB no/DT attention/NN to/IN factors/NNS like/IN the/DT uniformity/NN of/IN genres/NNS ,/, which/WDT weakens/VBZ the/DT validity/NN of/IN the/DT argument/NN that/WDT DLM/NNP is/VBZ universal/JJ ./.
Another/DT problem/NN is/VBZ that/IN this/DT study/NN sets/VBZ the/DT baseline/NN random/JJ language/NN as/IN projective/JJ ,/, which/WDT fails/VBZ to/TO truly/RB uncover/VB the/DT difference/NN between/IN natural/JJ language/NN and/CC random/JJ language/NN ,/, since/IN projectivity/NN is/VBZ an/DT important/JJ feature/NN of/IN many/JJ natural/JJ languages/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT paper/NN contends/VBZ an/DT "/`` apparent/JJ relationship/NN between/IN head/NN finality/NN and/CC dependency/NN length/NN "/'' despite/IN the/DT lack/NN of/IN an/DT explicit/JJ statistical/JJ comparison/NN ,/, which/WDT renders/VBZ this/DT conclusion/NN rather/RB hasty/JJ and/CC improper/JJ ./.
