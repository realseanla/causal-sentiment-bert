This/DT paper/NN develops/VBZ an/DT inconsistency/NN measure/NN on/IN conditional/JJ probabilistic/JJ knowledge/NN bases/NNS ./.
The/DT measure/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN fundamental/JJ principles/NNS for/IN inconsistency/NN measures/NNS and/CC thus/RB provides/VBZ a/DT solid/JJ theoretical/JJ framework/NN for/IN the/DT treatment/NN of/IN inconsistencies/NNS in/IN probabilistic/JJ expert/NN systems/NNS ./.
We/PRP illustrate/VBP its/PRP$ usefulness/NN and/CC immediate/JJ application/NN on/IN several/JJ examples/NNS and/CC present/VB some/DT formal/JJ results/NNS ./.
Building/NN on/IN this/DT measure/NN we/PRP use/VBP the/DT Shapley/NNP value/NN -/HYPH a/DT well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN solution/NN for/IN coalition/NN games/NNS -/, to/TO define/VB a/DT sophisticated/JJ indicator/NN that/WDT is/VBZ not/RB only/RB able/JJ to/TO measure/VB inconsistencies/NNS but/CC to/TO reveal/VB the/DT causes/NNS of/IN inconsistencies/NNS in/IN the/DT knowledge/NN base/NN ./.
Altogether/RB these/DT tools/NNS guide/VB the/DT knowledge/NN engineer/NN in/IN his/PRP$ aim/NN to/TO restore/VB consistency/NN and/CC therefore/RB enable/VBP him/PRP to/TO build/VB a/DT consistent/JJ and/CC usable/JJ knowledge/NN base/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB employed/VBN in/IN probabilistic/JJ expert/NN systems/NNS ./.
