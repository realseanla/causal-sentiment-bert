This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT tentative/JJ outline/NN for/IN the/DT construction/NN of/IN an/DT artificial/JJ ,/, generally/RB intelligent/JJ system/NN (/-LRB- AGI/NN )/-RRB- ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ argued/VBN that/IN building/VBG a/DT general/JJ data/NNS compression/NN algorithm/NN solving/VBG all/DT problems/NNS up/RP to/IN a/DT complexity/NN threshold/NN should/MD be/VB the/DT main/JJ thrust/NN of/IN research/NN ./.
A/DT measure/NN for/IN partial/JJ progress/NN in/IN AGI/NN is/VBZ suggested/VBN ./.
Although/IN the/DT details/NNS are/VBP far/RB from/IN being/VBG clear/JJ ,/, some/DT general/JJ properties/NNS for/IN a/DT general/JJ compression/NN algorithm/NN are/VBP fleshed/VBN out/RP ./.
