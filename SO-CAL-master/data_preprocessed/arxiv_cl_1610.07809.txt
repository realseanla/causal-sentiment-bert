The/DT SemEval/NNP -/HYPH 2010/CD benchmark/NN dataset/NN has/VBZ brought/VBN renewed/JJ attention/NN to/IN the/DT task/NN of/IN automatic/JJ keyphrase/NN extraction/NN ./.
This/DT dataset/NN is/VBZ made/VBN up/IN of/IN scientific/JJ articles/NNS that/WDT were/VBD automatically/RB converted/VBN from/IN PDF/NN format/NN to/IN plain/JJ text/NN and/CC thus/RB require/VBP careful/JJ preprocessing/VBG so/IN that/IN irrevelant/JJ spans/NNS of/IN text/NN do/VBP not/RB negatively/RB affect/VB keyphrase/NN extraction/NN performance/NN ./.
In/IN previous/JJ work/NN ,/, a/DT wide/JJ range/NN of/IN document/NN preprocessing/NN techniques/NNS were/VBD described/VBN but/CC their/PRP$ impact/NN on/IN the/DT overall/JJ performance/NN of/IN keyphrase/NN extraction/NN models/NNS is/VBZ still/RB unexplored/JJ ./.
Here/RB ,/, we/PRP re-assess/VBP the/DT performance/NN of/IN several/JJ keyphrase/NN extraction/NN models/NNS and/CC measure/VB their/PRP$ robustness/NN against/IN increasingly/RB sophisticated/JJ levels/NNS of/IN document/NN preprocessing/NN ./.
