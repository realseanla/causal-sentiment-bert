Wireless/NNP Local/NNP Area/NNP Network/NNP (/-LRB- WLAN/NNP )/-RRB- has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT promising/JJ choice/NN for/IN indoor/JJ positioning/NN as/IN the/DT only/JJ existing/VBG and/CC established/VBN infrastructure/NN ,/, to/TO localize/VB the/DT mobile/JJ and/CC stationary/JJ users/NNS indoors/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, since/IN WLAN/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN initially/RB designed/VBN for/IN wireless/JJ networking/NN and/CC not/RB positioning/VBG ,/, the/DT localization/NN task/NN based/VBN on/IN WLAN/NNP signals/NNS has/VBZ several/JJ challenges/NNS ./.
Amongst/IN the/DT WLAN/NN positioning/NN methods/NNS ,/, WLAN/NNP fingerprinting/NN localization/NN has/VBZ recently/RB achieved/VBN great/JJ attention/NN due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ promising/JJ results/NNS ./.
WLAN/NNP fingerprinting/NN faces/VBZ several/JJ challenges/NNS and/CC hence/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, our/PRP$ goal/NN is/VBZ to/IN overview/NN these/DT challenges/NNS and/CC the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN solutions/NNS ./.

Since/IN all/PDT the/DT proposed/VBN methods/NNS in/IN WLAN/NNP literature/NN have/VBP been/VBN conducted/VBN and/CC tested/VBN in/IN different/JJ settings/NNS ,/, the/DT reported/VBN results/NNS are/VBP not/RB equally/RB comparable/JJ ./.
