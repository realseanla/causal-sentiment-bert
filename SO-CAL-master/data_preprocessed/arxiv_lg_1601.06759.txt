Modeling/VBG the/DT distribution/NN of/IN natural/JJ images/NNS is/VBZ a/DT landmark/NN problem/NN in/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN ./.
This/DT task/NN requires/VBZ an/DT image/NN model/NN that/WDT is/VBZ at/IN once/RB expressive/JJ ,/, tractable/JJ and/CC scalable/JJ ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN that/WDT sequentially/RB predicts/VBZ the/DT pixels/NNS in/IN an/DT image/NN along/IN the/DT two/CD spatial/JJ dimensions/NNS ./.

Architectural/JJ novelties/NNS include/VBP fast/JJ two/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ recurrent/JJ layers/NNS and/CC an/DT effective/JJ use/NN of/IN residual/JJ connections/NNS in/IN deep/JJ recurrent/JJ networks/NNS ./.
We/PRP achieve/VBP log/NN -/HYPH likelihood/NN scores/NNS on/IN natural/JJ images/NNS that/WDT are/VBP considerably/RB better/JJR than/IN the/DT previous/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ./.
