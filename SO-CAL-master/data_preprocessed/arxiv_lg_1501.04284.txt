This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN learning/NN approach/NN to/IN pairwise/JJ constraint/NN propagation/NN on/IN multi-view/JJ data/NNS ./.
Although/IN pairwise/JJ constraint/NN propagation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN studied/VBN extensively/RB ,/, pairwise/JJ constraints/NNS are/VBP usually/RB defined/VBN over/IN pairs/NNS of/IN data/NNS points/NNS from/IN a/DT single/JJ view/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, only/RB intra-view/JJ constraint/NN propagation/NN is/VBZ considered/VBN for/IN multi-view/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, very/RB little/JJ attention/NN has/VBZ been/VBN paid/VBN to/IN inter-view/NN constraint/NN propagation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ more/JJR challenging/JJ since/IN pairwise/JJ constraints/NNS are/VBP now/RB defined/VBN over/IN pairs/NNS of/IN data/NNS points/NNS from/IN different/JJ views/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP to/IN decompose/VB the/DT challenging/JJ inter-view/NN constraint/NN propagation/NN problem/NN into/IN semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN subproblems/NNS so/IN that/IN they/PRP can/MD be/VB efficiently/RB solved/VBN based/VBN on/IN graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN label/NN propagation/NN ./.
To/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, this/DT is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ attempt/NN to/TO give/VB an/DT efficient/JJ solution/NN to/IN inter-view/NN constraint/NN propagation/NN from/IN a/DT semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN viewpoint/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, since/IN graph/NN -/HYPH based/VBN label/NN propagation/NN has/VBZ been/VBN adopted/VBN for/IN basic/JJ optimization/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP two/CD constrained/JJ graph/NN construction/NN methods/NNS for/IN interview/NN constraint/NN propagation/NN ,/, which/WDT only/RB differ/VBP in/IN how/WRB the/DT intra-view/JJ pairwise/JJ constraints/NNS are/VBP exploited/VBN ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS in/IN cross-view/JJ retrieval/NN have/VBP shown/VBN the/DT promising/JJ performance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ inter-view/NN constraint/NN propagation/NN ./.
