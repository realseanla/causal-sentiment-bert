A/DT biological/JJ neural/JJ network/NN is/VBZ constituted/VBN by/IN numerous/JJ subnetworks/NNS and/CC modules/NNS with/IN different/JJ functionalities/NNS ./.
For/IN an/DT artificial/JJ neural/JJ network/NN ,/, the/DT relationship/NN between/IN a/DT network/NN and/CC its/PRP$ subnetworks/NNS is/VBZ also/RB important/JJ and/CC useful/JJ for/IN both/DT theoretical/JJ and/CC algorithmic/JJ research/NN ,/, i.e./FW it/PRP can/MD be/VB exploited/VBN to/TO develop/VB incremental/JJ network/NN training/NN algorithm/NN or/CC parallel/JJ network/NN training/NN algorithm/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP explore/VBP the/DT relationship/NN between/IN an/DT ELM/NN neural/JJ network/NN and/CC its/PRP$ subnetworks/NNS ./.
To/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, we/PRP are/VBP the/DT first/JJ to/TO prove/VB a/DT theorem/NN that/WDT shows/VBZ an/DT ELM/NN neural/JJ network/NN can/MD be/VB scattered/VBN into/IN subnetworks/NNS and/CC its/PRP$ optimal/JJ solution/NN can/MD be/VB constructed/VBN recursively/RB by/IN the/DT optimal/JJ solutions/NNS of/IN these/DT subnetworks/NNS ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT theorem/NN we/PRP also/RB present/JJ two/CD algorithms/NNS to/TO train/VB a/DT large/JJ ELM/NN neural/JJ network/NN efficiently/RB :/: one/CD is/VBZ a/DT parallel/JJ network/NN training/NN algorithm/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ is/VBZ an/DT incremental/JJ network/NN training/NN algorithm/NN ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS demonstrate/VBP the/DT usefulness/NN of/IN the/DT theorem/NN and/CC the/DT validity/NN of/IN the/DT developed/VBN algorithms/NNS ./.
