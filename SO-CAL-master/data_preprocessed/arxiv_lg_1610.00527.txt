We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT probabilistic/JJ video/NN model/NN ,/, the/DT Video/NNP Pixel/NNP Network/NNP (/-LRB- VPN/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, that/WDT estimates/VBZ the/DT discrete/JJ joint/JJ distribution/NN of/IN the/DT raw/JJ pixel/NN values/NNS in/IN a/DT video/NN ./.
The/DT model/NN and/CC the/DT neural/JJ architecture/NN reflect/VB the/DT time/NN ,/, space/NN and/CC color/NN structure/NN of/IN video/NN tensors/NNS and/CC encode/VBP it/PRP as/IN a/DT four/CD -/HYPH dimensional/JJ dependency/NN chain/NN ./.
The/DT VPN/NNP approaches/VBZ the/DT best/JJS possible/JJ performance/NN on/IN the/DT Moving/VBG MNIST/NN benchmark/NN ,/, a/DT leap/NN over/IN the/DT previous/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT generated/VBN videos/NNS show/VBP only/JJ minor/JJ deviations/NNS from/IN the/DT ground/NN truth/NN ./.
The/DT VPN/NNP also/RB produces/VBZ detailed/JJ samples/NNS on/IN the/DT action/NN -/HYPH conditional/JJ Robotic/JJ Pushing/VBG benchmark/NN and/CC generalizes/VBZ to/IN the/DT motion/NN of/IN novel/JJ objects/NNS ./.
