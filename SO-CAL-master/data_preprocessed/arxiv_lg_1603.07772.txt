Skeleton/NN based/VBN action/NN recognition/NN distinguishes/VBZ human/JJ actions/NNS using/VBG the/DT trajectories/NNS of/IN skeleton/NN joints/NNS ,/, which/WDT provide/VBP a/DT very/RB good/JJ representation/NN for/IN describing/VBG actions/NNS ./.
Considering/VBG that/IN recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- RNNs/NNS )/-RRB- with/IN Long/JJ Short/JJ -/HYPH Term/NN Memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- can/MD learn/VB feature/NN representations/NNS and/CC model/NN long/RB -/HYPH term/NN temporal/JJ dependencies/NNS automatically/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT end/NN -/HYPH to/IN -/HYPH end/NN fully/RB connected/JJ deep/JJ LSTM/NN network/NN for/IN skeleton/NN based/VBN action/NN recognition/NN ./.
Inspired/VBN by/IN the/DT observation/NN that/IN the/DT co-occurrences/NNS of/IN the/DT joints/NNS intrinsically/RB characterize/VBP human/JJ actions/NNS ,/, we/PRP take/VBP the/DT skeleton/NN as/IN the/DT input/NN at/IN each/DT time/NN slot/NN and/CC introduce/VB a/DT novel/JJ regularization/NN scheme/NN to/TO learn/VB the/DT co-occurrence/NN features/NNS of/IN skeleton/NN joints/NNS ./.
To/TO train/VB the/DT deep/JJ LSTM/NN network/NN effectively/RB ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ dropout/NN algorithm/NN which/WDT simultaneously/RB operates/VBZ on/IN the/DT gates/NNS ,/, cells/NNS ,/, and/CC output/NN responses/NNS of/IN the/DT LSTM/NNP neurons/NNS ./.
