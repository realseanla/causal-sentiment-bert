We/PRP consider/VBP filtering/VBG for/IN a/DT continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN ,/, or/CC asynchronous/JJ ,/, stochastic/JJ system/NN where/WRB the/DT full/JJ distribution/NN over/IN states/NNS is/VBZ too/RB large/JJ to/TO be/VB stored/VBN or/CC calculated/VBN ./.
We/PRP assume/VBP that/IN the/DT rate/NN matrix/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN can/MD be/VB compactly/RB represented/VBN and/CC that/IN the/DT belief/NN distribution/NN is/VBZ to/TO be/VB approximated/VBN as/IN a/DT product/NN of/IN marginals/NNS ./.
