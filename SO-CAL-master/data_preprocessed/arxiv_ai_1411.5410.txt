Model/NN counting/NN is/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN computing/VBG the/DT number/NN of/IN models/NNS that/WDT satisfy/VBP a/DT given/VBN propositional/JJ theory/NN ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ recently/RB been/VBN applied/VBN to/IN solving/VBG inference/NN tasks/NNS in/IN probabilistic/JJ logic/NN programming/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO compute/VB the/DT probability/NN of/IN given/VBN queries/NNS being/VBG true/JJ provided/VBN a/DT set/NN of/IN mutually/RB independent/JJ random/JJ variables/NNS ,/, a/DT model/NN (/-LRB- a/DT logic/NN program/NN )/-RRB- and/CC some/DT evidence/NN ./.
The/DT core/NN of/IN solving/VBG this/DT inference/NN task/NN involves/VBZ translating/VBG the/DT logic/NN program/NN to/IN a/DT propositional/JJ theory/NN and/CC using/VBG a/DT model/NN counter/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN for/IN some/DT problems/NNS that/WDT involve/VBP inductive/JJ definitions/NNS like/IN reachability/NN in/IN a/DT graph/NN ,/, the/DT translation/NN of/IN logic/NN programs/NNS to/IN SAT/NNP can/MD be/VB expensive/JJ for/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN solving/VBG inference/NN tasks/NNS ./.
