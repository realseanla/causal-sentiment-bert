We/PRP show/VBP that/IN Langevin/NNP MCMC/NNP inference/NN in/IN an/DT energy/NN -/HYPH based/VBN model/NN with/IN latent/JJ variables/NNS has/VBZ the/DT property/NN that/IN the/DT early/JJ steps/NNS of/IN inference/NN ,/, starting/VBG from/IN a/DT stationary/JJ point/NN ,/, correspond/VBP to/IN propagating/VBG error/NN gradients/NNS into/IN internal/JJ layers/NNS ,/, similarly/RB to/TO back/RB -/HYPH propagation/NN ./.
