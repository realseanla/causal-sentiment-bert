A/DT significant/JJ performance/NN reduction/NN is/VBZ often/RB observed/VBN in/IN speech/NN recognition/NN when/WRB the/DT rate/NN of/IN speech/NN (/-LRB- ROS/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ too/RB low/JJ or/CC too/RB high/JJ ./.
Most/JJS of/IN present/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN addressing/VBG the/DT ROS/NNP variation/NN focus/NN on/IN the/DT change/NN of/IN speech/NN signals/NNS in/IN dynamic/JJ properties/NNS caused/VBN by/IN ROS/NNP ,/, and/CC accordingly/RB modify/VB the/DT dynamic/JJ model/NN ,/, e.g./FW ,/, the/DT transition/NN probabilities/NNS of/IN the/DT hidden/JJ Markov/NNP model/NN (/-LRB- HMM/NN )/-RRB- ./.
However/RB ,/, an/DT abnormal/JJ ROS/NN changes/NNS not/RB only/RB the/DT dynamic/JJ but/CC also/RB the/DT static/JJ property/NN of/IN speech/NN signals/NNS ,/, and/CC thus/RB can/MD not/RB be/VB compensated/VBN for/IN purely/RB by/IN modifying/VBG the/DT dynamic/JJ model/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ an/DT ROS/NN learning/NN approach/NN based/VBN on/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT involves/VBZ an/DT ROS/NN feature/NN as/IN the/DT input/NN of/IN the/DT DNN/NNP model/NN and/CC so/IN the/DT spectrum/NN distortion/NN caused/VBN by/IN ROS/NNP can/MD be/VB learned/VBN and/CC compensated/VBN for/IN ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN this/DT approach/NN can/MD deliver/VB better/JJR performance/NN for/IN too/RB slow/JJ and/CC too/RB fast/JJ utterances/NNS ,/, demonstrating/VBG our/PRP$ conjecture/NN that/IN ROS/NN impacts/NNS both/CC the/DT dynamic/JJ and/CC the/DT static/JJ property/NN of/IN speech/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN can/MD be/VB combined/VBN with/IN the/DT conventional/JJ HMM/NN transition/NN adaptation/NN method/NN ,/, offering/VBG additional/JJ performance/NN gains/NNS ./.
