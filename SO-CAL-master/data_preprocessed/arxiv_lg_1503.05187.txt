Random/NNP Forest/NNP (/-LRB- RF/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ an/DT ensemble/NN classification/NN technique/NN that/WDT was/VBD developed/VBN by/IN Breiman/NNP over/IN a/DT decade/NN ago/RB ./.
Compared/VBN with/IN other/JJ ensemble/NN techniques/NNS ,/, it/PRP has/VBZ proved/VBN its/PRP$ accuracy/NN and/CC superiority/NN ./.
Many/JJ researchers/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, believe/VBP that/IN there/EX is/VBZ still/RB room/NN for/IN enhancing/VBG and/CC improving/VBG its/PRP$ performance/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN predictive/JJ accuracy/NN ./.
This/DT explains/VBZ why/WRB ,/, over/IN the/DT past/JJ decade/NN ,/, there/EX have/VBP been/VBN many/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN RF/NN where/WRB each/DT extension/NN employed/VBN a/DT variety/NN of/IN techniques/NNS and/CC strategies/NNS to/TO improve/VB certain/JJ aspect/NN (/-LRB- s/AFX )/-RRB- of/IN RF/NN ./.
Since/IN it/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN proven/VBN empirically/RB that/IN ensembles/NNS tend/VBP to/TO yield/VB better/JJR results/NNS when/WRB there/EX is/VBZ a/DT significant/JJ diversity/NN among/IN the/DT constituent/JJ models/NNS ,/, the/DT objective/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ twofolds/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, it/PRP investigates/VBZ how/WRB an/DT unsupervised/JJ learning/NN technique/NN ,/, namely/RB ,/, Local/JJ Outlier/NN Factor/NN (/-LRB- LOF/NN )/-RRB- can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO identify/VB diverse/JJ trees/NNS in/IN the/DT RF/NN ./.
Second/RB ,/, trees/NNS with/IN the/DT highest/JJS LOF/NN scores/NNS are/VBP then/RB used/VBN to/TO produce/VB an/DT extension/NN of/IN RF/NNP termed/VBN LOFB/NN -/HYPH DRF/NN that/WDT is/VBZ much/RB smaller/JJR in/IN size/NN than/IN RF/NN ,/, and/CC yet/RB performs/VBZ at/IN least/JJS as/IN good/JJ as/IN RF/NN ,/, but/CC mostly/RB exhibits/VBZ higher/JJR performance/NN in/IN terms/NNS of/IN accuracy/NN ./.
The/DT latter/JJ refers/VBZ to/IN a/DT known/VBN technique/NN called/VBN ensemble/NN pruning/NN ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS on/IN 10/CD real/JJ datasets/NNS prove/VBP the/DT superiority/NN of/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN extension/NN over/IN the/DT traditional/JJ RF/NN ./.
Unprecedented/JJ pruning/NN levels/NNS reaching/VBG 99/CD percent/NN have/VBP been/VBN achieved/VBN at/IN the/DT time/NN of/IN boosting/VBG the/DT predictive/JJ accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT ensemble/NN ./.
The/DT notably/RB high/JJ pruning/NN level/NN makes/VBZ the/DT technique/NN a/DT good/JJ candidate/NN for/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN applications/NNS ./.
