In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ genetic/JJ algorithm/NN (/-LRB- GA/NN )/-RRB- solution/NN to/IN a/DT simple/JJ yet/RB challenging/JJ commercial/JJ puzzle/NN game/NN known/VBN as/IN the/DT Zen/NNP Puzzle/NNP Garden/NNP (/-LRB- ZPG/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP describe/VBP the/DT game/NN in/IN detail/NN ,/, before/IN presenting/VBG a/DT suitable/JJ encoding/VBG scheme/NN and/CC fitness/NN function/NN for/IN candidate/NN solutions/NNS ./.
