Recently/RB Kutin/NNP and/CC Niyogi/NNP investigated/VBD several/JJ notions/NNS of/IN algorithmic/JJ stability/NN --/: a/DT property/NN of/IN a/DT learning/NN map/NN conceptually/RB similar/JJ to/IN continuity/NN --/: showing/VBG that/IN training/NN -/HYPH stability/NN is/VBZ sufficient/JJ for/IN consistency/NN of/IN Empirical/JJ Risk/NN Minimization/NN while/IN distribution/NN -/HYPH free/JJ CV/NN -/HYPH stability/NN is/VBZ necessary/JJ and/CC sufficient/JJ for/IN having/VBG finite/NN VC/NNP -/HYPH dimension/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN concerns/VBZ a/DT phase/NN transition/NN in/IN the/DT training/NN stability/NN of/IN ERM/NNP ,/, conjectured/VBN by/IN the/DT same/JJ authors/NNS ./.
Kutin/NNP and/CC Niyogi/NNP proved/VBD that/IN ERM/NNP on/IN finite/JJ hypothesis/NN spaces/NNS containing/VBG a/DT unique/JJ risk/NN minimizer/NN has/VBZ training/NN stability/NN that/WDT scales/VBZ exponentially/RB with/IN sample/NN size/NN ,/, and/CC conjectured/VBD that/IN the/DT existence/NN of/IN multiple/JJ risk/NN minimizers/NNS prevents/VBZ even/RB super-quadratic/JJ convergence/NN ./.
We/PRP prove/VBP this/DT result/NN for/IN the/DT strictly/RB weaker/JJR notion/NN of/IN CV/NN -/HYPH stability/NN ,/, positively/RB resolving/VBG the/DT conjecture/NN ./.
