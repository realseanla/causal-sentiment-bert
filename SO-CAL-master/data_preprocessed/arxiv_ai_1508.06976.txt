This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN predicting/VBG the/DT k/NN events/NNS that/WDT are/VBP most/RBS likely/JJ to/TO occur/VB next/RB ,/, over/IN historical/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN event/NN streams/NNS ./.
Existing/VBG approaches/NNS to/IN causal/JJ prediction/NN queries/NNS have/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN limitations/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, they/PRP exhaustively/RB search/VB over/IN an/DT acyclic/JJ causal/JJ network/NN to/TO find/VB the/DT most/RBS likely/JJ k/NN effect/NN events/NNS ;/: however/RB ,/, data/NNS from/IN real/JJ event/NN streams/NNS frequently/RB reflect/VBP cyclic/JJ causality/NN ./.
Second/RB ,/, they/PRP contain/VBP conservative/JJ assumptions/NNS intended/VBN to/TO exclude/VB all/DT possible/JJ non-causal/JJ links/NNS in/IN the/DT causal/JJ network/NN ;/: it/PRP leads/VBZ to/IN the/DT omission/NN of/IN many/JJ less/JJR -/HYPH frequent/JJ but/CC important/JJ causal/JJ links/NNS ./.
We/PRP overcome/VBP these/DT limitations/NNS by/IN proposing/VBG a/DT novel/JJ event/NN precedence/NN model/NN and/CC a/DT run/NN -/HYPH time/NN causal/JJ inference/NN mechanism/NN ./.
The/DT event/NN precedence/NN model/NN constructs/NNS a/DT first/JJ order/NN absorbing/VBG Markov/NNP chain/NN incrementally/RB over/IN event/NN streams/NNS ,/, where/WRB an/DT edge/NN between/IN two/CD events/NNS signifies/VBZ a/DT temporal/JJ precedence/NN relationship/NN between/IN them/PRP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ a/DT necessary/JJ condition/NN for/IN causality/NN ./.
Then/RB ,/, the/DT run/NN -/HYPH time/NN causal/JJ inference/NN mechanism/NN learns/VBZ causal/JJ relationships/NNS dynamically/RB during/IN query/NN processing/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ done/VBN by/IN removing/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT temporal/JJ precedence/NN relationships/NNS that/WDT do/VBP not/RB exhibit/VB causality/NN in/IN the/DT presence/NN of/IN other/JJ events/NNS in/IN the/DT event/NN precedence/NN model/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ two/CD query/NN processing/NN algorithms/NNS --/: one/CD performs/VBZ exhaustive/JJ search/NN on/IN the/DT model/NN and/CC the/DT other/JJ performs/VBZ a/DT more/RBR efficient/JJ reduced/VBN search/NN with/IN early/JJ termination/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS using/VBG two/CD real/JJ datasets/NNS (/-LRB- cascading/VBG blackouts/NNS in/IN power/NN systems/NNS and/CC web/NN page/NN views/NNS )/-RRB- verify/VBP the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT probabilistic/JJ top/NN -/HYPH k/NN prediction/NN queries/NNS and/CC the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT algorithms/NNS ./.
Specifically/RB ,/, the/DT reduced/VBN search/NN algorithm/NN reduced/VBN runtime/NN ,/, relative/JJ to/IN exhaustive/JJ search/NN ,/, by/IN 25/CD -/SYM 80/CD percent/NN (/-LRB- depending/VBG on/IN the/DT application/NN )/-RRB- with/IN only/RB a/DT small/JJ reduction/NN in/IN accuracy/NN ./.
