Traditional/JJ Artificial/NNP Cognitive/NNP Systems/NNPS (/-LRB- for/IN example/NN ,/, intelligent/JJ robots/NNS )/-RRB- share/VBP a/DT number/NN of/IN limitations/NNS ./.
First/RB ,/, they/PRP are/VBP usually/RB made/VBN up/RP only/RB of/IN machine/NN components/NNS ;/: humans/NNS are/VBP only/RB playing/VBG the/DT role/NN of/IN user/NN or/CC supervisor/NN ./.
