Computerized/JJ adaptive/JJ testing/NN (/-LRB- CAT/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ an/DT interesting/JJ and/CC promising/JJ approach/NN to/IN testing/VBG human/JJ abilities/NNS ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ research/NN we/PRP use/VBP Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS to/TO create/VB a/DT model/NN of/IN tested/VBN humans/NNS ./.
We/PRP collected/VBD data/NNS from/IN paper/NN tests/NNS performed/VBN with/IN grammar/NN school/NN students/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT article/NN we/PRP first/RB provide/VBP the/DT summary/NN of/IN data/NNS used/VBN for/IN our/PRP$ experiments/NNS ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP several/JJ different/JJ Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS ,/, which/WDT we/PRP tested/VBD and/CC compared/VBN by/IN cross-validation/NN ./.
