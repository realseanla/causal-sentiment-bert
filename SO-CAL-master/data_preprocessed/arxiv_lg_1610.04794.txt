Most/JJS learning/NN approaches/NNS treat/VBP dimensionality/NN reduction/NN (/-LRB- DR/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC clustering/NN separately/RB (/-LRB- i.e./FW ,/, sequentially/RB )/-RRB- ,/, but/CC recent/JJ research/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN optimizing/VBG the/DT two/CD tasks/NNS jointly/RB can/MD substantially/RB improve/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN both/DT ./.
The/DT premise/NN behind/IN the/DT latter/JJ genre/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT data/NNS samples/NNS are/VBP obtained/VBN via/IN linear/JJ transformation/NN of/IN latent/JJ representations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP easy/JJ to/TO cluster/VB ;/: but/CC in/IN practice/NN ,/, the/DT transformation/NN from/IN the/DT latent/JJ space/NN to/IN the/DT data/NNS can/MD be/VB more/RBR complicated/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP assume/VBP that/IN this/DT transformation/NN is/VBZ an/DT unknown/JJ and/CC possibly/RB nonlinear/JJ function/NN ./.
To/TO recover/VB the/DT `/`` clustering/NN -/HYPH friendly/JJ '/'' latent/JJ representations/NNS and/CC to/TO better/RBR cluster/VB the/DT data/NNS ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT joint/JJ DR/NNP and/CC K/NNP -/HYPH means/VBZ clustering/NN approach/NN in/IN which/WDT DR/NNP is/VBZ accomplished/VBN via/IN learning/VBG a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT motivation/NN is/VBZ to/TO keep/VB the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN jointly/RB optimizing/VBG the/DT two/CD tasks/NNS ,/, while/IN exploiting/VBG the/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN 's/POS ability/NN to/TO approximate/VB any/DT nonlinear/JJ function/NN ./.
This/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN can/MD work/VB well/RB for/IN a/DT broad/JJ class/NN of/IN generative/JJ models/NNS ./.
Towards/IN this/DT end/NN ,/, we/PRP carefully/RB design/VB the/DT DNN/NNP structure/NN and/CC the/DT associated/VBN joint/NN optimization/NN criterion/NN ,/, and/CC propose/VB an/DT effective/JJ and/CC scalable/JJ algorithm/NN to/TO handle/VB the/DT formulated/VBN optimization/NN problem/NN ./.
