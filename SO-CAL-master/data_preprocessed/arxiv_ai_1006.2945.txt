A/DT combined/VBN Short/JJ -/HYPH Term/NN Learning/NN (/-LRB- STL/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Long/JJ -/HYPH Term/NN Learning/NN (/-LRB- LTL/NN )/-RRB- approach/NN to/IN solving/VBG mobile/JJ -/HYPH robot/NN navigation/NN problems/NNS is/VBZ presented/VBN and/CC tested/VBN in/IN both/CC the/DT real/JJ and/CC virtual/JJ domains/NNS ./.
The/DT LTL/NN phase/NN consists/VBZ of/IN rapid/JJ simulations/NNS that/WDT use/VBP a/DT Genetic/JJ Algorithm/NN to/TO derive/VB diverse/JJ sets/NNS of/IN behaviours/NNS ,/, encoded/VBN as/IN variable/JJ sets/NNS of/IN attributes/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT STL/NNP phase/NN is/VBZ an/DT idiotypic/JJ Artificial/NNP Immune/NNP System/NNP ./.
