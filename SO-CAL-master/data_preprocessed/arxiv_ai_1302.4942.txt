Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS provide/VBP a/DT method/NN of/IN representing/VBG conditional/JJ independence/NN between/IN random/JJ variables/NNS and/CC computing/VBG the/DT probability/NN distributions/NNS associated/VBN with/IN these/DT random/JJ variables/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP extend/VBP Bayesian/JJ network/NN structures/NNS to/TO compute/VB probability/NN density/NN functions/VBZ for/IN continuous/JJ random/JJ variables/NNS ./.
We/PRP make/VBP this/DT extension/NN by/IN approximating/VBG prior/JJ and/CC conditional/JJ densities/NNS using/VBG sums/NNS of/IN weighted/JJ Gaussian/JJ distributions/NNS and/CC then/RB finding/VBG the/DT propagation/NN rules/NNS for/IN updating/VBG the/DT densities/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN these/DT weights/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT simple/JJ example/NN that/WDT illustrates/VBZ the/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN for/IN continuous/JJ variables/NNS ;/: this/DT example/NN shows/VBZ the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN structure/NN and/CC approximation/NN errors/NNS on/IN the/DT computation/NN of/IN densities/NNS for/IN variables/NNS in/IN the/DT network/NN ./.
