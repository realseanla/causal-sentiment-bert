Previous/JJ research/NN into/IN the/DT relation/NN between/IN ASP/NN and/CC classical/JJ logic/NN has/VBZ identified/VBN at/IN least/RBS two/CD different/JJ ways/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT former/JJ extends/VBZ the/DT latter/JJ ./.
First/RB ,/, ASP/NN program/NN typically/RB contain/VBP sets/NNS of/IN rules/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB naturally/RB interpreted/VBN as/IN inductive/JJ definitions/NNS ,/, and/CC the/DT language/NN FO/NN (/-LRB- ID/NN )/-RRB- has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN such/JJ inductive/JJ definitions/NNS can/MD elegantly/RB be/VB added/VBN to/IN classical/JJ logic/NN in/IN a/DT modular/JJ way/NN ./.
Second/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ of/IN course/NN also/RB the/DT well/NN -/HYPH known/VBN epistemic/JJ component/NN of/IN ASP/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD mainly/RB emphasized/VBN in/IN the/DT early/JJ papers/NNS on/IN stable/JJ model/NN semantics/NNS ./.
To/TO investigate/VB whether/IN this/DT kind/NN of/IN knowledge/NN can/MD also/RB ,/, and/CC in/IN a/DT similarly/RB modular/JJ way/NN ,/, be/VB added/VBN to/IN classical/JJ logic/NN ,/, the/DT language/NN of/IN Ordered/VBN Epistemic/NNP Logic/NNP was/VBD presented/VBN in/IN recent/JJ work/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT logic/NN views/VBZ the/DT epistemic/JJ component/NN as/IN entirely/RB separate/JJ from/IN the/DT inductive/JJ definition/NN component/NN ,/, thus/RB ignoring/VBG any/DT possible/JJ interplay/NN between/IN the/DT two/CD ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT language/NN that/WDT extends/VBZ the/DT inductive/JJ definition/NN construct/NN found/VBN in/IN FO/NN (/-LRB- ID/NN )/-RRB- with/IN an/DT epistemic/JJ component/NN ,/, making/VBG such/JJ interplay/NN possible/JJ ./.
The/DT eventual/JJ goal/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ to/TO discover/VB whether/IN it/PRP is/VBZ really/RB appropriate/JJ to/TO view/VB the/DT epistemic/JJ component/NN and/CC the/DT inductive/JJ definition/NN component/NN of/IN ASP/NN as/IN two/CD separate/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN classical/JJ logic/NN ,/, or/CC whether/IN there/EX is/VBZ also/RB something/NN of/IN importance/NN in/IN the/DT combination/NN of/IN the/DT two/CD ./.
