The/DT literature/NN on/IN judgment/NN aggregation/NN has/VBZ now/RB been/VBN moving/VBG from/IN studying/VBG impossibility/NN results/NNS regarding/VBG aggregation/NN rules/NNS towards/IN studying/VBG specific/JJ judgment/NN aggregation/NN rules/NNS ./.
Here/RB we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN a/DT family/NN of/IN rules/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ the/DT natural/JJ counterpart/NN of/IN the/DT family/NN of/IN Condorcet/NNP -/HYPH consistent/JJ voting/NN rules/NNS :/: majority/NN -/HYPH preserving/VBG judgment/NN aggregation/NN rules/NNS ./.
A/DT judgment/NN aggregation/NN rule/NN is/VBZ majority/NN -/HYPH preserving/VBG if/IN whenever/WRB issue-wise/RB majority/NN is/VBZ consistent/JJ ,/, the/DT rule/NN should/MD output/NN the/DT majoritarian/JJ opinion/NN on/IN each/DT issue/NN ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP a/DT formal/JJ setting/NN for/IN relating/VBG judgment/NN aggregation/NN rules/NNS to/IN voting/NN rules/NNS and/CC propose/VB some/DT basic/JJ properties/NNS for/IN judgment/NN aggregation/NN rules/NNS ./.
We/PRP consider/VBP six/CD such/JJ rules/NNS some/DT of/IN which/WDT have/VBP already/RB appeared/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN ,/, some/DT others/NNS are/VBP new/JJ ./.
For/IN these/DT rules/NNS we/PRP consider/VBP their/PRP$ relation/NN to/IN known/VBN voting/NN rules/NNS ,/, to/IN each/DT other/JJ ,/, with/IN respect/NN to/IN their/PRP$ discriminating/JJ power/NN ,/, and/CC analyse/VB them/PRP with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT considered/VBN properties/NNS ./.
