This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/IN the/DT long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN tracking/NN of/IN an/DT object/NN in/IN a/DT challenging/JJ environment/NN ./.
The/DT object/NN is/VBZ a/DT cow/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN is/VBZ an/DT enclosure/NN in/IN a/DT cowshed/JJ ./.
Some/DT of/IN the/DT key/JJ challenges/NNS in/IN this/DT domain/NN are/VBP a/DT cluttered/JJ background/NN ,/, low/JJ contrast/NN and/CC high/JJ similarity/NN between/IN moving/VBG objects/NNS which/WDT greatly/RB reduces/VBZ the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN most/JJS existing/VBG approaches/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT based/VBN on/IN background/NN subtraction/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ split/VBN into/IN object/NN localization/NN ,/, instance/NN segmentation/NN ,/, learning/NN and/CC tracking/NN stages/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ solution/NN is/VBZ compared/VBN to/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN semi-supervised/JJ object/NN tracking/VBG algorithms/NNS and/CC we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT performance/NN is/VBZ strong/JJ and/CC well/RB suited/JJ to/IN subsequent/JJ analysis/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP our/PRP$ solution/NN as/IN a/DT first/JJ step/NN towards/IN broader/JJR tracking/NN and/CC behavior/NN monitoring/NN for/IN cows/NNS in/IN precision/NN agriculture/NN with/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ objective/NN of/IN early/JJ detection/NN of/IN lameness/NN ./.
