This/DT paper/NN introduces/VBZ a/DT robust/JJ learning/NN scheme/NN that/WDT can/MD dynamically/RB predict/VB the/DT stability/NN of/IN the/DT reconnection/NN of/IN sub-networks/NNS to/IN a/DT main/JJ grid/NN ./.
As/IN the/DT future/JJ electrical/JJ power/NN systems/NNS tend/VBP towards/IN smarter/JJR and/CC greener/JJR technology/NN ,/, the/DT deployment/NN of/IN self/NN sufficient/JJ networks/NNS ,/, or/CC microgrids/NNS ,/, becomes/VBZ more/RBR likely/JJ ./.
Microgrids/NNS may/MD operate/VB on/IN their/PRP$ own/JJ or/CC synchronized/VBN with/IN the/DT main/JJ grid/NN ,/, thus/RB control/NN methods/NNS need/VBP to/TO take/VB into/IN account/NN islanding/NN and/CC reconnecting/NN said/VBD networks/NNS ./.
The/DT ability/NN to/TO optimally/RB and/CC safely/RB reconnect/VB a/DT portion/NN of/IN the/DT grid/NN is/VBZ not/RB well/RB understood/VBN and/CC ,/, as/IN of/IN now/RB ,/, limited/VBN to/IN raw/JJ synchronization/NN between/IN interconnection/NN points/NNS ./.
