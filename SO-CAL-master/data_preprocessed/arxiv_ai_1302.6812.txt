This/DT paper/NN discusses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN abstracting/VBG conditional/JJ probabilistic/JJ actions/NNS ./.
We/PRP identify/VBP two/CD distinct/JJ types/NNS of/IN abstraction/NN :/: intra-action/JJ abstraction/NN and/CC inter-action/NN abstraction/NN ./.
We/PRP define/VBP what/WP it/PRP means/VBZ for/IN the/DT abstraction/NN of/IN an/DT action/NN to/TO be/VB correct/JJ and/CC then/RB derive/VBP two/CD methods/NNS of/IN intra-action/JJ abstraction/NN and/CC two/CD methods/NNS of/IN inter-action/NN abstraction/NN which/WDT are/VBP correct/JJ according/VBG to/IN this/DT criterion/NN ./.
We/PRP illustrate/VBP the/DT developed/JJ techniques/NNS by/IN applying/VBG them/PRP to/IN actions/NNS described/VBN with/IN the/DT temporal/JJ action/NN representation/NN used/VBN in/IN the/DT DRIPS/NNP decision/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ planner/NN and/CC we/PRP describe/VBP how/WRB the/DT planner/NN uses/VBZ abstraction/NN to/TO reduce/VB the/DT complexity/NN of/IN planning/NN ./.
