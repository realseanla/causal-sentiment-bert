Maintenance/NN of/IN association/NN rules/NNS is/VBZ an/DT interesting/JJ problem/NN ./.
Several/JJ incremental/JJ maintenance/NN algorithms/NNS were/VBD proposed/VBN since/IN the/DT work/NN of/IN (/-LRB- Cheung/NNP et/FW al/FW ,/, 1996/CD )/-RRB- ./.
The/DT majority/NN of/IN these/DT algorithms/NNS maintain/VBP rule/NN bases/NNS assuming/VBG that/IN support/NN threshold/NN does/VBZ n't/RB change/VB ./.
