The/DT long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN memory/NN of/IN most/JJS connectionist/JJ systems/NNS lies/VBZ entirely/RB in/IN the/DT weights/NNS of/IN the/DT system/NN ./.
Since/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN weights/NNS is/VBZ typically/RB fixed/VBN ,/, this/DT bounds/VBZ the/DT total/JJ amount/NN of/IN knowledge/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB learned/VBN and/CC stored/VBN ./.
