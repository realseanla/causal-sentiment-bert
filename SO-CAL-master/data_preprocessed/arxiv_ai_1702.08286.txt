Balancing/VBG fairness/NN and/CC efficiency/NN in/IN resource/NN allocation/NN is/VBZ a/DT classical/JJ economic/JJ and/CC computational/JJ problem/NN ./.
The/DT price/NN of/IN fairness/NN measures/NNS the/DT worst/RBS -/HYPH case/NN loss/NN of/IN economic/JJ efficiency/NN when/WRB using/VBG an/DT inefficient/JJ but/CC fair/JJ allocation/NN rule/NN ;/: for/IN indivisible/JJ goods/NNS in/IN many/JJ settings/NNS ,/, this/DT price/NN is/VBZ unacceptably/RB high/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT hybrid/NN fairness/NN rule/NN that/WDT balances/VBZ a/DT strict/JJ lexicographic/JJ preference/NN ordering/VBG over/IN classes/NNS of/IN agents/NNS and/CC a/DT utilitarian/JJ objective/NN that/WDT maximizes/VBZ economic/JJ efficiency/NN ./.
We/PRP develop/VBP a/DT utility/NN function/NN that/WDT favors/VBZ disadvantaged/JJ groups/NNS lexicographically/RB ;/: but/CC if/IN cost/NN to/IN overall/JJ efficiency/NN becomes/VBZ too/RB high/JJ ,/, it/PRP smoothly/RB switches/VBZ to/IN a/DT utilitarian/JJ objective/NN ./.
This/DT rule/NN has/VBZ only/RB one/CD parameter/NN which/WDT is/VBZ proportional/JJ to/IN a/DT bound/VBN on/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN fairness/NN ,/, and/CC can/MD be/VB adjusted/VBN by/IN policymakers/NNS ./.
We/PRP apply/VBP this/DT rule/NN to/IN kidney/NN exchange/NN ,/, where/WRB needy/JJ patients/NNS swap/VBP willing/JJ but/CC incompatible/JJ donors/NNS ,/, and/CC demonstrate/VBP on/IN real/JJ data/NNS from/IN a/DT large/JJ exchange/NN that/WDT our/PRP$ hybrid/NN rule/NN produces/VBZ more/JJR reliable/JJ outcomes/NNS than/IN other/JJ fairness/NN rules/NNS ./.
