In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP investigate/VBP the/DT extent/NN to/TO which/WDT features/VBZ derived/VBN from/IN bank/NN statements/NNS provided/VBN by/IN loan/NN applicants/NNS ,/, and/CC which/WDT are/VBP not/RB declared/VBN on/IN an/DT application/NN form/NN ,/, can/MD enhance/VB a/DT credit/NN scoring/VBG model/NN for/IN a/DT New/NNP Zealand/NNP lending/VBG company/NN ./.

We/PRP construct/VBP a/DT baseline/NN model/NN based/VBN solely/RB on/IN the/DT existing/VBG scoring/NN features/NNS obtained/VBN from/IN the/DT loan/NN application/NN form/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT second/JJ baseline/NN model/NN based/VBN solely/RB on/IN the/DT new/JJ bank/NN statement/NN -/HYPH derived/VBN features/NNS ./.
