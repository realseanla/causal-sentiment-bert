We/PRP proposed/VBD a/DT method/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ a/DT trust/NN computation/NN which/WDT is/VBZ previously/RB subjective/JJ and/CC incomputable/JJ ./.
An/DT example/NN of/IN case/NN study/NN for/IN the/DT trust/NN computation/NN is/VBZ the/DT United/NNP States/NNP of/IN America/NNP Great/NNP Britain/NNP relations/NNS ./.
