Software/NNP aging/NN is/VBZ a/DT phenomenon/NN that/WDT refers/VBZ to/IN progressive/JJ performance/NN degradation/NN or/CC transient/JJ failures/NNS or/CC even/RB crashes/VBZ in/IN long/JJ running/NN software/NN systems/NNS such/JJ as/IN web/NN servers/NNS ./.
It/PRP mainly/RB occurs/VBZ due/IN to/IN the/DT deterioration/NN of/IN operating/VBG system/NN resource/NN ,/, fragmentation/NN and/CC numerical/JJ error/NN accumulation/NN ./.
A/DT primitive/JJ method/NN to/TO fight/VB against/IN software/NN aging/NN is/VBZ software/NN rejuvenation/NN ./.
Software/NNP rejuvenation/NN is/VBZ a/DT proactive/JJ fault/NN management/NN technique/NN aimed/VBN at/IN cleaning/VBG up/RP the/DT system/NN internal/JJ state/NN to/TO prevent/VB the/DT occurrence/NN of/IN more/RBR severe/JJ crash/NN failures/NNS in/IN the/DT future/NN ./.
It/PRP involves/VBZ occasionally/RB stopping/VBG the/DT running/NN software/NN ,/, cleaning/VBG its/PRP$ internal/JJ state/NN and/CC restarting/VBG it/PRP ./.
An/DT optimized/VBN schedule/NN for/IN performing/VBG the/DT software/NN rejuvenation/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB derived/VBN in/IN advance/NN because/IN a/DT long/JJ running/NN application/NN could/MD not/RB be/VB put/VBN down/RP now/RB and/CC then/RB as/IN it/PRP may/MD lead/VB to/IN waste/NN of/IN cost/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ a/DT method/NN to/TO derive/VB an/DT accurate/JJ and/CC optimized/VBN schedule/NN for/IN rejuvenation/NN of/IN a/DT web/NN server/NN (/-LRB- Apache/NNP )/-RRB- by/IN using/VBG Radial/NNP Basis/NN Function/NN (/-LRB- RBF/NN )/-RRB- based/VBN Feed/VB Forward/NNP Neural/JJ Network/NN ,/, a/DT variant/NN of/IN Artificial/NNP Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- ANN/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
Aging/NN indicators/NNS are/VBP obtained/VBN through/IN experimental/JJ setup/NN involving/VBG Apache/NNP web/NN server/NN and/CC clients/NNS ,/, which/WDT acts/VBZ as/IN input/NN to/IN the/DT neural/JJ network/NN model/NN ./.
This/DT method/NN is/VBZ better/JJR than/IN existing/VBG ones/NNS because/IN usage/NN of/IN RBF/NNP leads/VBZ to/IN better/JJR accuracy/NN and/CC speed/NN in/IN convergence/NN ./.
