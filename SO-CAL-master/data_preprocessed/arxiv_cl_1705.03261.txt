Drug/NN -/HYPH drug/NN interaction/NN (/-LRB- DDI/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT vital/JJ information/NN when/WRB physicians/NNS and/CC pharmacists/NNS prepare/VBP for/IN the/DT combined/VBN use/NN of/IN two/CD or/CC more/JJR drugs/NNS ./.
Thus/RB ,/, several/JJ DDI/NNP databases/NNS are/VBP constructed/VBN to/TO avoid/VB mistakenly/RB medicine/NN administering/VBG ./.
In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ,/, automatically/RB extracting/VBG DDIs/NNS from/IN biomedical/JJ text/NN has/VBZ drawn/VBN researchers/NNS '/POS attention/NN ./.

Inspired/VBN by/IN the/DT deep/JJ learning/NN approaches/NNS in/IN natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN model/NN with/IN multiple/JJ attention/NN layers/NNS for/IN DDI/NNP classification/NN ./.
