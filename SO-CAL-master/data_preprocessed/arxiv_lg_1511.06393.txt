In/IN recent/JJ years/NNS increasingly/RB complex/JJ architectures/NNS for/IN deep/JJ convolution/NN networks/NNS (/-LRB- DCNs/NNS )/-RRB- have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO boost/VB the/DT performance/NN on/IN image/NN recognition/NN tasks/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT gains/NNS in/IN performance/NN have/VBP come/VBN at/IN a/DT cost/NN of/IN substantial/JJ increase/NN in/IN compute/VB resources/NNS ,/, the/DT model/NN size/NN and/CC processing/NN speed/NN of/IN the/DT network/NN for/IN training/NN and/CC evaluation/NN ./.
Fixed/VBN point/NN implementation/NN of/IN these/DT networks/NNS has/VBZ the/DT potential/JJ to/TO alleviate/VB some/DT of/IN the/DT burden/NN of/IN these/DT additional/JJ complexities/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT quantizer/NN design/NN for/IN fixed/VBN point/NN implementation/NN for/IN DCNs/NNS ./.
We/PRP then/RB formulate/VB an/DT optimization/NN problem/NN to/TO identify/VB optimal/JJ fixed/JJ point/NN bit/NN -/HYPH width/NN allocation/NN across/IN DCN/NNP layers/NNS ./.
We/PRP perform/VBP experiments/NNS on/IN a/DT recently/RB proposed/VBN DCN/NNP architecture/NN for/IN CIFAR/NN -/HYPH 10/CD benchmark/NN that/WDT generates/VBZ test/NN error/NN of/IN less/JJR than/IN 7/CD percent/NN ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN fixed/VBN point/NN bit/NN -/HYPH width/NN allocation/NN for/IN this/DT DCN/NNP ./.
Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN in/IN comparison/NN to/IN equal/JJ bit/NN -/HYPH width/NN settings/NNS ,/, the/DT fixed/VBN point/NN DCNs/NNS with/IN optimized/VBN bit/NN width/NN allocation/NN offer/NN &gt;/SYM 20/CD percent/NN reduction/NN in/IN the/DT model/NN size/NN without/IN any/DT loss/NN in/IN performance/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB demonstrate/VBP that/IN fine/JJ tuning/NN can/MD further/RB enhance/VB the/DT accuracy/NN of/IN fixed/VBN point/NN DCNs/NNS beyond/IN that/DT of/IN the/DT original/JJ floating/NN point/NN model/NN ./.
In/IN doing/VBG so/RB ,/, we/PRP report/VBP a/DT new/JJ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN fixed/VBN point/NN performance/NN of/IN 6.78/CD percent/NN error/NN -/HYPH rate/NN on/IN CIFAR/NN -/HYPH 10/CD benchmark/NN ./.
