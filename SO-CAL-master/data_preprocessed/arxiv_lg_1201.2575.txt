For/IN a/DT large/JJ multi-hop/JJ wireless/JJ network/NN ,/, nodes/NNS are/VBP preferable/JJ to/TO make/VB distributed/VBN and/CC localized/VBN link/NN -/HYPH scheduling/NN decisions/NNS with/IN only/JJ interactions/NNS among/IN a/DT small/JJ number/NN of/IN neighbors/NNS ./.

A/DT question/NN arises/VBZ how/WRB to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT information/NN outside/IN a/DT neighborhood/NN in/IN distributed/VBN link/NN -/HYPH scheduling/NN ./.

The/DT approximated/VBN information/NN outside/IN a/DT neighborhood/NN is/VBZ incorporated/VBN in/IN a/DT factor/NN graph/NN ./.
This/DT results/VBZ in/IN joint/JJ approximation/NN and/CC distributed/VBN link/NN -/HYPH scheduling/NN in/IN an/DT iterative/JJ fashion/NN ./.
Link/NN -/HYPH scheduling/NN decisions/NNS are/VBP first/JJ made/VBN at/IN each/DT individual/JJ node/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT approximated/VBN loss/NN variables/NNS ./.
Loss/NN variables/NNS are/VBP then/RB updated/VBN and/CC used/VBN for/IN next/JJ link/NN -/HYPH scheduling/NN decisions/NNS ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN repeats/NNS between/IN these/DT two/CD phases/NNS until/IN convergence/NN ./.
Interactive/JJ iterations/NNS among/IN these/DT variables/NNS are/VBP implemented/VBN with/IN a/DT message/NN -/HYPH passing/VBG algorithm/NN over/IN a/DT factor/NN graph/NN ./.
Simulation/NNP results/NNS show/VBP that/IN using/VBG learned/VBN information/NN outside/IN a/DT neighborhood/NN jointly/RB with/IN distributed/VBN link/NN -/HYPH scheduling/NN reduces/VBZ the/DT outage/NN probability/NN close/NN to/IN zero/CD even/RB for/IN a/DT small/JJ neighborhood/NN ./.
