In/IN existing/JJ works/NNS that/WDT learn/VBP representation/NN for/IN object/NN detection/NN ,/, the/DT relationship/NN between/IN a/DT candidate/NN window/NN and/CC the/DT ground/NN truth/NN bounding/VBG box/NN of/IN an/DT object/NN is/VBZ simplified/VBN by/IN thresholding/VBG their/PRP$ overlap/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN shows/VBZ information/NN loss/NN in/IN this/DT simplification/NN and/CC picks/VBZ up/RP the/DT relative/JJ location/NN //HYPH size/NN information/NN discarded/VBN by/IN thresholding/VBG ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT representation/NN learning/VBG pipeline/NN to/TO use/VB the/DT relationship/NN as/IN supervision/NN for/IN improving/VBG the/DT learned/VBN representation/NN in/IN object/NN detection/NN ./.
Such/JJ relationship/NN is/VBZ not/RB limited/VBN to/IN object/NN of/IN the/DT target/NN category/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB includes/VBZ surrounding/VBG objects/NNS of/IN other/JJ categories/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN image/NN regions/NNS with/IN multiple/JJ contexts/NNS and/CC multiple/JJ rotations/NNS are/VBP effective/JJ in/IN capturing/VBG such/JJ relationship/NN during/IN the/DT representation/NN learning/NN process/NN and/CC in/IN handling/VBG the/DT semantic/JJ and/CC visual/JJ variation/NN caused/VBN by/IN different/JJ window/NN -/HYPH object/NN configurations/NNS ./.

On/IN the/DT challenging/JJ ILSVRC2014/NN test/NN dataset/NN ,/, 48.6/CD percent/NN mAP/NN is/VBZ achieved/VBN by/IN our/PRP$ single/JJ model/NN and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT best/JJS among/IN published/VBN results/NNS ./.
