We/PRP present/VBP a/DT semi-supervised/JJ learning/NN framework/NN based/VBN on/IN graph/NN embeddings/NNS ./.
Given/VBN a/DT graph/NN between/IN instances/NNS ,/, we/PRP train/VBP an/DT embedding/NN for/IN each/DT instance/NN to/TO jointly/RB predict/VB the/DT class/NN label/NN and/CC the/DT neighborhood/NN context/NN in/IN the/DT graph/NN ./.
We/PRP develop/VBP both/DT transductive/JJ and/CC inductive/JJ variants/NNS of/IN our/PRP$ method/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT transductive/JJ variant/NN of/IN our/PRP$ method/NN ,/, the/DT class/NN labels/NNS are/VBP determined/VBN by/IN both/CC the/DT learned/VBN embeddings/NNS and/CC input/NN feature/NN vectors/NNS ,/, while/IN in/IN the/DT inductive/JJ variant/NN ,/, the/DT embeddings/NNS are/VBP defined/VBN as/IN a/DT parametric/JJ function/NN of/IN the/DT feature/NN vectors/NNS ,/, so/RB predictions/NNS can/MD be/VB made/VBN on/IN instances/NNS not/RB seen/VBN during/IN training/NN ./.
On/IN a/DT large/JJ and/CC diverse/JJ set/NN of/IN benchmark/NN tasks/NNS ,/, including/VBG text/NN classification/NN ,/, distantly/RB supervised/VBD entity/NN extraction/NN ,/, and/CC entity/NN classification/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP improved/VBN performance/NN over/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT existing/VBG models/NNS ./.
