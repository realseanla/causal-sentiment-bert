Inspired/VBN by/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN ad/NN exchanges/NNS for/IN online/JJ display/NN advertising/NN ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN inferring/VBG a/DT buyer/NN 's/POS value/NN distribution/NN for/IN a/DT good/JJ when/WRB the/DT buyer/NN is/VBZ repeatedly/RB interacting/VBG with/IN a/DT seller/NN through/IN a/DT posted/VBN -/HYPH price/NN mechanism/NN ./.
We/PRP model/VBP the/DT buyer/NN as/IN a/DT strategic/JJ agent/NN ,/, whose/WP$ goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO maximize/VB her/PRP$ long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN surplus/NN ,/, and/CC we/PRP are/VBP interested/JJ in/IN mechanisms/NNS that/WDT maximize/VBP the/DT seller/NN 's/POS long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN revenue/NN ./.
We/PRP define/VBP the/DT natural/JJ notion/NN of/IN strategic/JJ regret/NN ---/, the/DT lost/VBN revenue/NN as/IN measured/VBN against/IN a/DT truthful/JJ (/-LRB- non-strategic/JJ )/-RRB- buyer/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP seller/NN algorithms/NNS that/WDT are/VBP no/RB -/HYPH (/-LRB- strategic/JJ )/-RRB- -/HYPH regret/NN when/WRB the/DT buyer/NN discounts/VBZ her/PRP$ future/JJ surplus/NN ---/, i.e./FW the/DT buyer/NN prefers/VBZ showing/VBG advertisements/NNS to/IN users/NNS sooner/RBR rather/RB than/IN later/RB ./.
We/PRP also/RB give/VBP a/DT lower/JJR bound/VBN on/IN strategic/JJ regret/NN that/WDT increases/VBZ as/IN the/DT buyer/NN 's/POS discounting/NN weakens/VBZ and/CC shows/VBZ ,/, in/IN particular/JJ ,/, that/IN any/DT seller/NN algorithm/NN will/MD suffer/VB linear/JJ strategic/JJ regret/NN if/IN there/EX is/VBZ no/DT discounting/NN ./.
