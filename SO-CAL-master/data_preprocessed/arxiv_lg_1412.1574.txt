As/IN an/DT important/JJ and/CC challenging/JJ problem/NN in/IN computer/NN vision/NN and/CC graphics/NNS ,/, keypoint/NN -/HYPH based/VBN object/NN tracking/NN is/VBZ typically/RB formulated/VBN in/IN a/DT spatio/JJ -/HYPH temporal/JJ statistical/JJ learning/NN framework/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, most/JJS existing/VBG keypoint/NN trackers/NNS are/VBP incapable/JJ of/IN effectively/RB modeling/VBG and/CC balancing/VBG the/DT following/VBG three/CD aspects/NNS in/IN a/DT simultaneous/JJ manner/NN :/: temporal/JJ model/NN coherence/NN across/IN frames/NNS ,/, spatial/JJ model/NN consistency/NN within/IN frames/NNS ,/, and/CC discriminative/JJ feature/NN construction/NN ./.
To/TO address/VB this/DT issue/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT robust/JJ keypoint/NN tracker/NN based/VBN on/IN spatio/JJ -/HYPH temporal/JJ multi-task/VB structured/JJ output/NN optimization/NN driven/VBN by/IN discriminative/JJ metric/JJ learning/NN ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, temporal/JJ model/NN coherence/NN is/VBZ characterized/VBN by/IN multi-task/VB structured/JJ keypoint/NN model/NN learning/VBG over/IN several/JJ adjacent/JJ frames/NNS ,/, while/IN spatial/JJ model/NN consistency/NN is/VBZ modeled/VBN by/IN solving/VBG a/DT geometric/JJ verification/NN based/VBN structured/JJ learning/NN problem/NN ./.
Discriminative/JJ feature/NN construction/NN is/VBZ enabled/VBN by/IN metric/JJ learning/NN to/TO ensure/VB the/DT intra-class/JJ compactness/NN and/CC inter-class/NN separability/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, the/DT above/JJ three/CD modules/NNS are/VBP simultaneously/RB optimized/VBN in/IN a/DT joint/JJ learning/NN scheme/NN ./.
