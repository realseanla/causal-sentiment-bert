This/DT paper/NN proposes/VBZ an/DT approach/NN that/WDT predicts/VBZ the/DT road/NN course/NN from/IN camera/NN sensors/NNS leveraging/VBG deep/JJ learning/NN techniques/NNS ./.
Road/NNP pixels/NNS are/VBP identified/VBN by/IN training/VBG a/DT multi-scale/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN on/IN a/DT large/JJ number/NN of/IN full/JJ -/HYPH scene/NN -/HYPH labeled/VBN night/NN -/HYPH time/NN road/NN images/NNS including/VBG adverse/JJ weather/NN conditions/NNS ./.
A/DT framework/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN that/IN applies/VBZ the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN to/IN longer/JJR distance/NN road/NN course/NN estimation/NN ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN for/IN an/DT augmented/VBN reality/NN navigation/NN application/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT framework/NN long/JJ range/NN sensor/NN data/NNS (/-LRB- radar/NN )/-RRB- and/CC data/NNS from/IN a/DT map/NN database/NN are/VBP fused/VBN with/IN short/JJ range/NN sensor/NN data/NNS (/-LRB- camera/NN )/-RRB- to/TO produce/VB a/DT precise/JJ longitudinal/JJ and/CC lateral/JJ localization/NN and/CC road/NN course/NN estimation/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN reliably/RB detects/VBZ roads/NNS with/IN and/CC without/IN lane/NN markings/NNS and/CC thus/RB increases/VBZ the/DT robustness/NN and/CC availability/NN of/IN road/NN course/NN estimations/NNS and/CC augmented/VBN reality/NN navigation/NN ./.
Evaluations/NNS on/IN an/DT extensive/JJ set/NN of/IN high/JJ precision/NN ground/NN truth/NN data/NNS taken/VBN from/IN a/DT differential/JJ GPS/NN and/CC an/DT inertial/JJ measurement/NN unit/NN show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN reaches/VBZ state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN performance/NN without/IN the/DT limitation/NN of/IN requiring/VBG existing/VBG lane/NN markings/NNS ./.
