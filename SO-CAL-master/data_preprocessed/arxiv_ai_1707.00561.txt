In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP formulated/VBD a/DT real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN problem/NN related/VBN to/IN sewer/NN pipeline/NN gas/NN detection/NN using/VBG the/DT classification/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approaches/NNS ./.
The/DT primary/JJ goal/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN was/VBD to/TO identify/VB the/DT hazardousness/NN of/IN sewer/NN pipeline/NN to/TO offer/VB safe/JJ and/CC non-hazardous/JJ access/NN to/IN sewer/NN pipeline/NN workers/NNS so/IN that/IN the/DT human/JJ fatalities/NNS ,/, which/WDT occurs/VBZ due/IN to/IN the/DT toxic/JJ exposure/NN of/IN sewer/NN gas/NN components/NNS ,/, can/MD be/VB avoided/VBN ./.
The/DT dataset/NN acquired/VBN through/IN laboratory/NN tests/NNS ,/, experiments/NNS ,/, and/CC various/JJ literature/NN sources/NNS was/VBD organized/VBN to/TO design/VB a/DT predictive/JJ model/NN that/WDT was/VBD able/JJ to/TO identify/VB //, classify/VB hazardous/JJ and/CC non-hazardous/JJ situation/NN of/IN sewer/NN pipeline/NN ./.
To/TO design/VB such/JJ prediction/NN model/NN ,/, several/JJ classification/NN algorithms/NNS were/VBD used/VBN and/CC their/PRP$ performances/NNS were/VBD evaluated/VBN and/CC compared/VBN ,/, both/DT empirically/RB and/CC statistically/RB ,/, over/IN the/DT collected/VBN dataset/NN ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT performances/NNS of/IN several/JJ ensemble/NN methods/NNS were/VBD analyzed/VBN to/TO understand/VB the/DT extent/NN of/IN improvement/NN offered/VBN by/IN these/DT methods/NNS ./.
The/DT result/NN of/IN this/DT comprehensive/JJ study/NN showed/VBD that/IN the/DT instance/NN -/HYPH based/VBN learning/NN algorithm/NN performed/VBD better/JJR than/IN many/JJ other/JJ algorithms/NNS such/JJ as/IN multilayer/JJ perceptron/NN ,/, radial/JJ basis/NN function/NN network/NN ,/, support/NN vector/NN machine/NN ,/, reduced/VBN pruning/NN tree/NN ./.
Similarly/RB ,/, it/PRP was/VBD observed/VBN that/IN multi-scheme/JJ ensemble/NN approach/NN enhanced/VBD the/DT performance/NN of/IN base/NN predictors/NNS ./.
