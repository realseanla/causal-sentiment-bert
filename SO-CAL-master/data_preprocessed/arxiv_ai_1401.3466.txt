Coalition/NN formation/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ type/NN of/IN interaction/NN that/WDT involves/VBZ the/DT creation/NN of/IN coherent/JJ groupings/NNS of/IN distinct/JJ ,/, autonomous/JJ ,/, agents/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO efficiently/RB achieve/VB their/PRP$ individual/JJ or/CC collective/JJ goals/NNS ./.
Forming/VBG effective/JJ coalitions/NNS is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ research/NN challenge/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN multi-agent/JJ systems/NNS ./.
Central/NNP to/IN this/DT endeavour/NN is/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN determining/VBG which/WDT of/IN the/DT many/JJ possible/JJ coalitions/NNS to/TO form/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO achieve/VB some/DT goal/NN ./.
This/DT usually/RB requires/VBZ calculating/VBG a/DT value/NN for/IN every/DT possible/JJ coalition/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN the/DT coalition/NN value/NN ,/, which/WDT indicates/VBZ how/WRB beneficial/JJ that/DT coalition/NN would/MD be/VB if/IN it/PRP was/VBD formed/VBN ./.
Once/IN these/DT values/NNS are/VBP calculated/VBN ,/, the/DT agents/NNS usually/RB need/VBP to/TO find/VB a/DT combination/NN of/IN coalitions/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT every/DT agent/NN belongs/VBZ to/IN exactly/RB one/CD coalition/NN ,/, and/CC by/IN which/WDT the/DT overall/JJ outcome/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN is/VBZ maximized/VBN ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT coalition/NN structure/NN generation/NN problem/NN is/VBZ extremely/RB challenging/JJ due/IN to/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN possible/JJ solutions/NNS that/WDT need/VBP to/TO be/VB examined/VBN ,/, which/WDT grows/VBZ exponentially/RB with/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN agents/NNS involved/VBN ./.
To/IN date/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, many/JJ algorithms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN to/TO solve/VB this/DT problem/NN using/VBG different/JJ techniques/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN dynamic/JJ programming/NN ,/, to/IN integer/NN programming/NN ,/, to/IN stochastic/JJ search/NN all/DT of/IN which/WDT suffer/VBP from/IN major/JJ limitations/NNS relating/VBG to/IN execution/NN time/NN ,/, solution/NN quality/NN ,/, and/CC memory/NN requirements/NNS ./.
