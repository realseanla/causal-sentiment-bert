An/DT ordinal/JJ view/NN of/IN independence/NN is/VBZ studied/VBN in/IN the/DT framework/NN of/IN possibility/NN theory/NN ./.
We/PRP investigate/VBP three/CD possible/JJ definitions/NNS of/IN dependence/NN ,/, of/IN increasing/VBG strength/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN them/PRP is/VBZ the/DT counterpart/NN to/TO the/DT multiplication/NN law/NN in/IN probability/NN theory/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT two/CD others/NNS are/VBP based/VBN on/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN conditional/JJ possibility/NN ./.
