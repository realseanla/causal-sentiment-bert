Regularisation/NN of/IN deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- during/IN training/NN is/VBZ critical/JJ to/IN performance/NN ./.
By/IN far/RB the/DT most/RBS popular/JJ method/NN is/VBZ known/VBN as/IN dropout/NN ./.
Here/RB ,/, cast/VBN through/IN the/DT prism/NN of/IN signal/NN processing/NN theory/NN ,/, we/PRP compare/VBP and/CC contrast/VBP the/DT regularisation/NN effects/NNS of/IN dropout/NN with/IN those/DT of/IN dither/NN ./.
We/PRP illustrate/VBP some/DT serious/JJ inherent/JJ limitations/NNS of/IN dropout/NN and/CC demonstrate/VBP that/IN dither/NN provides/VBZ a/DT far/RB more/RBR effective/JJ regulariser/NN which/WDT does/VBZ not/RB suffer/VB from/IN the/DT same/JJ limitations/NNS ./.
