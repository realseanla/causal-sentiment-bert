Local/JJ Process/NN Model/NN (/-LRB- LPM/NN )/-RRB- discovery/NN is/VBZ focused/VBN on/IN the/DT mining/NN of/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN process/NN models/NNS where/WRB each/DT model/NN describes/VBZ the/DT behavior/NN represented/VBN in/IN the/DT event/NN log/NN only/RB partially/RB ,/, i.e./FW subsets/NNS of/IN possible/JJ events/NNS are/VBP taken/VBN into/IN account/NN to/TO create/VB so/RB -/HYPH called/VBN local/JJ process/NN models/NNS ./.
