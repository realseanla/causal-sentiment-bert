This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN finding/VBG a/DT preference/NN relation/NN on/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN acts/NNS from/IN the/DT knowledge/NN of/IN an/DT ordering/NN on/IN events/NNS (/-LRB- subsets/NNS of/IN states/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN )/-RRB- describing/VBG the/DT decision/NN -/HYPH maker/NN (/-LRB- DM/NN )/-RRB- s/POS uncertainty/NN and/CC an/DT ordering/NN of/IN consequences/NNS of/IN acts/NNS ,/, describing/VBG the/DT DMs/NNPS preferences/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, contrary/JJ to/IN classical/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN decision/NN theory/NN ,/, we/PRP try/VBP to/TO do/VB it/PRP without/IN resorting/VBG to/IN any/DT numerical/JJ representation/NN of/IN utility/NN nor/CC uncertainty/NN ,/, and/CC without/IN even/RB using/VBG any/DT qualitative/JJ scale/NN on/IN which/WDT both/DT uncertainty/NN and/CC preference/NN could/MD be/VB mapped/VBN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN although/IN many/JJ axioms/NNS of/IN Savage/NNP theory/NN can/MD be/VB preserved/VBN and/CC despite/IN the/DT intuitive/JJ appeal/NN of/IN the/DT method/NN for/IN constructing/VBG a/DT preference/NN over/IN acts/NNS ,/, the/DT approach/NN is/VBZ inconsistent/JJ with/IN a/DT probabilistic/JJ representation/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN ,/, but/CC leads/VBZ to/IN the/DT kind/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN theory/NN encountered/VBD in/IN non-monotonic/JJ reasoning/NN (/-LRB- especially/RB preferential/JJ and/CC rational/JJ inference/NN )/-RRB- ,/, closely/RB related/JJ to/IN possibility/NN theory/NN ./.
Moreover/RB the/DT method/NN turns/VBZ out/RP to/TO be/VB either/CC very/RB little/JJ decisive/JJ or/CC to/TO lead/VB to/IN very/RB risky/JJ decisions/NNS ,/, although/IN its/PRP$ basic/JJ principles/NNS look/VBP sound/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN raises/VBZ the/DT question/NN of/IN the/DT very/RB possibility/NN of/IN purely/RB symbolic/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN Savage/NNP -/HYPH like/JJ decision/NN -/HYPH making/VBG under/IN uncertainty/NN and/CC obtains/VBZ preliminary/JJ negative/JJ results/NNS ./.
