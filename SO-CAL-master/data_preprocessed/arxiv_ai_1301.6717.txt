This/DT paper/NN extends/VBZ previous/JJ work/NN with/IN network/NN fragments/NNS and/CC situation/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ network/NN construction/NN ./.
We/PRP formally/RB define/VBP the/DT asymmetry/NN network/NN ,/, an/DT alternative/JJ representation/NN for/IN a/DT conditional/JJ probability/NN table/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB present/VBP an/DT object/NN -/HYPH oriented/VBN representation/NN for/IN partially/RB specified/VBN asymmetry/NN networks/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT representation/NN is/VBZ parsimonious/JJ ./.
We/PRP define/VBP an/DT algebra/NN for/IN the/DT elements/NNS of/IN the/DT representation/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO '/`` factor/VB '/'' any/DT CPT/NN and/CC to/TO soundly/RB combine/VB the/DT partially/RB specified/VBN asymmetry/NN networks/NNS ./.
