In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP analyse/VBP network/NN motifs/NNS in/IN the/DT co-occurrence/NN directed/VBN networks/NNS constructed/VBN from/IN five/CD different/JJ texts/NNS (/-LRB- four/CD books/NNS and/CC one/CD portal/NN )/-RRB- in/IN the/DT Croatian/JJ language/NN ./.
After/IN preparing/VBG the/DT data/NNS and/CC network/NN construction/NN ,/, we/PRP perform/VBP the/DT network/NN motif/NN analysis/NN ./.
We/PRP analyse/VBP the/DT motif/NN frequencies/NNS and/CC Z/NN -/HYPH scores/NNS in/IN the/DT five/CD networks/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP the/DT triad/NN significance/NN profile/NN for/IN five/CD datasets/NNS ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, we/PRP compare/VBP our/PRP$ results/NNS with/IN the/DT existing/VBG results/NNS for/IN the/DT linguistic/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Firstly/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT triad/NN significance/NN profile/NN for/IN the/DT Croatian/JJ language/NN is/VBZ very/RB similar/JJ with/IN the/DT other/JJ languages/NNS and/CC all/PDT the/DT networks/NNS belong/VBP to/IN the/DT same/JJ family/NN of/IN networks/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP certain/JJ differences/NNS between/IN the/DT Croatian/JJ language/NN and/CC other/JJ analysed/VBN languages/NNS ./.
We/PRP conclude/VBP that/IN this/DT is/VBZ due/JJ to/IN the/DT free/JJ word/NN -/HYPH order/NN of/IN the/DT Croatian/JJ language/NN ./.
