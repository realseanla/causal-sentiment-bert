Methods/NNS for/IN analyzing/VBG or/CC learning/VBG from/IN "/`` fuzzy/JJ data/NNS "/'' have/VBP attracted/VBN increasing/VBG attention/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS ./.
In/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, existing/VBG methods/NNS (/-LRB- for/IN precise/JJ ,/, non-fuzzy/JJ data/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP extended/VBN to/IN the/DT fuzzy/JJ case/NN in/IN an/DT ad/FW -/HYPH hoc/FW manner/NN ,/, and/CC without/IN carefully/RB considering/VBG the/DT interpretation/NN of/IN a/DT fuzzy/JJ set/NN when/WRB being/VBG used/VBN for/IN modeling/NN data/NNS ./.
Distinguishing/VBG between/IN an/DT ontic/JJ and/CC an/DT epistemic/JJ interpretation/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ set/NN -/HYPH valued/VBN data/NNS ,/, and/CC focusing/VBG on/IN the/DT latter/JJ ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN a/DT "/`` fuzzification/NN "/'' of/IN learning/VBG algorithms/NNS based/VBN on/IN an/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT generic/JJ extension/NN principle/NN is/VBZ not/RB appropriate/JJ ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, the/DT extension/NN principle/NN fails/VBZ to/TO properly/RB exploit/VB the/DT inductive/JJ bias/NN underlying/VBG statistical/JJ and/CC machine/NN learning/NN methods/NNS ,/, although/IN this/DT bias/NN ,/, at/IN least/RBS in/IN principle/JJ ,/, offers/VBZ a/DT means/NN for/IN "/`` disambiguating/VBG "/'' the/DT fuzzy/JJ data/NNS ./.
Alternatively/RB ,/, we/PRP therefore/RB propose/VBP a/DT method/NN which/WDT is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN the/DT generalization/NN of/IN loss/NN functions/NNS in/IN empirical/JJ risk/NN minimization/NN ,/, and/CC which/WDT performs/VBZ model/NN identification/NN and/CC data/NNS disambiguation/NN simultaneously/RB ./.
Elaborating/VBG on/IN the/DT fuzzification/NN of/IN specific/JJ types/NNS of/IN losses/NNS ,/, we/PRP establish/VBP connections/NNS to/TO well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN loss/NN functions/NNS in/IN regression/NN and/CC classification/NN ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP our/PRP$ approach/NN with/IN related/JJ methods/NNS and/CC illustrate/VB its/PRP$ use/NN in/IN logistic/JJ regression/NN for/IN binary/JJ classification/NN ./.
