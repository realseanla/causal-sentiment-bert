The/DT AGM/NNP theory/NN of/IN belief/NN revision/NN has/VBZ become/VBN an/DT important/JJ paradigm/NN for/IN investigating/VBG rational/JJ belief/NN changes/NNS ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, researchers/NNS working/VBG in/IN this/DT paradigm/NN have/VBP restricted/VBN much/RB of/IN their/PRP$ attention/NN to/IN rather/RB simple/JJ representations/NNS of/IN belief/NN states/NNS ,/, namely/RB logically/RB closed/JJ sets/NNS of/IN propositional/JJ sentences/NNS ./.
In/IN our/PRP$ opinion/NN ,/, this/DT has/VBZ resulted/VBN in/IN a/DT too/RB abstract/JJ categorisation/NN of/IN belief/NN change/NN operations/NNS :/: expansion/NN ,/, revision/NN ,/, or/CC contraction/NN ./.
Occasionally/RB ,/, in/IN the/DT AGM/NNP paradigm/NN ,/, also/RB probabilistic/JJ belief/NN changes/NNS have/VBP been/VBN considered/VBN ,/, and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ widely/RB accepted/VBN that/IN the/DT probabilistic/JJ version/NN of/IN expansion/NN is/VBZ conditioning/VBG ./.
However/RB ,/, we/PRP argue/VBP that/IN it/PRP may/MD be/VB more/RBR correct/JJ to/TO view/VB conditioning/NN and/CC expansion/NN as/IN two/CD essentially/RB different/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN belief/NN change/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN what/WP we/PRP call/VBP constraining/VBG is/VBZ a/DT better/JJR candidate/NN for/IN being/VBG considered/VBN probabilistic/JJ expansion/NN ./.
