Epistemic/JJ logic/NN has/VBZ become/VBN a/DT major/JJ field/NN of/IN philosophical/JJ logic/NN ever/RB since/IN the/DT groundbreaking/JJ work/NN by/IN Hintikka/NNP (/-LRB- 1962/CD )/-RRB- ./.
Despite/IN its/PRP$ various/JJ successful/JJ applications/NNS in/IN theoretical/JJ computer/NN science/NN ,/, AI/NN ,/, and/CC game/NN theory/NN ,/, the/DT technical/JJ development/NN of/IN the/DT field/NN has/VBZ been/VBN mainly/RB focusing/VBG on/IN the/DT propositional/JJ part/NN ,/, i.e./FW ,/, the/DT propositional/JJ modal/JJ logics/NNS of/IN "/`` knowing/VBG that/IN "/'' ./.
However/RB ,/, knowledge/NN is/VBZ expressed/VBN in/IN everyday/JJ life/NN by/IN using/VBG various/JJ other/JJ locutions/NNS such/JJ as/IN "/`` knowing/VBG whether/IN "/`` ,/, "/`` knowing/VBG what/WP "/'' ,/, "/`` knowing/VBG how/WRB "/'' and/CC so/RB on/IN (/-LRB- knowing/VBG -/HYPH wh/NNP hereafter/RB )/-RRB- ./.
