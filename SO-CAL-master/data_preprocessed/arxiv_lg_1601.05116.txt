Why/WRB has/VBZ SIFT/NNP been/VBN so/RB successful/JJ ?/.
Why/WRB its/PRP$ extension/NN ,/, DSP/NNP -/HYPH SIFT/NNP ,/, can/MD further/RB improve/VB SIFT/NNP ?/.
Is/VBZ there/RB a/DT theory/NN that/WDT can/MD explain/VB both/DT ?/.
How/WRB can/MD such/JJ theory/NN benefit/NN real/JJ applications/NNS ?/.
Can/MD it/PRP suggest/VB new/JJ algorithms/NNS with/IN reduced/VBN computational/JJ complexity/NN or/CC new/JJ descriptors/NNS with/IN better/JJR accuracy/NN for/IN matching/VBG ?/.
We/PRP construct/VBP a/DT general/JJ theory/NN of/IN local/JJ descriptors/NNS for/IN visual/JJ matching/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ theory/NN relies/VBZ on/IN concepts/NNS in/IN energy/NN minimization/NN and/CC heat/NN diffusion/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN SIFT/NNP and/CC DSP/NNP -/HYPH SIFT/NNP approximate/VB the/DT solution/NN the/DT theory/NN suggests/VBZ ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, DSP/NNP -/HYPH SIFT/NNP gives/VBZ a/DT better/JJR approximation/NN to/IN the/DT theoretical/JJ solution/NN ;/: justifying/VBG why/WRB DSP/NNP -/HYPH SIFT/NNP outperforms/VBZ SIFT/NNP ./.
Using/VBG the/DT developed/VBN theory/NN ,/, we/PRP derive/VBP new/JJ descriptors/NNS that/WDT have/VBP fewer/JJR parameters/NNS and/CC are/VBP potentially/RB better/JJR in/IN handling/VBG affine/JJ deformations/NNS ./.
