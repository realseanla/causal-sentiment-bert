Clinical/JJ trial/NN adaptation/NN refers/VBZ to/IN any/DT adjustment/NN of/IN the/DT trial/NN protocol/NN after/IN the/DT onset/NN of/IN the/DT trial/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB the/DT process/NN of/IN introducing/VBG new/JJ medical/JJ interventions/NNS to/IN patients/NNS more/RBR efficient/JJ by/IN reducing/VBG the/DT cost/NN and/CC the/DT time/NN associated/VBN with/IN evaluating/VBG their/PRP$ safety/NN and/CC efficacy/NN ./.
The/DT principal/JJ question/NN is/VBZ how/WRB should/MD adaptation/NN be/VB performed/VBN so/RB as/IN to/TO minimize/VB the/DT chance/NN of/IN distorting/VBG the/DT outcome/NN of/IN the/DT trial/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ method/NN for/IN achieving/VBG this/DT ./.
Unlike/IN previous/JJ work/NN our/PRP$ approach/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN trial/NN adaptation/NN by/IN sample/NN size/NN adjustment/NN ./.
We/PRP adopt/VBP a/DT recently/RB proposed/VBN stratification/NN framework/NN based/VBN on/IN collected/VBN auxiliary/JJ data/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN this/DT information/NN together/RB with/IN the/DT primary/JJ measured/VBN variables/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO make/VB a/DT probabilistically/RB informed/JJ choice/NN of/IN the/DT particular/JJ sub-group/JJ a/DT sample/NN should/MD be/VB removed/VBN from/IN ./.
