Local/JJ consistencies/NNS stronger/JJR than/IN arc/NN consistency/NN have/VBP received/VBN a/DT lot/NN of/IN attention/NN since/IN the/DT early/JJ days/NNS of/IN CSP/NNP research/NN ./.

Taking/VBG advantage/NN of/IN recent/JJ advances/NNS in/IN parallelization/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ approach/NN for/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN strong/JJ local/JJ consistencies/NNS (/-LRB- SLCs/NNS )/-RRB- that/WDT can/MD improve/VB their/PRP$ performance/NN by/IN largely/RB preserving/VBG the/DT speed/NN -/HYPH ups/NNS they/PRP offer/VBP in/IN cases/NNS where/WRB they/PRP are/VBP successful/JJ ,/, and/CC eliminating/VBG the/DT run/NN time/NN penalties/NNS in/IN cases/NNS where/WRB they/PRP are/VBP unsuccessful/JJ ./.
