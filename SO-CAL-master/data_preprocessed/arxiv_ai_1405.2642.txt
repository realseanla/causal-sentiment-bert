The/DT dynamics/NNS of/IN belief/NN and/CC knowledge/NN is/VBZ one/CD of/IN the/DT major/JJ components/NNS of/IN any/DT autonomous/JJ system/NN that/WDT should/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO incorporate/VB new/JJ pieces/NNS of/IN information/NN ./.
We/PRP introduced/VBD the/DT knowledge/NN base/NN dynamics/NNS to/TO deal/VB with/IN two/CD important/JJ points/NNS :/: first/RB ,/, to/TO handle/VB belief/NN states/NNS that/WDT need/VBP not/RB be/VB deductively/RB closed/VBN ;/: and/CC the/DT second/JJ point/NN is/VBZ the/DT ability/NN to/TO declare/VB certain/JJ parts/NNS of/IN the/DT belief/NN as/IN immutable/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP address/VBP another/DT ,/, radically/RB new/JJ approach/NN to/IN this/DT problem/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN is/VBZ very/RB close/JJ to/IN the/DT Hansson/NNP 's/POS dyadic/JJ representation/NN of/IN belief/NN ./.
Here/RB ,/, we/PRP consider/VBP the/DT immutable/JJ part/NN as/IN defining/VBG a/DT new/JJ logical/JJ system/NN ./.
By/IN a/DT logical/JJ system/NN ,/, we/PRP mean/VBP that/IN it/PRP defines/VBZ its/PRP$ own/JJ consequence/NN relation/NN and/CC closure/NN operator/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN this/DT ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP an/DT abductive/JJ framework/NN for/IN knowledge/NN base/NN dynamics/NNS ./.
