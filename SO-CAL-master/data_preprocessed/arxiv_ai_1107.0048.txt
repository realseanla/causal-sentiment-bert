In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP confront/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN applying/VBG reinforcement/NN learning/VBG to/IN agents/NNS that/WDT perceive/VBP the/DT environment/NN through/IN many/JJ sensors/NNS and/CC that/DT can/MD perform/VB parallel/JJ actions/NNS using/VBG many/JJ actuators/NNS as/RB is/VBZ the/DT case/NN in/IN complex/JJ autonomous/JJ robots/NNS ./.
We/PRP argue/VBP that/IN reinforcement/NN learning/NN can/MD only/RB be/VB successfully/RB applied/VBN to/IN this/DT case/NN if/IN strong/JJ assumptions/NNS are/VBP made/VBN on/IN the/DT characteristics/NNS of/IN the/DT environment/NN in/IN which/WDT the/DT learning/NN is/VBZ performed/VBN ,/, so/IN that/IN the/DT relevant/JJ sensor/NN readings/NNS and/CC motor/NN commands/NNS can/MD be/VB readily/RB identified/VBN ./.
The/DT introduction/NN of/IN such/JJ assumptions/NNS leads/VBZ to/IN strongly/RB -/HYPH biased/JJ learning/NN systems/NNS that/WDT can/MD eventually/RB lose/VB the/DT generality/NN of/IN traditional/JJ reinforcement/NN -/HYPH learning/VBG algorithms/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT line/NN ,/, we/PRP observe/VBP that/IN ,/, in/IN realistic/JJ situations/NNS ,/, the/DT reward/NN received/VBN by/IN the/DT robot/NN depends/VBZ only/RB on/IN a/DT reduced/VBN subset/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT executed/VBN actions/NNS and/CC that/IN only/RB a/DT reduced/VBN subset/NN of/IN the/DT sensor/NN inputs/NNS (/-LRB- possibly/RB different/JJ in/IN each/DT situation/NN and/CC for/IN each/DT action/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP relevant/JJ to/TO predict/VB the/DT reward/NN ./.
We/PRP formalize/VBP this/DT property/NN in/IN the/DT so/RB called/VBN '/`` categorizability/NN assumption/NN '/'' and/CC we/PRP present/VBP an/DT algorithm/NN that/WDT takes/VBZ advantage/NN of/IN the/DT categorizability/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, allowing/VBG a/DT decrease/NN in/IN the/DT learning/NN time/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN existing/VBG reinforcement/NN -/HYPH learning/VBG algorithms/NNS ./.
Results/NNS of/IN the/DT application/NN of/IN the/DT algorithm/NN to/IN a/DT couple/NN of/IN simulated/JJ realistic/JJ -/HYPH robotic/JJ problems/NNS (/-LRB- landmark/NN -/HYPH based/VBN navigation/NN and/CC the/DT six/CD -/HYPH legged/JJ robot/NN gait/NN generation/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP reported/VBN to/TO validate/VB our/PRP$ approach/NN and/CC to/TO compare/VB it/PRP to/IN existing/VBG flat/JJ and/CC generalization/NN -/HYPH based/VBN reinforcement/NN -/HYPH learning/VBG approaches/NNS ./.
