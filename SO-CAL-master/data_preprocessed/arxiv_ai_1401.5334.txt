This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ a/DT microkernel/NN architecture/NN for/IN constraint/NN programming/NN organized/VBN around/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN small/JJ number/NN of/IN core/NN functionalities/NNS and/CC minimal/JJ interfaces/VBZ ./.
The/DT architecture/NN contrasts/VBZ with/IN the/DT monolithic/JJ nature/NN of/IN many/JJ implementations/NNS ./.
