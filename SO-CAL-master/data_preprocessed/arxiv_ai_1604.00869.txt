Knowledge/NN base/NN is/VBZ the/DT way/NN to/TO store/VB structured/JJ and/CC unstructured/JJ data/NNS throughout/IN the/DT web/NN ./.
Since/IN the/DT size/NN of/IN the/DT web/NN is/VBZ increasing/VBG rapidly/RB ,/, there/EX are/VBP huge/JJ needs/NNS to/TO structure/VB the/DT knowledge/NN in/IN a/DT fully/RB automated/VBN way/NN ./.
However/RB fully/RB -/HYPH automated/VBN knowledge/NN -/HYPH base/NN evolution/NN on/IN the/DT Semantic/JJ Web/NN is/VBZ a/DT major/JJ challenges/NNS ,/, although/IN there/EX are/VBP many/JJ ontology/NN evolution/NN techniques/NNS available/JJ ./.
Therefore/RB learning/VBG ontology/NN automatically/RB can/MD contribute/VB to/IN the/DT semantic/JJ web/NN society/NN significantly/RB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP full/JJ -/HYPH automated/VBN ontology/NN learning/NN algorithm/NN to/TO generate/VB refined/JJ knowledge/NN base/NN from/IN incomplete/JJ knowledge/NN base/NN and/CC rdf/NN -/HYPH triples/NNS ./.
