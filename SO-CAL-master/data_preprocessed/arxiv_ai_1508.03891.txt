This/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ an/DT architecture/NN that/WDT combines/VBZ the/DT complementary/JJ strengths/NNS of/IN probabilistic/JJ graphical/JJ models/NNS and/CC declarative/JJ programming/NN to/TO enable/VB robots/NNS to/TO represent/VB and/CC reason/NN with/IN qualitative/JJ and/CC quantitative/JJ descriptions/NNS of/IN uncertainty/NN and/CC domain/NN knowledge/NN ./.
The/DT architecture/NN comprises/VBZ three/CD components/NNS :/: a/DT controller/NN ,/, a/DT logician/NN and/CC an/DT executor/NN ./.
The/DT logician/NN uses/VBZ a/DT coarse/JJ -/HYPH resolution/NN ,/, qualitative/JJ model/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC logical/JJ reasoning/NN to/TO plan/VB a/DT sequence/NN of/IN abstract/JJ actions/NNS for/IN an/DT assigned/VBN goal/NN ./.
For/IN each/DT abstract/JJ action/NN to/TO be/VB executed/VBN ,/, the/DT executor/NN uses/VBZ probabilistic/JJ information/NN at/IN finer/JJR granularity/NN and/CC probabilistic/JJ algorithms/NNS to/TO execute/VB a/DT sequence/NN of/IN concrete/JJ actions/NNS ,/, and/CC to/TO report/VB observations/NNS of/IN the/DT environment/NN ./.
The/DT controller/NN dispatches/VBZ goals/NNS and/CC relevant/JJ information/NN to/IN the/DT logician/NN and/CC executor/NN ,/, collects/VBZ and/CC processes/VBZ information/NN from/IN these/DT components/NNS ,/, refines/VBZ the/DT coarse/JJ -/HYPH resolution/NN description/NN to/TO obtain/VB the/DT probabilistic/JJ information/NN at/IN finer/JJR granularity/NN for/IN each/DT abstract/JJ action/NN ,/, and/CC computes/VBZ the/DT policy/NN for/IN executing/VBG the/DT abstract/JJ action/NN using/VBG probabilistic/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
The/DT architecture/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN in/IN simulation/NN and/CC on/IN a/DT mobile/JJ robot/NN moving/VBG objects/NNS in/IN an/DT indoor/JJ domain/NN ,/, to/TO show/VB that/IN it/PRP supports/VBZ reasoning/NN with/IN violation/NN of/IN defaults/NNS ,/, noisy/JJ observations/NNS and/CC unreliable/JJ actions/NNS ,/, in/IN complex/JJ domains/NNS ./.
