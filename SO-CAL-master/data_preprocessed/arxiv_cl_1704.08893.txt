Discourse/NN -/HYPH annotated/VBN corpora/NNS are/VBP an/DT important/JJ resource/NN for/IN the/DT community/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, these/DT corpora/NNS are/VBP often/RB annotated/VBN according/VBG to/IN different/JJ frameworks/NNS ,/, making/VBG comparison/NN of/IN the/DT annotations/NNS difficult/JJ ./.
This/DT is/VBZ unfortunate/JJ ,/, since/IN mapping/VBG the/DT existing/VBG annotations/NNS would/MD result/VB in/IN more/JJR (/-LRB- training/NN )/-RRB- data/NNS for/IN researchers/NNS in/IN automatic/JJ discourse/NN relation/NN processing/NN and/CC researchers/NNS in/IN linguistics/NNS and/CC psycholinguistics/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT article/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP an/DT effort/NN to/TO map/VB two/CD large/JJ corpora/NNS onto/IN each/DT other/JJ :/: the/DT Penn/NNP Discourse/NN Treebank/NNP and/CC the/DT Rhetorical/JJ Structure/NN Theory/NN Discourse/NN Treebank/NNP ./.
