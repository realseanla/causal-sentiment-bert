This/DT paper/NN develops/VBZ generalizations/NNS of/IN empowerment/NN to/IN continuous/JJ states/NNS ./.
Empowerment/NN is/VBZ a/DT recently/RB introduced/VBN information/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ quantity/NN motivated/VBN by/IN hypotheses/NNS about/IN the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN the/DT sensorimotor/NN loop/NN in/IN biological/JJ organisms/NNS ,/, but/CC also/RB from/IN considerations/NNS stemming/VBG from/IN curiosity/NN -/HYPH driven/VBN learning/NN ./.
Empowemerment/JJ measures/NNS ,/, for/IN agent/NN -/HYPH environment/NN systems/NNS with/IN stochastic/JJ transitions/NNS ,/, how/WRB much/JJ influence/NN an/DT agent/NN has/VBZ on/IN its/PRP$ environment/NN ,/, but/CC only/RB that/DT influence/NN that/WDT can/MD be/VB sensed/VBN by/IN the/DT agent/NN sensors/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ an/DT information/NN -/HYPH theoretic/JJ generalization/NN of/IN joint/JJ controllability/NN (/-LRB- influence/NN on/IN environment/NN )/-RRB- and/CC observability/NN (/-LRB- measurement/NN by/IN sensors/NNS )/-RRB- of/IN the/DT environment/NN by/IN the/DT agent/NN ,/, both/CC controllability/NN and/CC observability/NN being/VBG usually/RB defined/VBN in/IN control/NN theory/NN as/IN the/DT dimensionality/NN of/IN the/DT control/NN //HYPH observation/NN spaces/NNS ./.
Earlier/RBR work/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN empowerment/NN has/VBZ various/JJ interesting/JJ and/CC relevant/JJ properties/NNS ,/, e.g./FW ,/, it/PRP allows/VBZ us/PRP to/TO identify/VB salient/JJ states/NNS using/VBG only/RB the/DT dynamics/NNS ,/, and/CC it/PRP can/MD act/VB as/IN intrinsic/JJ reward/NN without/IN requiring/VBG an/DT external/JJ reward/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT previous/JJ work/NN empowerment/NN was/VBD limited/VBN to/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN small/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN and/CC discrete/JJ domains/NNS and/CC furthermore/RB state/NN transition/NN probabilities/NNS were/VBD assumed/VBN to/TO be/VB known/VBN ./.
The/DT goal/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO extend/VB empowerment/NN to/IN the/DT significantly/RB more/RBR important/JJ and/CC relevant/JJ case/NN of/IN continuous/JJ vector/NN -/HYPH valued/VBN state/NN spaces/NNS and/CC initially/RB unknown/JJ state/NN transition/NN probabilities/NNS ./.
The/DT continuous/JJ state/NN space/NN is/VBZ addressed/VBN by/IN Monte/NNP -/HYPH Carlo/NNP approximation/NN ;/: the/DT unknown/JJ transitions/NNS are/VBP addressed/VBN by/IN model/NN learning/NN and/CC prediction/NN for/IN which/WDT we/PRP apply/VBP Gaussian/JJ processes/NNS regression/NN with/IN iterated/VBN forecasting/NN ./.
In/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN well/RB -/HYPH known/VBN continuous/JJ control/NN tasks/NNS we/PRP examine/VBP the/DT dynamics/NNS induced/VBN by/IN empowerment/NN and/CC include/VBP an/DT application/NN to/IN exploration/NN and/CC online/JJ model/NN learning/NN ./.
