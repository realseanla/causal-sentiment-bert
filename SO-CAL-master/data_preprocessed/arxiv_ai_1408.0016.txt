In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP describe/VBP the/DT architecture/NN of/IN a/DT web/NN -/HYPH based/VBN predictive/JJ text/NN editor/NN being/VBG developed/VBN for/IN the/DT controlled/VBN natural/JJ language/NN PENG$/NN ^/SYM {/-LRB- ASP/NN )/-RRB- $/$ ./.
This/DT controlled/VBN language/NN can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO write/VB non-monotonic/JJ specifications/NNS that/WDT have/VBP the/DT same/JJ expressive/JJ power/NN as/IN Answer/NN Set/VBN Programs/NNS ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO support/VB the/DT writing/NN process/NN of/IN these/DT specifications/NNS ,/, the/DT predictive/JJ text/NN editor/NN communicates/VBZ asynchronously/RB with/IN the/DT controlled/VBN natural/JJ language/NN processor/NN that/WDT generates/VBZ lookahead/NN categories/NNS and/CC additional/JJ auxiliary/JJ information/NN for/IN the/DT author/NN of/IN a/DT specification/NN text/NN ./.
The/DT text/NN editor/NN can/MD display/VB multiple/JJ sets/NNS of/IN lookahead/NN categories/NNS simultaneously/RB for/IN different/JJ possible/JJ sentence/NN completions/NNS ,/, anaphoric/JJ expressions/NNS ,/, and/CC supports/VBZ the/DT addition/NN of/IN new/JJ content/NN words/NNS to/IN the/DT lexicon/NN ./.
