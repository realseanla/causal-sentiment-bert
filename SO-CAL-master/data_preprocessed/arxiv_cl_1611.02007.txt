Keyphrase/NN annotation/NN is/VBZ the/DT task/NN of/IN identifying/VBG textual/JJ units/NNS that/WDT represent/VBP the/DT main/JJ content/NN of/IN a/DT document/NN ./.
Keyphrase/NN annotation/NN is/VBZ either/CC carried/VBN out/RP by/IN extracting/VBG the/DT most/RBS important/JJ phrases/NNS from/IN a/DT document/NN ,/, keyphrase/NN extraction/NN ,/, or/CC by/IN assigning/VBG entries/NNS from/IN a/DT controlled/VBN domain/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ vocabulary/NN ,/, keyphrase/NN assignment/NN ./.
