Theoretical/JJ analyses/NNS of/IN the/DT Dendritic/JJ Cell/NN Algorithm/NN (/-LRB- DCA/NNP )/-RRB- have/VBP yielded/VBN several/JJ criticisms/NNS about/IN its/PRP$ underlying/JJ structure/NN and/CC operation/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN ,/, several/JJ alterations/NNS and/CC fixes/NNS have/VBP been/VBN suggested/VBN in/IN the/DT literature/NN to/TO correct/VB for/IN these/DT findings/NNS ./.
A/DT contribution/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ to/TO investigate/VB the/DT effects/NNS of/IN replacing/VBG the/DT classification/NN stage/NN of/IN the/DT DCA/NNP (/-LRB- which/WDT is/VBZ known/VBN to/TO be/VB flawed/JJ )/-RRB- with/IN a/DT traditional/JJ machine/NN learning/VBG technique/NN ./.
This/DT work/NN goes/VBZ on/IN to/TO question/VB the/DT merits/NNS of/IN those/DT unique/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT DCA/NNP that/WDT are/VBP yet/RB to/TO be/VB thoroughly/RB analysed/VBN ./.
If/IN none/NN of/IN these/DT properties/NNS can/MD be/VB found/VBN to/TO have/VB a/DT benefit/NN over/IN traditional/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, then/RB "/`` fixing/VBG "/'' the/DT DCA/NNP is/VBZ arguably/RB less/RBR efficient/JJ than/IN simply/RB creating/VBG a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN ./.
This/DT work/NN examines/VBZ the/DT dynamic/JJ filtering/NN property/NN of/IN the/DT DCA/NNP and/CC questions/NNS the/DT utility/NN of/IN this/DT unique/JJ feature/NN for/IN the/DT anomaly/NN detection/NN problem/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ found/VBN that/IN this/DT feature/NN ,/, while/IN advantageous/JJ for/IN noisy/JJ ,/, time/NN -/HYPH ordered/VBN classification/NN ,/, is/VBZ not/RB as/IN useful/JJ as/IN a/DT traditional/JJ static/NN filter/NN for/IN processing/VBG a/DT synthetic/JJ dataset/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ concluded/VBN that/IN there/EX are/VBP still/RB unique/JJ features/NNS of/IN the/DT DCA/NNP left/VBD to/TO investigate/VB ./.
