In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP and/CC analyze/VBP reported/VBN failures/NNS of/IN artificially/RB intelligent/JJ systems/NNS and/CC extrapolate/VBP our/PRP$ analysis/NN to/IN future/JJ AIs/NNS ./.
We/PRP suggest/VBP that/IN both/CC the/DT frequency/NN and/CC the/DT seriousness/NN of/IN future/JJ AI/NN failures/NNS will/MD steadily/RB increase/VB ./.
AI/NN Safety/NN can/MD be/VB improved/VBN based/VBN on/IN ideas/NNS developed/VBN by/IN cybersecurity/NN experts/NNS ./.
For/IN narrow/JJ AIs/NNS safety/NN failures/NNS are/VBP at/IN the/DT same/JJ ,/, moderate/JJ ,/, level/NN of/IN criticality/NN as/IN in/IN cybersecurity/NN ,/, however/RB for/IN general/JJ AI/NN ,/, failures/NNS have/VBP a/DT fundamentally/RB different/JJ impact/NN ./.
A/DT single/JJ failure/NN of/IN a/DT superintelligent/NN system/NN may/MD cause/VB a/DT catastrophic/JJ event/NN without/IN a/DT chance/NN for/IN recovery/NN ./.
The/DT goal/NN of/IN cybersecurity/NN is/VBZ to/TO reduce/VB the/DT number/NN of/IN successful/JJ attacks/NNS on/IN the/DT system/NN ;/: the/DT goal/NN of/IN AI/NN Safety/NN is/VBZ to/TO make/VB sure/JJ zero/CD attacks/NNS succeed/VBP in/IN bypassing/VBG the/DT safety/NN mechanisms/NNS ./.
