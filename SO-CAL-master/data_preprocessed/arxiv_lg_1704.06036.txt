The/DT Correlation/NN Filter/NN is/VBZ an/DT algorithm/NN that/WDT trains/VBZ a/DT linear/JJ template/NN to/TO discriminate/VB between/IN images/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ translations/NNS ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ well/RB suited/JJ to/IN object/NN tracking/NN because/IN its/PRP$ formulation/NN in/IN the/DT Fourier/NNP domain/NN provides/VBZ a/DT fast/JJ solution/NN ,/, enabling/VBG the/DT detector/NN to/TO be/VB re-trained/VBN once/RB per/IN frame/NN ./.
Previous/JJ works/NNS that/WDT use/VBP the/DT Correlation/NN Filter/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, have/VBP adopted/VBN features/NNS that/WDT were/VBD either/CC manually/RB designed/VBN or/CC trained/VBN for/IN a/DT different/JJ task/NN ./.
This/DT work/NN is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ to/TO overcome/VB this/DT limitation/NN by/IN interpreting/VBG the/DT Correlation/NN Filter/NN learner/NN ,/, which/WDT has/VBZ a/DT closed/JJ -/HYPH form/NN solution/NN ,/, as/IN a/DT differentiable/JJ layer/NN in/IN a/DT deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN ./.
This/DT enables/VBZ learning/VBG deep/JJ features/NNS that/WDT are/VBP tightly/RB coupled/VBN to/IN the/DT Correlation/NN Filter/NN ./.
