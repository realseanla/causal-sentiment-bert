This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT mining/NN of/IN class/NN association/NN rules/NNS with/IN rough/JJ set/NN approach/NN ./.
In/IN data/NNS mining/NN ,/, an/DT association/NN occurs/VBZ between/IN two/CD set/NN of/IN elements/NNS when/WRB one/CD element/NN set/VBD happen/VB together/RB with/IN another/DT ./.
A/DT class/NN association/NN rule/NN set/NN (/-LRB- CARs/NNS )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT subset/NN of/IN association/NN rules/NNS with/IN classes/NNS specified/VBN as/IN their/PRP$ consequences/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP an/DT efficient/JJ algorithm/NN for/IN mining/VBG the/DT finest/JJS class/NN rule/NN set/VBN inspired/VBN form/NN Apriori/NNP algorithm/NN ,/, where/WRB the/DT support/NN and/CC confidence/NN are/VBP computed/VBN based/VBN on/IN the/DT elementary/JJ set/NN of/IN lower/JJR approximation/NN included/VBD in/IN the/DT property/NN of/IN rough/JJ set/NN theory/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/VBN approach/NN has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN very/RB effective/JJ ,/, where/WRB the/DT rough/JJ set/NN approach/NN for/IN class/NN association/NN discovery/NN is/VBZ much/JJ simpler/JJR than/IN the/DT classic/JJ association/NN method/NN ./.
