This/DT paper/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN modeling/VBG ride/NN requests/NNS and/CC their/PRP$ variations/NNS over/IN location/NN and/CC time/NN ,/, based/VBN on/IN analyzing/VBG extensive/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN data/NNS from/IN a/DT ride/NN -/HYPH sharing/NN service/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT graph/NN model/NN that/WDT captures/VBZ the/DT spatial/JJ and/CC temporal/JJ variability/NN of/IN ride/NN requests/NNS and/CC the/DT potentials/NNS for/IN ride/NN pooling/VBG ./.
We/PRP discover/VBP these/DT ride/NN request/NN graphs/NNS exhibit/VBP a/DT well/RB known/JJ property/NN called/VBN densification/NN power/NN law/NN often/RB found/VBN in/IN real/JJ graphs/NNS modelling/VBG human/JJ behaviors/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP the/DT pattern/NN of/IN ride/NN requests/NNS and/CC the/DT potential/NN of/IN ride/NN pooling/VBG for/IN a/DT city/NN can/MD be/VB characterized/VBN by/IN the/DT densification/NN factor/NN of/IN the/DT ride/NN request/NN graphs/NNS ./.
Previous/JJ works/NNS have/VBP shown/VBN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO automatically/RB generate/VB synthetic/JJ versions/NNS of/IN these/DT graphs/NNS that/WDT exhibit/VBP a/DT given/VBN densification/NN factor/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP an/DT algorithm/NN for/IN automatic/JJ generation/NN of/IN synthetic/JJ ride/NN request/NN graphs/NNS that/WDT match/VBP quite/RB well/RB the/DT densification/NN factor/NN of/IN ride/NN request/NN graphs/NNS from/IN actual/JJ ride/NN request/NN data/NNS ./.
