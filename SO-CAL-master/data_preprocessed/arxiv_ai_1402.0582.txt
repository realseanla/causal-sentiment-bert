We/PRP address/VBP a/DT dynamic/JJ repair/NN shop/NN scheduling/NN problem/NN in/IN the/DT context/NN of/IN military/JJ aircraft/NN fleet/NN management/NN where/WRB the/DT goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO maintain/VB a/DT full/JJ complement/NN of/IN aircraft/NN over/IN the/DT long/JJ -/HYPH term/NN ./.
A/DT number/NN of/IN flights/NNS ,/, each/DT with/IN a/DT requirement/NN for/IN a/DT specific/JJ number/NN and/CC type/NN of/IN aircraft/NN ,/, are/VBP already/RB scheduled/VBN over/IN a/DT long/JJ horizon/NN ./.
We/PRP need/VBP to/TO assign/VB aircraft/NN to/IN flights/NNS and/CC schedule/NN repair/NN activities/NNS while/IN considering/VBG the/DT flights/NNS requirements/NNS ,/, repair/NN capacity/NN ,/, and/CC aircraft/NN failures/NNS ./.
The/DT number/NN of/IN aircraft/NN awaiting/VBG repair/NN dynamically/RB changes/VBZ over/IN time/NN due/IN to/IN failures/NNS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ therefore/RB necessary/JJ to/TO rebuild/VB the/DT repair/NN schedule/NN online/NN ./.
To/TO solve/VB the/DT problem/NN ,/, we/PRP view/VBP the/DT dynamic/JJ repair/NN shop/NN as/IN successive/JJ static/NN repair/NN scheduling/NN sub-problems/NNS over/IN shorter/JJR time/NN periods/NNS ./.
