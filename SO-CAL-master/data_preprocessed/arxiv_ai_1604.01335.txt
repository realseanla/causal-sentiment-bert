Residual/JJ learning/NN has/VBZ recently/RB surfaced/VBN as/IN an/DT effective/JJ means/NNS of/IN constructing/VBG very/RB deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS for/IN object/NN recognition/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, current/JJ incarnations/NNS of/IN residual/JJ networks/NNS do/VBP not/RB allow/VB for/IN the/DT modeling/NN and/CC integration/NN of/IN complex/JJ relations/NNS between/IN closely/RB coupled/VBN recognition/NN tasks/NNS or/CC across/IN domains/NNS ./.
Such/JJ problems/NNS are/VBP often/RB encountered/VBN in/IN multimedia/NNS and/CC vision/NN applications/NNS involving/VBG large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN content/NN recognition/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ extension/NN of/IN residual/JJ learning/NN for/IN deep/JJ networks/NNS that/WDT enables/VBZ intuitive/JJ learning/NN across/IN multiple/JJ related/JJ tasks/NNS using/VBG cross-connections/NNS called/VBN cross-residuals/NNS ./.
These/DT cross-residuals/NNS connections/NNS can/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT form/NN of/IN in/IN -/HYPH network/NN regularization/NN and/CC enables/VBZ greater/JJR network/NN generalization/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP how/WRB cross-residual/JJ learning/NN (/-LRB- CRL/NN )/-RRB- can/MD be/VB integrated/VBN in/IN multitask/JJ networks/NNS to/TO jointly/RB train/VB and/CC detect/VB visual/JJ concepts/NNS across/IN several/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT single/JJ multitask/NN cross-residual/JJ network/NN with/IN &gt;/SYM 40/CD percent/NN less/RBR parameters/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO achieve/VB competitive/JJ ,/, or/CC even/RB better/JJR ,/, detection/NN performance/NN on/IN a/DT visual/JJ sentiment/NN concept/NN detection/NN problem/NN normally/RB requiring/VBG multiple/JJ specialized/JJ single/JJ -/HYPH task/NN networks/NNS ./.
The/DT resulting/VBG multitask/JJ cross-residual/JJ network/NN also/RB achieves/VBZ better/JJR detection/NN performance/NN by/IN about/IN 10.4/CD percent/NN over/IN a/DT standard/JJ multitask/JJ residual/JJ network/NN without/IN cross-residuals/NNS with/IN even/RB a/DT small/JJ amount/NN of/IN cross-task/NN weighting/NN ./.
