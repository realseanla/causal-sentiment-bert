The/DT paper/NN analyzes/VBZ dynamic/JJ epistemic/JJ logic/NN from/IN a/DT topological/JJ perspective/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ contribution/NN consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT framework/NN in/IN which/WDT dynamic/JJ epistemic/JJ logic/NN satisfies/VBZ the/DT requirements/NNS for/IN being/VBG a/DT topological/JJ dynamical/JJ system/NN thus/RB interfacing/VBG discrete/JJ dynamic/JJ logics/NNS with/IN continuous/JJ mappings/NNS of/IN dynamical/JJ systems/NNS ./.
The/DT setting/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN a/DT notion/NN of/IN logical/JJ convergence/NN ,/, demonstratively/RB equivalent/JJ with/IN convergence/NN in/IN Stone/NNP topology/NN ./.
