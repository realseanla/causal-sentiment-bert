We/PRP study/VBP hedonic/JJ games/NNS with/IN dichotomous/JJ preferences/NNS ./.
Hedonic/JJ games/NNS are/VBP cooperative/JJ games/NNS in/IN which/WDT players/NNS desire/VBP to/TO form/VB coalitions/NNS ,/, but/CC only/RB care/VB about/IN the/DT makeup/NN of/IN the/DT coalitions/NNS of/IN which/WDT they/PRP are/VBP members/NNS ;/: they/PRP are/VBP indifferent/JJ about/IN the/DT makeup/NN of/IN other/JJ coalitions/NNS ./.
The/DT assumption/NN of/IN dichotomous/JJ preferences/NNS means/VBZ that/IN ,/, additionally/RB ,/, each/DT player/NN 's/POS preference/NN relation/NN partitions/NNS the/DT set/NN of/IN coalitions/NNS of/IN which/WDT that/WDT player/NN is/VBZ a/DT member/NN into/IN just/RB two/CD equivalence/NN classes/NNS :/: satisfactory/JJ and/CC unsatisfactory/JJ ./.
A/DT player/NN is/VBZ indifferent/JJ between/IN satisfactory/JJ coalitions/NNS ,/, and/CC is/VBZ indifferent/JJ between/IN unsatisfactory/JJ coalitions/NNS ,/, but/CC strictly/RB prefers/VBZ any/DT satisfactory/JJ coalition/NN over/IN any/DT unsatisfactory/JJ coalition/NN ./.
We/PRP develop/VBP a/DT succinct/JJ representation/NN for/IN such/JJ games/NNS ,/, in/IN which/WDT each/DT player/NN 's/POS preference/NN relation/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN by/IN a/DT propositional/JJ formula/NN ./.
We/PRP show/VBP how/WRB solution/NN concepts/NNS for/IN hedonic/JJ games/NNS with/IN dichotomous/JJ preferences/NNS are/VBP characterised/VBN by/IN propositional/JJ formulas/NNS ./.
