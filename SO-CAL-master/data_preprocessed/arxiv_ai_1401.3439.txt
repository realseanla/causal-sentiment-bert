The/DT algorithm/NN selects/VBZ demonstrations/NNS based/VBN on/IN a/DT measure/NN of/IN action/NN selection/NN confidence/NN ,/, and/CC our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN using/VBG Confident/JJ Execution/NN the/DT agent/NN requires/VBZ fewer/JJR demonstrations/NNS to/TO learn/VB the/DT policy/NN than/IN when/WRB demonstrations/NNS are/VBP selected/VBN by/IN a/DT human/JJ teacher/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ algorithmic/JJ component/NN ,/, Corrective/JJ Demonstration/NN ,/, enables/VBZ the/DT teacher/NN to/TO correct/VB any/DT mistakes/NNS made/VBN by/IN the/DT agent/NN through/IN additional/JJ demonstrations/NNS in/IN order/NN to/TO improve/VB the/DT policy/NN and/CC future/JJ task/NN performance/NN ./.
