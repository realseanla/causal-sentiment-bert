A/DT standard/JJ assumption/NN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN is/VBZ the/DT exchangeability/NN of/IN data/NNS ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ equivalent/JJ to/IN assuming/VBG that/IN the/DT examples/NNS are/VBP generated/VBN from/IN the/DT same/JJ probability/NN distribution/NN independently/RB ./.
This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ devoted/VBN to/IN testing/VBG the/DT assumption/NN of/IN exchangeability/NN on/IN -/HYPH line/NN :/: the/DT examples/NNS arrive/VBP one/CD by/IN one/CD ,/, and/CC after/IN receiving/VBG each/DT example/NN we/PRP would/MD like/VB to/TO have/VB a/DT valid/JJ measure/NN of/IN the/DT degree/NN to/TO which/WDT the/DT assumption/NN of/IN exchangeability/NN has/VBZ been/VBN falsified/VBN ./.
Such/JJ measures/NNS are/VBP provided/VBN by/IN exchangeability/NN martingales/NNS ./.
We/PRP extend/VBP known/JJ techniques/NNS for/IN constructing/VBG exchangeability/NN martingales/NNS and/CC show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ new/JJ method/NN is/VBZ competitive/JJ with/IN the/DT martingales/NNS introduced/VBN before/RB ./.
Finally/RB we/PRP investigate/VB the/DT performance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ testing/NN method/NN on/IN two/CD benchmark/NN datasets/NNS ,/, USPS/NNP and/CC Statlog/NNP Satellite/NNP data/NNS ;/: for/IN the/DT former/JJ ,/, the/DT known/JJ techniques/NNS give/VBP satisfactory/JJ results/NNS ,/, but/CC for/IN the/DT latter/JJ our/PRP$ new/JJ more/JJR flexible/JJ method/NN becomes/VBZ necessary/JJ ./.
