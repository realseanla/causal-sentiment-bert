Ground/NNP vehicles/NNS equipped/VBN with/IN monocular/JJ vision/NN systems/NNS are/VBP a/DT valuable/JJ source/NN of/IN high/JJ resolution/NN image/NN data/NNS for/IN precision/NN agriculture/NN applications/NNS in/IN orchards/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ an/DT image/NN processing/NN framework/NN for/IN fruit/NN detection/NN and/CC counting/NN using/VBG orchard/NN image/NN data/NNS ./.
A/DT general/JJ purpose/NN image/NN segmentation/NN approach/NN is/VBZ used/VBN ,/, including/VBG two/CD feature/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS ;/: multi-scale/JJ Multi-Layered/JJ Perceptrons/NNS (/-LRB- MLP/NN )/-RRB- and/CC Convolutional/JJ Neural/JJ Networks/NNS (/-LRB- CNN/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
These/DT networks/NNS were/VBD extended/VBN by/IN including/VBG contextual/JJ information/NN about/IN how/WRB the/DT image/NN data/NNS was/VBD captured/VBN (/-LRB- metadata/NN )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT correlates/VBZ with/IN some/DT of/IN the/DT appearance/NN variations/NNS and/CC //HYPH or/CC class/NN distributions/NNS observed/VBN in/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
The/DT pixel-wise/JJ fruit/NN segmentation/NN output/NN is/VBZ processed/VBN using/VBG the/DT Watershed/NNP Segmentation/NNP (/-LRB- WS/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Circular/NNP Hough/NNP Transform/NNP (/-LRB- CHT/NNP )/-RRB- algorithms/NNS to/TO detect/VB and/CC count/VB individual/JJ fruits/NNS ./.
Experiments/NNS were/VBD conducted/VBN in/IN a/DT commercial/JJ apple/NN orchard/NN near/IN Melbourne/NNP ,/, Australia/NNP ./.
The/DT results/NNS show/VBP an/DT improvement/NN in/IN fruit/NN segmentation/NN performance/NN with/IN the/DT inclusion/NN of/IN metadata/NN on/IN the/DT previously/RB benchmarked/VBN MLP/NNP network/NN ./.
We/PRP extend/VBP this/DT work/NN with/IN CNNs/NNS ,/, bringing/VBG agrovision/RB closer/JJR to/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN in/IN computer/NN vision/NN ,/, where/WRB although/IN metadata/NN had/VBD negligible/JJ influence/NN ,/, the/DT best/JJS pixel-wise/JJ F1/NN -/HYPH score/NN of/IN $/$ 0.791/CD $/$ was/VBD achieved/VBN ./.
The/DT WS/NNP algorithm/NN produced/VBD the/DT best/JJS apple/NN detection/NN and/CC counting/NN results/NNS ,/, with/IN a/DT detection/NN F1/NN -/HYPH score/NN of/IN $/$ 0.858/CD $/$ ./.
As/IN a/DT final/JJ step/NN ,/, image/NN fruit/NN counts/NNS were/VBD accumulated/VBN over/IN multiple/JJ rows/NNS at/IN the/DT orchard/NN and/CC compared/VBN against/IN the/DT post-harvest/JJ fruit/NN counts/NNS that/WDT were/VBD obtained/VBN from/IN a/DT grading/NN and/CC counting/VBG machine/NN ./.
The/DT count/NN estimates/NNS using/VBG CNN/NNP and/CC WS/NNP resulted/VBD in/IN the/DT best/JJS performance/NN for/IN this/DT dataset/NN ,/, with/IN a/DT squared/JJ correlation/NN coefficient/NN of/IN $/$ r/LS ^/SYM 2/CD =/SYM 0.826/CD $/$ ./.
