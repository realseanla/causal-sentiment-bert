Inspired/VBN by/IN recent/JJ successes/NNS of/IN deep/JJ learning/NN in/IN computer/NN vision/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ application/NN of/IN deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS to/IN facial/JJ expression/NN recognition/NN ,/, in/IN particular/JJ smile/NN recognition/NN ./.
A/DT smile/NN recognition/NN test/NN accuracy/NN of/IN 99.45/CD percent/NN is/VBZ achieved/VBN for/IN the/DT Denver/NNP Intensity/NN of/IN Spontaneous/JJ Facial/JJ Action/NN (/-LRB- DISFA/NN )/-RRB- database/NN ,/, significantly/RB outperforming/VBG existing/VBG approaches/NNS based/VBN on/IN hand/NN -/HYPH crafted/VBN features/NNS with/IN accuracies/NNS ranging/VBG from/IN 65.55/CD percent/NN to/IN 79.67/CD percent/NN ./.
The/DT novelty/NN of/IN this/DT approach/NN includes/VBZ a/DT comprehensive/JJ model/NN selection/NN of/IN the/DT architecture/NN parameters/NNS ,/, allowing/VBG to/TO find/VB an/DT appropriate/JJ architecture/NN for/IN each/DT expression/NN such/JJ as/IN smile/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ feasible/JJ because/IN all/DT experiments/NNS were/VBD run/VBN on/IN a/DT Tesla/NNP K40c/NN GPU/NNP ,/, allowing/VBG a/DT speedup/NN of/IN factor/NN 10/CD over/IN traditional/JJ computations/NNS on/IN a/DT CPU/NN ./.
