In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP proposed/VBD two/CD different/JJ approaches/NNS ,/, a/DT rule/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN and/CC a/DT machine/NN -/HYPH learning/NN based/VBN approach/NN ,/, to/TO identify/VB active/JJ heart/NN failure/NN cases/NNS automatically/RB by/IN analyzing/VBG electronic/JJ health/NN records/NNS (/-LRB- EHR/NN )/-RRB- ./.
For/IN the/DT rule/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN ,/, we/PRP extracted/VBD cardiovascular/JJ data/NNS elements/NNS from/IN clinical/JJ notes/NNS and/CC matched/VBN patients/NNS to/IN different/JJ colors/NNS according/VBG their/PRP$ heart/NN failure/NN condition/NN by/IN using/VBG rules/NNS provided/VBN by/IN experts/NNS in/IN heart/NN failure/NN ./.
It/PRP achieved/VBD 69.4/CD percent/NN accuracy/NN and/CC 0.729/CD F1/NN -/HYPH Score/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT machine/NN learning/NN approach/NN ,/, with/IN bigram/NN of/IN clinical/JJ notes/NNS as/IN features/NNS ,/, we/PRP tried/VBD four/CD different/JJ models/NNS while/IN SVM/NN with/IN linear/JJ kernel/NN achieved/VBD the/DT best/JJS performance/NN with/IN 87.5/CD percent/NN accuracy/NN and/CC 0.86/CD F1/NN -/HYPH Score/NN ./.

Once/IN we/PRP combine/VBP the/DT machine/NN -/HYPH learning/NN and/CC rule/NN -/HYPH based/VBN algorithms/NNS ,/, we/PRP will/MD enable/VB hospital/NN -/HYPH wide/JJ surveillance/NN of/IN active/JJ heart/NN failure/NN through/IN increased/VBN accuracy/NN and/CC interpretability/NN of/IN the/DT outputs/NNS ./.
