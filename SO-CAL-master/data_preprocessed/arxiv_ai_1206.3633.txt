In/IN the/DT recent/JJ advancement/NN of/IN multimedia/NNS technologies/NNS ,/, it/PRP becomes/VBZ a/DT major/JJ concern/NN of/IN detecting/VBG visual/JJ attention/NN regions/NNS in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN image/NN processing/NN ./.
The/DT popularity/NN of/IN the/DT terminal/JJ devices/NNS in/IN a/DT heterogeneous/JJ environment/NN of/IN the/DT multimedia/NNS technology/NN gives/VBZ us/PRP enough/JJ scope/NN for/IN the/DT betterment/NN of/IN image/NN visualization/NN ./.
Although/IN there/EX exist/VBP numerous/JJ methods/NNS ,/, feature/NN based/VBN image/NN extraction/NN becomes/VBZ a/DT popular/JJ one/NN in/IN the/DT field/NN of/IN image/NN processing/NN ./.
The/DT objective/NN of/IN image/NN segmentation/NN is/VBZ the/DT domain/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ partition/NN of/IN the/DT image/NN into/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN regions/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP visually/RB distinct/JJ and/CC uniform/JJ with/IN respect/NN to/IN some/DT property/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN grey/JJ level/NN ,/, texture/NN or/CC colour/NN ./.

Its/PRP$ application/NN area/NN encompasses/VBZ mobile/JJ devices/NNS ,/, industrial/JJ quality/NN control/NN ,/, medical/JJ appliances/NNS ,/, robot/NN navigation/NN ,/, geophysical/JJ exploration/NN ,/, military/JJ applications/NNS ,/, etc/FW ./.
In/IN all/PDT these/DT areas/NNS ,/, the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT final/JJ results/NNS depends/VBZ largely/RB on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT preprocessing/JJ work/NN ./.

We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT feature/NN based/VBN fuzzy/JJ rule/NN guided/VBN novel/JJ technique/NN that/WDT is/VBZ functionally/RB devoid/JJ of/IN any/DT external/JJ intervention/NN during/IN execution/NN ./.

In/IN order/NN to/TO justify/VB the/DT supremacy/NN of/IN performance/NN of/IN our/PRP$ proposed/VBN technique/NN in/IN respect/NN of/IN its/PRP$ competitors/NNS ,/, we/PRP take/VBP recourse/NN to/IN effective/JJ metrics/NNS like/IN Mean/NNP Squared/NNP Error/NNP (/-LRB- MSE/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, Mean/NNP Absolute/NNP Error/NNP (/-LRB- MAE/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC Peak/NN Signal/VBP to/IN Noise/NN Ratio/NN (/-LRB- PSNR/NNP )/-RRB- ./.
