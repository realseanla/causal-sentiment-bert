It/PRP is/VBZ widely/RB acknowledged/VBN that/DT function/NN symbols/NNS are/VBP an/DT important/JJ feature/NN in/IN answer/NN set/VBN programming/NN ,/, as/IN they/PRP make/VBP modeling/VBG easier/JJR ,/, increase/VB the/DT expressive/JJ power/NN ,/, and/CC allow/VB us/PRP to/TO deal/VB with/IN infinite/JJ domains/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ issue/NN with/IN their/PRP$ introduction/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT evaluation/NN of/IN a/DT program/NN might/MD not/RB terminate/VB and/CC checking/VBG whether/IN it/PRP terminates/VBZ or/CC not/RB is/VBZ undecidable/JJ ./.
To/TO cope/VB with/IN this/DT problem/NN ,/, several/JJ classes/NNS of/IN logic/NN programs/NNS have/VBP been/VBN proposed/VBN where/WRB the/DT use/NN of/IN function/NN symbols/NNS is/VBZ restricted/VBN but/CC the/DT program/NN evaluation/NN termination/NN is/VBZ guaranteed/VBN ./.
