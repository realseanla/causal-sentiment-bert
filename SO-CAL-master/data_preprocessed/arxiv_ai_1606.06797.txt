This/DT extended/VBD abstract/JJ presents/VBZ an/DT overview/NN on/IN NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ optimization/NN problems/NNS with/IN multiple/JJ interdependent/JJ components/NNS ./.
These/DT problems/NNS occur/VBP in/IN many/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN applications/NNS :/: industrial/JJ applications/NNS ,/, engineering/NN ,/, and/CC logistics/NNS ./.
The/DT fact/NN that/IN these/DT problems/NNS are/VBP composed/VBN of/IN many/JJ sub-problems/NNS that/WDT are/VBP NP/NNP -/HYPH hard/JJ makes/VBZ them/PRP even/RB more/RBR challenging/JJ to/TO solve/VB using/VBG exact/JJ algorithms/NNS ./.
This/DT is/VBZ mainly/RB due/IN to/IN the/DT high/JJ complexity/NN of/IN this/DT class/NN of/IN algorithms/NNS and/CC the/DT hardness/NN of/IN the/DT problems/NNS themselves/PRP ./.
The/DT main/JJ source/NN of/IN difficulty/NN of/IN these/DT problems/NNS is/VBZ the/DT presence/NN of/IN internal/JJ dependencies/NNS between/IN sub-problems/NNS ./.
This/DT aspect/NN of/IN interdependence/NN of/IN components/NNS is/VBZ presented/VBN ,/, and/CC some/DT outlines/VBZ on/IN solving/VBG approaches/NNS are/VBP briefly/RB introduced/VBN from/IN a/DT (/-LRB- meta/NN )/-RRB- heuristics/NNS and/CC evolutionary/JJ computation/NN perspective/NN ./.
