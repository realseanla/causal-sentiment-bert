The/DT Generational/NNP Garbage/NNP collection/NN involves/VBZ organizing/VBG the/DT heap/NN into/IN different/JJ divisions/NNS of/IN memory/NN space/NN in/IN -/HYPH order/NN to/TO filter/VB long/JJ -/HYPH lived/JJ objects/NNS from/IN short/JJ -/HYPH lived/JJ objects/NNS through/IN moving/VBG the/DT surviving/VBG object/NN of/IN each/DT generation/NN Garbage/NNP Collection/NNP cycle/NN to/IN another/DT memory/NN space/NN updating/VBG its/PRP$ age/NN and/CC reclaiming/VBG space/NN from/IN the/DT dead/JJ ones/NNS ./.
The/DT problem/NN in/IN this/DT method/NN is/VBZ that/IN the/DT longer/RBR an/DT object/NN is/VBZ alive/JJ during/IN its/PRP$ initial/JJ generations/NNS the/DT longer/RBR the/DT garbage/NN collector/NN will/MD have/VB to/TO deal/VB with/IN it/PRP by/IN checking/VBG for/IN its/PRP$ reachability/NN from/IN the/DT root/NN and/CC promoting/VBG it/PRP to/IN other/JJ space/NN divisions/NNS where/WRB as/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ goal/NN of/IN the/DT Garbage/NNP Collector/NNP is/VBZ to/TO reclaim/VB memory/NN from/IN unreachable/JJ objects/NNS at/IN a/DT minimal/JJ time/NN possible/JJ ./.
This/DT paper/NN is/VBZ a/DT proposal/NN of/IN a/DT method/NN where/WRB the/DT lifetime/NN of/IN every/DT object/NN getting/VBG into/IN the/DT heap/NN will/MD be/VB predicted/VBN and/CC will/MD be/VB placed/VBN in/IN heap/NN accordingly/RB for/IN the/DT garbage/NN collector/NN to/TO deal/VB more/JJR with/IN reclaiming/VBG space/NN from/IN dead/JJ objects/NNS and/CC less/JJR in/IN promoting/VBG the/DT live/JJ ones/NNS to/IN the/DT higher/JJR level/NN ./.
