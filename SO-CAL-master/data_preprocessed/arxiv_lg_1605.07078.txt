Recent/JJ progress/NN on/IN many/JJ imaging/NN and/CC vision/NN tasks/NNS has/VBZ been/VBN driven/VBN by/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN deep/JJ feed/NN -/HYPH forward/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, which/WDT are/VBP trained/VBN by/IN propagating/VBG gradients/NNS of/IN a/DT loss/NN defined/VBN on/IN the/DT final/JJ output/NN ,/, back/RB through/IN the/DT network/NN up/RP to/IN the/DT first/JJ layer/NN that/WDT operates/VBZ directly/RB on/IN the/DT image/NN ./.
We/PRP propose/VBP back/RB -/HYPH propagating/VBG one/CD step/NN further/RBR ---/: to/TO learn/VB camera/NN sensor/NN designs/NNS jointly/RB with/IN networks/NNS that/WDT carry/VBP out/RP inference/NN on/IN the/DT images/NNS they/PRP capture/VBP ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP specifically/RB consider/VBP the/DT design/NN and/CC inference/NN problems/NNS in/IN a/DT typical/JJ color/NN camera/NN ---/, where/WRB the/DT sensor/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO measure/VB only/RB one/CD color/NN channel/NN at/IN each/DT pixel/NN location/NN ,/, and/CC computational/JJ inference/NN is/VBZ required/VBN to/TO reconstruct/VB a/DT full/JJ color/NN image/NN ./.
We/PRP learn/VBP the/DT camera/NN sensor/NN 's/POS color/NN multiplexing/VBG pattern/NN by/IN encoding/VBG it/PRP as/IN layer/NN whose/WP$ learnable/JJ weights/NNS determine/VB which/WDT color/NN channel/NN ,/, from/IN among/IN a/DT fixed/VBN set/NN ,/, will/MD be/VB measured/VBN at/IN each/DT location/NN ./.
These/DT weights/NNS are/VBP jointly/RB trained/VBN with/IN those/DT of/IN a/DT reconstruction/NN network/NN that/WDT operates/VBZ on/IN the/DT corresponding/VBG sensor/NN measurements/NNS to/TO produce/VB a/DT full/JJ color/NN image/NN ./.
