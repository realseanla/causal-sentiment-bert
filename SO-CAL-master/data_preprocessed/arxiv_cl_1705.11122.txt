Learning/VBG meaningful/JJ representations/NNS that/WDT maintain/VBP the/DT content/NN necessary/JJ for/IN a/DT particular/JJ task/NN while/IN filtering/VBG away/RB detrimental/JJ variations/NNS is/VBZ a/DT problem/NN of/IN great/JJ interest/NN in/IN machine/NN learning/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP tackle/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN learning/VBG representations/NNS invariant/JJ to/IN a/DT specific/JJ factor/NN or/CC trait/NN of/IN data/NNS ,/, leading/VBG to/IN better/JJR generalization/NN ./.
The/DT representation/NN learning/NN process/NN is/VBZ formulated/VBN as/IN an/DT adversarial/JJ minimax/NN game/NN ./.
We/PRP analyze/VBP the/DT optimal/JJ equilibrium/NN of/IN such/PDT a/DT game/NN and/CC find/VB that/IN it/PRP amounts/VBZ to/IN maximizing/VBG the/DT uncertainty/NN of/IN inferring/VBG the/DT detrimental/JJ factor/NN given/VBN the/DT representation/NN while/IN maximizing/VBG the/DT certainty/NN of/IN making/VBG task/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ predictions/NNS ./.
On/IN three/CD benchmark/NN tasks/NNS ,/, namely/RB fair/JJ and/CC bias/NN -/HYPH free/JJ classification/NN ,/, language/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ generation/NN ,/, and/CC lighting/NN -/HYPH independent/JJ image/NN classification/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN framework/NN induces/VBZ an/DT invariant/JJ representation/NN ,/, and/CC leads/VBZ to/IN better/JJR generalization/NN evidenced/VBN by/IN the/DT improved/JJ test/NN performance/NN ./.
