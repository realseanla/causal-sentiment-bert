We/PRP offer/VBP a/DT new/JJ understanding/NN of/IN some/DT aspects/NNS of/IN practical/JJ SAT/NN -/HYPH solvers/NNS that/WDT are/VBP based/VBN on/IN DPLL/NN with/IN unit/NN -/HYPH clause/NN propagation/NN ,/, clause/NN -/HYPH learning/NN ,/, and/CC restarts/NNS ./.
We/PRP do/VBP so/RB by/IN analyzing/VBG a/DT concrete/JJ algorithm/NN which/WDT we/PRP claim/VBP is/VBZ faithful/JJ to/IN what/WP practical/JJ solvers/NNS do/VBP ./.
