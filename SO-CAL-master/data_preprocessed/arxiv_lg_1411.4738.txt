The/DT cross-media/JJ retrieval/NN problem/NN has/VBZ received/VBN much/JJ attention/NN in/IN recent/JJ years/NNS due/IN to/IN the/DT rapidly/RB increasing/VBG multimedia/NNS data/NNS on/IN the/DT Internet/NN ./.
A/DT new/JJ approach/NN to/IN the/DT problem/NN was/VBD raised/VBN which/WDT intends/VBZ to/TO match/VB the/DT different/JJ modal/JJ features/NNS directly/RB ./.
Thus/RB ,/, how/WRB to/TO get/VB rid/VBN of/IN the/DT heterogeneity/NN between/IN the/DT different/JJ modalities/NNS and/CC match/VB the/DT different/JJ modal/JJ features/NNS with/IN different/JJ dimensions/NNS become/VBP the/DT key/JJ points/NNS in/IN this/DT research/NN ./.
On/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN ,/, the/DT metric/JJ learning/NN shows/VBZ great/JJ power/NN to/TO learn/VB a/DT distance/NN metric/JJ to/TO explore/VB the/DT relationship/NN between/IN data/NNS points/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT traditional/JJ metric/JJ learning/NN algorithms/NNS are/VBP only/RB focusing/VBG on/IN one/CD modality/NN features/NNS ,/, which/WDT suffers/VBZ difficulties/NNS to/TO handle/VB the/DT heterogeneous/JJ features/NNS with/IN different/JJ dimensions/NNS ./.
Thus/RB ,/, in/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP proposed/VBD a/DT heterogeneous/JJ similarity/NN learning/VBG algorithm/NN based/VBN on/IN the/DT metric/JJ learning/NN for/IN the/DT cross-modal/JJ feature/NN matching/NN ./.
With/IN the/DT nuclear/JJ penalization/NN ,/, an/DT accelerated/VBN proximal/JJ gradient/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ successfully/RB imported/VBN to/TO find/VB the/DT optimal/JJ solution/NN with/IN the/DT fast/JJ convergence/NN rate/NN of/IN O/NN (/-LRB- 1/CD //SYM t/NN ^/SYM 2/CD )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP applied/VBD it/PRP to/IN the/DT image/NN -/HYPH text/NN cross-media/NN retrieval/NN problem/NN ,/, and/CC compared/VBN it/PRP with/IN several/JJ popular/JJ and/CC the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH art/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
