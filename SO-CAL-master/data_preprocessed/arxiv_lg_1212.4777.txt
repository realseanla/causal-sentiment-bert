Topic/NN models/NNS provide/VBP a/DT useful/JJ method/NN for/IN dimensionality/NN reduction/NN and/CC exploratory/JJ data/NNS analysis/NN in/IN large/JJ text/NN corpora/NNS ./.
Most/JJS approaches/NNS to/IN topic/NN model/NN inference/NN have/VBP been/VBN based/VBN on/IN a/DT maximum/JJ likelihood/NN objective/NN ./.
