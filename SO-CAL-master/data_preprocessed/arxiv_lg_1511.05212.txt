We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT hashing/VBG mechanism/NN for/IN constructing/VBG binary/JJ data/NNS embeddings/NNS ,/, that/IN involves/VBZ pseudo-random/NN projections/NNS followed/VBN by/IN nonlinear/JJ (/-LRB- sign/NN function/NN )/-RRB- mappings/NNS ./.
The/DT pseudo-random/NN projection/NN is/VBZ described/VBN by/IN a/DT matrix/NN ,/, where/WRB not/RB all/DT entries/NNS are/VBP independent/JJ random/JJ variables/NNS but/CC instead/RB a/DT fixed/VBN ''/'' budget/NN of/IN randomness/NN ''/'' is/VBZ distributed/VBN across/IN the/DT matrix/NN ./.
Such/JJ matrices/NNS can/MD be/VB efficiently/RB stored/VBN in/IN sub-quadratic/JJ or/CC even/RB linear/JJ space/NN ,/, provide/VB reduction/NN in/IN randomness/NN usage/NN (/-LRB- i.e./FW number/NN of/IN required/VBN random/JJ values/NNS )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC very/RB often/RB lead/VB to/IN computational/JJ speed/NN ups/NNS ./.
We/PRP prove/VBP several/JJ theoretical/JJ results/NNS showing/VBG that/IN projections/NNS via/IN various/JJ structured/JJ matrices/NNS followed/VBN by/IN nonlinear/JJ mappings/NNS accurately/RB preserve/VB the/DT angular/JJ distance/NN between/IN input/NN high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ vectors/NNS ./.
To/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN our/PRP$ knowledge/NN ,/, these/DT results/NNS are/VBP the/DT first/JJ that/WDT give/VBP theoretical/JJ ground/NN for/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN general/JJ structured/JJ matrices/NNS in/IN the/DT nonlinear/JJ setting/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, they/PRP significantly/RB generalize/VBP previous/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN the/DT Johnson/NNP -/HYPH Lindenstrauss/NNP lemma/NNP and/CC prove/VB the/DT plausibility/NN of/IN the/DT approach/NN that/WDT was/VBD so/RB far/RB only/RB heuristically/RB confirmed/VBN for/IN some/DT special/JJ structured/JJ matrices/NNS ./.
Consequently/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN many/JJ structured/JJ matrices/NNS can/MD be/VB used/VBN as/IN an/DT efficient/JJ information/NN compression/NN mechanism/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ findings/NNS also/RB build/VBP a/DT better/JJR understanding/NN of/IN certain/JJ deep/JJ architectures/NNS ,/, which/WDT contain/VBP randomly/RB weighted/JJ and/CC untrained/JJ layers/NNS ,/, and/CC yet/RB achieve/VB high/JJ performance/NN on/IN different/JJ learning/NN tasks/NNS ./.
We/PRP are/VBP interested/JJ in/IN how/WRB the/DT action/NN of/IN random/JJ projection/NN followed/VBN by/IN non-linear/JJ transformation/NN may/MD influence/VB learning/NN ./.
We/PRP empirically/RB verify/VBP our/PRP$ theoretical/JJ findings/NNS and/CC show/VB the/DT dependence/NN of/IN learning/VBG via/IN structured/VBN hashed/JJ projections/NNS on/IN the/DT network/NN performance/NN ./.
