Improving/VBG distant/JJ speech/NN recognition/NN is/VBZ a/DT crucial/JJ step/NN towards/IN flexible/JJ human/JJ -/HYPH machine/NN interfaces/VBZ ./.
Current/JJ technology/NN ,/, however/RB ,/, still/RB exhibits/VBZ a/DT lack/NN of/IN robustness/NN ,/, especially/RB when/WRB adverse/JJ acoustic/JJ conditions/NNS are/VBP met/VBN ./.

To/TO address/VB this/DT concern/NN ,/, a/DT promising/JJ approach/NN consists/VBZ in/IN concatenating/VBG a/DT speech/NN enhancement/NN and/CC a/DT speech/NN recognition/NN deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN and/CC to/TO jointly/RB update/VB their/PRP$ parameters/NNS as/IN if/IN they/PRP were/VBD within/IN a/DT single/JJ bigger/JJR network/NN ./.
