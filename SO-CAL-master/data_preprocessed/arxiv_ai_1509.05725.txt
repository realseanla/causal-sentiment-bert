In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP extend/VBP the/DT classical/JJ notion/NN of/IN strong/JJ and/CC weak/JJ backdoor/NN sets/NNS by/IN allowing/VBG that/IN different/JJ instantiations/NNS of/IN the/DT backdoor/NN variables/NNS result/VBP in/IN instances/NNS that/WDT belong/VBP to/IN different/JJ base/NN classes/NNS ;/: the/DT union/NN of/IN the/DT base/NN classes/NNS forms/VBZ a/DT heterogeneous/JJ base/NN class/NN ./.
Backdoor/NNP sets/VBZ to/IN heterogeneous/JJ base/NN classes/NNS can/MD be/VB much/RB smaller/JJR than/IN backdoor/NN sets/NNS to/IN homogeneous/JJ ones/NNS ,/, hence/RB they/PRP are/VBP much/RB more/RBR desirable/JJ but/CC possibly/RB harder/RBR to/TO find/VB ./.
We/PRP draw/VBP a/DT detailed/JJ complexity/NN landscape/NN for/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN detecting/VBG strong/JJ and/CC weak/JJ backdoor/NN sets/NNS into/IN heterogeneous/JJ base/NN classes/NNS for/IN SAT/NNP and/CC CSP/NNP ./.
