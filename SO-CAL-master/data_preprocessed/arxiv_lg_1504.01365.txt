Stochastic/JJ Dual/JJ Coordinate/NNP Descent/NNP (/-LRB- SDCD/NNP )/-RRB- has/VBZ become/VBN one/CD of/IN the/DT most/RBS efficient/JJ ways/NNS to/TO solve/VB the/DT family/NN of/IN $/$ \/CD ell_2/CD $/$ -/HYPH regularized/VBN empirical/JJ risk/NN minimization/NN problems/NNS ,/, including/VBG linear/JJ SVM/NN ,/, logistic/JJ regression/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ others/NNS ./.
The/DT vanilla/NN implementation/NN of/IN DCD/NNP is/VBZ quite/RB slow/JJ ;/: however/RB ,/, by/IN maintaining/VBG primal/JJ variables/NNS while/IN updating/VBG dual/JJ variables/NNS ,/, the/DT time/NN complexity/NN of/IN SDCD/NN can/MD be/VB significantly/RB reduced/VBN ./.
