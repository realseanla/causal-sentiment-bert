The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ to/TO identify/VB a/DT probability/NN mass/NN function/NN associated/VBN with/IN a/DT discrete/JJ set/NN ,/, given/VBN an/DT infinite/JJ data/NN sequence/NN of/IN elements/NNS from/IN the/DT set/NN ./.

If/IN the/DT probability/NN mass/NN function/NN is/VBZ incomputable/JJ ,/, has/VBZ a/DT finite/JJ mean/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT drawing/NN is/VBZ i.i.d./NN ,/, then/RB there/EX is/VBZ an/DT algorithm/NN which/WDT pointwise/RB converges/VBZ to/IN the/DT target/NN almost/RB surely/RB ./.
