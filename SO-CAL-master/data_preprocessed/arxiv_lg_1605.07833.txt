In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP derive/VBP a/DT modified/VBN InfoMax/NNP algorithm/NN for/IN the/DT solution/NN of/IN Blind/NNP Signal/NNP Separation/NN (/-LRB- BSS/NN )/-RRB- problems/NNS by/IN using/VBG advanced/JJ stochastic/JJ methods/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN a/DT novel/JJ stochastic/JJ optimization/NN approach/NN known/VBN as/IN the/DT Adaptive/JJ Moment/NN Estimation/NN (/-LRB- Adam/NNP )/-RRB- algorithm/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN BSS/NN solution/NN can/MD benefit/VB from/IN the/DT excellent/JJ properties/NNS of/IN the/DT Adam/NNP approach/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO derive/VB the/DT new/JJ learning/NN rule/NN ,/, the/DT Adam/NNP algorithm/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN in/IN the/DT derivation/NN of/IN the/DT cost/NN function/NN maximization/NN in/IN the/DT standard/JJ InfoMax/NNP algorithm/NN ./.
The/DT natural/JJ gradient/NN adaptation/NN is/VBZ also/RB considered/VBN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, some/DT experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN the/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN ./.
