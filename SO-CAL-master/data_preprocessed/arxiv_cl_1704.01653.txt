Pre-aspiration/NN is/VBZ defined/VBN as/IN the/DT period/NN of/IN glottal/JJ friction/NN occurring/VBG in/IN sequences/NNS of/IN vocalic/NN //HYPH consonantal/JJ sonorants/NNS and/CC phonetically/RB voiceless/JJ obstruents/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP two/CD machine/NN learning/NN methods/NNS for/IN automatic/JJ measurement/NN of/IN pre-aspiration/NN duration/NN :/: feedforward/JJ neural/JJ network/NN ,/, which/WDT works/VBZ at/IN the/DT frame/NN level/NN ;/: and/CC structured/VBN prediction/NN model/NN ,/, which/WDT relies/VBZ on/IN manually/RB designed/VBN feature/NN functions/NNS ,/, and/CC works/VBZ at/IN the/DT segment/NN level/NN ./.
The/DT input/NN for/IN both/DT algorithms/NNS is/VBZ a/DT speech/NN signal/NN of/IN an/DT arbitrary/JJ length/NN containing/VBG a/DT single/JJ obstruent/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT output/NN is/VBZ a/DT pair/NN of/IN times/NNS which/WDT constitutes/VBZ the/DT pre-aspiration/NN boundaries/NNS ./.
We/PRP train/VBP both/DT models/NNS on/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN manually/RB annotated/VBN examples/NNS ./.
Results/NNS suggest/VBP that/IN the/DT structured/JJ model/NN is/VBZ superior/JJ to/IN the/DT frame/NN -/HYPH based/VBN model/NN as/IN it/PRP yields/VBZ higher/JJR accuracy/NN in/IN predicting/VBG the/DT boundaries/NNS and/CC generalizes/VBZ to/IN new/JJ speakers/NNS and/CC new/JJ languages/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP demonstrate/VBP the/DT applicability/NN of/IN our/PRP$ structured/JJ prediction/NN algorithm/NN by/IN replicating/VBG linguistic/JJ analysis/NN of/IN pre-aspiration/NN in/IN Aberystwyth/NNP English/NNP with/IN high/JJ correlation/NN ./.
