In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP the/DT Neural/JJ Knowledge/NN DNA/NN ,/, a/DT framework/NN that/WDT tailors/VBZ the/DT ideas/NNS underlying/VBG the/DT success/NN of/IN neural/JJ networks/NNS to/IN the/DT scope/NN of/IN knowledge/NN representation/NN ./.
Knowledge/NN representation/NN is/VBZ a/DT fundamental/JJ field/NN that/WDT dedicate/VBP to/IN representing/VBG information/NN about/IN the/DT world/NN in/IN a/DT form/NN that/WDT computer/NN systems/NNS can/MD utilize/VB to/TO solve/VB complex/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN Neural/JJ Knowledge/NN DNA/NN is/VBZ designed/VBN to/TO support/VB discovering/VBG ,/, storing/VBG ,/, reusing/VBG ,/, improving/VBG ,/, and/CC sharing/VBG knowledge/NN among/IN machines/NNS and/CC organisation/NN ./.

As/IN the/DT DNA/NN produces/VBZ phenotypes/NNS ,/, the/DT Neural/JJ Knowledge/NN DNA/NN carries/VBZ information/NN and/CC knowledge/NN via/IN its/PRP$ four/CD essential/JJ elements/NNS ,/, namely/RB ,/, Networks/NNS ,/, Experiences/NNPS ,/, States/NNPS ,/, and/CC Actions/NNS ./.
