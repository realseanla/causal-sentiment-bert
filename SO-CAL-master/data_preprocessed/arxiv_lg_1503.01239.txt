This/DT paper/NN focuses/VBZ on/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN simultaneous/JJ sample/NN and/CC feature/NN selection/NN for/IN machine/NN learning/NN in/IN a/DT fully/RB unsupervised/JJ setting/NN ./.
Though/IN most/JJS existing/JJ works/NNS tackle/VBP these/DT two/CD problems/NNS separately/RB that/WDT derives/VBZ two/CD well/RB -/HYPH studied/VBN sub-areas/NNS namely/RB active/JJ learning/NN and/CC feature/NN selection/NN ,/, a/DT unified/JJ approach/NN is/VBZ inspirational/JJ since/IN they/PRP are/VBP often/RB interleaved/VBN with/IN each/DT other/JJ ./.
Noisy/JJ and/CC high/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ features/NNS will/MD bring/VB adverse/JJ effect/NN on/IN sample/NN selection/NN ,/, while/IN `/`` good/JJ '/'' samples/NNS will/MD be/VB beneficial/JJ to/IN feature/NN selection/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT unified/VBN framework/NN to/TO conduct/VB active/JJ learning/NN and/CC feature/NN selection/NN simultaneously/RB ./.
From/IN the/DT data/NNS reconstruction/NN perspective/NN ,/, both/CC the/DT selected/VBN samples/NNS and/CC features/NNS can/MD best/RB approximate/VB the/DT original/JJ dataset/NN respectively/RB ,/, such/JJ that/IN the/DT selected/VBN samples/NNS characterized/VBN by/IN the/DT selected/VBN features/NNS are/VBP very/RB representative/JJ ./.
Additionally/RB our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ one/CD -/HYPH shot/NN without/IN iteratively/RB selecting/VBG samples/NNS for/IN progressive/JJ labeling/NN ./.
Thus/RB our/PRP$ model/NN is/VBZ especially/RB suitable/JJ when/WRB the/DT initial/JJ labeled/VBN samples/NNS are/VBP scarce/JJ or/CC totally/RB absent/JJ ,/, which/WDT existing/VBG works/NNS hardly/RB address/VBP particularly/RB for/IN simultaneous/JJ feature/NN selection/NN ./.
To/TO alleviate/VB the/DT NP/NN -/HYPH hardness/NN of/IN the/DT raw/JJ problem/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN formulation/NN involves/VBZ a/DT convex/NN but/CC non-smooth/JJ optimization/NN problem/NN ./.
We/PRP solve/VB it/PRP efficiently/RB by/IN an/DT iterative/JJ algorithm/NN ,/, and/CC prove/VB its/PRP$ global/JJ convergence/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN publicly/RB available/JJ datasets/NNS validate/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ promising/VBG compared/VBN with/IN the/DT state/NN -/HYPH of/IN -/HYPH the/DT -/HYPH arts/NNS ./.
