Searching/VBG the/DT complete/JJ space/NN of/IN possible/JJ Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS is/VBZ intractable/JJ for/IN problems/NNS of/IN interesting/JJ size/NN ,/, so/RB Bayesian/JJ network/NN structure/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN the/DT commonly/RB used/VBN Sparse/JJ Candidate/NN algorithm/NN ,/, employ/VB heuristics/NNS ./.
