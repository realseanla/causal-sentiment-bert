This/DT work/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN regret/NN minimization/NN in/IN non-stochastic/JJ multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN problems/NNS ,/, focusing/VBG on/IN performance/NN guarantees/NNS that/WDT hold/VBP with/IN high/JJ probability/NN ./.
Such/JJ results/NNS are/VBP rather/RB scarce/JJ in/IN the/DT literature/NN since/IN proving/VBG them/PRP requires/VBZ a/DT large/JJ deal/NN of/IN technical/JJ effort/NN and/CC significant/JJ modifications/NNS to/IN the/DT standard/NN ,/, more/RBR intuitive/JJ algorithms/NNS that/WDT come/VBP only/RB with/IN guarantees/NNS that/WDT hold/VBP on/RP expectation/NN ./.
One/CD of/IN these/DT modifications/NNS is/VBZ forcing/VBG the/DT learner/NN to/IN sample/NN the/DT losses/NNS of/IN every/DT arm/NN at/IN least/JJS $/$ \/SYM Omega/NN (/-LRB- \/SYM sqrt/NN {/-LRB- T/NN }/-RRB- )/-RRB- $/$ times/NNS over/IN $/$ T$/CD rounds/NNS ,/, which/WDT can/MD adversely/RB affect/VB performance/NN if/IN many/JJ of/IN the/DT arms/NNS are/VBP obviously/RB suboptimal/JJ ./.
While/IN it/PRP is/VBZ widely/RB conjectured/VBN that/IN this/DT property/NN is/VBZ essential/JJ for/IN proving/VBG high/JJ -/HYPH probability/NN regret/NN bounds/NNS ,/, we/PRP show/VBP in/IN this/DT paper/NN that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO achieve/VB such/JJ strong/JJ results/NNS without/IN this/DT undesirable/JJ exploration/NN component/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ result/NN relies/VBZ on/IN a/DT simple/JJ and/CC intuitive/JJ loss/NN -/HYPH estimation/NN strategy/NN called/VBN \/SYM emph/NN {/-LRB- Implicit/JJ eXploration/NN }/-RRB- (/-LRB- IX/CD )/-RRB- that/WDT allows/VBZ a/DT remarkably/RB clean/JJ analysis/NN ./.
To/TO demonstrate/VB the/DT flexibility/NN of/IN our/PRP$ technique/NN ,/, we/PRP derive/VBP several/JJ improved/VBN high/JJ -/HYPH probability/NN bounds/NNS for/IN various/JJ extensions/NNS of/IN the/DT standard/JJ multi-armed/JJ bandit/NN framework/NN ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP conduct/VBP a/DT simple/JJ experiment/NN that/WDT illustrates/VBZ the/DT robustness/NN of/IN our/PRP$ implicit/JJ exploration/NN technique/NN ./.
