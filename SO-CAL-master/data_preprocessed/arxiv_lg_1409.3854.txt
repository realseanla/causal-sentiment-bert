Over/IN the/DT past/JJ five/CD decades/NNS ,/, k/CD -/HYPH means/NN has/VBZ become/VBN the/DT clustering/NN algorithm/NN of/IN choice/NN in/IN many/JJ application/NN domains/NNS primarily/RB due/IN to/IN its/PRP$ simplicity/NN ,/, time/NN //HYPH space/NN efficiency/NN ,/, and/CC invariance/NN to/IN the/DT ordering/NN of/IN the/DT data/NNS points/NNS ./.
Unfortunately/RB ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN 's/POS sensitivity/NN to/IN the/DT initial/JJ selection/NN of/IN the/DT cluster/NN centers/NNS remains/VBZ to/TO be/VB its/PRP$ most/RBS serious/JJ drawback/NN ./.
