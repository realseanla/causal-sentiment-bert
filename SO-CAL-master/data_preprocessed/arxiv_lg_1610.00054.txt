Detecting/VBG a/DT small/JJ number/NN of/IN outliers/NNS from/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN data/NNS observations/NNS is/VBZ always/RB challenging/JJ ./.
This/DT problem/NN is/VBZ more/RBR difficult/JJ in/IN the/DT setting/NN of/IN multiple/JJ network/NN samples/NNS ,/, where/WRB computing/VBG the/DT anomalous/JJ degree/NN of/IN a/DT network/NN sample/NN is/VBZ generally/RB not/RB sufficient/JJ ./.
In/IN fact/NN ,/, explaining/VBG why/WRB the/DT network/NN is/VBZ exceptional/JJ ,/, expressed/VBN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN subnetwork/NN ,/, is/VBZ also/RB equally/RB important/JJ ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT novel/JJ algorithm/NN to/TO address/VB these/DT two/CD key/JJ problems/NNS ./.
We/PRP treat/VBP each/DT network/NN sample/NN as/IN a/DT potential/JJ outlier/NN and/CC identify/VB subnetworks/NNS that/WDT mostly/RB discriminate/VBP it/PRP from/IN nearby/RB regular/JJ samples/NNS ./.

Our/PRP$ method/NN thus/RB goes/VBZ beyond/IN subspace/NN //HYPH subgraph/NN discovery/NN and/CC we/PRP show/VBP that/IN it/PRP converges/VBZ to/IN a/DT global/JJ optimum/JJ ./.
Evaluation/NN on/IN various/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN network/NN datasets/NNS demonstrates/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN not/RB only/RB outperforms/VBZ baselines/NNS in/IN both/DT network/NN and/CC high/JJ dimensional/JJ setting/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB discovers/VBZ highly/RB relevant/JJ and/CC interpretable/JJ local/JJ subnetworks/NNS ,/, further/RB enhancing/VBG our/PRP$ understanding/NN of/IN anomalous/JJ networks/NNS ./.
