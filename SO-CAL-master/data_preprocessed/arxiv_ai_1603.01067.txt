We/PRP represent/VBP the/DT sequence/NN of/IN fMRI/NN (/-LRB- Functional/JJ Magnetic/JJ Resonance/NN Imaging/NN )/-RRB- brain/NN volumes/NNS recorded/VBN during/IN a/DT cognitive/JJ stimulus/NN by/IN a/DT graph/NN which/WDT consists/VBZ of/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN local/JJ meshes/NNS ./.
The/DT corresponding/VBG cognitive/JJ process/NN ,/, encoded/VBN in/IN the/DT brain/NN ,/, is/VBZ then/RB represented/VBN by/IN these/DT meshes/NNS each/DT of/IN which/WDT is/VBZ estimated/VBN assuming/VBG a/DT linear/JJ relationship/NN among/IN the/DT voxel/NN time/NN series/NN in/IN a/DT predefined/JJ locality/NN ./.
