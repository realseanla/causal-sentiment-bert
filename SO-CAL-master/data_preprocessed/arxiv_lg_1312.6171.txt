This/DT paper/NN presents/VBZ an/DT unsupervised/JJ multi-modal/JJ learning/NN system/NN that/WDT learns/VBZ associative/JJ representation/NN from/IN two/CD input/NN modalities/NNS (/-LRB- channels/NNS )/-RRB- such/JJ that/IN input/NN on/IN one/CD channel/NN will/MD correctly/RB generate/VB the/DT associated/JJ response/NN at/IN the/DT other/JJ channel/NN and/CC vice/NN versa/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, the/DT system/NN develops/VBZ a/DT kind/NN of/IN supervised/JJ classification/NN model/NN meant/VBN to/TO simulate/VB aspects/NNS of/IN human/JJ associative/JJ memory/NN ./.
The/DT system/NN uses/VBZ a/DT deep/JJ learning/NN architecture/NN (/-LRB- DLA/NN )/-RRB- composed/VBN of/IN two/CD input/NN //SYM output/NN channels/NNS formed/VBN from/IN stacked/VBN Restricted/JJ Boltzmann/NNP Machines/NNPS (/-LRB- RBM/NNP )/-RRB- and/CC an/DT associative/JJ memory/NN network/NN that/WDT combines/VBZ the/DT two/CD channels/NNS ./.
The/DT DLA/NNP is/VBZ trained/VBN on/IN pairs/NNS of/IN MNIST/NNP handwritten/JJ digit/NN images/NNS to/TO develop/VB hierarchical/JJ features/NNS and/CC associative/JJ representations/NNS that/WDT are/VBP able/JJ to/TO reconstruct/VB one/CD image/NN given/VBN its/PRP$ paired/VBN -/HYPH associate/NN ./.
Experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT multi-modal/JJ learning/NN system/NN generates/VBZ models/NNS that/WDT are/VBP as/IN accurate/JJ as/IN back/RB -/HYPH propagation/NN networks/NNS but/CC with/IN the/DT advantage/NN of/IN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN from/IN either/CC paired/VBN or/CC non-paired/JJ training/NN examples/NNS ./.
