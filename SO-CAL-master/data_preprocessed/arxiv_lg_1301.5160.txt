Predicting/NNP the/DT nodes/NNS of/IN a/DT given/VBN graph/NN is/VBZ a/DT fascinating/JJ theoretical/JJ problem/NN with/IN applications/NNS in/IN several/JJ domains/NNS ./.
Since/IN graph/NN sparsification/NN via/IN spanning/VBG trees/NNS retains/VBZ enough/JJ information/NN while/IN making/VBG the/DT task/NN much/RB easier/JJR ,/, trees/NNS are/VBP an/DT important/JJ special/JJ case/NN of/IN this/DT problem/NN ./.
Although/IN it/PRP is/VBZ known/VBN how/WRB to/TO predict/VB the/DT nodes/NNS of/IN an/DT unweighted/JJ tree/NN in/IN a/DT nearly/RB optimal/JJ way/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT weighted/JJ case/NN a/DT fully/RB satisfactory/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ not/RB available/JJ yet/RB ./.
We/PRP fill/VBP this/DT hole/NN and/CC introduce/VB an/DT efficient/JJ node/NN predictor/NN ,/, Shazoo/NNP ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ nearly/RB optimal/JJ on/IN any/DT weighted/JJ tree/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN Shazoo/NNP can/MD be/VB viewed/VBN as/IN a/DT common/JJ nontrivial/JJ generalization/NN of/IN both/DT previous/JJ approaches/NNS for/IN unweighted/JJ trees/NNS and/CC weighted/JJ lines/NNS ./.
Experiments/NNS on/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN datasets/NNS confirm/VBP that/IN Shazoo/NNP performs/VBZ well/RB in/IN that/IN it/PRP fully/RB exploits/VBZ the/DT structure/NN of/IN the/DT input/NN tree/NN ,/, and/CC gets/VBZ very/RB close/JJ to/IN (/-LRB- and/CC sometimes/RB better/JJR than/IN )/-RRB- less/JJR scalable/JJ energy/NN minimization/NN methods/NNS ./.
