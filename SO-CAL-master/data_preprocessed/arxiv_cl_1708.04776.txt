Nowadays/RB ,/, cross-modal/JJ retrieval/NN plays/VBZ an/DT indispensable/JJ role/NN to/TO flexibly/RB find/VB information/NN across/IN different/JJ modalities/NNS of/IN data/NNS ./.
Effectively/RB measuring/VBG the/DT similarity/NN between/IN different/JJ modalities/NNS of/IN data/NNS is/VBZ the/DT key/NN of/IN cross-modal/JJ retrieval/NN ./.
Different/JJ modalities/NNS such/JJ as/IN image/NN and/CC text/NN have/VBP imbalanced/VBN and/CC complementary/JJ relationships/NNS ,/, which/WDT contain/VBP unequal/JJ amount/NN of/IN information/NN when/WRB describing/VBG the/DT same/JJ semantics/NNS ./.
