Background/NN :/: Children/NNS are/VBP frequently/RB prescribed/VBN medication/NN off/IN -/HYPH label/NN ,/, meaning/VBG there/RB has/VBZ not/RB been/VBN sufficient/JJ testing/NN of/IN the/DT medication/NN to/TO determine/VB its/PRP$ safety/NN or/CC effectiveness/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ reason/NN this/DT safety/NN knowledge/NN is/VBZ lacking/VBG is/VBZ due/IN to/IN ethical/JJ restrictions/NNS that/WDT prevent/VBP children/NNS from/IN being/VBG included/VBN in/IN the/DT majority/NN of/IN clinical/JJ trials/NNS ./.
Objective/NN :/: The/DT objective/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ to/TO investigate/VB whether/IN an/DT ensemble/NN of/IN simple/JJ study/NN designs/NNS can/MD be/VB implemented/VBN to/IN signal/NN acutely/RB occurring/VBG side/NN effects/NNS effectively/RB within/IN the/DT paediatric/JJ population/NN by/IN using/VBG historical/JJ longitudinal/JJ data/NNS ./.
The/DT majority/NN of/IN pharmacovigilance/NN techniques/NNS are/VBP unsupervised/JJ ,/, but/CC this/DT research/NN presents/VBZ a/DT supervised/JJ framework/NN ./.
Methods/NNS :/: Multiple/JJ measures/NNS of/IN association/NN are/VBP calculated/VBN for/IN each/DT drug/NN and/CC medical/JJ event/NN pair/NN and/CC these/DT are/VBP used/VBN as/IN features/NNS that/WDT are/VBP fed/VBN into/IN a/DT classiffier/NN to/TO determine/VB the/DT likelihood/NN of/IN the/DT drug/NN and/CC medical/JJ event/NN pair/NN corresponding/VBG to/IN an/DT adverse/JJ drug/NN reaction/NN ./.
The/DT classiffier/NN is/VBZ trained/VBN using/VBG known/JJ adverse/JJ drug/NN reactions/NNS or/CC known/VBN non-adverse/JJ drug/NN reaction/NN relationships/NNS ./.
Results/NNS :/: The/DT novel/JJ ensemble/NN framework/NN obtained/VBD a/DT false/JJ positive/JJ rate/NN of/IN 0:149/CD ,/, a/DT sensitivity/NN of/IN 0:547/CD and/CC a/DT specificity/NN of/IN 0:851/CD when/WRB implemented/VBN on/IN a/DT reference/NN set/NN of/IN drug/NN and/CC medical/JJ event/NN pairs/NNS ./.
The/DT novel/JJ framework/NN consistently/RB outperformed/VBD each/DT individual/JJ simple/JJ study/NN design/NN ./.
Conclusion/NN :/: This/DT research/NN shows/VBZ that/IN it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO exploit/VB the/DT mechanism/NN of/IN causality/NN and/CC presents/VBZ a/DT framework/NN for/IN signalling/NN adverse/JJ drug/NN reactions/NNS effectively/RB ./.
