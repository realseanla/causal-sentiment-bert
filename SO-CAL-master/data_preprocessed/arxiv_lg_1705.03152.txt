Pure/JJ acoustic/JJ neural/JJ models/NNS ,/, particularly/RB the/DT LSTM/NN -/HYPH RNN/NN model/NN ,/, have/VBP shown/VBN great/JJ potential/NN in/IN language/NN identification/NN (/-LRB- LID/NN )/-RRB- ./.
However/RB ,/, the/DT phonetic/JJ information/NN has/VBZ been/VBN largely/RB overlooked/VBN by/IN most/JJS of/IN existing/VBG neural/JJ LID/NN models/NNS ,/, although/IN this/DT information/NN has/VBZ been/VBN used/VBN in/IN the/DT conventional/JJ phonetic/JJ LID/NN systems/NNS with/IN a/DT great/JJ success/NN ./.
