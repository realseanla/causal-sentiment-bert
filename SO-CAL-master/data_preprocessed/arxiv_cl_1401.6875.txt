To/TO tackle/VB the/DT vocabulary/NN problem/NN in/IN conversational/JJ systems/NNS ,/, previous/JJ work/NN has/VBZ applied/VBN unsupervised/JJ learning/NN approaches/VBZ on/IN co-occurring/VBG speech/NN and/CC eye/NN gaze/NN during/IN interaction/NN to/IN automatically/RB acquire/VB new/JJ words/NNS ./.

To/TO address/VB these/DT issues/NNS ,/, we/PRP developed/VBD new/JJ approaches/NNS that/WDT incorporate/VBP user/NN language/NN behavior/NN ,/, domain/NN knowledge/NN ,/, and/CC conversation/NN context/NN in/IN word/NN acquisition/NN ./.
