We/PRP propose/VBP a/DT novel/JJ method/NN for/IN translation/NN selection/NN in/IN statistical/JJ machine/NN translation/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT a/DT convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN is/VBZ employed/VBN to/TO judge/VB the/DT similarity/NN between/IN a/DT phrase/NN pair/NN in/IN two/CD languages/NNS ./.
The/DT specifically/RB designed/VBN convolutional/JJ architecture/NN encodes/VBZ not/RB only/RB the/DT semantic/JJ similarity/NN of/IN the/DT translation/NN pair/NN ,/, but/CC also/RB the/DT context/NN containing/VBG the/DT phrase/NN in/IN the/DT source/NN language/NN ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO capture/VB context/NN -/HYPH dependent/JJ semantic/JJ similarities/NNS of/IN translation/NN pairs/NNS ./.
We/PRP adopt/VBP a/DT curriculum/NN learning/NN strategy/NN to/TO train/VB the/DT model/NN :/: we/PRP classify/VBP the/DT training/NN examples/NNS into/IN easy/JJ ,/, medium/JJ ,/, and/CC difficult/JJ categories/NNS ,/, and/CC gradually/RB build/VB the/DT ability/NN of/IN representing/VBG phrase/NN and/CC sentence/NN level/NN context/NN by/IN using/VBG training/NN examples/NNS from/IN easy/JJ to/TO difficult/JJ ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ the/DT baseline/NN system/NN by/IN up/RB to/IN 1.4/CD BLEU/NN points/NNS ./.
