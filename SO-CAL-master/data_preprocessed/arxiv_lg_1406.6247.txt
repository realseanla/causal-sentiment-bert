Applying/VBG convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS to/IN large/JJ images/NNS is/VBZ computationally/RB expensive/JJ because/IN the/DT amount/NN of/IN computation/NN scales/NNS linearly/RB with/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN image/NN pixels/NNS ./.
We/PRP present/VBP a/DT novel/JJ recurrent/JJ neural/JJ network/NN model/NN that/WDT is/VBZ capable/JJ of/IN extracting/VBG information/NN from/IN an/DT image/NN or/CC video/NN by/IN adaptively/RB selecting/VBG a/DT sequence/NN of/IN regions/NNS or/CC locations/NNS and/CC only/RB processing/VBG the/DT selected/VBN regions/NNS at/IN high/JJ resolution/NN ./.
Like/IN convolutional/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN model/NN has/VBZ a/DT degree/NN of/IN translation/NN invariance/NN built/VBN -/HYPH in/RP ,/, but/CC the/DT amount/NN of/IN computation/NN it/PRP performs/VBZ can/MD be/VB controlled/VBN independently/RB of/IN the/DT input/NN image/NN size/NN ./.
While/IN the/DT model/NN is/VBZ non-differentiable/JJ ,/, it/PRP can/MD be/VB trained/VBN using/VBG reinforcement/NN learning/VBG methods/NNS to/TO learn/VB task/NN -/HYPH specific/JJ policies/NNS ./.
We/PRP evaluate/VBP our/PRP$ model/NN on/IN several/JJ image/NN classification/NN tasks/NNS ,/, where/WRB it/PRP significantly/RB outperforms/VBZ a/DT convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN baseline/NN on/IN cluttered/JJ images/NNS ,/, and/CC on/IN a/DT dynamic/JJ visual/JJ control/NN problem/NN ,/, where/WRB it/PRP learns/VBZ to/TO track/VB a/DT simple/JJ object/NN without/IN an/DT explicit/JJ training/NN signal/NN for/IN doing/VBG so/RB ./.
