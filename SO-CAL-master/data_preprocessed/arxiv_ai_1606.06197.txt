This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ a/DT question/NN about/IN music/NN cognition/NN :/: how/WRB do/VBP we/PRP derive/VBP polymetric/JJ structures/NNS ./.
A/DT preference/NN rule/NN system/NN is/VBZ presented/VBN which/WDT is/VBZ implemented/VBN into/IN a/DT drum/NN computer/NN ./.
The/DT preference/NN rule/NN system/NN allows/VBZ inferring/VBG local/JJ polymetric/JJ structures/NNS ,/, like/IN two/CD -/HYPH over-three/NN and/CC three/CD -/HYPH over-two/NN ./.
By/IN analyzing/VBG the/DT micro-timing/NN of/IN West/JJ African/JJ percussion/NN music/NN a/DT timing/NN pattern/NN consisting/VBG of/IN six/CD pulses/NNS was/VBD discovered/VBN ./.
It/PRP integrates/VBZ binary/JJ and/CC ternary/JJ rhythmic/JJ feels/VBZ ./.
The/DT presented/VBN drum/NN computer/NN integrates/VBZ the/DT discovered/VBN superimposed/VBN polymetric/JJ swing/NN (/-LRB- timing/NN and/CC velocity/NN )/-RRB- appropriate/JJ to/IN the/DT rhythmic/JJ sequence/NN the/DT user/NN inputs/NNS ./.
For/IN binary/JJ sequences/NNS ,/, the/DT amount/NN of/IN binary/JJ swing/NN is/VBZ increased/VBN and/CC for/IN ternary/JJ sequences/NNS ,/, the/DT ternary/JJ swing/NN is/VBZ increased/VBN ./.
