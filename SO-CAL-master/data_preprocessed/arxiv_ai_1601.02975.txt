In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP conduct/VBP an/DT analysis/NN of/IN Moodle/NN activity/NN data/NNS focused/VBD on/IN identifying/VBG early/JJ predictors/NNS of/IN good/JJ student/NN performance/NN ./.
The/DT analysis/NN shows/VBZ that/IN three/CD relevant/JJ hypotheses/NNS are/VBP largely/RB supported/VBN by/IN the/DT data/NNS ./.
These/DT hypotheses/NNS are/VBP :/: early/JJ submission/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ sign/NN ,/, a/DT high/JJ level/NN of/IN activity/NN is/VBZ predictive/JJ of/IN good/JJ results/NNS and/CC evening/NN activity/NN is/VBZ even/RB better/JJR than/IN daytime/NN activity/NN ./.
We/PRP highlight/VBD some/DT pathological/JJ examples/NNS where/WRB high/JJ levels/NNS of/IN activity/NN correlates/VBZ with/IN bad/JJ results/NNS ./.
