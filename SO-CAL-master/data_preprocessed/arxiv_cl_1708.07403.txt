In/IN contrast/NN to/IN previous/JJ work/NN ,/, CloudScan/NNP does/VBZ not/RB rely/VB on/IN templates/NNS of/IN invoice/NN layout/NN ,/, instead/RB it/PRP learns/VBZ a/DT single/JJ global/JJ model/NN of/IN invoices/NNS that/WDT naturally/RB generalizes/VBZ to/IN unseen/JJ invoice/NN layouts/NNS ./.
