This/DT article/NN is/VBZ an/DT overview/NN of/IN the/DT "/`` SP/NN theory/NN of/IN intelligence/NN "/'' ./.
The/DT theory/NN aims/VBZ to/TO simplify/VB and/CC integrate/VB concepts/NNS across/IN artificial/JJ intelligence/NN ,/, mainstream/NN computing/NN and/CC human/JJ perception/NN and/CC cognition/NN ,/, with/IN information/NN compression/NN as/IN a/DT unifying/JJ theme/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ conceived/VBN as/IN a/DT brain/NN -/HYPH like/JJ system/NN that/WDT receives/VBZ '/`` New/NNP '/'' information/NN and/CC stores/NNS some/DT or/CC all/DT of/IN it/PRP in/IN compressed/JJ form/NN as/IN '/`` Old/NNP '/'' information/NN ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ realised/VBN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN a/DT computer/NN model/NN -/HYPH a/DT first/JJ version/NN of/IN the/DT SP/NN machine/NN ./.
The/DT concept/NN of/IN "/`` multiple/JJ alignment/NN "/'' is/VBZ a/DT powerful/JJ central/JJ idea/NN ./.
Using/VBG heuristic/NN techniques/NNS ,/, the/DT system/NN builds/VBZ multiple/JJ alignments/NNS that/WDT are/VBP '/`` good/JJ '/'' in/IN terms/NNS of/IN information/NN compression/NN ./.
For/IN each/DT multiple/JJ alignment/NN ,/, probabilities/NNS may/MD be/VB calculated/VBN ./.
These/DT provide/VBP the/DT basis/NN for/IN calculating/VBG the/DT probabilities/NNS of/IN inferences/NNS ./.
The/DT system/NN learns/VBZ new/JJ structures/NNS from/IN partial/JJ matches/NNS between/IN patterns/NNS ./.
Using/VBG heuristic/NN techniques/NNS ,/, the/DT system/NN searches/VBZ for/IN sets/NNS of/IN structures/NNS that/WDT are/VBP '/`` good/JJ '/'' in/IN terms/NNS of/IN information/NN compression/NN ./.
These/DT are/VBP normally/RB ones/NNS that/WDT people/NNS judge/VBP to/TO be/VB '/`` natural/JJ '/'' ,/, in/IN accordance/NN with/IN the/DT '/`` DONSVIC/NN '/'' principle/NN --/: the/DT discovery/NN of/IN natural/JJ structures/NNS via/IN information/NN compression/NN ./.
The/DT SP/NN theory/NN may/MD be/VB applied/VBN in/IN several/JJ areas/NNS including/VBG '/'' computing/NN '/'' ,/, aspects/NNS of/IN mathematics/NNS and/CC logic/NN ,/, representation/NN of/IN knowledge/NN ,/, natural/JJ language/NN processing/NN ,/, pattern/NN recognition/NN ,/, several/JJ kinds/NNS of/IN reasoning/NN ,/, information/NN storage/NN and/CC retrieval/NN ,/, planning/NN and/CC problem/NN solving/VBG ,/, information/NN compression/NN ,/, neuroscience/NN ,/, and/CC human/JJ perception/NN and/CC cognition/NN ./.
