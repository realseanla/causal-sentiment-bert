The/DT importance/NN of/IN algorithm/NN portfolio/NN techniques/NNS for/IN SAT/NNP has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN noted/VBN ,/, and/CC a/DT number/NN of/IN very/RB successful/JJ systems/NNS have/VBP been/VBN devised/VBN ,/, including/VBG the/DT most/RBS successful/JJ one/CD ---/NFP SATzilla/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, all/PDT these/DT systems/NNS are/VBP quite/RB complex/JJ (/-LRB- to/TO understand/VB ,/, reimplement/NN ,/, or/CC modify/VB )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN portfolio/NN for/IN SAT/NNP that/WDT is/VBZ extremely/RB simple/JJ ,/, but/CC in/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN so/RB efficient/JJ that/IN it/PRP outperforms/VBZ SATzilla/NNP ./.
For/IN a/DT new/JJ SAT/NNP instance/NN to/TO be/VB solved/VBN ,/, our/PRP$ portfolio/NN finds/VBZ its/PRP$ k/CD -/HYPH nearest/JJS neighbors/NNS from/IN the/DT training/NN set/NN and/CC invokes/VBZ a/DT solver/NN that/WDT performs/VBZ the/DT best/JJS at/IN those/DT instances/NNS ./.
The/DT main/JJ distinguishing/VBG feature/NN of/IN our/PRP$ algorithm/NN portfolio/NN is/VBZ the/DT locality/NN of/IN the/DT selection/NN procedure/NN ---/, the/DT selection/NN of/IN a/DT SAT/NN solver/NN is/VBZ based/VBN only/RB on/IN few/JJ instances/NNS similar/JJ to/IN the/DT input/NN one/CD ./.
