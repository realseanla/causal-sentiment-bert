Mediation/NN is/VBZ a/DT process/NN ,/, in/IN which/WDT both/DT parties/NNS agree/VBP to/TO resolve/VB their/PRP$ dispute/NN by/IN negotiating/VBG over/IN alternative/JJ solutions/NNS presented/VBN by/IN a/DT mediator/NN ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO construct/VB such/JJ solutions/NNS ,/, mediation/NN brings/VBZ more/JJR information/NN and/CC knowledge/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, if/IN possible/JJ ,/, resources/NNS to/IN the/DT negotiation/NN table/NN ./.
The/DT contribution/NN of/IN this/DT paper/NN is/VBZ the/DT automated/VBN mediation/NN machinery/NN which/WDT does/VBZ that/DT ./.
It/PRP presents/VBZ an/DT argumentation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN mediation/NN approach/NN that/WDT extends/VBZ the/DT logic/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN to/IN argumentation/NN -/HYPH based/VBN negotiation/NN involving/VBG BDI/NNP agents/NNS ./.
The/DT paper/NN describes/VBZ the/DT mediation/NN algorithm/NN ./.
For/IN comparison/NN it/PRP illustrates/VBZ the/DT method/NN with/IN a/DT case/NN study/NN used/VBN in/IN an/DT earlier/JJR work/NN ./.
It/PRP demonstrates/VBZ how/WRB the/DT computational/JJ mediator/NN can/MD deal/VB with/IN realistic/JJ situations/NNS in/IN which/WDT the/DT negotiating/VBG agents/NNS would/MD otherwise/RB fail/VB due/JJ to/IN lack/NN of/IN knowledge/NN and/CC //HYPH or/CC resources/NNS ./.
