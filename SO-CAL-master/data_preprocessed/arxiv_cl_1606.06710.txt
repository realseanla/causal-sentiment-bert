We/PRP introduce/VBP QVEC/NN -/HYPH CCA/NN --/: an/DT intrinsic/JJ evaluation/NN metric/JJ for/IN word/NN vector/NN representations/NNS based/VBN on/IN correlations/NNS of/IN learned/VBN vectors/NNS with/IN features/NNS extracted/VBN from/IN linguistic/JJ resources/NNS ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN QVEC/NN -/HYPH CCA/NN scores/NNS are/VBP an/DT effective/JJ proxy/NN for/IN a/DT range/NN of/IN extrinsic/JJ semantic/JJ and/CC syntactic/JJ tasks/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN evaluation/NN obtains/VBZ higher/JJR and/CC more/JJR consistent/JJ correlations/NNS with/IN downstream/JJ tasks/NNS ,/, compared/VBN to/IN existing/VBG approaches/NNS to/IN intrinsic/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN word/NN vectors/NNS that/WDT are/VBP based/VBN on/IN word/NN similarity/NN ./.
