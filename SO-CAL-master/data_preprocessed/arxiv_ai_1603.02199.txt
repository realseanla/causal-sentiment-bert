We/PRP describe/VBP a/DT learning/NN -/HYPH based/VBN approach/NN to/IN hand/NN -/HYPH eye/NN coordination/NN for/IN robotic/JJ grasping/VBG from/IN monocular/JJ images/NNS ./.
To/TO learn/VB hand/NN -/HYPH eye/NN coordination/NN for/IN grasping/VBG ,/, we/PRP trained/VBD a/DT large/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN to/TO predict/VB the/DT probability/NN that/WDT task/NN -/HYPH space/NN motion/NN of/IN the/DT gripper/NN will/MD result/VB in/IN successful/JJ grasps/VBZ ,/, using/VBG only/RB monocular/JJ camera/NN images/NNS and/CC independently/RB of/IN camera/NN calibration/NN or/CC the/DT current/JJ robot/NN pose/NN ./.
This/DT requires/VBZ the/DT network/NN to/TO observe/VB the/DT spatial/JJ relationship/NN between/IN the/DT gripper/NN and/CC objects/NNS in/IN the/DT scene/NN ,/, thus/RB learning/VBG hand/NN -/HYPH eye/NN coordination/NN ./.
We/PRP then/RB use/VB this/DT network/NN to/TO servo/VB the/DT gripper/NN in/IN real/JJ time/NN to/TO achieve/VB successful/JJ grasps/VBZ ./.
To/TO train/VB our/PRP$ network/NN ,/, we/PRP collected/VBD over/RP 800,000/CD grasp/NN attempts/NNS over/IN the/DT course/NN of/IN two/CD months/NNS ,/, using/VBG between/IN 6/CD and/CC 14/CD robotic/JJ manipulators/NNS at/IN any/DT given/VBN time/NN ,/, with/IN differences/NNS in/IN camera/NN placement/NN and/CC hardware/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ experimental/JJ evaluation/NN demonstrates/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN achieves/VBZ effective/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN control/NN ,/, can/MD successfully/RB grasp/VB novel/JJ objects/NNS ,/, and/CC corrects/VBZ mistakes/NNS by/IN continuous/JJ servoing/NN ./.
