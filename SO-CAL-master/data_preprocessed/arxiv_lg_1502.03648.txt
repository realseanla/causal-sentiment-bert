Deep/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- DNN/NN )/-RRB- are/VBP the/DT state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN on/IN many/JJ engineering/NN problems/NNS such/JJ as/IN computer/NN vision/NN and/CC audition/NN ./.
A/DT key/JJ factor/NN in/IN the/DT success/NN of/IN the/DT DNN/NNP is/VBZ scalability/NN -/HYPH bigger/JJR networks/NNS work/VBP better/RBR ./.
