We/PRP explore/VBP the/DT sequential/JJ decision/NN making/VBG problem/NN where/WRB the/DT goal/NN is/VBZ to/TO estimate/VB uniformly/RB well/RB a/DT number/NN of/IN linear/JJ models/NNS ,/, given/VBN a/DT shared/VBN budget/NN of/IN random/JJ contexts/NNS independently/RB sampled/VBN from/IN a/DT known/JJ distribution/NN ./.
The/DT decision/NN maker/NN must/MD query/VB one/CD of/IN the/DT linear/JJ models/NNS for/IN each/DT incoming/JJ context/NN ,/, and/CC receives/VBZ an/DT observation/NN corrupted/VBN by/IN noise/NN levels/NNS that/WDT are/VBP unknown/JJ ,/, and/CC depend/VB on/IN the/DT model/NN instance/NN ./.
We/PRP present/VBP Trace/NNP -/HYPH UCB/NNP ,/, an/DT adaptive/JJ allocation/NN algorithm/NN that/WDT learns/VBZ the/DT noise/NN levels/NNS while/IN balancing/VBG contexts/NNS accordingly/RB across/IN the/DT different/JJ linear/JJ functions/NNS ,/, and/CC derive/VBP guarantees/NNS for/IN simple/JJ regret/NN in/IN both/CC expectation/NN and/CC high/JJ -/HYPH probability/NN ./.
