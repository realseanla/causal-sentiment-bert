This/DT paper/NN considers/VBZ the/DT problem/NN of/IN clustering/VBG a/DT partially/RB observed/VBN unweighted/JJ graph/NN --/: i.e./FW one/CD where/WRB for/IN some/DT node/NN pairs/NNS we/PRP know/VBP there/EX is/VBZ an/DT edge/NN between/IN them/PRP ,/, for/IN some/DT others/NNS we/PRP know/VBP there/EX is/VBZ no/DT edge/NN ,/, and/CC for/IN the/DT remaining/VBG we/PRP do/VBP not/RB know/VB whether/IN or/CC not/RB there/EX is/VBZ an/DT edge/NN ./.
We/PRP want/VBP to/TO organize/VB the/DT nodes/NNS into/IN disjoint/NN clusters/NNS so/IN that/IN there/EX is/VBZ relatively/RB dense/JJ (/-LRB- observed/VBN )/-RRB- connectivity/NN within/IN clusters/NNS ,/, and/CC sparse/JJ across/IN clusters/NNS ./.
