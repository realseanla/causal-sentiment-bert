Continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN Bayesian/JJ networks/NNS (/-LRB- CTBNs/NNS )/-RRB- are/VBP graphical/JJ representations/NNS of/IN multi-component/JJ continuous/JJ -/HYPH time/NN Markov/NNP processes/NNS as/IN directed/VBN graphs/NNS ./.
The/DT edges/NNS in/IN the/DT network/NN represent/VBP direct/JJ influences/NNS among/IN components/NNS ./.
The/DT joint/JJ rate/NN matrix/NN of/IN the/DT multi-component/JJ process/NN is/VBZ specified/VBN by/IN means/NNS of/IN conditional/JJ rate/NN matrices/NNS for/IN each/DT component/NN separately/RB ./.
This/DT paper/NN addresses/VBZ the/DT situation/NN where/WRB some/DT of/IN the/DT components/NNS evolve/VBP on/IN a/DT time/NN scale/NN that/WDT is/VBZ much/JJ shorter/JJR compared/VBN to/IN the/DT time/NN scale/NN of/IN the/DT other/JJ components/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP prove/VBP that/IN in/IN the/DT limit/NN where/WRB the/DT separation/NN of/IN scales/NNS is/VBZ infinite/JJ ,/, the/DT Markov/NNP process/NN converges/VBZ (/-LRB- in/IN distribution/NN ,/, or/CC weakly/RB )/-RRB- to/IN a/DT reduced/VBN ,/, or/CC effective/JJ Markov/NNP process/NN that/WDT only/RB involves/VBZ the/DT slow/JJ components/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB demonstrate/VBP that/IN for/IN reasonable/JJ separation/NN of/IN scale/NN (/-LRB- an/DT order/NN of/IN magnitude/NN )/-RRB- the/DT reduced/VBN process/NN is/VBZ a/DT good/JJ approximation/NN of/IN the/DT marginal/JJ process/NN over/IN the/DT slow/JJ components/NNS ./.
We/PRP provide/VBP a/DT simple/JJ procedure/NN for/IN building/VBG a/DT reduced/VBN CTBN/NN for/IN this/DT effective/JJ process/NN ,/, with/IN conditional/JJ rate/NN matrices/NNS that/WDT can/MD be/VB directly/RB calculated/VBN from/IN the/DT original/JJ CTBN/NN ,/, and/CC discuss/VB the/DT implications/NNS for/IN approximate/JJ reasoning/NN in/IN large/JJ systems/NNS ./.
