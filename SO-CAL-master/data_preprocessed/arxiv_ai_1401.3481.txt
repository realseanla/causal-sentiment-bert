The/DT Weighted/JJ Constraint/NN Satisfaction/NN Problem/NN (/-LRB- WCSP/NN )/-RRB- framework/NN allows/VBZ representing/VBG and/CC solving/VBG problems/NNS involving/VBG both/CC hard/JJ constraints/NNS and/CC cost/NN functions/NNS ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ been/VBN applied/VBN to/IN various/JJ problems/NNS ,/, including/VBG resource/NN allocation/NN ,/, bioinformatics/NN ,/, scheduling/NN ,/, etc/FW ./.
To/TO solve/VB such/JJ problems/NNS ,/, solvers/NNS usually/RB rely/VBP on/IN branch/NN -/HYPH and/CC -/HYPH bound/VBN algorithms/NNS equipped/VBN with/IN local/JJ consistency/NN filtering/NN ,/, mostly/RB soft/JJ arc/NN consistency/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, these/DT techniques/NNS are/VBP not/RB well/RB suited/JJ to/TO solve/VB problems/NNS with/IN very/RB large/JJ domains/NNS ./.
Motivated/VBN by/IN the/DT resolution/NN of/IN an/DT RNA/NN gene/NN localization/NN problem/NN inside/IN large/JJ genomic/JJ sequences/NNS ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT spirit/NN of/IN bounds/NNS consistency/NN for/IN large/JJ domains/NNS in/IN crisp/JJ CSPs/NNS ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP soft/JJ bounds/NNS arc/NN consistency/NN ,/, a/DT new/JJ weighted/JJ local/JJ consistency/NN specifically/RB designed/VBN for/IN WCSP/NN with/IN very/RB large/JJ domains/NNS ./.
Compared/VBN to/IN soft/JJ arc/NN consistency/NN ,/, BAC/NN provides/VBZ significantly/RB improved/VBN time/NN and/CC space/NN asymptotic/JJ complexity/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP how/WRB the/DT semantics/NNS of/IN cost/NN functions/NNS can/MD be/VB exploited/VBN to/TO further/RB improve/VB the/DT time/NN complexity/NN of/IN BAC/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB compare/VBP both/CC in/IN theory/NN and/CC in/IN practice/NN the/DT efficiency/NN of/IN BAC/NN on/IN a/DT WCSP/NN with/IN bounds/NNS consistency/NN enforced/VBN on/IN a/DT crisp/JJ CSP/NNP using/VBG cost/NN variables/NNS ./.
On/IN two/CD different/JJ real/JJ problems/NNS modeled/VBN as/IN WCSP/NNP ,/, including/VBG our/PRP$ RNA/NN gene/NN localization/NN problem/NN ,/, we/PRP observe/VBP that/IN maintaining/VBG bounds/NNS arc/NN consistency/NN outperforms/VBZ arc/NN consistency/NN and/CC also/RB improves/VBZ over/IN bounds/NNS consistency/NN enforced/VBN on/IN a/DT constraint/NN model/NN with/IN cost/NN variables/NNS ./.
