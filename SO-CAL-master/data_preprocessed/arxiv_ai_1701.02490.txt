The/DT majority/NN of/IN online/JJ display/NN ads/NNS are/VBP served/VBN through/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN bidding/NN (/-LRB- RTB/NN )/-RRB- ---/NFP each/DT ad/NN display/NN impression/NN is/VBZ auctioned/VBN off/RP in/IN real/JJ -/HYPH time/NN when/WRB it/PRP is/VBZ just/RB being/VBG generated/VBN from/IN a/DT user/NN visit/NN ./.

Most/JJS previous/JJ works/NNS consider/VBP the/DT bid/NN decision/NN as/IN a/DT static/NN optimization/NN problem/NN of/IN either/CC treating/VBG the/DT value/NN of/IN each/DT impression/NN independently/RB or/CC setting/VBG a/DT bid/NN price/NN to/IN each/DT segment/NN of/IN ad/NN volume/NN ./.
