Collaborative/JJ filtering/NN or/CC recommender/NN systems/NNS use/VBP a/DT database/NN about/IN user/NN preferences/NNS to/TO predict/VB additional/JJ topics/NNS or/CC products/NNS a/DT new/JJ user/NN might/MD like/VB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP describe/VBP several/JJ algorithms/NNS designed/VBN for/IN this/DT task/NN ,/, including/VBG techniques/NNS based/VBN on/IN correlation/NN coefficients/NNS ,/, vector/NN -/HYPH based/VBN similarity/NN calculations/NNS ,/, and/CC statistical/JJ Bayesian/JJ methods/NNS ./.
We/PRP compare/VBP the/DT predictive/JJ accuracy/NN of/IN the/DT various/JJ methods/NNS in/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN representative/JJ problem/NN domains/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP two/CD basic/JJ classes/NNS of/IN evaluation/NN metrics/NNS ./.
The/DT first/JJ characterizes/VBZ accuracy/NN over/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN individual/JJ predictions/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN average/JJ absolute/JJ deviation/NN ./.
The/DT second/JJ estimates/VBZ the/DT utility/NN of/IN a/DT ranked/VBN list/NN of/IN suggested/VBN items/NNS ./.
This/DT metric/JJ uses/VBZ an/DT estimate/NN of/IN the/DT probability/NN that/IN a/DT user/NN will/MD see/VB a/DT recommendation/NN in/IN an/DT ordered/VBN list/NN ./.
