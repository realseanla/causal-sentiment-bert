Pertinence/NN Feedback/NN is/VBZ a/DT technique/NN that/WDT enables/VBZ a/DT user/NN to/IN interactively/RB express/VB his/PRP$ information/NN requirement/NN by/IN modifying/VBG his/PRP$ original/JJ query/NN formulation/NN with/IN further/JJ information/NN ./.
This/DT information/NN is/VBZ provided/VBN by/IN explicitly/RB confirming/VBG the/DT pertinent/JJ of/IN some/DT indicating/VBG objects/NNS and/CC //HYPH or/CC goals/NNS extracted/VBN by/IN the/DT system/NN ./.
Obviously/RB the/DT user/NN can/MD not/RB mark/VB objects/NNS and/CC //HYPH or/CC goals/NNS as/IN pertinent/JJ until/IN some/DT are/VBP extracted/VBN ,/, so/IN the/DT first/JJ search/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB initiated/VBN by/IN a/DT query/NN and/CC the/DT initial/JJ query/NN specification/NN has/VBZ to/TO be/VB good/JJ enough/RB to/TO pick/VB out/RP some/DT pertinent/JJ objects/NNS and/CC //HYPH or/CC goals/NNS from/IN the/DT Semantic/NNP Network/NNP ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT short/JJ survey/NN of/IN fuzzy/JJ and/CC Semantic/JJ approaches/NNS to/IN Knowledge/NN Extraction/NN ./.
The/DT goal/NN of/IN such/JJ approaches/NNS is/VBZ to/TO define/VB flexible/JJ Knowledge/NN Extraction/NN Systems/NNPS able/JJ to/TO deal/VB with/IN the/DT inherent/JJ vagueness/NN and/CC uncertainty/NN of/IN the/DT Extraction/NN process/NN ./.
It/PRP has/VBZ long/RB been/VBN recognised/VBN that/IN interactivity/NN improves/VBZ the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN Knowledge/NN Extraction/NN systems/NNS ./.
Novice/NN user/NN 's/POS queries/NNS are/VBP the/DT most/RBS natural/JJ and/CC interactive/JJ medium/NN of/IN communication/NN and/CC recent/JJ progress/NN in/IN recognition/NN is/VBZ making/VBG it/PRP possible/JJ to/TO build/VB systems/NNS that/WDT interact/VBP with/IN the/DT user/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, given/VBN the/DT typical/JJ novice/NN user/NN 's/POS queries/NNS submitted/VBD to/IN Knowledge/NN Extraction/NN Systems/NNPS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ easy/JJ to/TO imagine/VB that/IN the/DT effects/NNS of/IN goal/NN recognition/NN errors/NNS in/IN novice/NN user/NN 's/POS queries/NNS must/MD be/VB severely/RB destructive/JJ on/IN the/DT system/NN 's/POS effectiveness/NN ./.
The/DT experimental/JJ work/NN reported/VBN in/IN this/DT paper/NN shows/VBZ that/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN possibility/NN theory/NN in/IN classical/JJ Knowledge/NN Extraction/NN techniques/NNS for/IN novice/NN user/NN 's/POS query/NN processing/NN is/VBZ more/RBR robust/JJ than/IN the/DT use/NN of/IN the/DT probability/NN theory/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, both/CC possibilistic/JJ and/CC probabilistic/JJ pertinence/NN feedback/NN can/MD be/VB effectively/RB employed/VBN to/TO improve/VB the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN novice/NN user/NN 's/POS query/NN processing/NN ./.
