In/IN this/DT article/NN we/PRP present/VBP a/DT method/NN to/TO reconstruct/VB the/DT interconnectedness/NN of/IN dynamically/RB related/VBN stochastic/JJ processes/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT interactions/NNS are/VBP bi-directional/JJ and/CC the/DT underlying/VBG topology/NN is/VBZ a/DT tree/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ approach/NN is/VBZ based/VBN on/IN multivariate/JJ Wiener/NNP filtering/NN which/WDT recovers/VBZ spurious/JJ edges/NNS apart/RB from/IN the/DT true/JJ edges/NNS in/IN the/DT topology/NN reconstruction/NN ./.
The/DT main/JJ contribution/NN of/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ to/TO show/VB that/IN all/DT spurious/JJ links/NNS obtained/VBN using/VBG Wiener/NNP filtering/VBG can/MD be/VB eliminated/VBN if/IN the/DT underlying/VBG topology/NN is/VBZ a/DT tree/NN based/VBN on/IN which/WDT we/PRP present/VBP a/DT three/CD stage/NN network/NN reconstruction/NN procedure/NN for/IN trees/NNS ./.
