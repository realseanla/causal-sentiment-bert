We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT dependent/JJ doors/NNS problem/NN as/IN an/DT abstraction/NN for/IN situations/NNS in/IN which/WDT one/PRP must/MD perform/VB a/DT sequence/NN of/IN possibly/RB dependent/JJ decisions/NNS ,/, without/IN receiving/VBG feedback/NN information/NN on/IN the/DT effectiveness/NN of/IN previously/RB made/VBN actions/NNS ./.
Informally/RB ,/, the/DT problem/NN considers/VBZ a/DT set/NN of/IN $/$ d/LS $/$ doors/NNS that/WDT are/VBP initially/RB closed/VBN ,/, and/CC the/DT aim/NN is/VBZ to/TO open/VB all/DT of/IN them/PRP as/RB fast/RB as/IN possible/JJ ./.
To/TO open/VB a/DT door/NN ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN knocks/VBZ on/IN it/PRP and/CC it/PRP might/MD open/VB or/CC not/RB according/VBG to/IN some/DT probability/NN distribution/NN ./.
This/DT distribution/NN may/MD depend/VB on/IN which/WDT other/JJ doors/NNS are/VBP currently/RB open/JJ ,/, as/RB well/RB as/IN on/IN which/WDT other/JJ doors/NNS were/VBD open/JJ during/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT previous/JJ knocks/NNS on/IN that/DT door/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN aims/VBZ to/TO minimize/VB the/DT expected/VBN time/NN until/IN all/DT doors/NNS open/JJ ./.
Crucially/RB ,/, it/PRP must/MD act/VB at/IN any/DT time/NN without/IN knowing/VBG whether/IN or/CC which/WDT other/JJ doors/NNS have/VBP already/RB opened/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP focus/VBP on/IN scenarios/NNS where/WRB dependencies/NNS between/IN doors/NNS are/VBP both/DT positively/RB correlated/VBN and/CC acyclic.The/NN fundamental/JJ distribution/NN of/IN a/DT door/NN describes/VBZ the/DT probability/NN it/PRP opens/VBZ in/IN the/DT best/JJS of/IN conditions/NNS (/-LRB- with/IN respect/NN to/IN other/JJ doors/NNS being/VBG open/JJ or/CC closed/JJ )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP show/VBP that/IN if/IN in/IN two/CD configurations/NNS of/IN $/$ d/LS $/$ doors/NNS corresponding/VBG doors/NNS share/VBP the/DT same/JJ fundamental/JJ distribution/NN ,/, then/RB these/DT configurations/NNS have/VBP the/DT same/JJ optimal/JJ running/NN time/NN up/RB to/IN a/DT universal/JJ constant/JJ ,/, no/RB matter/RB what/WP are/VBP the/DT dependencies/NNS between/IN doors/NNS and/CC what/WP are/VBP the/DT distributions/NNS ./.
We/PRP also/RB identify/VBP algorithms/NNS that/WDT are/VBP optimal/JJ up/IN to/IN a/DT universal/JJ constant/JJ factor/NN ./.
For/IN the/DT case/NN in/IN which/WDT all/DT doors/NNS share/VBP the/DT same/JJ fundamental/JJ distribution/NN we/PRP additionally/RB provide/VBP a/DT simpler/JJR algorithm/NN ,/, and/CC a/DT formula/NN to/TO calculate/VB its/PRP$ running/NN time/NN ./.
We/PRP furthermore/RB analyse/VB the/DT price/NN of/IN lacking/VBG feedback/NN for/IN several/JJ configurations/NNS governed/VBN by/IN standard/JJ fundamental/JJ distributions/NNS ./.
In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN the/DT price/NN is/VBZ logarithmic/JJ in/IN $/$ d/LS $/$ for/IN memoryless/JJ doors/NNS ,/, but/CC can/MD potentially/RB grow/VB to/TO be/VB linear/JJ in/IN $/$ d/LS $/$ for/IN other/JJ distributions.We/NN then/RB turn/VB our/PRP$ attention/NN to/TO investigate/VB precise/JJ bounds/NNS ./.
Even/RB for/IN the/DT case/NN of/IN two/CD doors/NNS ,/, identifying/VBG the/DT optimal/JJ sequence/NN is/VBZ an/DT intriguing/JJ combinatorial/JJ question/NN ./.
Here/RB ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT case/NN of/IN two/CD cascading/VBG memoryless/JJ doors/NNS ./.
That/DT is/VBZ ,/, the/DT first/JJ door/NN opens/VBZ on/IN each/DT knock/NN independently/RB with/IN probability/NN $/$ p/NN \/SYM _/NFP 1/CD $/$ ./.
The/DT second/JJ door/NN can/MD only/RB open/VB if/IN the/DT first/JJ door/NN is/VBZ open/JJ ,/, in/IN which/WDT case/NN it/PRP will/MD open/VB on/IN each/DT knock/NN independently/RB with/IN probability/NN $/$ p/NN \/SYM _/NFP 2/CD $/$ ./.
We/PRP solve/VB this/DT problem/NN almost/RB completely/RB by/IN identifying/VBG algorithms/NNS that/WDT are/VBP optimal/JJ up/IN to/IN an/DT additive/JJ term/NN of/IN 1/CD ./.
