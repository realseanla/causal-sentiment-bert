In/IN this/DT paper/NN we/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN predicting/VBG a/DT time/NN series/NN using/VBG the/DT ARMA/NN (/-LRB- autoregressive/NN moving/VBG average/NN )/-RRB- model/NN ,/, under/IN minimal/JJ assumptions/NNS on/IN the/DT noise/NN terms/NNS ./.
Using/VBG regret/NN minimization/NN techniques/NNS ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP effective/JJ online/JJ learning/NN algorithms/NNS for/IN the/DT prediction/NN problem/NN ,/, without/IN assuming/VBG that/IN the/DT noise/NN terms/NNS are/VBP Gaussian/JJ ,/, identically/RB distributed/VBN or/CC even/RB independent/JJ ./.
