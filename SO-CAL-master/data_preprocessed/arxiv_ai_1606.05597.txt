Concept/NNP Trees/NNP are/VBP a/DT type/NN of/IN database/NN that/WDT can/MD organise/VB arbitrary/JJ textual/JJ information/NN using/VBG a/DT very/RB simple/JJ rule/NN ./.
Each/DT tree/NN tries/VBZ to/TO represent/VB a/DT single/JJ cohesive/JJ concept/NN and/CC the/DT trees/NNS can/MD link/VB with/IN each/DT other/JJ for/IN navigation/NN and/CC semantic/JJ purposes/NNS ./.
The/DT trees/NNS are/VBP therefore/RB a/DT type/NN of/IN semantic/JJ network/NN and/CC would/MD benefit/VB from/IN having/VBG a/DT consistent/JJ level/NN of/IN context/NN for/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT nodes/NNS ./.
The/DT Concept/NNP Tree/NNP nodes/NNS have/VBP a/DT mathematical/JJ basis/NN allowing/VBG for/IN a/DT consistent/JJ build/NN process/NN ./.
These/DT would/MD represent/VB nouns/NNS or/CC verbs/NNS in/IN a/DT text/NN sentence/NN ,/, for/IN example/NN ./.
New/NNP to/IN the/DT design/NN can/MD then/RB be/VB lists/NNS of/IN descriptive/JJ elements/NNS for/IN each/DT of/IN the/DT nodes/NNS ./.
The/DT descriptors/NNS can/MD also/RB be/VB weighted/VBN ,/, but/CC do/VBP not/RB have/VB to/TO follow/VB the/DT strict/JJ counting/NN rule/NN of/IN the/DT tree/NN nodes/NNS ./.
With/IN the/DT new/JJ descriptive/JJ layers/NNS ,/, a/DT much/JJ richer/JJR type/NN of/IN knowledge/NN can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN and/CC still/RB reasoned/VBD over/IN automatically/RB ./.
The/DT linking/VBG structure/NN of/IN the/DT licas/NNS network/NN is/VBZ very/RB relevant/JJ to/IN building/VBG the/DT concept/NN trees/NNS now/RB and/CC forms/VBZ the/DT basis/NN for/IN their/PRP$ construction/NN ./.
The/DT concept/NN tree/NN -/HYPH symbolic/JJ neural/JJ network/NN relation/NN is/VBZ also/RB extended/VBN further/RB ./.
