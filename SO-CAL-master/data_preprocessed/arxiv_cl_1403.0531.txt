Modalities/NNS of/IN communication/NN for/IN human/JJ beings/NNS are/VBP gradually/RB increasing/VBG in/IN number/NN with/IN the/DT advent/NN of/IN new/JJ forms/NNS of/IN technology/NN ./.
Many/JJ human/JJ beings/NNS can/MD readily/RB transition/VB between/IN these/DT different/JJ forms/NNS of/IN communication/NN with/IN little/JJ or/CC no/DT effort/NN ,/, which/WDT brings/VBZ about/IN the/DT question/NN :/: How/WRB similar/JJ are/VBP these/DT different/JJ communication/NN modalities/NNS ?/.
To/TO understand/VB technology/NN $/$ \/CD text/NN {/-LRB- '/`` }/-RRB- $/$ s/POS influence/NN on/IN English/NNP communication/NN ,/, four/CD different/JJ corpora/NNS were/VBD analyzed/VBN and/CC compared/VBN :/: Writing/VBG from/IN Books/NNS using/VBG the/DT 1/CD -/HYPH grams/NNS database/NN from/IN the/DT Google/NNP Books/NNP project/NN ,/, Twitter/NNP ,/, IRC/NNP Chat/NNP ,/, and/CC transcribed/VBN Talking/VBG ./.
Multi-word/JJ confusion/NN matrices/NNS revealed/VBD that/IN Talking/NNP has/VBZ the/DT most/RBS similarity/NN when/WRB compared/VBN to/IN the/DT other/JJ modes/NNS of/IN communication/NN ,/, while/IN 1/CD -/HYPH grams/NNS were/VBD the/DT least/JJS similar/JJ form/NN of/IN communication/NN analyzed/VBN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT analysis/NN of/IN word/NN usage/NN ,/, word/NN usage/NN frequency/NN distributions/NNS ,/, and/CC word/NN class/NN usage/NN ,/, among/IN other/JJ things/NNS ,/, Talking/VBG is/VBZ also/RB the/DT most/RBS similar/JJ to/IN Twitter/NNP and/CC IRC/NNP Chat/NNP ./.
This/DT suggests/VBZ that/IN communicating/VBG using/VBG Twitter/NNP and/CC IRC/NNP Chat/NNP evolved/VBD from/IN Talking/VBG rather/RB than/IN Writing/VBG ./.
When/WRB we/PRP communicate/VBP online/RB ,/, even/RB though/IN we/PRP are/VBP writing/VBG ,/, we/PRP do/VBP not/RB Tweet/NNP or/CC Chat/NNP how/WRB we/PRP write/VBP books/NNS ;/: we/PRP Tweet/NNP and/CC Chat/NNP how/WRB we/PRP Speak/VBP ./.
Nonfiction/NNP and/CC Fiction/NNP writing/NN were/VBD clearly/RB differentiable/JJ from/IN our/PRP$ analysis/NN with/IN Twitter/NNP and/CC Chat/NNP being/VBG much/RB more/RBR similar/JJ to/IN Fiction/NNP than/IN Nonfiction/NNP writing/NN ./.
These/DT hypotheses/NNS were/VBD then/RB tested/VBN using/VBG author/NN and/CC journalists/NNS Cory/NN Doctorow/NNP ./.
Mr./NNP Doctorow/NNP $/$ \/CD text/NN {/-LRB- '/`` }/-RRB- $/$ s/POS Writing/VBG ,/, Twitter/NNP usage/NN ,/, and/CC Talking/VBG were/VBD all/DT found/VBN to/TO have/VB very/RB similar/JJ vocabulary/NN usage/NN patterns/NNS as/IN the/DT amalgamized/VBN populations/NNS ,/, as/RB long/RB as/IN the/DT writing/NN was/VBD Fiction/NNP ./.
However/RB ,/, Mr./NNP Doctorow/NNP $/$ \/CD text/NN {/-LRB- '/`` }/-RRB- $/$ s/POS Nonfiction/NNP writing/NN is/VBZ different/JJ from/IN 1/CD -/HYPH grams/NNS and/CC other/JJ collected/VBD Nonfiction/NNP writings/NNS ./.
This/DT data/NN could/MD perhaps/RB be/VB used/VBN to/TO create/VB more/JJR entertaining/JJ works/NNS of/IN Nonfiction/NNP ./.
