We/PRP study/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN recognizing/VBG video/NN sequences/NNS of/IN fingerspelled/VBN letters/NNS in/IN American/JJ Sign/VB Language/NNP (/-LRB- ASL/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Fingerspelling/NNP comprises/VBZ a/DT significant/JJ but/CC relatively/RB understudied/JJ part/NN of/IN ASL/NN ./.
Recognizing/VBG fingerspelling/NN is/VBZ challenging/VBG for/IN a/DT number/NN of/IN reasons/NNS :/: It/PRP involves/VBZ quick/RB ,/, small/JJ motions/NNS that/WDT are/VBP often/RB highly/RB coarticulated/VBN ;/: it/PRP exhibits/VBZ significant/JJ variation/NN between/IN signers/NNS ;/: and/CC there/EX has/VBZ been/VBN a/DT dearth/NN of/IN continuous/JJ fingerspelling/NN data/NNS collected/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN we/PRP collect/VBP and/CC annotate/VBP a/DT new/JJ data/NNS set/NN of/IN continuous/JJ fingerspelling/NN videos/NNS ,/, compare/VB several/JJ types/NNS of/IN recognizers/NNS ,/, and/CC explore/VB the/DT problem/NN of/IN signer/NN variation/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ best/RBS -/HYPH performing/VBG models/NNS are/VBP segmental/JJ (/-LRB- semi-Markov/NNP )/-RRB- conditional/JJ random/JJ fields/NNS using/VBG deep/JJ neural/JJ network/NN -/HYPH based/VBN features/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT signer/NN -/HYPH dependent/JJ setting/NN ,/, our/PRP$ recognizers/NNS achieve/VBP up/RP to/IN about/RB 92/CD percent/NN letter/NN accuracy/NN ./.
