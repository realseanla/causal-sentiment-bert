Accepting/VBG a/DT proposition/NN means/VBZ that/IN our/PRP$ confidence/NN in/IN this/DT proposition/NN is/VBZ strictly/RB greater/JJR than/IN the/DT confidence/NN in/IN its/PRP$ negation/NN ./.
This/DT paper/NN investigates/VBZ the/DT subclass/NN of/IN uncertainty/NN measures/NNS ,/, expressing/VBG confidence/NN ,/, that/DT capture/NN the/DT idea/NN of/IN acceptance/NN ,/, what/WP we/PRP call/VBP acceptance/NN functions/NNS ./.
Due/IN to/IN the/DT monotonicity/NN property/NN of/IN confidence/NN measures/NNS ,/, the/DT acceptance/NN of/IN a/DT proposition/NN entails/VBZ the/DT acceptance/NN of/IN any/DT of/IN its/PRP$ logical/JJ consequences/NNS ./.
In/IN agreement/NN with/IN the/DT idea/NN that/IN a/DT belief/NN set/NN (/-LRB- in/IN the/DT sense/NN of/IN Gardenfors/NNP )/-RRB- must/MD be/VB closed/VBN under/IN logical/JJ consequence/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ also/RB required/VBN that/IN the/DT separate/JJ acceptance/NN o/IN two/CD propositions/NNS entail/VBP the/DT acceptance/NN of/IN their/PRP$ conjunction/NN ./.
Necessity/NN (/-LRB- and/CC possibility/NN )/-RRB- measures/NNS agree/VBP with/IN this/DT view/NN of/IN acceptance/NN while/IN probability/NN and/CC belief/NN functions/NNS generally/RB do/VBP not/RB ./.
General/NNP properties/NNS of/IN acceptance/NN functions/NNS are/VBP estabilished/VBN ./.
The/DT motivation/NN behind/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ the/DT investigation/NN of/IN a/DT setting/NN for/IN belief/NN revision/NN more/RBR general/JJ than/IN the/DT one/CD proposed/VBN by/IN Alchourron/NNP ,/, Gardenfors/NNP and/CC Makinson/NNP ,/, in/IN connection/NN with/IN the/DT notion/NN of/IN conditioning/NN ./.
