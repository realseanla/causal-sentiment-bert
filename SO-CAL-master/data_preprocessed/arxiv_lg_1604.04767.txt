Learning/VBG dictionaries/NNS suitable/JJ for/IN sparse/JJ coding/NN instead/RB of/IN using/VBG engineered/VBN bases/NNS has/VBZ proven/VBN effective/JJ in/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN image/NN processing/NN tasks/NNS ./.
This/DT paper/NN studies/NNS the/DT optimization/NN of/IN dictionaries/NNS on/IN image/NN data/NNS where/WRB the/DT representation/NN is/VBZ enforced/VBN to/TO be/VB explicitly/RB sparse/JJ with/IN respect/NN to/IN a/DT smooth/JJ ,/, normalized/VBN sparseness/NN measure/NN ./.
This/DT involves/VBZ the/DT computation/NN of/IN Euclidean/JJ projections/NNS onto/IN level/NN sets/NNS of/IN the/DT sparseness/NN measure/NN ./.
While/IN previous/JJ algorithms/NNS for/IN this/DT optimization/NN problem/NN had/VBD at/RB least/RBS quasi-linear/JJ time/NN complexity/NN ,/, here/RB the/DT first/JJ algorithm/NN with/IN linear/JJ time/NN complexity/NN and/CC constant/JJ space/NN complexity/NN is/VBZ proposed/VBN ./.
The/DT key/NN for/IN this/DT is/VBZ the/DT mathematically/RB rigorous/JJ derivation/NN of/IN a/DT characterization/NN of/IN the/DT projection/NN 's/POS result/NN based/VBN on/IN a/DT soft/JJ -/HYPH shrinkage/NN function/NN ./.
This/DT theory/NN is/VBZ applied/VBN in/IN an/DT original/JJ algorithm/NN called/VBN Easy/NNP Dictionary/NNP Learning/NNP (/-LRB- EZDL/NNP )/-RRB- ,/, which/WDT learns/VBZ dictionaries/NNS with/IN a/DT simple/JJ and/CC fast/JJ -/HYPH to/TO -/HYPH compute/VB Hebbian/JJ -/HYPH like/JJ learning/NN rule/NN ./.
The/DT new/JJ algorithm/NN is/VBZ efficient/JJ ,/, expressive/JJ and/CC particularly/RB simple/JJ to/TO implement/VB ./.
It/PRP is/VBZ demonstrated/VBN that/IN despite/IN its/PRP$ simplicity/NN ,/, the/DT proposed/VBN learning/NN algorithm/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO generate/VB a/DT rich/JJ variety/NN of/IN dictionaries/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ a/DT topographic/JJ organization/NN of/IN atoms/NNS or/CC separable/JJ atoms/NNS ./.
Further/RB ,/, the/DT dictionaries/NNS are/VBP as/IN expressive/JJ as/IN those/DT of/IN benchmark/NN learning/NN algorithms/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN the/DT reproduction/NN quality/NN on/IN entire/JJ images/NNS ,/, and/CC result/VBP in/IN an/DT equivalent/JJ denoising/NN performance/NN ./.
EZDL/NNP learns/VBZ approximately/RB 30/CD percent/NN faster/RBR than/IN the/DT already/RB very/RB efficient/JJ Online/NN Dictionary/NNP Learning/NNP algorithm/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ therefore/RB eligible/JJ for/IN rapid/JJ data/NNS set/VBN analysis/NN and/CC problems/NNS with/IN vast/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN learning/NN samples/NNS ./.
