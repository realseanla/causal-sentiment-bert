We/PRP present/VBP a/DT method/NN for/IN the/DT classification/NN of/IN multi-labelled/VBN text/NN documents/NNS explicitly/RB designed/VBN for/IN data/NNS stream/NN applications/NNS that/WDT require/VBP to/TO process/VB a/DT virtually/RB infinite/JJ sequence/NN of/IN data/NNS using/VBG constant/JJ memory/NN and/CC constant/JJ processing/NN time/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN is/VBZ composed/VBN of/IN an/DT online/JJ procedure/NN used/VBN to/TO efficiently/RB map/VB text/NN into/IN a/DT low/JJ -/HYPH dimensional/JJ feature/NN space/NN and/CC a/DT partition/NN of/IN this/DT space/NN into/IN a/DT set/NN of/IN regions/NNS for/IN which/WDT the/DT system/NN extracts/NNS and/CC keeps/VBZ statistics/NNS used/VBN to/TO predict/VB multi-label/JJ text/NN annotations/NNS ./.
Documents/NNS are/VBP fed/VBN into/IN the/DT system/NN as/IN a/DT sequence/NN of/IN words/NNS ,/, mapped/VBN to/IN a/DT region/NN of/IN the/DT partition/NN ,/, and/CC annotated/VBN using/VBG the/DT statistics/NNS computed/VBN from/IN the/DT labelled/VBN instances/NNS colliding/VBG in/IN the/DT same/JJ region/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN is/VBZ referred/VBN to/IN as/IN clashing/VBG ./.
We/PRP illustrate/VBP the/DT method/NN in/IN real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN text/NN data/NNS ,/, comparing/VBG the/DT results/NNS with/IN those/DT obtained/VBN using/VBG other/JJ text/NN classifiers/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, we/PRP provide/VBP an/DT analysis/NN about/IN the/DT effect/NN of/IN the/DT representation/NN space/NN dimensionality/NN on/IN the/DT predictive/JJ performance/NN of/IN the/DT system/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT online/JJ embedding/NN indeed/RB approximates/VBZ the/DT geometry/NN of/IN the/DT full/JJ corpus-wise/JJ TF/NN and/CC TF/NN -/HYPH IDF/NNP space/NN ./.
The/DT model/NN obtains/VBZ competitive/JJ F/NN measures/NNS with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT most/RBS accurate/JJ methods/NNS ,/, using/VBG significantly/RB fewer/JJR computational/JJ resources/NNS ./.
In/IN addition/NN ,/, the/DT method/NN achieves/VBZ a/DT higher/JJR macro-averaged/JJ F/NN measure/NN than/IN methods/NNS with/IN similar/JJ running/NN time/NN ./.
Furthermore/RB ,/, the/DT system/NN is/VBZ able/JJ to/TO learn/VB faster/JJR than/IN the/DT other/JJ methods/NNS from/IN partially/RB labelled/VBN streams/NNS ./.
