We/PRP present/VBP an/DT algorithm/NN for/IN building/VBG rule/NN lists/NNS that/WDT is/VBZ two/CD orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN faster/RBR than/IN previous/JJ work/NN ./.
Rule/NN list/NN algorithms/NNS are/VBP competitors/NNS for/IN decision/NN tree/NN algorithms/NNS ./.
They/PRP are/VBP associative/JJ classifiers/NNS ,/, in/IN that/IN they/PRP are/VBP built/VBN from/IN pre-mined/JJ association/NN rules/NNS ./.
They/PRP have/VBP a/DT logical/JJ structure/NN that/WDT is/VBZ a/DT sequence/NN of/IN IF/NN -/HYPH THEN/RB rules/NNS ,/, identical/JJ to/IN a/DT decision/NN list/NN or/CC one/CD -/HYPH sided/JJ decision/NN tree/NN ./.
Instead/RB of/IN using/VBG greedy/JJ splitting/NN and/CC pruning/NN like/IN decision/NN tree/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, we/PRP fully/RB optimize/VBP over/IN rule/NN lists/NNS ,/, striking/VBG a/DT practical/JJ balance/NN between/IN accuracy/NN ,/, interpretability/NN ,/, and/CC computational/JJ speed/NN ./.
The/DT algorithm/NN presented/VBN here/RB uses/VBZ a/DT mixture/NN of/IN theoretical/JJ bounds/NNS (/-LRB- tight/RB enough/RB to/TO have/VB practical/JJ implications/NNS as/IN a/DT screening/NN or/CC bounding/VBG procedure/NN )/-RRB- ,/, computational/JJ reuse/VB ,/, and/CC highly/RB tuned/JJ language/NN libraries/NNS to/TO achieve/VB computational/JJ efficiency/NN ./.
Currently/RB ,/, for/IN many/JJ practical/JJ problems/NNS ,/, this/DT method/NN achieves/VBZ better/JJR accuracy/NN and/CC sparsity/NN than/IN decision/NN trees/NNS ;/: further/RB ,/, in/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, the/DT computational/JJ time/NN is/VBZ practical/JJ and/CC often/RB less/JJR than/IN that/DT of/IN decision/NN trees/NNS ./.
