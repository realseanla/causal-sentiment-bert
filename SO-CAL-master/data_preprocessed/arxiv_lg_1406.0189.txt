We/PRP study/VBP the/DT total/JJ least/JJS squares/NNS (/-LRB- TLS/NN )/-RRB- problem/NN that/WDT generalizes/VBZ least/JJS squares/NNS regression/NN by/IN allowing/VBG measurement/NN errors/NNS in/IN both/DT dependent/JJ and/CC independent/JJ variables/NNS ./.
TLS/NN is/VBZ widely/RB used/VBN in/IN applied/VBN fields/NNS including/VBG computer/NN vision/NN ,/, system/NN identification/NN and/CC econometrics/NNS ./.
The/DT special/JJ case/NN when/WRB all/DT dependent/JJ and/CC independent/JJ variables/NNS have/VBP the/DT same/JJ level/NN of/IN uncorrelated/JJ Gaussian/JJ noise/NN ,/, known/VBN as/IN ordinary/JJ TLS/NNS ,/, can/MD be/VB solved/VBN by/IN singular/JJ value/NN decomposition/NN (/-LRB- SVD/NN )/-RRB- ./.
