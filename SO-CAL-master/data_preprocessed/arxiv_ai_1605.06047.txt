Self/NNP -/HYPH Organizing/NNP Map/NNP (/-LRB- SOM/NNP )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT neural/JJ network/NN model/NN which/WDT is/VBZ used/VBN to/TO obtain/VB a/DT topology/NN -/HYPH preserving/VBG mapping/NN from/IN the/DT (/-LRB- usually/RB high/JJ dimensional/JJ )/-RRB- input/NN //HYPH feature/NN space/NN to/IN an/DT output/NN //HYPH map/NN space/NN of/IN fewer/JJR dimensions/NNS (/-LRB- usually/RB two/CD or/CC three/CD in/IN order/NN to/TO facilitate/VB visualization/NN )/-RRB- ./.
Neurons/NNS in/IN the/DT output/NN space/NN are/VBP connected/VBN with/IN each/DT other/JJ but/CC this/DT structure/NN remains/VBZ fixed/VBN throughout/IN training/NN and/CC learning/NN is/VBZ achieved/VBN through/IN the/DT updating/NN of/IN neuron/NN reference/NN vectors/NNS in/IN feature/NN space/NN ./.

In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, a/DT variant/NN of/IN SOM/NNP is/VBZ proposed/VBN called/VBN AMSOM/NNP (/-LRB- Adaptive/JJ Moving/VBG Self/NNP -/HYPH Organizing/NNP Map/NNP )/-RRB- that/IN on/IN the/DT one/CD hand/NN creates/VBZ a/DT more/RBR flexible/JJ structure/NN where/WRB neuron/NN positions/NNS are/VBP dynamically/RB altered/VBN during/IN training/NN and/CC on/IN the/DT other/JJ hand/NN tackles/VBZ the/DT drawback/NN of/IN having/VBG a/DT predefined/JJ grid/NN by/IN allowing/VBG neuron/NN addition/NN and/CC //HYPH or/CC removal/NN during/IN training/NN ./.
