Re-scale/JJ boosting/VBG (/-LRB- RBoosting/NN )/-RRB- is/VBZ a/DT variant/NN of/IN boosting/VBG which/WDT can/MD essentially/RB improve/VB the/DT generalization/NN performance/NN of/IN boosting/VBG learning/NN ./.
The/DT key/JJ feature/NN of/IN RBoosting/NN lies/VBZ in/IN introducing/VBG a/DT shrinkage/NN degree/NN to/TO re-scale/VB the/DT ensemble/NN estimate/NN in/IN each/DT gradient/NN -/HYPH descent/NN step/NN ./.
Thus/RB ,/, the/DT shrinkage/NN degree/NN determines/VBZ the/DT performance/NN of/IN RBoosting/NNP ./.
