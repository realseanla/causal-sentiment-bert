We/PRP study/VBP the/DT power/NN of/IN different/JJ types/NNS of/IN adaptive/JJ (/-LRB- nonoblivious/JJ )/-RRB- adversaries/NNS in/IN the/DT setting/NN of/IN prediction/NN with/IN expert/NN advice/NN ,/, under/IN both/CC full/JJ information/NN and/CC bandit/NN feedback/NN ./.
We/PRP measure/VBP the/DT player/NN 's/POS performance/NN using/VBG a/DT new/JJ notion/NN of/IN regret/NN ,/, also/RB known/VBN as/IN policy/NN regret/NN ,/, which/WDT better/JJR captures/VBZ the/DT adversary/NN 's/POS adaptiveness/NN to/IN the/DT player/NN 's/POS behavior/NN ./.

In/IN particular/JJ ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN with/IN switching/VBG costs/NNS ,/, the/DT attainable/JJ rate/NN with/IN bandit/NN feedback/NN is/VBZ $/$ \/SYM Theta/NNP (/-LRB- T/NNP ^/SYM {/-LRB- 2/3/CD }/-RRB- )/-RRB- $/$ ./.
