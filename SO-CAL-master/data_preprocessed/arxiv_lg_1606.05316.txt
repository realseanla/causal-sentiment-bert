Infinite/JJ --/: Layer/NNP Networks/NNP (/-LRB- ILN/NNP )/-RRB- have/VBP recently/RB been/VBN proposed/VBN as/IN an/DT architecture/NN that/WDT mimics/VBZ neural/JJ networks/NNS while/IN enjoying/VBG some/DT of/IN the/DT advantages/NNS of/IN kernel/NN methods/NNS ./.
ILN/NNP are/VBP networks/NNS that/WDT integrate/VBP over/IN infinitely/RB many/JJ nodes/NNS within/IN a/DT single/JJ hidden/JJ layer/NN ./.
