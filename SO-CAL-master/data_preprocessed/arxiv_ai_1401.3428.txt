We/PRP consider/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN optimal/JJ planning/NN in/IN stochastic/JJ domains/NNS with/IN resource/NN constraints/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT resources/NNS are/VBP continuous/JJ and/CC the/DT choice/NN of/IN action/NN at/IN each/DT step/NN depends/VBZ on/IN resource/NN availability/NN ./.
We/PRP introduce/VBP the/DT HAO/NN */NFP algorithm/NN ,/, a/DT generalization/NN of/IN the/DT AO/NNP */NFP algorithm/NN that/WDT performs/VBZ search/NN in/IN a/DT hybrid/JJ state/NN space/NN that/WDT is/VBZ modeled/VBN using/VBG both/DT discrete/JJ and/CC continuous/JJ state/NN variables/NNS ,/, where/WRB the/DT continuous/JJ variables/NNS represent/VBP monotonic/JJ resources/NNS ./.
Like/IN other/JJ heuristic/NN search/NN algorithms/NNS ,/, HAO/NN */NFP leverages/VBZ knowledge/NN of/IN the/DT start/NN state/NN and/CC an/DT admissible/JJ heuristic/NN to/TO focus/VB computational/JJ effort/NN on/IN those/DT parts/NNS of/IN the/DT state/NN space/NN that/WDT could/MD be/VB reached/VBN from/IN the/DT start/NN state/NN by/IN following/VBG an/DT optimal/JJ policy/NN ./.
