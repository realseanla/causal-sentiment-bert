Embedding/VBG learning/NN ,/, a.k.a./RB representation/NN learning/NN ,/, has/VBZ been/VBN shown/VBN to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO model/VB large/JJ -/HYPH scale/NN semantic/JJ knowledge/NN graphs/NNS ./.
A/DT key/JJ concept/NN is/VBZ a/DT mapping/NN of/IN the/DT knowledge/NN graph/NN to/IN a/DT tensor/NN representation/NN whose/WP$ entries/NNS are/VBP predicted/VBN by/IN models/NNS using/VBG latent/NN representations/NNS of/IN generalized/VBN entities/NNS ./.
In/IN recent/JJ publications/NNS the/DT embedding/NN models/NNS were/VBD extended/VBN to/TO also/RB consider/VB temporal/JJ evolutions/NNS ,/, temporal/JJ patterns/NNS and/CC subsymbolic/JJ representations/NNS ./.
These/DT extended/VBD models/NNS were/VBD used/VBN successfully/RB to/TO predict/VB clinical/JJ events/NNS like/IN procedures/NNS ,/, lab/NN measurements/NNS ,/, and/CC diagnoses/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP attempt/VBP to/TO map/VB these/DT embedding/NN models/NNS ,/, which/WDT were/VBD developed/VBN purely/RB as/IN solutions/NNS to/IN technical/JJ problems/NNS ,/, to/IN various/JJ cognitive/JJ memory/NN functions/NNS ,/, in/IN particular/JJ to/IN semantic/JJ and/CC concept/NN memory/NN ,/, episodic/JJ memory/NN and/CC sensory/JJ memory/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB make/VBP an/DT analogy/NN between/IN a/DT predictive/JJ model/NN ,/, which/WDT uses/VBZ entity/NN representations/NNS derived/VBN in/IN memory/NN models/NNS ,/, to/IN working/VBG memory/NN ./.
Cognitive/JJ memory/NN functions/NNS are/VBP typically/RB classified/VBN as/RB long/RB -/HYPH term/NN or/CC short/JJ -/HYPH term/NN memory/NN ,/, where/WRB long/RB -/HYPH term/NN memory/NN has/VBZ the/DT subcategories/NNS declarative/JJ memory/NN and/CC non-declarative/JJ memory/NN and/CC the/DT short/JJ term/NN memory/NN has/VBZ the/DT subcategories/NNS sensory/JJ memory/NN and/CC working/VBG memory/NN ./.
There/EX is/VBZ evidence/NN that/IN these/DT main/JJ cognitive/JJ categories/NNS are/VBP partially/RB dissociated/VBN from/IN one/CD another/DT in/IN the/DT brain/NN ,/, as/IN expressed/VBN in/IN their/PRP$ differential/JJ sensitivity/NN to/IN brain/NN damage/NN ./.
However/RB ,/, there/EX is/VBZ also/RB evidence/NN indicating/VBG that/IN the/DT different/JJ memory/NN functions/NNS are/VBP not/RB mutually/RB independent/JJ ./.
A/DT hypothesis/NN that/IN arises/VBZ out/RP off/IN this/DT work/NN is/VBZ that/IN mutual/JJ information/NN exchange/NN can/MD be/VB achieved/VBN by/IN sharing/VBG or/CC coupling/NN of/IN distributed/VBN latent/JJ representations/NNS of/IN entities/NNS across/IN different/JJ memory/NN functions/NNS ./.
