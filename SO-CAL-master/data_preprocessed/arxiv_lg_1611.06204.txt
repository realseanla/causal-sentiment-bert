Curriculum/NN Learning/NN emphasizes/VBZ the/DT order/NN of/IN training/NN instances/NNS in/IN a/DT computational/JJ learning/NN setup/NN ./.
The/DT core/NN hypothesis/NN is/VBZ that/IN simpler/JJR instances/NNS should/MD be/VB learned/VBN early/RB as/IN building/NN blocks/NNS to/TO learn/VB more/RBR complex/JJ ones/NNS ./.
Despite/IN its/PRP$ usefulness/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB unknown/JJ how/WRB exactly/RB the/DT internal/JJ representation/NN of/IN models/NNS are/VBP affected/VBN by/IN curriculum/NN learning/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP study/VBP the/DT effect/NN of/IN curriculum/NN learning/NN on/IN Long/JJ Short/JJ -/HYPH Term/NN Memory/NN (/-LRB- LSTM/NN )/-RRB- networks/NNS ,/, which/WDT have/VBP shown/VBN strong/JJ competency/NN in/IN many/JJ Natural/NNP Language/NNP Processing/NNP (/-LRB- NLP/NNP )/-RRB- problems/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS on/IN sentiment/NN analysis/NN task/NN and/CC a/DT synthetic/JJ task/NN similar/JJ to/IN sequence/NN prediction/NN tasks/NNS in/IN NLP/NNP show/VBP that/IN curriculum/NN learning/NN has/VBZ a/DT positive/JJ effect/NN on/IN the/DT LSTM/NNP 's/POS internal/JJ states/NNS by/IN biasing/VBG the/DT model/NN towards/IN building/VBG constructive/JJ representations/NNS i.e./FW the/DT internal/JJ representation/NN at/IN the/DT previous/JJ timesteps/NNS are/VBP used/VBN as/IN building/NN blocks/NNS for/IN the/DT final/JJ prediction/NN ./.
We/PRP also/RB find/VBP that/IN smaller/JJR models/NNS significantly/RB improves/VBZ when/WRB they/PRP are/VBP trained/VBN with/IN curriculum/NN learning/NN ./.
