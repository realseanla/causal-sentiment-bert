The/DT difficulty/NN in/IN analyzing/VBG LSTM/NN -/HYPH like/JJ recurrent/JJ neural/JJ networks/NNS lies/VBZ in/IN the/DT complex/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT recurrent/JJ unit/NN ,/, which/WDT induces/VBZ highly/RB complex/JJ nonlinear/JJ dynamics/NNS ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP design/VBP a/DT new/JJ simple/JJ recurrent/JJ unit/NN ,/, which/WDT we/PRP call/VBP Prototypical/JJ Recurrent/JJ Unit/NN (/-LRB- PRU/NN )/-RRB- ./.
We/PRP verify/VBP experimentally/RB that/IN PRU/NNP performs/VBZ comparably/RB to/IN LSTM/NNP and/CC GRU/NNP ./.
This/DT potentially/RB enables/VBZ PRU/NNP to/TO be/VB a/DT prototypical/JJ example/NN for/IN analytic/JJ study/NN of/IN LSTM/NN -/HYPH like/JJ recurrent/JJ networks/NNS ./.
Along/IN these/DT experiments/NNS ,/, the/DT memorization/NN capability/NN of/IN LSTM/NN -/HYPH like/JJ networks/NNS is/VBZ also/RB studied/VBN and/CC some/DT insights/NNS are/VBP obtained/VBN ./.
