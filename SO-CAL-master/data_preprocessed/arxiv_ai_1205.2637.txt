A/DT major/JJ benefit/NN of/IN graphical/JJ models/NNS is/VBZ that/IN most/JJS knowledge/NN is/VBZ captured/VBN in/IN the/DT model/NN structure/NN ./.
Many/JJ models/NNS ,/, however/RB ,/, produce/VBP inference/NN problems/NNS with/IN a/DT lot/NN of/IN symmetries/NNS not/RB reflected/VBN in/IN the/DT graphical/JJ structure/NN and/CC hence/RB not/RB exploitable/JJ by/IN efficient/JJ inference/NN techniques/NNS such/JJ as/IN belief/NN propagation/NN (/-LRB- BP/NN )/-RRB- ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP present/VBP a/DT new/JJ and/CC simple/JJ BP/NN algorithm/NN ,/, called/VBN counting/VBG BP/NN ,/, that/IN exploits/NNS such/JJ additional/JJ symmetries/NNS ./.
Starting/VBG from/IN a/DT given/VBN factor/NN graph/NN ,/, counting/VBG BP/NN first/JJ constructs/NNS a/DT compressed/JJ factor/NN graph/NN of/IN clusternodes/NNS and/CC clusterfactors/NNS ,/, corresponding/VBG to/IN sets/NNS of/IN nodes/NNS and/CC factors/NNS that/WDT are/VBP indistinguishable/JJ given/VBN the/DT evidence/NN ./.

Our/PRP$ experiments/NNS show/VBP that/IN counting/VBG BP/NN is/VBZ applicable/JJ to/IN a/DT variety/NN of/IN important/JJ AI/NN tasks/NNS such/JJ as/IN (/-LRB- dynamic/JJ )/-RRB- relational/JJ models/NNS and/CC boolean/JJ model/NN counting/NN ,/, and/CC that/DT significant/JJ efficiency/NN gains/NNS are/VBP obtainable/JJ ,/, often/RB by/IN orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN ./.
