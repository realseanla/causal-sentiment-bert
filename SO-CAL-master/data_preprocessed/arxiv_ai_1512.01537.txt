A/DT general/JJ approach/NN to/IN knowledge/NN transfer/NN is/VBZ introduced/VBN in/IN which/WDT an/DT agent/NN controlled/VBN by/IN a/DT neural/JJ network/NN adapts/VBZ how/WRB it/PRP reuses/VBZ existing/VBG networks/NNS as/IN it/PRP learns/VBZ in/IN a/DT new/JJ domain/NN ./.
Networks/NNS trained/VBN for/IN a/DT new/JJ domain/NN can/MD improve/VB their/PRP$ performance/NN by/IN routing/VBG activation/NN selectively/RB through/IN previously/RB learned/VBN neural/JJ structure/NN ,/, regardless/RB of/IN how/WRB or/CC for/IN what/WP it/PRP was/VBD learned/VBN ./.
