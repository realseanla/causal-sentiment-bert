We/PRP propose/VBP (/-LRB- CAD/NNP )/-RRB- $/$ ^/SYM 2/CD $/$ RL/CD ,/, a/DT flight/NN controller/NN for/IN Collision/NN Avoidance/NN via/IN Deep/JJ Reinforcement/NN Learning/VBG that/DT can/MD be/VB used/VBN to/TO perform/VB collision/NN -/HYPH free/JJ flight/NN in/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN although/IN it/PRP is/VBZ trained/VBN entirely/RB in/IN a/DT 3D/NN CAD/NN model/NN simulator/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ method/NN uses/VBZ only/RB single/JJ RGB/NN images/NNS from/IN a/DT monocular/JJ camera/NN mounted/VBN on/IN the/DT robot/NN as/IN the/DT input/NN and/CC is/VBZ specialized/VBN for/IN indoor/JJ hallway/NN following/VBG and/CC obstacle/NN avoidance/NN ./.
In/IN contrast/NN to/IN most/JJS indoor/JJ navigation/NN techniques/NNS that/WDT aim/VBP to/TO directly/RB reconstruct/VB the/DT 3D/NN geometry/NN of/IN the/DT environment/NN ,/, our/PRP$ approach/NN directly/RB predicts/VBZ the/DT probability/NN of/IN collision/NN given/VBN the/DT current/JJ monocular/JJ image/NN and/CC a/DT candidate/NN action/NN ./.
To/TO obtain/VB accurate/JJ predictions/NNS ,/, we/PRP develop/VBP a/DT deep/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/VBG algorithm/NN for/IN learning/VBG indoor/JJ navigation/NN ,/, which/WDT uses/VBZ the/DT actual/JJ performance/NN of/IN the/DT current/JJ policy/NN to/TO construct/VB accurate/JJ supervision/NN ./.
The/DT collision/NN prediction/NN model/NN is/VBZ represented/VBN by/IN a/DT deep/JJ convolutional/JJ neural/JJ network/NN that/WDT directly/RB processes/VBZ raw/JJ image/NN inputs/NNS ./.
Our/PRP$ collision/NN avoidance/NN system/NN is/VBZ entirely/RB trained/VBN in/IN simulation/NN and/CC thus/RB addresses/VBZ the/DT high/JJ sample/NN complexity/NN of/IN deep/JJ reinforcement/NN learning/NN and/CC avoids/VBZ the/DT dangers/NNS of/IN trial/NN -/HYPH and/CC -/HYPH error/NN learning/NN in/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN ./.
By/IN highly/RB randomizing/VBG the/DT rendering/NN settings/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ simulated/JJ training/NN set/NN ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN we/PRP can/MD train/VB a/DT collision/NN predictor/NN that/WDT generalizes/VBZ to/IN new/JJ environments/NNS with/IN substantially/RB different/JJ appearance/NN from/IN the/DT training/NN scenarios/NNS ./.
Finally/RB ,/, we/PRP evaluate/VBP our/PRP$ method/NN in/IN the/DT real/JJ world/NN by/IN controlling/VBG a/DT real/JJ quadrotor/NN flying/VBG through/IN real/JJ hallways/NNS ./.
We/PRP demonstrate/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ method/NN can/MD perform/VB real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN collision/NN avoidance/NN and/CC hallway/NN following/VBG after/IN being/VBG trained/VBN exclusively/RB on/IN synthetic/JJ images/NNS ,/, without/IN ever/RB having/VBG seen/VBN a/DT single/JJ real/JJ image/NN at/IN the/DT training/NN time/NN ./.
