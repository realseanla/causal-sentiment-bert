For/IN many/JJ optimization/NN problems/NNS it/PRP is/VBZ possible/JJ to/TO define/VB a/DT distance/NN metric/NN between/IN problem/NN variables/NNS that/WDT correlates/VBZ with/IN the/DT likelihood/NN and/CC strength/NN of/IN interactions/NNS between/IN the/DT variables/NNS ./.
For/IN example/NN ,/, one/CD may/MD define/VB a/DT metric/JJ so/IN that/IN the/DT dependencies/NNS between/IN variables/NNS that/WDT are/VBP closer/RBR to/IN each/DT other/JJ with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT metric/JJ are/VBP expected/VBN to/TO be/VB stronger/JJR than/IN the/DT dependencies/NNS between/IN variables/NNS that/WDT are/VBP further/RBR apart/RB ./.
