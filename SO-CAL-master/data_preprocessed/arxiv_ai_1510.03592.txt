We/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN localizing/VBG non-collaborative/JJ WiFi/NN devices/NNS in/IN a/DT large/JJ region/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ main/JJ motive/NN is/VBZ to/TO localize/VB humans/NNS by/IN localizing/VBG their/PRP$ WiFi/NN devices/NNS ,/, e.g./FW during/IN search/NN -/HYPH and/CC -/HYPH rescue/NN operations/NNS after/IN a/DT natural/JJ disaster/NN ./.
We/PRP use/VBP an/DT active/JJ sensing/VBG approach/NN that/WDT relies/VBZ on/IN Unmanned/NNP Aerial/NNP Vehicles/NNPS (/-LRB- UAVs/NNS )/-RRB- to/TO collect/VB signal/NN -/HYPH strength/NN measurements/NNS at/IN informative/JJ locations/NNS ./.
The/DT problem/NN is/VBZ challenging/JJ since/IN the/DT measurement/NN is/VBZ received/VBN at/IN arbitrary/JJ times/NNS and/CC they/PRP are/VBP received/VBN only/RB when/WRB the/DT UAV/NNP is/VBZ in/IN close/JJ proximity/NN to/IN the/DT device/NN ./.
For/IN these/DT reasons/NNS ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ extremely/RB important/JJ to/TO make/VB prudent/JJ decision/NN with/IN very/RB few/JJ measurements/NNS ./.
We/PRP use/VBP the/DT Bayesian/JJ optimization/NN approach/NN based/VBN on/IN Gaussian/JJ process/NN (/-LRB- GP/NNP )/-RRB- regression/NN ./.
This/DT approach/NN works/VBZ well/RB for/IN our/PRP$ application/NN since/IN GPs/NNS give/VBP reliable/JJ predictions/NNS with/IN very/RB few/JJ measurements/NNS while/IN Bayesian/JJ optimization/NN makes/VBZ a/DT judicious/JJ trade/NN -/HYPH off/NN between/IN exploration/NN and/CC exploitation/NN ./.
In/IN field/NN experiments/NNS conducted/VBN over/IN a/DT region/NN of/IN 1000/CD $/$ \/CD times/NNS $/$ 1000/CD $/$ m/CD ^/SYM 2/CD $/$ ,/, we/PRP show/VBP that/IN our/PRP$ approach/NN reduces/VBZ the/DT search/NN area/NN to/IN less/JJR than/IN 100/CD meters/NNS around/IN the/DT WiFi/NN device/NN within/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS only/RB ./.
Overall/RB ,/, our/PRP$ approach/NN localizes/VBZ the/DT device/NN in/IN less/JJR than/IN 15/CD minutes/NNS with/IN an/DT error/NN of/IN less/JJR than/IN 20/CD meters/NNS ./.
