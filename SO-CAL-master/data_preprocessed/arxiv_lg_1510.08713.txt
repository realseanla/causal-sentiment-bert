Since/IN the/DT early/JJ 1980s/NNS ,/, the/DT research/NN community/NN has/VBZ developed/VBN ever/RB more/RBR sophisticated/JJ algorithms/NNS for/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN energy/NN disaggregation/NN ,/, but/CC despite/IN decades/NNS of/IN research/NN ,/, there/EX is/VBZ still/RB a/DT dearth/NN of/IN applications/NNS with/IN demonstrated/VBN value/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT work/NN ,/, we/PRP explore/VBP a/DT question/NN that/WDT is/VBZ highly/RB pertinent/JJ to/IN this/DT research/NN community/NN :/: how/WRB good/JJ does/VBZ energy/NN disaggregation/NN need/VBP to/TO be/VB in/IN order/NN to/TO infer/VB characteristics/NNS of/IN a/DT household/NN ?/.
We/PRP present/VBP novel/JJ techniques/NNS that/WDT use/VBP unsupervised/JJ energy/NN disaggregation/NN to/TO predict/VB both/DT household/NN occupancy/NN and/CC static/NN properties/NNS of/IN the/DT household/NN such/JJ as/IN size/NN of/IN the/DT home/NN and/CC number/NN of/IN occupants/NNS ./.
