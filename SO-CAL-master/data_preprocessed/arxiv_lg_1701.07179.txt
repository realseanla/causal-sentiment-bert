Malicious/JJ URL/NN ,/, a.k.a./RB malicious/JJ website/NN ,/, is/VBZ a/DT common/JJ and/CC serious/JJ threat/NN to/IN cybersecurity/NN ./.
Malicious/JJ URLs/NNS host/NN unsolicited/JJ content/NN (/-LRB- spam/NN ,/, phishing/NN ,/, drive/VB -/HYPH by/RP exploits/NNS ,/, etc./FW )/-RRB- and/CC lure/NN unsuspecting/JJ users/NNS to/TO become/VB victims/NNS of/IN scams/NNS (/-LRB- monetary/JJ loss/NN ,/, theft/NN of/IN private/JJ information/NN ,/, and/CC malware/NN installation/NN )/-RRB- ,/, and/CC cause/VB losses/NNS of/IN billions/NNS of/IN dollars/NNS every/DT year/NN ./.
