The/DT correlation/NN and/CC interactions/NNS among/IN different/JJ biological/JJ entities/NNS comprise/VBP the/DT biological/JJ system/NN ./.
Although/IN already/RB revealed/VBN interactions/NNS contribute/VBP to/IN the/DT understanding/NN of/IN different/JJ existing/VBG systems/NNS ,/, researchers/NNS face/VBP many/JJ questions/NNS everyday/JJ regarding/VBG inter-relationships/NNS among/IN entities/NNS ./.
Their/PRP$ queries/NNS have/VBP potential/JJ role/NN in/IN exploring/VBG new/JJ relations/NNS which/WDT may/MD open/VB up/RP a/DT new/JJ area/NN of/IN investigation/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP introduce/VBP a/DT text/NN mining/NN based/VBN method/NN for/IN answering/VBG the/DT biological/JJ queries/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN statistical/JJ computation/NN such/JJ that/IN researchers/NNS can/MD come/VB up/RP with/IN new/JJ knowledge/NN discovery/NN ./.
It/PRP facilitates/VBZ user/NN to/TO submit/VB their/PRP$ query/NN in/IN natural/JJ linguistic/JJ form/NN which/WDT can/MD be/VB treated/VBN as/IN hypothesis/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ proposed/VBN approach/NN analyzes/VBZ the/DT hypothesis/NN and/CC measures/VBZ the/DT p/NN -/HYPH value/NN of/IN the/DT hypothesis/NN with/IN respect/NN to/IN the/DT existing/VBG literature/NN ./.
Based/VBN on/IN the/DT measured/VBN value/NN ,/, the/DT system/NN either/CC accepts/VBZ or/CC rejects/VBZ the/DT hypothesis/NN from/IN statistical/JJ point/NN of/IN view/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, even/RB it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB find/VB any/DT direct/JJ relationship/NN among/IN the/DT entities/NNS of/IN the/DT hypothesis/NN ,/, it/PRP presents/VBZ a/DT network/NN to/TO give/VB an/DT integral/JJ overview/NN of/IN all/PDT the/DT entities/NNS through/IN which/WDT the/DT entities/NNS might/MD be/VB related/VBN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ also/RB congenial/JJ for/IN the/DT researchers/NNS to/TO widen/VB their/PRP$ view/NN and/CC thus/RB think/VB of/IN new/JJ hypothesis/NN for/IN further/JJ investigation/NN ./.
It/PRP assists/VBZ researcher/NN to/TO get/VB a/DT quantitative/JJ evaluation/NN of/IN their/PRP$ assumptions/NNS such/JJ that/IN they/PRP can/MD reach/VB a/DT logical/JJ conclusion/NN and/CC thus/RB aids/NNS in/IN relevant/JJ re-searches/NNS of/IN biological/JJ knowledge/NN discovery/NN ./.
The/DT system/NN also/RB provides/VBZ the/DT researchers/NNS a/DT graphical/JJ interactive/JJ interface/NN to/TO submit/VB their/PRP$ hypothesis/NN for/IN assessment/NN in/IN a/DT more/RBR convenient/JJ way/NN ./.
