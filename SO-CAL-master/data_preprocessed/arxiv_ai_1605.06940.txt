Combinatorial/JJ decision/NN problems/NNS arise/VBP in/IN many/JJ different/JJ domains/NNS such/JJ as/IN scheduling/NN ,/, routing/NN ,/, packing/NN ,/, bioinformatics/NN ,/, and/CC many/JJ more/JJR ./.
Despite/IN recent/JJ advances/NNS in/IN developing/VBG scalable/JJ solvers/NNS ,/, there/EX are/VBP still/RB many/JJ problems/NNS which/WDT are/VBP often/RB very/RB hard/JJ to/TO solve/VB ./.
Typically/RB the/DT most/RBS advanced/JJ solvers/NNS include/VBP elements/NNS which/WDT are/VBP stochastic/JJ in/IN nature/NN ./.
If/IN a/DT same/JJ instance/NN is/VBZ solved/VBN many/JJ times/NNS using/VBG different/JJ seeds/NNS then/RB depending/VBG on/IN the/DT inherent/JJ characteristics/NNS of/IN a/DT problem/NN instance/NN and/CC the/DT solver/NN ,/, one/PRP can/MD observe/VB a/DT highly/RB -/HYPH variant/JJ distribution/NN of/IN times/NNS spanning/VBG multiple/JJ orders/NNS of/IN magnitude/NN ./.
Therefore/RB ,/, to/TO solve/VB a/DT problem/NN instance/NN efficiently/RB it/PRP is/VBZ often/RB useful/JJ to/TO solve/VB the/DT same/JJ instance/NN in/IN parallel/JJ with/IN different/JJ seeds/NNS ./.
With/IN the/DT proliferation/NN of/IN cloud/NN computing/NN ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ natural/JJ to/TO think/VB about/IN an/DT elastic/JJ solver/NN which/WDT can/MD scale/VB up/RP by/IN launching/VBG searches/NNS in/IN parallel/NN on/IN thousands/NNS of/IN machines/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC cores/NNS )/-RRB- ./.
However/RB ,/, this/DT could/MD result/VB in/IN consuming/VBG a/DT lot/NN of/IN energy/NN ./.
Moreover/RB ,/, not/RB every/DT instance/NN would/MD require/VB thousands/NNS of/IN machines/NNS ./.
The/DT challenge/NN is/VBZ to/TO resolve/VB the/DT tradeoff/NN between/IN solution/NN time/NN and/CC energy/NN consumption/NN optimally/RB for/IN a/DT given/VBN problem/NN instance/NN ./.
We/PRP analyse/VBP the/DT impact/NN of/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN machines/NNS (/-LRB- or/CC cores/NNS )/-RRB- on/IN not/RB only/JJ solution/NN time/NN but/CC also/RB on/IN energy/NN consumption/NN ./.
We/PRP highlight/VBP that/IN although/IN solution/NN time/NN always/RB drops/VBZ as/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN machines/NNS increases/NNS ,/, the/DT relation/NN between/IN the/DT number/NN of/IN machines/NNS and/CC energy/NN consumption/NN is/VBZ more/RBR complicated/JJ ./.
In/IN many/JJ cases/NNS ,/, the/DT optimal/JJ energy/NN consumption/NN may/MD be/VB achieved/VBN by/IN a/DT middle/JJ ground/NN ,/, we/PRP analyse/VBP this/DT relationship/NN in/IN detail/NN ./.
The/DT tradeoff/NN between/IN solution/NN time/NN and/CC energy/NN consumption/NN is/VBZ studied/VBN further/RB ,/, showing/VBG that/IN the/DT energy/NN consumption/NN of/IN a/DT solver/NN can/MD be/VB reduced/VBN drastically/RB if/IN we/PRP increase/VBP the/DT solution/NN time/NN marginally/RB ./.
We/PRP also/RB develop/VBP a/DT prediction/NN model/NN ,/, demonstrating/VBG that/IN such/JJ insights/NNS can/MD be/VB exploited/VBN to/TO achieve/VB faster/RBR solutions/NNS times/NNS in/IN a/DT more/JJR energy/NN efficient/JJ manor/NN ./.
