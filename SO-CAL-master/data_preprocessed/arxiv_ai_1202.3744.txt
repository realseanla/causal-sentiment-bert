Previous/JJ work/NN has/VBZ shown/VBN that/IN the/DT problem/NN of/IN learning/VBG the/DT optimal/JJ structure/NN of/IN a/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN can/MD be/VB formulated/VBN as/IN a/DT shortest/JJS path/NN finding/NN problem/NN in/IN a/DT graph/NN and/CC solved/VBN using/VBG A/DT */SYM search/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP improve/VBP the/DT scalability/NN of/IN this/DT approach/NN by/IN developing/VBG a/DT memory/NN -/HYPH efficient/JJ heuristic/NN search/NN algorithm/NN for/IN learning/VBG the/DT structure/NN of/IN a/DT Bayesian/JJ network/NN ./.
Instead/RB of/IN using/VBG A/DT */SYM ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP a/DT frontier/NN breadth/NN -/HYPH first/JJ branch/NN and/CC bound/VBN search/NN that/WDT leverages/VBZ the/DT layered/JJ structure/NN of/IN the/DT search/NN graph/NN of/IN this/DT problem/NN so/IN that/IN no/DT more/JJR than/IN two/CD layers/NNS of/IN the/DT graph/NN ,/, plus/CC solution/NN reconstruction/NN information/NN ,/, need/VBP to/TO be/VB stored/VBN in/IN memory/NN at/IN a/DT time/NN ./.
To/TO further/RB improve/VB scalability/NN ,/, the/DT algorithm/NN stores/NNS most/JJS of/IN the/DT graph/NN in/IN external/JJ memory/NN ,/, such/JJ as/IN hard/JJ disk/NN ,/, when/WRB it/PRP does/VBZ not/RB fit/VB in/IN RAM/NNP ./.
Experimental/JJ results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT resulting/VBG algorithm/NN solves/VBZ significantly/RB larger/JJR problems/NNS than/IN the/DT current/JJ state/NN of/IN the/DT art/NN ./.
