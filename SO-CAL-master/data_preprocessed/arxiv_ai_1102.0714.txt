One/CD of/IN the/DT main/JJ research/NN areas/NNS in/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP is/VBZ the/DT coding/NN of/IN agents/NNS (/-LRB- programs/NNS )/-RRB- which/WDT are/VBP able/JJ to/TO learn/VB by/IN themselves/PRP in/IN any/DT situation/NN ./.
This/DT means/VBZ that/IN agents/NNS must/MD be/VB useful/JJ for/IN purposes/NNS other/JJ than/IN those/DT they/PRP were/VBD created/VBN for/IN ,/, as/IN ,/, for/IN example/NN ,/, playing/VBG chess/NN ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN we/PRP try/VBP to/TO get/VB closer/JJR to/IN the/DT pristine/JJ goal/NN of/IN Artificial/NNP Intelligence/NNP ./.
One/CD of/IN the/DT problems/NNS to/TO decide/VB whether/IN an/DT agent/NN is/VBZ really/RB intelligent/JJ or/CC not/RB is/VBZ the/DT measurement/NN of/IN its/PRP$ intelligence/NN ,/, since/IN there/EX is/VBZ currently/RB no/DT way/NN to/TO measure/VB it/PRP in/IN a/DT reliable/JJ way/NN ./.
The/DT purpose/NN of/IN this/DT project/NN is/VBZ to/TO create/VB an/DT interpreter/NN that/WDT allows/VBZ for/IN the/DT execution/NN of/IN several/JJ environments/NNS ,/, including/VBG those/DT which/WDT are/VBP generated/VBN randomly/RB ,/, so/IN that/IN an/DT agent/NN (/-LRB- a/DT person/NN or/CC a/DT program/NN )/-RRB- can/MD interact/VB with/IN them/PRP ./.
Once/IN the/DT interaction/NN between/IN the/DT agent/NN and/CC the/DT environment/NN is/VBZ over/RB ,/, the/DT interpreter/NN will/MD measure/VB the/DT intelligence/NN of/IN the/DT agent/NN according/VBG to/IN the/DT actions/NNS ,/, states/NNS and/CC rewards/VBZ the/DT agent/NN has/VBZ undergone/VBN inside/IN the/DT environment/NN during/IN the/DT test/NN ./.
As/IN a/DT result/NN we/PRP will/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO measure/VB agents/NNS '/POS intelligence/NN in/IN any/DT possible/JJ environment/NN ,/, and/CC to/TO make/VB comparisons/NNS between/IN several/JJ agents/NNS ,/, in/IN order/NN to/TO determine/VB which/WDT of/IN them/PRP is/VBZ the/DT most/RBS intelligent/JJ ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO perform/VB the/DT tests/NNS ,/, the/DT interpreter/NN must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO randomly/RB generate/VB environments/NNS that/WDT are/VBP really/RB useful/JJ to/TO measure/VB agents/NNS '/POS intelligence/NN ,/, since/IN not/RB any/DT randomly/RB generated/VBN environment/NN will/MD serve/VB that/DT purpose/NN ./.
