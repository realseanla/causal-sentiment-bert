In/IN this/DT research/NN we/PRP address/VBP the/DT problem/NN of/IN capturing/VBG recurring/VBG concepts/NNS in/IN a/DT data/NN stream/NN environment/NN ./.
Recurrence/NN capture/NN enables/VBZ the/DT re-use/NN of/IN previously/RB learned/VBN classifiers/NNS without/IN the/DT need/NN for/IN re-learning/NN while/IN providing/VBG for/IN better/JJR accuracy/NN during/IN the/DT concept/NN recurrence/NN interval/NN ./.
We/PRP capture/VBP concepts/NNS by/IN applying/VBG the/DT Discrete/NNP Fourier/NNP Transform/NNP (/-LRB- DFT/NNP )/-RRB- to/IN Decision/NN Tree/NNP classifiers/NNS to/TO obtain/VB highly/RB compressed/JJ versions/NNS of/IN the/DT trees/NNS at/IN concept/NN drift/NN points/NNS in/IN the/DT stream/NN and/CC store/NN such/JJ trees/NNS in/IN a/DT repository/NN for/IN future/JJ use/NN ./.
Our/PRP$ empirical/JJ results/NNS on/IN real/JJ world/NN and/CC synthetic/JJ data/NNS exhibiting/VBG varying/VBG degrees/NNS of/IN recurrence/NN show/VBP that/IN the/DT Fourier/NNP compressed/VBN trees/NNS are/VBP more/RBR robust/JJ to/IN noise/NN and/CC are/VBP able/JJ to/TO capture/VB recurring/VBG concepts/NNS with/IN higher/JJR precision/NN than/IN a/DT meta/NN learning/NN approach/NN that/WDT chooses/VBZ to/IN re-use/NN classifiers/NNS in/IN their/PRP$ originally/RB occurring/VBG form/NN ./.
