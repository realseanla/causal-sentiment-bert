Efficient/JJ implementations/NNS of/IN DPLL/NN with/IN the/DT addition/NN of/IN clause/NN learning/NN are/VBP the/DT fastest/JJS complete/JJ Boolean/JJ satisfiability/NN solvers/NNS and/CC can/MD handle/VB many/JJ significant/JJ real/JJ -/HYPH world/NN problems/NNS ,/, such/JJ as/IN verification/NN ,/, planning/NN and/CC design/NN ./.
Despite/IN its/PRP$ importance/NN ,/, little/JJ is/VBZ known/VBN of/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ strengths/NNS and/CC limitations/NNS of/IN the/DT technique/NN ./.
