Recent/JJ advancements/NNS in/IN unsupervised/JJ feature/NN learning/NN have/VBP developed/VBN powerful/JJ latent/JJ representations/NNS of/IN words/NNS ./.
However/RB ,/, it/PRP is/VBZ still/RB not/RB clear/JJ what/WP makes/VBZ one/CD representation/NN better/JJR than/IN another/DT and/CC how/WRB we/PRP can/MD learn/VB the/DT ideal/JJ representation/NN ./.
