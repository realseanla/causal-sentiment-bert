Techniques/NNS for/IN unsupervised/JJ discovery/NN of/IN acoustic/JJ patterns/NNS are/VBP getting/VBG increasingly/RB attractive/JJ ,/, because/IN huge/JJ quantities/NNS of/IN speech/NN data/NNS are/VBP becoming/VBG available/JJ but/CC manual/JJ annotations/NNS remain/VBP hard/JJ to/TO acquire/VB ./.
In/IN this/DT paper/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP an/DT approach/NN for/IN unsupervised/JJ discovery/NN of/IN linguistic/JJ structure/NN for/IN the/DT target/NN spoken/VBN language/NN given/VBN raw/JJ speech/NN data/NNS ./.
This/DT linguistic/JJ structure/NN includes/VBZ two/CD -/HYPH level/NN (/-LRB- subword/NN -/HYPH like/JJ and/CC word/NN -/HYPH like/JJ )/-RRB- acoustic/JJ patterns/NNS ,/, the/DT lexicon/NN of/IN word/NN -/HYPH like/JJ patterns/NNS in/IN terms/NNS of/IN subword/NN -/HYPH like/JJ patterns/NNS and/CC the/DT N/NN -/HYPH gram/NN language/NN model/NN based/VBN on/IN word/NN -/HYPH like/JJ patterns/NNS ./.
All/DT patterns/NNS ,/, models/NNS ,/, and/CC parameters/NNS can/MD be/VB automatically/RB learned/VBN from/IN the/DT unlabelled/JJ speech/NN corpus/NN ./.
This/DT is/VBZ achieved/VBN by/IN an/DT initialization/NN step/NN followed/VBN by/IN three/CD cascaded/VBN stages/NNS for/IN acoustic/JJ ,/, linguistic/JJ ,/, and/CC lexical/JJ iterative/JJ optimization/NN ./.
The/DT lexicon/NN of/IN word/NN -/HYPH like/JJ patterns/NNS defines/VBZ allowed/VBN consecutive/JJ sequence/NN of/IN HMMs/NNS for/IN subword/NN -/HYPH like/JJ patterns/NNS ./.
In/IN each/DT iteration/NN ,/, model/NN training/NN and/CC decoding/NN produces/VBZ updated/VBN labels/NNS from/IN which/WDT the/DT lexicon/NN and/CC HMMs/NNS can/MD be/VB further/RB updated/VBN ./.
In/IN this/DT way/NN ,/, model/NN parameters/NNS and/CC decoded/VBN labels/NNS are/VBP respectively/RB optimized/VBN in/IN each/DT iteration/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT knowledge/NN about/IN the/DT linguistic/JJ structure/NN is/VBZ learned/VBN gradually/RB layer/NN after/IN layer/NN ./.
The/DT proposed/VBN approach/NN was/VBD tested/VBN in/IN preliminary/JJ experiments/NNS on/IN a/DT corpus/NN of/IN Mandarin/NNP broadcast/VBD news/NN ,/, including/VBG a/DT task/NN of/IN spoken/JJ term/NN detection/NN with/IN performance/NN compared/VBN to/IN a/DT parallel/JJ test/NN using/VBG models/NNS trained/VBN in/IN a/DT supervised/JJ way/NN ./.
Results/NNS show/VBP that/IN the/DT proposed/VBN system/NN not/RB only/RB yields/VBZ reasonable/JJ performance/NN on/IN its/PRP$ own/JJ ,/, but/CC is/VBZ also/RB complimentary/JJ to/IN existing/VBG large/JJ vocabulary/NN ASR/NN systems/NNS ./.
