Often/RB ,/, the/DT performance/NN on/IN a/DT supervised/JJ machine/NN learning/VBG task/NN is/VBZ evaluated/VBN with/IN a/DT loss/NN function/NN that/WDT can/MD not/RB be/VB optimized/VBN directly/RB ./.
A/DT common/JJ solution/NN to/IN this/DT problem/NN is/VBZ to/TO simply/RB optimize/VB a/DT surrogate/JJ loss/NN function/NN in/IN the/DT hope/NN that/IN the/DT task/NN loss/NN of/IN interest/NN will/MD go/VB down/RP as/RB well/RB ./.
The/DT task/NN loss/NN function/NN defines/VBZ the/DT cost/NN for/IN all/DT possible/JJ answers/NNS and/CC it/PRP is/VBZ arguably/RB the/DT most/RBS important/JJ element/NN of/IN the/DT problem/NN setup/NN ./.

For/IN this/DT purpose/NN ,/, we/PRP propose/VBP to/IN train/NN an/DT estimator/NN of/IN the/DT task/NN loss/NN function/NN itself/PRP and/CC to/TO make/VB predictions/NNS by/IN looking/VBG for/IN the/DT output/NN with/IN the/DT lowest/JJS estimated/JJ loss/NN ./.
