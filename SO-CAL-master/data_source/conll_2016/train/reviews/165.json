{"title": "Discovering Correspondences between Multiple Languages by MDL", "abstract": "How can we automatically discover the most important correspondences between words from two or more languages? How can we do so allowing for correspondences between any subset of languages, without drowning in redundant results, and at the same time maintaining control over the level of detail? These are exactly the questions we answer in this paper. We approach the problem with the Minimum Description Length principle, and give an efficient algorithm for discovering statistically important correspondences. We test the efficacy of our method against a set of Slavic languages. The experiments show our method automatically discovers non-trivial associations, allowing for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of multiple languages.", "id": "165", "reviews": [{"comments": "This paper proposes a method for discovering correspondences between languages\nbased on MDL. The author model correspondences between words sharing the same\nmeaning in a number of Slavic languages. They develop codes for rules that\nmatch substrings in two or more languages and formulate an MDL objective that\nbalances the description of the model and the data given the model. \nThe model is trained with EM and tested on a set of 13 Slavic languages. The\nresults are shown by several distance measures, a phylogenetic tree, and\nexample of found correspondences. \n\nThe motivation and formulation of the approach makes sense. MDL seems like a\nreasonable tool to attack the problem and the motivation for employing EM is\npresented nicely. I must admit, though, that some of the derivations were not\nentirely clear to me.\nThe authors point out the resemblance of the MDL objective to Bayesian\ninference, and one thinks of the application of Bayesian inference in\n(biological) phylogenetic inference, e.g. using the MrBayes tool. An empirical\ncomparison here could be insightful.  \n\nRelated work: \n- Lacking comparison to methods for borrowing and cognate detection or other\ncomputational methods for historical linguistics. For example, the studies by\nAlexandre Bouchard-Cote, Tandy Warnow, Luay Nakhleh and Andrew Kitchen. Some\nmay not have available tools to apply in the given dataset, but one can mention\nList and Moran (2013). There are also relevant tools for biological phylogeny\ninference that can be applied (paup, MrBayes, etc.). \n\nApproach and methodology\n- Alignment procedure: the memory/runtime bottleneck appears to be a major\ndrawback, allowing the comparison of only 5 languages at most. As long as\nmultiple languages are involved, and phylogenetic trees, it would be\ninteresting to see more languages. I'm curious what ideas the authors have for\ndealing with this issue. \n- Phylogenetic tree: using neighbor joining for creating phylogenetic trees is\nknown to have disadvantages (like having to specify the root manually). How\nabout more sophisticated methods?  \n- Do you run EM until convergence or have some other stopping criterion? \n\nData\n- Two datasets are mixed, one of cognates and one not necessarily (the Swadesh\nlists). Have you considered how this might impact the results? \n- The data is in orthographic form, which might hide many correspondences. This\nis especially apparent in languages with different scripts. Therefore the\nlearned rules might indicate change of script more than real linguistic\ncorrespondences. This seems like a shortcoming that could be avoided by working\non the level of phonetic transcriptions.\n\nUnclear points\n- What is the \"optimal unigram for symbol usages in all rules\"? (line 286)\n- The merging done in the maximization step was not entirely clear to me. \n\nMinor issue\n- \"focus in on\" -> \"focus on\" (line 440)\n\nRefs\nJohann-Mattis List, Steven Moran. 2013.
