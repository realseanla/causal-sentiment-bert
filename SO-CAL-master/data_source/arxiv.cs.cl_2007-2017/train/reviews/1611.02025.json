This paper addresses the lack of a standard dataset and evaluative methodology for the problem. We present and make publicly available a new dataset of 18,793 news articles covering 39 entities. For each entity, we provide a gold standard timeline and a set of entity-related articles. We propose ROUGE as an evaluation metric and validate our dataset by showing that top Google results outperform straw-man baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 12:47:25 GMT  (744kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02025v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xavier holt", "will radford", "ben hachey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02025"}
