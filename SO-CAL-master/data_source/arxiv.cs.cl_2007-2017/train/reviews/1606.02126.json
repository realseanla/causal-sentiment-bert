Previous studies formalize it as a string-to-string problem, and solve it in an unsupervised way. In this paper, we formalize it as a syntax-based alignment problem, and solve it in a supervised manner based on the syntax trees. Experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 13:00:48 GMT  (1893kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02126v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 07:26:13 GMT  (1657kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02126v2", "Added significance test results"], ["v3", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 01:02:41 GMT  (1656kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02126v3", "Added significance test results"], ["v4", "Sat, 18 Feb 2017 01:53:58 GMT  (1780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02126v4", "Updated the paper with AMR parsing results"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chenhui chu", "sadao kurohashi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02126"}
