In this work we develop a full fledged pipeline to generate summaries of news articles using the Abstract Meaning Representation(AMR). We first generate the AMR graphs of stories then extract summary graphs from the story graphs and finally generate sentences from the summary graph. For extracting summary AMRs from the story AMRs we use a two step process. First, we find important sentences from the text and then extract the summary AMRs from those selected sentences. We outperform the previous methods using AMR for summarization by more that 3 ROGUE-1 points. On the CNN-Dailymail corpus we achieve results competitive with the strong lead-3 baseline till summary graph extraction step.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 10:04:45 GMT  (272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01678v1", "10 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Jul 2017 20:48:14 GMT  (272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01678v2", "10 pages, 4 figures"], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 21:27:44 GMT  (276kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01678v3", "10 pages, 4 figures, Update: Added more results , corrected figures and tables"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shibhansh dohare", "harish karnick", "vivek gupta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01678"}
