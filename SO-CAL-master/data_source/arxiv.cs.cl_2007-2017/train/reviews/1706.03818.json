Recent work has shown that comparing speech segments by representing them as fixed-dimensional vectors --- acoustic word embeddings --- and measuring their vector distance (e.g., cosine distance) can discriminate between words more accurately than DTW-based approaches. We consider an approach to query-by-example search that embeds both the query and database segments according to a neural model, followed by nearest-neighbor search to find the matching segments. Earlier work on embedding-based query-by-example, using template-based acoustic word embeddings, achieved competitive performance. We find that our embeddings, based on recurrent neural networks trained to optimize word discrimination, achieve substantial improvements in performance and run-time efficiency over the previous approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 19:30:57 GMT  (477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03818v1", "To appear Interspeech 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear Interspeech 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shane settle", "keith levin", "herman kamper", "karen livescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03818"}
