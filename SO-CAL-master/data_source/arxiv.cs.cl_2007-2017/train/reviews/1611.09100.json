In contrast with prior work on tree-structured models in which the trees are either provided as input or predicted using supervision from explicit treebank annotations, the tree structures in this work are optimized to improve performance on a downstream task. Experiments demonstrate the benefit of learning task-specific composition orders, outperforming both sequential encoders and recursive encoders based on treebank annotations. We analyze the induced trees and show that while they discover some linguistically intuitive structures (e.g., noun phrases, simple verb phrases), they are different than conventional English syntactic structures.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 12:57:07 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09100v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dani yogatama", "phil blunsom", "chris dyer", "edward grefenstette", "wang ling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.09100"}
