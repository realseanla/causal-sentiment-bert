{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Jun-2016", "title": "Single-Model Encoder-Decoder with Explicit Morphological Representation for Reinflection", "abstract": "Morphological reinflection is the task of generating a target form given a source form, a source tag and a target tag. We propose a new way of modeling this task with neural encoder-decoder models. Our approach reduces the amount of required training data for this architecture and achieves state-of-the-art results, making encoder-decoder models applicable to morphological reinflection even for low-resource languages. We further present a new automatic correction method for the outputs based on edit trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 08:57:14 GMT  (231kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00589v1", "Accepted at ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["katharina kann", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00589"}
