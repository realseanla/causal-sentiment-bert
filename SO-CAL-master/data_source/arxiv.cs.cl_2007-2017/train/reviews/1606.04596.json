Since parallel corpora are usually limited in quantity, quality, and coverage, especially for low-resource languages, it is appealing to exploit monolingual corpora to improve NMT. We propose a semi-supervised approach for training NMT models on the concatenation of labeled (parallel corpora) and unlabeled (monolingual corpora) data. The central idea is to reconstruct the monolingual corpora using an autoencoder, in which the source-to-target and target-to-source translation models serve as the encoder and decoder, respectively. Our approach can not only exploit the monolingual corpora of the target language, but also of the source language. Experiments on the Chinese-English dataset show that our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art SMT and NMT systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:22:27 GMT  (223kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04596v1", "Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of ACL 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 10 Aug 2016 19:08:20 GMT  (223kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04596v2", "Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of ACL 2016.
