We identify multiple features and build a model to rank entities using a ground-truth dataset of more than 10 thousand labels. The final system ranks 27 million entities with 75% precision and 48% F1 score. We provide performance evaluation and empirical evidence of the quality of ranking across languages, and open the final ranked lists for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:16:02 GMT  (1776kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06108v1", "2 Pages, 1 Figure, 2 Tables, WWW2017 Companion, WWW 2017 Companion"]], "COMMENTS": "2 Pages, 1 Figure, 2 Tables, WWW2017 Companion, WWW 2017 Companion", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["prantik bhattacharyya", "nemanja spasojevic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06108"}
