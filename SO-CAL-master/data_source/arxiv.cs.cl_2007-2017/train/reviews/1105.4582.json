In this paper, we evaluate how native speakers of American English and Arabic perceive personality traits and naturalness of English utterances that vary along the dimensions of verbosity, hedging, lexical and syntactic alignment, and formality. The utterances are the turns within dialogue fragments that are presented as text transcripts to the workers of Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results of the study suggest that all four dimensions can be used as linguistic markers of all personality traits by both language communities. A further comparative analysis shows cross-cultural differences for some combinations of measures of personality traits and naturalness, the dimensions of linguistic variability and dialogue acts.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2011 18:49:02 GMT  (30kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4582v1", "An abridged version is accepted for publication at SIGDIAL 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "An abridged version is accepted for publication at SIGDIAL 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.RO", "authors": ["maxim makatchev", "reid simmons"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.4582"}
