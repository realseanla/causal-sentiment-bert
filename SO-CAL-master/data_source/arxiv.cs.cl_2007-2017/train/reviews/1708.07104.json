In this paper, we focus on the automatic identification of fake content in online news. Our contribution is twofold. First, we introduce two novel datasets for the task of fake news detection, covering seven different news domains. We describe the collection, annotation, and validation process in detail and present several exploratory analysis on the identification of linguistic differences in fake and legitimate news content. Second, we conduct a set of learning experiments to build accurate fake news detectors. In addition, we provide comparative analyses of the automatic and manual identification of fake news.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 17:12:03 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07104v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ver\\'onica p\\'erez-rosas", "bennett kleinberg", "alexandra lefevre", "rada mihalcea"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07104"}
