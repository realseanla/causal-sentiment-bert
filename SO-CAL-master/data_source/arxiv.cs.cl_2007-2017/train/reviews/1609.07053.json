{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Sep-2016", "title": "Semantic Tagging with Deep Residual Networks", "abstract": "We propose a novel semantic tagging task, semtagging, tailored for the purpose of multilingual semantic parsing, and present the first tagger using deep residual networks (ResNets). Our tagger uses both word and character representations and includes a novel residual bypass architecture. We evaluate the tagset both intrinsically on the new task of semantic tagging, as well as on Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging. Our system, consisting of a ResNet and an auxiliary loss function predicting our semantic tags, significantly outperforms prior results on English Universal Dependencies POS tagging (95.71% accuracy on UD v1.2 and 95.67% accuracy on UD v1.3).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 16:34:00 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07053v1", "10 pages, to appear at COLING 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 18:33:13 GMT  (118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07053v2", "COLING 2016, camera ready version"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, to appear at COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["johannes bjerva", "barbara plank", "johan bos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07053"}
