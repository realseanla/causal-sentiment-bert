This effortful design process starts in stark contrast to the easiness with which people can use language to describe real and imaginary environments. We present SceneSeer: an interactive text to 3D scene generation system that allows a user to design 3D scenes using natural language. A user provides input text from which we extract explicit constraints on the objects that should appear in the scene. Given these explicit constraints, the system then uses a spatial knowledge base learned from an existing database of 3D scenes and 3D object models to infer an arrangement of the objects forming a natural scene matching the input description. Using textual commands the user can then iteratively refine the created scene by adding, removing, replacing, and manipulating objects. We evaluate the quality of 3D scenes generated by SceneSeer in a perceptual evaluation experiment where we compare against manually designed scenes and simpler baselines for 3D scene generation. We demonstrate how the generated scenes can be iteratively refined through simple natural language commands.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 20:47:47 GMT  (7392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00050v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GR cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["angel x chang", "mihail eric", "manolis savva", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00050"}
