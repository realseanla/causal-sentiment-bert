The present study shows that combining quantitative and qualitative approaches is essential for understanding non-standard linguistic variation in a CMC corpus. It also presents a methodology that enables the systematic study of this variation by including all non-standard words in the corpus. The analyses resulted in a convincing illustration of the Adolescent Peak Principle. In addition, our approach revealed an intriguing correlation between the use of regional speech features and chatspeak features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 13:02:59 GMT  (322kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02431v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["claudia peersman", "walter daelemans", "reinhild vandekerckhove", "bram vandekerckhove", "leona van vaerenbergh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02431"}
