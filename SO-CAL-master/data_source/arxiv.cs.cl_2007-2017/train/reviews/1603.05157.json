We propose a convolutional neural network which splits the input sentence into three parts according to the relation arguments and compare it to state-of-the-art and traditional approaches of relation classification. Finally, we combine different methods and show that the combination is better than individual approaches. We also analyze the effect of genre differences on performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Mar 2016 16:02:03 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05157v1", "NAACL 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 14:54:28 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05157v2", "NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["heike adel", "benjamin roth", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.05157"}
