Prior work has evaluated this intriguing result using a word analogy prediction formulation and hand-selected relations, but the generality of the finding over a broader range of lexical relation types and different learning settings has not been evaluated. In this paper, we carry out such an evaluation in two learning settings: (1) spectral clustering to induce word relations, and (2) supervised learning to classify vector differences into relation types. We find that word embeddings capture a surprising amount of information, and that, under suitable supervised training, vector subtraction generalises well to a broad range of relations, including over unseen lexical items.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Sep 2015 11:23:44 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01692v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 12:20:03 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01692v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 05:44:33 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01692v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 13 Aug 2016 17:56:01 GMT  (141kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01692v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ekaterina vylomova", "laura rimell", "trevor cohn", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.01692"}
