In an automatic text summarization process, a text is given to the computer and the computer returns a shorter less redundant extract or abstract of the original text(s). Many techniques have been developed for summarizing English text(s). But, a very few attempts have been made for Bengali text summarization. This paper presents a method for Bengali text summarization which extracts important sentences from a Bengali document to produce a summary.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2012 04:56:59 GMT  (236kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2240v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["kamal sarkar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2240"}
