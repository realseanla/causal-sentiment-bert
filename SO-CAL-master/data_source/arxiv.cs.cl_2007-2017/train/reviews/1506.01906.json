One of these challenges is the detection of idioms or proverbs phrases within the writer text or comment. An idiom or proverb is a form of speech or an expression that is peculiar to itself. Grammatically, it cannot be understood from the individual meanings of its elements and can yield different sentiment when treats as separate words. Consequently, In order to facilitate the task of detection and classification of lexical phrases for automated SA systems, this paper presents AIPSeLEX a novel idioms/ proverbs sentiment lexicon for modern standard Arabic (MSA) and colloquial. AIPSeLEX is manually collected and annotated at sentence level with semantic orientation (positive or negative). The efforts of manually building and annotating the lexicon are reported. Moreover, we build a classifier that extracts idioms and proverbs, phrases from text using n-gram and similarity measure methods. Finally, several experiments were carried out on various data, including Arabic tweets and Arabic microblogs (hotel reservation, product reviews, and TV program comments) from publicly available Arabic online reviews websites (social media, blogs, forums, e-commerce web sites) to evaluate the coverage and accuracy of AIPSeLEX.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 13:29:33 GMT  (795kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01906v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.03105"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.03105", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hossam s ibrahim", "sherif m abdou", "mervat gheith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01906"}
