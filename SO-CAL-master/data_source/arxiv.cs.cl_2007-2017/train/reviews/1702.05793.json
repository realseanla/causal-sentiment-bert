By comparing learning algorithms, we are also able to compare the closely related OT and HG frameworks themselves. Experimental results show that the additional expressivity of the HG framework over OT affords performance gains in the task of predicting the surface word order of Czech sentences. We compare the perceptron with the classic Gradual Learning Algorithm (GLA), which learns OT grammars, as well as the popular Maximum Entropy model. In addition to showing that the perceptron is theoretically appealing, our work shows that the performance of the HG model it learns approaches that of the upper bound in prediction accuracy on a held out test set and that it is capable of accurately modeling observed variation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Feb 2017 20:37:40 GMT  (645kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05793v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ann irvine", "mark dredze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05793"}
