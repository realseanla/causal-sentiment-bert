{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Apr-2017", "title": "Deep Joint Entity Disambiguation with Local Neural Attention", "abstract": "We propose a novel deep learning model for joint document-level entity disambiguation, which leverages learned neural representations. Key components are entity embeddings, a neural attention mechanism over local context windows, and a differentiable joint inference stage for disambiguation. Our approach thereby combines benefits of deep learning with more traditional approaches such as graphical models and probabilistic mention-entity maps. Extensive experiments show that we are able to obtain competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy at moderate computational costs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 10:18:32 GMT  (409kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04920v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 23:47:24 GMT  (401kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04920v2", "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2017 long paper"], ["v3", "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 18:25:57 GMT  (389kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04920v3", "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2017 long paper"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["octavian-eugen ganea", "thomas hofmann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.04920"}
