However, they are mainly modeled only implicitly by current coreference resolvers. We propose a dependency-based embedding model of selectional preferences which allows fine-grained compatibility judgments with high coverage. We show that the incorporation of our model improves coreference resolution performance on the CoNLL dataset, matching the state-of-the-art results of a more complex system. However, it comes with a cost that makes it debatable how worthwhile such improvements are.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 11:54:37 GMT  (573kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06456v1", "EMNLP 2017 - short paper"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017 - short paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["benjamin heinzerling", "nafise sadat moosavi", "michael strube 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.06456"}
