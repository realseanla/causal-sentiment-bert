Because metonyms are closely related to metaphors, we apply features that are used successfully for metaphor recognition to the task of detecting metonyms. On the ACL SemEval 2007 Task 8 data with gold standard metonym annotations, our system achieved 86.45% accuracy on the location metonyms. Our code can be found on GitHub.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 03:26:05 GMT  (727kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04515v1", "9 pages, 8 pages content"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 8 pages content", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wei zhang", "judith gelernter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04515"}
