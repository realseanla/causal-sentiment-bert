In this paper, we consider the case where there is an unobserved confounding variable $z$ that influences both the features $\\mathbf{x}$ and the class variable $y$. When the influence of $z$ changes from training to testing data, we find that the classifier accuracy can degrade rapidly. In our approach, we assume that we can predict the value of $z$ at training time with some error. The prediction for $z$ is then fed to Pearl's back-door adjustment to build our model. Because of the attenuation bias caused by measurement error in $z$, standard approaches to controlling for $z$ are ineffective. In response, we propose a method to properly control for the influence of $z$ by first estimating its relationship with the class variable $y$, then updating predictions for $z$ to match that estimated relationship. By adjusting the influence of $z$, we show that we can build a model that exceeds competing baselines on accuracy as well as on robustness over a range of confounding relationships.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 5 Mar 2017 21:57:25 GMT  (4454kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01671v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["virgile landeiro", "aron culotta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01671"}
