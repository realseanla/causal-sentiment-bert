The proposed method is based on the combination of several lexical and morphological characteristics, to build a language model and a set of features for Machine Learning algorithms. We provide a detailed study on the proposed method performance and failure cases, indicating that it is competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on Legal Information Retrieval and Question Answering, while not needing extensive training data nor depending on expert produced knowledge. The proposed method achieved significant results in the competition, indicating a substantial level of adequacy for the tasks addressed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Sep 2016 07:24:08 GMT  (143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00799v1", "16 pages, 5 figures, Lecture notes in computer science: New Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 2016/03"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 5 figures, Lecture notes in computer science: New Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence, 2016/03", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["danilo s carvalho", "minh-tien nguyen", "tran xuan chien", "minh le nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00799"}
