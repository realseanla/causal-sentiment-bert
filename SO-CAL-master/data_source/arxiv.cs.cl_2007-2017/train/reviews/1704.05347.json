Here, we propose to advance toward multilingual evaluation. To that end, we provide test data for four major languages. We experiment with a set of baselines based on cross-lingual embeddings and machine translation. While our best system scores an average accuracy of just over 75%, we focus largely on enabling further research in multilingual inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:12:37 GMT  (43kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05347v1", "Submitted for review at EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted for review at EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["\\v{z}eljko agi\\'c", "natalie schluter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05347"}
