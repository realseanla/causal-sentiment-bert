The tool presents a scatterplot, where each axis corresponds to the rank-frequency a term occurs in a category of documents. Through a tie-breaking strategy, the tool is able to display thousands of visible term-representing points and find space to legibly label hundreds of them. Scattertext also lends itself to a query-based visualization of how the use of terms with similar embeddings differs between document categories, as well as a visualization for comparing the importance scores of bag-of-words features to univariate metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 00:48:15 GMT  (1627kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00565v1", "6 pages, 5 figures.
