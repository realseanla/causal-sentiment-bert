That scheme improves upon its predecessors to better facilitate comprehensive manual annotation. Moreover, unlike the previous schemes, the preposition supersenses are organized hierarchically. Our data will be publicly released on the web upon publication.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 May 2016 01:38:34 GMT  (428kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02257v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nathan schneider", "jena d hwang", "vivek srikumar", "meredith green", "kathryn conger", "tim o'gorman", "martha palmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02257"}
