For confusable closely spaced languages, the system needs longer input test duration material to obtain sufficient information to distinguish between languages. Alternatively, if languages are distinct and not acoustically/linguistically similar to others, duration is not a sufficient remedy. The solution proposed here is to explore duration distribution analysis for near/far languages based on the Language Recognition i-Vector Machine Learning Challenge 2015 (LRiMLC15) database. Using this knowledge, we propose a likelihood ratio based fusion approach that leveraged both score and duration information. The experimental results show that the use of duration and score fusion improves language recognition performance by 5% relative in LRiMLC15 cost.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 02:14:23 GMT  (2589kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06404v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["suwon shon", "seongkyu mun", "john h l hansen", "hanseok ko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06404"}
