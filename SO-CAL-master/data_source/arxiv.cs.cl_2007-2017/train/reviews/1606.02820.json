{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jun-2016", "title": "Inducing Domain-Specific Sentiment Lexicons from Unlabeled Corpora", "abstract": "A word's sentiment depends on the domain in which it is used. Computational social science research thus requires sentiment lexicons that are specific to the domains being studied. We combine domain-specific word embeddings with a label propagation framework to induce accurate domain-specific sentiment lexicons using small sets of seed words. We show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on inducing sentiment lexicons from domain-specific corpora and that our purely corpus-based approach outperforms methods that rely on hand-curated resources (e.g., WordNet). Using our framework, we induce and release historical sentiment lexicons for 150 years of English and community-specific sentiment lexicons for 250 online communities from the social media forum Reddit. The historical lexicons we induce show that more than 5% of sentiment-bearing (non-neutral) English words completely switched polarity during the last 150 years, and the community-specific lexicons highlight how sentiment varies drastically between different communities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 04:28:10 GMT  (1007kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02820v1", "10 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 03:12:09 GMT  (1034kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02820v2", "11 pages, 5 figures, EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["william l hamilton", "kevin clark", "jure leskovec", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02820"}
