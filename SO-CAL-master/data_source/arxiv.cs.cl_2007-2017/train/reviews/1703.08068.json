This paper presents a novel approach, which bridges the gap between these two categories of networks. In particular, we propose an architecture which takes advantage of the explicit, sequential enumeration of the word history in FNN structure while enhancing each word representation at the projection layer through recurrent context information that evolves in the network. The context integration is performed using an additional word-dependent weight matrix that is also learned during the training. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art feedforward as well as recurrent neural network architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:48:45 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08068v1", "published (INTERSPEECH 2016), 5 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "published (INTERSPEECH 2016), 5 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["youssef oualil", "clayton greenberg", "mittul singh", "dietrich klakow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08068"}
