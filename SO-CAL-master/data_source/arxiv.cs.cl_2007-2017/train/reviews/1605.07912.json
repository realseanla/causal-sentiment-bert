{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-May-2016", "title": "Review Networks for Caption Generation", "abstract": "We propose a novel module, the reviewer module, to improve the encoder-decoder learning framework. The reviewer module is generic, and can be plugged into an existing encoder-decoder model. The reviewer module performs a number of review steps with attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states, and outputs a fact vector after each review step; the fact vectors are used as the input of the attention mechanism in the decoder. We show that the conventional encoder-decoders are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we show that our framework can improve over state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems on the tasks of image captioning and source code captioning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 14:49:58 GMT  (1874kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07912v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 May 2016 00:47:21 GMT  (1874kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07912v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 01:39:35 GMT  (1875kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07912v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 17:50:27 GMT  (1877kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07912v4", "NIPS 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["zhilin yang", "ye yuan", "yuexin wu", "william w cohen", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07912"}
