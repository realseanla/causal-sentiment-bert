On the other hand, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have brought significant improvements to deep feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs), as they are able to better reduce spectral variation in the input signal. In this paper, a network architecture called as convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) is proposed by combining the CNN and LSTM RNN. In the proposed CRNNs, each speech frame, without adjacent context frames, is organized as a number of local feature patches along the frequency axis, and then a LSTM network is performed on each feature patch along the time axis. We train and compare FFNNs, LSTM RNNs and the proposed LSTM CRNNs at various number of configurations. Experimental results show that the LSTM CRNNs can exceed state-of-the-art speech recognition performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 02:48:13 GMT  (596kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03165v1", "Published in INTERSPEECH 2015, September 6-10, 2015, Dresden, Germany"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in INTERSPEECH 2015, September 6-10, 2015, Dresden, Germany", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["xiangang li", "xihong wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03165"}
