This memory-enhanced RNN decoder is called \\textsc{MemDec}. At each time during decoding, \\textsc{MemDec} will read from this memory and write to this memory once, both with content-based addressing. Unlike the unbounded memory in previous work\\cite{RNNsearch} to store the representation of source sentence, the memory in \\textsc{MemDec} is a matrix with pre-determined size designed to better capture the information important for the decoding process at each time step. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that it can improve by $4.8$ BLEU upon Groundhog and $5.3$ BLEU upon on Moses, yielding the best performance achieved with the same training set.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 02:28:19 GMT  (148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02003v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mingxuan wang", "zhengdong lu", "hang li", "qun liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02003"}
