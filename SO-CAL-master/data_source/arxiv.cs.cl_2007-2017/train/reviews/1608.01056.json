These embeddings are typically based on distributional statistics, making it difficult for them to generalize to rare or unseen words. We propose to improve word embeddings by incorporating morphological information, capturing shared sub-word features. Unlike previous work that constructs word embeddings directly from morphemes, we combine morphological and distributional information in a unified probabilistic framework, in which the word embedding is a latent variable. The morphological information provides a prior distribution on the latent word embeddings, which in turn condition a likelihood function over an observed corpus. This approach yields improvements on intrinsic word similarity evaluations, and also in the downstream task of part-of-speech tagging.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 02:21:16 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01056v1", "Accepted to Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016, Austin)"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 01:28:00 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01056v2", "Appeared at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016, Austin)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016, Austin)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["parminder bhatia", "robert guthrie", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.01056"}
