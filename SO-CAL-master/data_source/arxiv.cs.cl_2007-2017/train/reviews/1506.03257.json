In this paper we present an approach event coreference resolution according to: a) similar temporal information, and b) similar semantic arguments. Temporal information is detected using an automatic temporal information system (TIPSem), while semantic information is represented by means of LDA Topic Modeling. The evaluation of our approach shows that it obtains the highest Micro-average F-score results in the SemEval2015 Task 4: TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering (25.36\\% for TrackB, 23.15\\% for SubtrackB), with an improvement of up to 6\\% in comparison to the other systems. However, our experiment also showed some draw-backs in the Topic Modeling approach that degrades performance of the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 11:28:31 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03257v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["borja navarro-colorado", "estela saquete"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03257"}
