It does so by considering the context in which speeches are made, and the content of those speeches. To detect latent themes in legislative speeches over time, speech content is analyzed using a new dynamic topic modeling method, based on two layers of matrix factorization. This method is applied to a new corpus of all English language legislative speeches in the EP plenary from the period 1999-2014. Our findings suggest that the political agenda of the EP has evolved significantly over time, is impacted upon by the committee structure of the Parliament, and reacts to exogenous events such as EU Treaty referenda and the emergence of the Euro-crisis have a significant impact on what is being discussed in Parliament.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 May 2015 13:17:35 GMT  (561kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07302v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 29 May 2015 10:25:16 GMT  (558kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07302v2", "Fix minor typo"], ["v3", "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 18:12:15 GMT  (561kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07302v3", "Fix references"], ["v4", "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 10:13:04 GMT  (561kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07302v4", "Add link to implementation code on Github"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["derek greene", "james p cross"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.07302"}
