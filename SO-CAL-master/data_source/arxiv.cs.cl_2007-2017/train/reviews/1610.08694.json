The reported results in the shared task bring this submission to the third place on subtask 1 (word relatedness), and the first place on subtask 2 (semantic relation classification), demonstrating the utility of integrating the complementary path-based and distributional information sources in recognizing semantic relatedness. Combined with a common similarity measure, LexNET performs fairly good on the word relatedness task (subtask 1). The relatively lower performance of LexNET and the various other systems on subtask 2, however, confirms the difficulty of the semantic relation classification task, and stresses the need to develop additional methods for this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 10:49:00 GMT  (103kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08694v1", "5 pages, accepted to the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex-V), in COLING 2016"], ["v2", "Sun, 30 Oct 2016 09:42:41 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08694v2", "5 pages, accepted to the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex-V), in COLING 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 10:10:01 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08694v3", "5 pages, accepted to the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex-V), in COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, accepted to the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex-V), in COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vered shwartz", "ido dagan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08694"}
