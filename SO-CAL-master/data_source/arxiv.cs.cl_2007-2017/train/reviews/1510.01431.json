However, stylized, non-factual aspects of the written description are missing from the current systems. One of such styles is descriptions with emotions, which is commonplace in everyday communication, and influences decision-making and interpersonal relationships. We design a system to describe an image with emotions, and present a model that automatically generates captions with positive or negative sentiments. We propose a novel switching recurrent neural network with word-level regularization, which is able to produce emotional image captions using only 2000+ training sentences containing sentiments. We evaluate the captions with different automatic and crowd-sourcing metrics. Our model compares favourably in common quality metrics for image captioning. In 84.6% of cases the generated positive captions were judged as being at least as descriptive as the factual captions, of these positive captions 88% were confirmed by the crowd-sourced workers as having the appropriate sentiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 04:57:47 GMT  (1189kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01431v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 13 Dec 2015 23:03:23 GMT  (2282kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01431v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["alexander patrick mathews", "lexing xie", "xuming he"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.01431"}
