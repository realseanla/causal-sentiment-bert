{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Sep-2015", "title": "TransG : A Generative Mixture Model for Knowledge Graph Embedding", "abstract": "Recently, knowledge graph embedding, which projects symbolic entities and relations into continuous vector space, has become a new, hot topic in artificial intelligence. This paper addresses a new issue of \\textbf{multiple relation semantics} that a relation may have multiple meanings revealed by the entity pairs associated with the corresponding triples, and proposes a novel Gaussian mixture model for embedding, \\textbf{TransG}. The new model can discover latent semantics for a relation and leverage a mixture of relation component vectors for embedding a fact triple. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generative model for knowledge graph embedding, which is able to deal with multiple relation semantics. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model achieves substantial improvements against the state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 02:30:17 GMT  (1019kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 02:17:33 GMT  (390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 01:32:17 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 27 Dec 2015 05:46:51 GMT  (339kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 06:03:20 GMT  (344kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v5", null], ["v6", "Sat, 17 Jun 2017 03:54:46 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v6", null], ["v7", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 12:55:14 GMT  (394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05488v7", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["han xiao", "minlie huang", "yu hao", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.05488"}
