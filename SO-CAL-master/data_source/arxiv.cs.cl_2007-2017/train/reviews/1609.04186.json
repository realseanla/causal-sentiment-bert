{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Sep-2016", "title": "Neural Machine Translation with Supervised Attention", "abstract": "The attention mechanisim is appealing for neural machine translation, since it is able to dynam- ically encode a source sentence by generating a alignment between a target word and source words. Unfortunately, it has been proved to be worse than conventional alignment models in aligment accuracy. In this paper, we analyze and explain this issue from the point view of re- ordering, and propose a supervised attention which is learned with guidance from conventional alignment models. Experiments on two Chinese-to-English translation tasks show that the super- vised attention mechanism yields better alignments leading to substantial gains over the standard attention based NMT.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 09:31:40 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04186v1", "This paper was submitted into COLING2016 on July 10, and it is under review"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper was submitted into COLING2016 on July 10, and it is under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lemao liu", "masao utiyama", "rew finch", "eiichiro sumita"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.04186"}
