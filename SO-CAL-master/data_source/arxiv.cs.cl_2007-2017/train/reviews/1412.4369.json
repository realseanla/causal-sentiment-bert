To this end, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly optimizes a distributional objective on raw text and a relational objective on WordNet. Preliminary results on knowledge base completion, analogy tests, and parsing show that word representations trained on both objectives can give improvements in some cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 15:18:18 GMT  (132kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4369v1", "Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR2015 (long version of the paper)"], ["v2", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 12:44:01 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4369v2", "Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR2015 (long version of the paper)"], ["v3", "Sat, 21 Mar 2015 13:21:20 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4369v3", "This is the long version of a short paper accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR2015 (long version of the paper)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniel fried", "kevin duh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.4369"}
