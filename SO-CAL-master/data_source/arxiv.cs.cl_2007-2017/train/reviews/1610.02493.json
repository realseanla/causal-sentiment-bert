Our attention has mainly been focused on an attempt to improve the probabilistic model on which our semantic decoder is based. To achieve this goal, we have decided to test the influence of the pertinent context use, and of the contextual data integration of different types, on the effectiveness of the semantic decoder. The findings are quite satisfactory.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 06:33:35 GMT  (406kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02493v1", "Advances in Computer Science and Engineering. 12 pages 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Advances in Computer Science and Engineering. 12 pages 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mourad mars", "mounir zrigui", "mohamed belgacem", "anis zouaghi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02493"}
