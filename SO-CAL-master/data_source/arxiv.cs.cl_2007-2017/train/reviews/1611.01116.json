Inspired by this work we present Binary Paragraph Vectors, simple neural networks that learn short binary codes for fast information retrieval. We show that binary paragraph vectors outperform autoencoder-based binary codes, despite using fewer bits. We also evaluate their precision in transfer learning settings, where binary codes are inferred for documents unrelated to the training corpus. Results from these experiments indicate that Binary Paragraph Vectors can capture semantics relevant for various domain-specific documents. Finally, we present a model that simultaneously learns short binary codes and longer, real-valued representations. This model can be used to rapidly retrieve a short list of highly relevant documents from a large document collection.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 18:10:35 GMT  (285kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01116v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 17:29:34 GMT  (285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01116v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v3", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 14:33:06 GMT  (354kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01116v3", "Accepted to appear as a regular paper at the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["karol grzegorczyk", "marcin kurdziel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01116"}
