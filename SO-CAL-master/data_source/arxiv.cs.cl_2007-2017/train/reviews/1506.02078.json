However, while LSTMs provide exceptional results in practice, the source of their performance and their limitations remain rather poorly understood. Using character-level language models as an interpretable testbed, we aim to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive analysis of their representations, predictions and error types. In particular, our experiments reveal the existence of interpretable cells that keep track of long-range dependencies such as line lengths, quotes and brackets. Moreover, an extensive analysis with finite horizon n-gram models suggest that these dependencies are actively discovered and utilized by the networks. Finally, we provide detailed error analysis that suggests areas for further study.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 22:33:04 GMT  (4031kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02078v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 02:42:24 GMT  (2671kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02078v2", "changing style, adding references, minor changes to text"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["andrej karpathy", "justin johnson", "li fei-fei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02078"}
