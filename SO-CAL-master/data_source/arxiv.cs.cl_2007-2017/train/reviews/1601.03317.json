Most NMT models follow the encoder-decoder frame- work. To make encoder-decoder models more flexible, attention mechanism was introduced to machine translation and also other tasks like speech recognition and image captioning. We observe that the quality of translation by attention-based encoder-decoder can be significantly dam- aged when the alignment is incorrect. We attribute these problems to the lack of distortion and fertility models. Aiming to resolve these problems, we propose new variations of attention-based encoder- decoder and compare them with other models on machine translation. Our pro- posed method achieved an improvement of 2 BLEU points over the original attention- based encoder-decoder.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 17:14:01 GMT  (1928kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03317v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 04:58:59 GMT  (1932kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03317v2", "11 pages, updated details"], ["v3", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 02:08:02 GMT  (1933kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03317v3", "11 pages, updated details"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shi feng", "shujie liu", "mu li", "ming zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.03317"}
