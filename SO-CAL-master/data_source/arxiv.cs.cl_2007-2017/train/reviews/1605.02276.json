Word similarity evaluation, which correlates the distance between vectors and human judgments of semantic similarity is attractive, because it is computationally inexpensive and fast. In this paper we present several problems associated with the evaluation of word vectors on word similarity datasets, and summarize existing solutions. Our study suggests that the use of word similarity tasks for evaluation of word vectors is not sustainable and calls for further research on evaluation methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 May 2016 05:09:28 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02276v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 04:48:34 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02276v2", "The First Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP"], ["v3", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 02:41:04 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02276v3", "The First Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui", "yulia tsvetkov", "pushpendre rastogi", "chris dyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02276"}
