The difficulty of the Arabic handwriting recognition is that, the accuracy of the character recognition which affects on the accuracy of the word recognition, in additional there is also two or three from for each character, the suggested solution by using artificial neural network can solve the problem and overcome the difficulty of Arabic handwriting recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Jun 2010 19:20:31 GMT  (507kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2809v1", "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, seethis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, seethis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["a a zaidan", "b b zaidan", "hamid a jalab", "hamdan o alanazi", "rami alnaqeib"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.2809"}
