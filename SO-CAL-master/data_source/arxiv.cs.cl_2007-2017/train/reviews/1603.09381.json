Our approach uses context words and their part-of-speech tags and shape information as features. Then we hire temporal (1D) convolutional neural network to learn hidden feature representations. Finally, we use Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to predict event spans. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 20:57:07 GMT  (95kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09381v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1408.5882by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1408.5882by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["peng li", "heng huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09381"}
