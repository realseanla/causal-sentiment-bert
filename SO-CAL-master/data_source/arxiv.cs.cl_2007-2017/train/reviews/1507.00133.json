The resource consists in two different sets, an Italian dictionary of more than 277.000 words tagged with their prior polarity value, and a set of polarity modifiers, containing more than 200 words, which can be used in combination with non neutral terms of the dictionary in order to induce the sentiment of Italian compound terms. To the best of our knowledge this is the first prior polarity manually annotated resource which has been developed for the Italian natural language.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 07:29:12 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00133v1", "10 pages, Accepted to NLPCS 2015, the 12th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, Accepted to NLPCS 2015, the 12th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["valeria borz\\`i", "simone faro", "arianna pavone", "sabrina sansone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1507.00133"}
