To automatically monitor online reputation of entities , systems have to deal with ambiguous entity names, polarity detection and topic detection. We propose three approaches to tackle the first issue: monitoring Twitter in order to find relevant tweets about a given entity. Evaluated within the framework of the RepLab-2013 Filtering task, each of them has been shown competitive with state-of-the-art approaches. Mainly we investigate on how much merging strategies may impact performances on a filtering task according to the evaluation measure.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 07:17:36 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07385v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jean-val\\`ere cossu", "ludovic bonnefoy", "xavier bost", "marc el b\\`eze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07385"}
