In terms of Spearman correlation coefficient values, our methods perform more than two times better (nearly 0.62) in predicting the borrowing likeliness compared to the best performing baseline (nearly 0.26) reported in literature. Based on this likeliness estimate we asked annotators to re-annotate the language tags of foreign words in predominantly native contexts. In 88 percent of cases the annotators felt that the foreign language tag should be replaced by native language tag, thus indicating a huge scope for improvement of automatic language identification systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 04:17:42 GMT  (511kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08446v1", "11 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1703.05122"], ["v2", "Sat, 29 Jul 2017 04:47:16 GMT  (511kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08446v2", "11 pages, accepted in the 2017 conference on Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing(EMNLP 2017) arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1703.05122"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1703.05122", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jasabanta patro", "bidisha samanta", "saurabh singh", "abhipsa basu", "prithwish mukherjee", "monojit choudhury", "animesh mukherjee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.08446"}
