INAUT is based on French language and abundantly uses georeferenced entities. After describing the structure of the overall system, giving details on the language and on its generation, and discussing the three major applications of INAUT (document production, interaction with ENCs and collaborative updates of the knowledge base), we conclude with future extensions and open problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 May 2014 09:11:53 GMT  (3508kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3772v1", "10 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication at Fourth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL 2014), 20-22 August 2014, Galway, Ireland"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 3 figures, accepted for publication at Fourth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL 2014), 20-22 August 2014, Galway, Ireland", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yannis haralambous", "julie sauvage-vincent", "john puentes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3772"}
