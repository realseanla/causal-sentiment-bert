Moreover, stories are often told conversationally through dialog, and previous work suggests that information provided dialogically is more engaging than when provided in monolog. In this paper, we present algorithms for converting a deep representation of a story into a dialogic storytelling, that can vary aspects of the telling, including the personality of the storytellers. We conduct several experiments to test whether dialogic storytellings are more engaging, and whether automatically generated variants in linguistic form that correspond to personality differences can be recognized in an extended storytelling dialog.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 16:06:18 GMT  (533kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07476v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kevin k bowden", "grace i lin", "lena i reed", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07476"}
