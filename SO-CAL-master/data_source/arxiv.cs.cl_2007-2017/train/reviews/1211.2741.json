This paper describes a Hindi Speech Actuated Computer Interface for Web search (HSACIWS), which accepts spoken queries in Hindi language and provides the search result on the screen. This system recognizes spoken queries by large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR), retrieves relevant document by text retrieval, and provides the search result on the Web by the integration of the Web and the voice systems. The LVCSR in this system showed enough performance levels for speech with acoustic and language models derived from a query corpus with target contents.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Nov 2012 19:17:34 GMT  (284kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2741v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC cs.IR", "authors": ["kamlesh sharma", "s v a v prasad", "t v prasad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.2741"}
