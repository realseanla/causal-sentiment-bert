While word embedding has been demoed as a powerful representation for characterizing the statistical properties of natural language. In this study, we propose to use BLSTM-RNN with word embedding for part-of-speech (POS) tagging task. When tested on Penn Treebank WSJ test set, a state-of-the-art performance of 97.40 tagging accuracy is achieved. Without using morphological features, this approach can also achieve a good performance comparable with the Stanford POS tagger.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 08:57:30 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06168v1", "rejected by ACL 2015 short, score: 4,3,2 (full is 5)"]], "COMMENTS": "rejected by ACL 2015 short, score: 4,3,2 (full is 5)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["peilu wang", "yao qian", "frank k soong", "lei he", "hai zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.06168"}
