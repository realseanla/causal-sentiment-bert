We present a data set of general text where the normalizations were generated using an existing text normalization component of a text-to-speech system. This data set will be released open-source in the near future.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 22:42:02 GMT  (461kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00068v1", "17 pages, 13 tables, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 19:51:12 GMT  (461kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00068v2", "17 pages, 13 tables, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 13 tables, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["richard sproat", "navdeep jaitly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00068"}
