One way to extend beyond words is to compare two tuples using a function that combines pairwise similarities between the component words in the tuples. A strength of this approach is that it works with both relational similarity (analogy) and compositional similarity (paraphrase). However, past work required hand-coding the combination function for different tasks. The main contribution of this paper is that combination functions are generated by supervised learning. We achieve state-of-the-art results in measuring relational similarity between word pairs (SAT analogies and SemEval~2012 Task 2) and measuring compositional similarity between noun-modifier phrases and unigrams (multiple-choice paraphrase questions).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Oct 2013 14:50:39 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5042v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["peter d turney"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.5042"}
