Unlike typical approaches to parsing, the model doesn't require part-of-speech (POS) tagging of the sentences. With proper regularization and additional supervision achieved with multitask learning we reach state-of-the-art performance on Slavic languages from the Universal Dependencies treebank: with no linguistic features other than characters, our parser is as accurate as a transition- based system trained on perfect POS tags.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 15:16:43 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03441v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 18:46:40 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03441v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jan chorowski", "micha{\\l} zapotoczny", "pawe{\\l} rychlikowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03441"}
