After preparing the data and network construction, we perform the network motif analysis. We analyse the motif frequencies and Z-scores in the five networks. We present the triad significance profile for five datasets. Furthermore, we compare our results with the existing results for the linguistic networks. Firstly, we show that the triad significance profile for the Croatian language is very similar with the other languages and all the networks belong to the same family of networks. However, there are certain differences between the Croatian language and other analysed languages. We conclude that this is due to the free word-order of the Croatian language.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 18:46:36 GMT  (691kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4960v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hana rizvi\\'c", "sanda martin\\v{c}i\\'c-ip\\v{s}i\\'c", "ana me\\v{s}trovi\\'c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4960"}
