We explore methods of decode-time integration of attention-based neural translation models with phrase-based statistical machine translation. Efficient batch-algorithms for GPU-querying are proposed and implemented. For English-Russian, the phrase-based system cannot surpass state-of-the-art stand-alone neural models. For the Russian-English task, our submission achieves the top BLEU result, outperforming the best pure-neural system by 1.1 BLEU points and our own phrase-based baseline by 1.6 BLEU. In follow-up experiments we improve these results by additional 0.7 BLEU.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 15:34:19 GMT  (52kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04809v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 May 2016 12:15:46 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04809v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 13:22:46 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04809v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marcin junczys-dowmunt", "tomasz dwojak", "rico sennrich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04809"}
