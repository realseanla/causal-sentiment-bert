We find that, in fact, an n-gram language model with a simple heuristic gives strong results on this task. Furthermore, we show that a long short-term memory (LSTM) language model is comparatively effective at recovering order, with our basic model outperforming a state-of-the-art syntactic model by 11.5 BLEU points. Additional data and larger beams yield further gains, at the expense of training and search time.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 22:09:49 GMT  (182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08633v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 03:41:45 GMT  (137kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08633v2", "EMNLP 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["allen schmaltz", "alexander m rush", "stuart m shieber"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.08633"}
