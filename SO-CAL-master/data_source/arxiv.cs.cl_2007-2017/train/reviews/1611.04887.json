Although the performance of the representation learning models are better than the traditional baselines for the tasks, little is known about the core properties of a tweet encoded within the representations. Understanding these core properties would empower us in making generalizable conclusions about the quality of representations. Our work presented here constitutes the first step in opening the black-box of vector embedding for social media posts, with emphasis on tweets in particular.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 15:34:47 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04887v1", "Presented at NIPS 2016 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Complex Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at NIPS 2016 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Complex Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["j ganesh", "manish gupta", "vasudeva varma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04887"}
