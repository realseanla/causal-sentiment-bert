We introduce a new model, RLDA, which extends Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [Blei et al., 2003] for the review space by incorporating auxiliary data available in online reviews to improve modeling while simultaneously remaining compatible with pre-existing fast sampling techniques such as [Yao et al., 2009; Li et al., 2014a] to achieve high performance. The network is designed such that computation is efficiently offloaded to the client devices using the Chital system [Robinson &amp; Li, 2015], improving response times and reducing server costs. The resulting system is able to rapidly compute a large number of specialized latent variable models while requiring minimal server resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Oct 2015 05:26:09 GMT  (694kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07035v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.DC cs.IR", "authors": ["joseph w robinson", "aaron q li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07035"}
