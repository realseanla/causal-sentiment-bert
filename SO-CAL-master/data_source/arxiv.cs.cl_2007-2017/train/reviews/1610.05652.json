The approach combines regular expressions over tokens and a bidirectional inference method in a sequence labelling model, which achieves an overall $F_1$ score of 89.66% on a test set of an evaluation compaign, organized in late 2016 by the Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) community.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 14:44:01 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05652v1", "Submitted to the VLSP Workshop 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 14:25:42 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05652v2", "Submitted to the VLSP Workshop 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to the VLSP Workshop 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["phuong le-hong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05652"}
