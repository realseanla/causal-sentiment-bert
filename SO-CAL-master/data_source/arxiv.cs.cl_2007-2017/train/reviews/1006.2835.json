Panini was the first to define Grammar for Sanskrit language with about 4000 rules in fifth century. These rules contain uncertainty information. It is not possible to Computer processing of Sanskrit language with uncertain information. In this paper, fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning are proposed to deal to eliminate uncertain information for reasoning with Sanskrit grammar. The Sanskrit language processing is also discussed in this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Jun 2010 20:07:32 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2835v1", "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, seethis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, seethis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["p venkata subba reddy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.2835"}
