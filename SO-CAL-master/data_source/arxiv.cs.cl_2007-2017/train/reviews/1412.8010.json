In this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct a Vietnamese SentiWordNet (VSWN). SentiWordNet is typically generated from WordNet in which each synset has numerical scores to indicate its opinion polarities. Many previous studies obtained these scores by applying a machine learning method to WordNet. However, Vietnamese WordNet is not available unfortunately by the time of this paper. Therefore, we propose a method to construct VSWN from a Vietnamese dictionary, not from WordNet. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by generating a VSWN with 39,561 synsets automatically. The method is experimentally tested with 266 synsets with aspect of positivity and negativity. It attains a competitive result compared with English SentiWordNet that is 0.066 and 0.052 differences for positivity and negativity sets respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Dec 2014 01:54:15 GMT  (461kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8010v1", "accepted on April-9th-2014, best paper award"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted on April-9th-2014, best paper award", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xuan-son vu", "seong-bae park"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.8010"}
