Recently, distributed representation of sentences learned by neural models from unlabeled data has been shown to outperform the traditional bag-of-words representation. However, most of these learning methods consider only the content of a sentence and disregard the relations among sentences in a discourse by and large.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 20:19:35 GMT  (2195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08078v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["tanay kumar saha", "shafiq joty", "naeemul hassan", "mohammad al hasan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08078"}
