This paper aims to suggest a solution to structural and semantic ambiguities due to the idiomaticity and non-grammaticalness of phrases commonly used in English language by applying bilingual phrase database in English-Korean Machine Translation (EKMT). This paper firstly clarifies what the phrase unit in EKMT is based on the definition of the English phrase, secondly clarifies what kind of language unit can be the target of the phrase database for EKMT, thirdly suggests a way to build the phrase database by presenting the format of the phrase database with examples, and finally discusses briefly the method to apply this bilingual phrase database to the EKMT for structural and semantic disambiguation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 01:37:40 GMT  (222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05626v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["myong-chol pak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.05626"}
