{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Jun-2016", "title": "Focused Meeting Summarization via Unsupervised Relation Extraction", "abstract": "We present a novel unsupervised framework for focused meeting summarization that views the problem as an instance of relation extraction. We adapt an existing in-domain relation learner (Chen et al., 2011) by exploiting a set of task-specific constraints and features. We evaluate the approach on a decision summarization task and show that it outperforms unsupervised utterance-level extractive summarization baselines as well as an existing generic relation-extraction-based summarization method. Moreover, our approach produces summaries competitive with those generated by supervised methods in terms of the standard ROUGE score.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 22:49:56 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07849v1", "SIGDIAL 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "SIGDIAL 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "claire cardie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07849"}
