We submitted results for Hindi (hi), Bengali (bn), and Telugu (te) languages mixed with English (en). In this paper, we have described our approaches to the POS tagging techniques, we exploited for this task. Machine learning has been used to POS tag the mixed language text. For POS tagging, distributed representations of words in vector space (word2vec) for feature extraction and Log-linear models have been tried. We report our work on all three languages hi, bn, and te mixed with en.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 06:13:31 GMT  (17kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09799v1", "3 Pages, Published in the Proceedings of the Tool Contest on POS Tagging for Code-mixed Indian Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp) Text"]], "COMMENTS": "3 Pages, Published in the Proceedings of the Tool Contest on POS Tagging for Code-mixed Indian Social Media (Facebook, Twitter, and Whatsapp) Text", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["prakash b pimpale", "raj nath patel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09799"}
