However, it is difficult to create a large dataset to train the ability of deep neural network models (DNNs). We propose fine-tuning as a new training process, where a model pre-trained on a large dataset is fine-tuned with a small supplemental training set. Our results show that fine-tuning can improve the ability of a state-of-the-art DNN model for Recognizing Textual Entailment tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 22:25:45 GMT  (385kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08563v1", "10 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 28 Jun 2017 23:59:15 GMT  (382kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08563v2", "8 pages plus references, 3 tables, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["john p lalor", "hao wu", "hong yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08563"}
