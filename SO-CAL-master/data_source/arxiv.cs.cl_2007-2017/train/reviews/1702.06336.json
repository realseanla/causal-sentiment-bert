Our architecture is inspired by previously proposed neural-network-based belief-tracking systems. In addition, we extended some parts of our modular architecture with differentiable rules to allow end-to-end training. We hypothesize that these rules allow our tracker to generalize better than pure machine-learning based systems. For evaluation, we used the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset - a popular belief tracking testbed with dialogs from restaurant information system. To our knowledge, our hybrid tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result in three out of four categories within the DSTC2.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 11:34:14 GMT  (337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06336v1", "Accepted to EACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to EACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["miroslav vodol\\'an", "rudolf kadlec", "jan kleindienst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06336"}
