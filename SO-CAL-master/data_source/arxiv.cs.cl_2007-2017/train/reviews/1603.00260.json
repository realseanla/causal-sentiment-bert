I posit to analyze natural language text with the help of semantic annotations and mine important events for navigating large text corpora. Semantic annotations such as named entities, geographic locations, and temporal expressions can help us mine events from the given corpora. These events thus provide us with useful means to discover the locked knowledge in them. I pose three problems that can help unlock this knowledge vault in semantically annotated text corpora: i. identifying important events; ii. semantic search; and iii. event analytics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 13:14:33 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00260v1", "Extended research report of an extended abstract published at WSDM 2016 Doctoral Consortium. in WSDM 2016 Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended research report of an extended abstract published at WSDM 2016 Doctoral Consortium. in WSDM 2016 Proceedings of the Ninth ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["dhruv gupta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00260"}
