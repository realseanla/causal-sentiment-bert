It is commonly understood that stop words do not contribute to the context or content of textual documents. Due to their high frequency of occurrence, their presence in text mining presents an obstacle to the understanding of the content in the documents. To eliminate the bias effects, most text mining software or approaches make use of stop words list to identify and remove those words. However, the development of such top words list is difficult and inconsistent between textual sources. This problem is further aggravated by sources such as Twitter which are highly repetitive or similar in nature. In this paper, we will be examining the original work using term frequency, inverse document frequency and term adjacency for developing a stop words list for the Twitter data source. We propose a new technique using combinatorial values as an alternative measure to effectively list out stop words.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 May 2012 15:37:46 GMT  (234kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6396v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["murphy choy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.6396"}
