We argue that (1) the quality of a model' s posterior distribution can and should be directly evaluated, as to whether probabilities correspond to empirical frequencies, and (2) NLP uncertainty can be projected not only to pipeline components, but also to exploratory data analysis, telling a user when to trust and not trust the NLP analysis. We present a method to analyze calibration, and apply it to compare the miscalibration of several commonly used models. We also contribute a coreference sampling algorithm that can create confidence intervals for a political event extraction task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 00:25:51 GMT  (126kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05154v1", "12 pages (including supplementary information) in EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 17:26:24 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05154v2", "15 pages (including supplementary information), proceedings of EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages (including supplementary information) in EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["khanh nguyen", "brendan o'connor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.05154"}
