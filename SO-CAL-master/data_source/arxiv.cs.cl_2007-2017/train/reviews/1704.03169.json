However, the correctness of beam search degrades when the a model is over-confident about a suboptimal prediction. In this paper, we propose to perform minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) decoding for some extra steps at a later stage. In order to speed up MBR decoding, we compute the Bayes risks on GPU in batch mode. In our experiments, we found that MBR reranking works with a large beam size. Later-stage MBR decoding is shown to outperform simple MBR reranking in machine translation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 06:48:45 GMT  (570kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03169v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 08:02:00 GMT  (930kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03169v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["raphael shu", "hideki nakayama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03169"}
