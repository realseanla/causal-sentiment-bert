We at- tack the task by first partitioning the AMR graph into smaller fragments, and then generating the translation for each fragment, before finally deciding the order by solving an asymmetric generalized traveling salesman problem (AGTSP). A Maximum Entropy classifier is trained to estimate the traveling costs, and a TSP solver is used to find the optimized solution. The final model reports a BLEU score of 22.44 on the SemEval-2016 Task8 dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Sep 2016 18:12:12 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07451v1", "accepted by EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted by EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["linfeng song", "yue zhang", "xiaochang peng", "zhiguo wang", "daniel gildea"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.07451"}
