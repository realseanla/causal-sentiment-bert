The corpus is diverse, consisting of parliamentary proceedings, literary works, transcripts of TED talks and political commentary. It will be instrumental for research of translationese and its applications to (human and machine) translation; specifically, it can be used for the task of translationese identification, a research direction that enjoys a growing interest in recent years. To evaluate the quality of the corpus, we replicate and expand on previous results of supervised identification of translationese, and further extend the experiments to additional datasets, including an additional language pair, and exploiting bilingual information.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 19:07:49 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03611v1", "the paper is under a journal review"], ["v2", "Sun, 6 Mar 2016 13:41:11 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03611v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "the paper is under a journal review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ella rabinovich", "shuly wintner", "ofek luis lewinsohn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03611"}
