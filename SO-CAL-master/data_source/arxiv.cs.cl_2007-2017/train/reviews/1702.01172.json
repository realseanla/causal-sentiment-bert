Depending on the age of the content, additional knowledge might be needed to find and understand older texts. Especially facts about entities are subject to change. Most severe in terms of information retrieval are name changes. In order to find entities that have changed their name over time, search engines need to be aware of this evolution. We tackle this problem by analyzing Wikipedia in terms of entity evolutions mentioned in articles regardless the structural elements. We gathered statistics and automatically extracted minimum excerpts covering name changes by incorporating lists dedicated to that subject. In future work, these excerpts are going to be used to discover patterns and detect changes in other sources. In this work we investigate whether or not Wikipedia is a suitable source for extracting the required knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 21:36:46 GMT  (3860kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01172v1", "WISE 2014, Thessaloniki, Greece"]], "COMMENTS": "WISE 2014, Thessaloniki, Greece", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["helge holzmann", "thomas risse"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01172"}
