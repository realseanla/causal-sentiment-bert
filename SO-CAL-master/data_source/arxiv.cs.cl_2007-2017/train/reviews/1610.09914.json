{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "31-Oct-2016", "title": "Named Entity Recognition for Novel Types by Transfer Learning", "abstract": "In named entity recognition, we often don't have a large in-domain training corpus or a knowledge base with adequate coverage to train a model directly. In this paper, we propose a method where, given training data in a related domain with similar (but not identical) named entity (NE) types and a small amount of in-domain training data, we use transfer learning to learn a domain-specific NE model. That is, the novelty in the task setup is that we assume not just domain mismatch, but also label mismatch.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 13:36:35 GMT  (53kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09914v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lizhen qu", "gabriela ferraro", "liyuan zhou", "weiwei hou", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.09914"}
