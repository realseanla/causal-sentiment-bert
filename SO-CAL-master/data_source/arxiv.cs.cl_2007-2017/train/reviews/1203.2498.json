The importance of tools for natural language processing is materialized by the need to have applications that can effectively treat the vast mass of information available nowadays on electronic forms. Among these tools, mainly driven by the necessity of a fast writing in alignment to the actual daily life speed, our interest is on the writing auditors. The morphological and syntactic properties of Arabic make it a difficult language to master, and explain the lack in the processing tools for that language. Among these properties, we can mention: the complex structure of the Arabic word, the agglutinative nature, lack of vocalization, the segmentation of the text, the linguistic richness, etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Mar 2012 13:28:03 GMT  (235kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2498v1", "4th International Workshop on ICTs and Amazigh, February 2011"], ["v2", "Tue, 4 Jun 2013 06:31:32 GMT  (1472kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2498v2", "4th International Workshop on ICTs and Amazigh, February 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "4th International Workshop on ICTs and Amazigh, February 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["riadh bouslimi", "houda amraoui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.2498"}
