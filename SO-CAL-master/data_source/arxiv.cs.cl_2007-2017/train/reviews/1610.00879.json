We introduce automatic drunk-texting prediction as the task of identifying whether a text was written when under the influence of alcohol. We experiment with tweets labeled using hashtags as distant supervision. Our classifiers use a set of N-gram and stylistic features to detect drunk tweets. Our observations present the first quantitative evidence that text contains signals that can be exploited to detect drunk-texting.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 07:34:24 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00879v1", "This paper was presented at ACL-IJCNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper was presented at ACL-IJCNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aditya joshi", "abhijit mishra", "balamurali ar", "pushpak bhattacharyya", "mark carman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.00879"}
