Some of the techniques that were found beneficial are: maxout networks with annealed dropout rates; networks with a very large number of outputs trained on 2000 hours of data; joint modeling of partially unfolded recurrent neural networks and convolutional nets by combining the bottleneck and output layers and retraining the resulting model; and lastly, sophisticated language model rescoring with exponential and neural network LMs. These techniques result in an 8.0% word error rate on the Switchboard part of the Hub5-2000 evaluation test set which is 23% relative better than our previous best published result.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 May 2015 20:49:32 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05899v1", "Submitted to Interspeech 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Interspeech 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["george saon", "hong-kwang j kuo", "steven rennie", "michael picheny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.05899"}
