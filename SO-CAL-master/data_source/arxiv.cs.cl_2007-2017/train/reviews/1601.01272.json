However, understanding and interpreting the source of this success remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Recurrent Memory Network (RMN), a novel RNN architecture, that not only amplifies the power of RNN but also facilitates our understanding of its internal functioning and allows us to discover underlying patterns in data. We demonstrate the power of RMN on language modeling and sentence completion tasks. On language modeling, RMN outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on three large German, Italian, and English dataset. Additionally we perform in-depth analysis of various linguistic dimensions that RMN captures. On Sentence Completion Challenge, for which it is essential to capture sentence coherence, our RMN obtains 69.2% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 18:44:07 GMT  (662kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01272v1", "8 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 11:13:11 GMT  (1036kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01272v2", "8 pages, 6 figures.
