In this paper, we provide a multi-class schema, an annotated dataset, and supervised classifiers based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and other models for the task of classifying discussion topics. We apply the CNN classifier to the most popular breast cancer online community, and carry out a longitudinal analysis to show topic distributions and topic changes throughout members' participation. Our experimental results suggest that CNN outperforms other classifiers in the task of topic classification, and that certain trajectories can be detected with respect to topic changes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 17:47:42 GMT  (843kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08458v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 22:46:39 GMT  (843kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08458v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 15:09:05 GMT  (843kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08458v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["shaodian zhang", "edouard grave", "elizabeth sklar", "noemie elhadad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08458"}
