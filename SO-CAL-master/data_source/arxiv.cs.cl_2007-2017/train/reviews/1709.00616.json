Therefore, a lot of research has been spent in improving its accuracy. Off-the-shelf tools, however, are: i) complicated to use and ii) domain/dialect dependent. We explore three language-independent alternatives to morphological segmentation using: i) data-driven sub-word units, ii) characters as a unit of learning, and iii) word embeddings learned using a character CNN (Convolution Neural Network). On the tasks of Machine Translation and POS tagging, we found these methods to achieve close to, and occasionally surpass state-of-the-art performance. In our analysis, we show that a neural machine translation system is sensitive to the ratio of source and target tokens, and a ratio close to 1 or greater, gives optimal performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Sep 2017 18:45:48 GMT  (869kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00616v1", "ACL 2017 pages 7"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 pages 7", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hassan sajjad", "fahim dalvi", "nadir durrani", "ahmed abdelali", "yonatan belinkov", "stephan vogel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1709.00616"}
