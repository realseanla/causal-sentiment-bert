The introduced formalism leads to semantics of manipulation action and has applications to both observing and understanding human manipulation actions as well as executing them with a robotic mechanism (e.g. a humanoid robot). It is based on a Combinatory Categorial Grammar. The goal of the introduced framework is to: (1) represent manipulation actions with both syntax and semantic parts, where the semantic part employs $\\lambda$-calculus; (2) enable a probabilistic semantic parsing schema to learn the $\\lambda$-calculus representation of manipulation action from an annotated action corpus of videos; (3) use (1) and (2) to develop a system that visually observes manipulation actions and understands their meaning while it can reason beyond observations using propositional logic and axiom schemata. The experiments conducted on a public available large manipulation action dataset validate the theoretical framework and our implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 20:00:08 GMT  (6612kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01525v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["yezhou yang", "yiannis aloimonos", "cornelia ferm\u00fcller", "eren erdal aksoy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.01525"}
