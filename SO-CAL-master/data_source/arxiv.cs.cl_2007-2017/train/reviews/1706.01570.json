We present a method for inducing portions of translation lexicons through the use of expert knowledge in these settings where there are approximately zero resources available other than a language informant, potentially not even large amounts of monolingual data. We investigate inducing a Moroccan Darija-English translation lexicon via French loanwords bridging into English and find that a useful lexicon is induced for human-assisted translation and statistical machine translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 00:55:25 GMT  (75kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01570v1", "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table; to appear in the Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, Vancouver, Canada, August 3, 2017"], ["v2", "Sun, 20 Aug 2017 20:09:30 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01570v2", "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table; published in the Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, pages 21-25, Vancouver, Canada, August 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table; to appear in the Proceedings of the 10th Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora, Vancouver, Canada, August 3, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michael bloodgood", "benjamin strauss"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01570"}
