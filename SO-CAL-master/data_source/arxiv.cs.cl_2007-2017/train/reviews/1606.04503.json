We use long short-term memories (LSTM) to induce distributed representations of each argument, and then combine these representations with surface features in a neural network. The architecture of the neural network is determined by Bayesian hyperparameter search.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:00:59 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04503v1", "describes our system at the CoNLL 2016 shared task"]], "COMMENTS": "describes our system at the CoNLL 2016 shared task", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["akanksha", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04503"}
