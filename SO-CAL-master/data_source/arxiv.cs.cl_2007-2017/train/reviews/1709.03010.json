This capability is desirable in a variety of applications, including conversational systems, where successful agents need to produce language in a specific style and generate responses steered by a human puppeteer or external knowledge. We decompose the neural generation process into empirically easier sub-problems: a faithfulness model and a decoding method based on selective-sampling. We also describe training and sampling algorithms that bias the generation process with a specific language style restriction, or a topic restriction. Human evaluation results show that our proposed methods are able to restrict style and topic without degrading output quality in conversational tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 22:03:11 GMT  (1187kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03010v1", "EMNLP 2017 camera-ready version"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017 camera-ready version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["di wang", "nebojsa jojic", "chris brockett", "eric nyberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1709.03010"}
