After implementing M$^2$ as a scorer in the Moses tuning framework, we investigate interactions of dense and sparse features, different optimizers, and tuning strategies for the CoNLL-2014 shared task. We notice erratic behavior when optimizing sparse feature weights with M$^2$ and offer partial solutions. To our surprise, we find that a bare-bones phrase-based SMT setup with task-specific parameter-tuning outperforms all previously published results for the CoNLL-2014 test set by a large margin (46.37% M$^2$ over previously 40.56%, by a neural encoder-decoder model) while being trained on the same data. Our newly introduced dense and sparse features widen that gap, and we improve the state-of-the-art to 49.49% M$^2$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 13:43:56 GMT  (141kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06353v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 08:42:23 GMT  (156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06353v2", "Accepted for publication at EMNLP 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marcin junczys-dowmunt", "roman grundkiewicz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06353"}
