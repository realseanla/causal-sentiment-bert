This paper presents some evidence against this assumption, and provides a list of biases and unwarranted inferences that can be found in the Flickr30K dataset. Finally, it considers methods to find examples of these, and discusses how we should deal with stereotype-driven descriptions in future applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 May 2016 19:17:23 GMT  (128kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06083v1", "In: Proceedings of the Workshop on Multimodal Corpora (MMC-2016), pages 1-4.
