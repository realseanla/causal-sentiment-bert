Although a number of annotated corpora have been established to facilitate data-driven grammatical error detection and correction approaches, they are still limited in terms of quantity and coverage because human annotation is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. In this work, we propose to utilize unlabeled data to train neural network based grammatical error detection models. The basic idea is to cast error detection as a binary classification problem and derive positive and negative training examples from unlabeled data. We introduce an attention-based neural network to capture long-distance dependencies that influence the word being detected. Experiments show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms SVMs and convolutional networks with fixed-size context window.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 05:32:35 GMT  (232kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08987v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 06:08:59 GMT  (232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08987v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhuoran liu", "yang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08987"}
