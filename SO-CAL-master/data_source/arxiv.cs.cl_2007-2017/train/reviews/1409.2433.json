In particular, we consider the complexity of finding an alignment that has a significant overlap with an optimal alignment. We discuss ways of representing the solution for the general weighted sentence alignment as well as phrases-to-words alignment problem, and show that computing a string which agrees with the optimal sentence partition on more than half (plus an arbitrarily small polynomial fraction) positions for the phrases-to-words alignment is NP-hard. For the general weighted sentence alignment we obtain such bound from the agreement on a little over 2/3 of the bits. Additionally, we generalize the Hamming distance approximation of a solution structure to approximating it with respect to the edit distance metric, obtaining similar lower bounds.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Sep 2014 17:19:11 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2433v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CC cs.DS", "authors": ["antonina kolokolova", "renesa nizamee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.2433"}
