This embedding result has several important consequences: it not only provides a simple new proof theory for the calculus, thereby clarifying the proof-theoretic foundations of hybrid type-logical grammars, but, since the translation is simple and direct, it also provides several new parsing strategies for hybrid type-logical grammars. Second, NP-completeness of hybrid type-logical grammars follows immediately. The main embedding result also sheds new light on problems with lambda grammars/abstract categorial grammars and shows lambda grammars/abstract categorial grammars suffer from problems of over-generation and from problems at the syntax-semantics interface unlike any other categorial grammar.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 May 2014 18:48:15 GMT  (80kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6678v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.CL", "authors": ["richard moot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6678"}
