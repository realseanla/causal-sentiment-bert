We argue that propagating errors through the end-to-end recurrent structures are not a direct way of control the hidden vectors. In this paper, we propose to use word predictions as a mechanism for direct supervision. More specifically, we require these vectors to be able to predict the vocabulary in target sentence. Our simple mechanism ensures better representations in the encoder and decoder without using any extra data or annotation. It is also helpful in reducing the target side vocabulary and improving the decoding efficiency. Experiments on Chinese-English and German-English machine translation tasks show BLEU improvements by 4.53 and 1.3, respectively", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Aug 2017 13:38:10 GMT  (1823kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01771v1", "Accepted at EMNLP2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EMNLP2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rongxiang weng", "shujian huang", "zaixiang zheng", "xin-yu dai", "jiajun chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.01771"}
