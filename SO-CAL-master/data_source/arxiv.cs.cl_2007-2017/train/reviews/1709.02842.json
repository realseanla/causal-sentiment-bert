We present joint end-to-end neural network architectures that combine long short-term memory (LSTM) and a latent topic model to simultaneously train a classifier for mortality prediction and learn latent topics indicative of mortality from textual clinical notes. For topic interpretability, the topic modeling layer has been carefully designed as a single-layer network with constraints inspired by LDA. Experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset show that our models significantly outperform prior models that are based on LDA topics in mortality prediction. However, we achieve limited success with our method for interpreting topics from the trained models by looking at the neural network weights.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 19:30:09 GMT  (888kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02842v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yohan jo", "lisa lee", "shruti palaskar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02842"}
