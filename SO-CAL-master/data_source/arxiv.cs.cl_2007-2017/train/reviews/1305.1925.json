The first step is speech. The dream of a true virtual reality, a complete human-computer interaction system will not come true unless we try to give some perception to machine and make it perceive the outside world as humans communicate with each other. This software project is under development for listening and replying machine (Computer) through speech. The Speech interface is developed to convert speech input into some parametric form (Speech-to-Text) for further processing and the results, text output to speech synthesis (Text-to-Speech)", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 May 2013 05:55:50 GMT  (90kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1925v1", "Pages: 06 Figures : 06. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.1429,arXiv:1305.1428"]], "COMMENTS": "Pages: 06 Figures : 06. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.1429,arXiv:1305.1428", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL", "authors": ["urmila shrawankar", "anjali mahajan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1925"}
