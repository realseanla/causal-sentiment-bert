In this study, we pro- vide powerful computational linguistics tools to explore, retrieve and browse a dataset of 16K multilingual affective visual concepts and 7.3M Flickr images. First, we design an effective crowdsourc- ing experiment to collect human judgements of sentiment connected to the visual concepts. We then use word embeddings to repre- sent these concepts in a low dimensional vector space, allowing us to expand the meaning around concepts, and thus enabling insight about commonalities and differences among different languages. We compare a variety of concept representations through a novel evaluation task based on the notion of visual semantic relatedness. Based on these representations, we design clustering schemes to group multilingual visual concepts, and evaluate them with novel metrics based on the crowdsourced sentiment annotations as well as visual semantic relatedness. The proposed clustering framework enables us to analyze the full multilingual dataset in-depth and also show an application on a facial data subset, exploring cultural in- sights of portrait-related affective visual concepts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 19:40:00 GMT  (7864kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02276v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.IR cs.MM", "authors": ["nikolaos pappas", "miriam redi", "mercan topkara", "brendan jou", "hongyi liu", "tao chen", "shih-fu chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02276"}
