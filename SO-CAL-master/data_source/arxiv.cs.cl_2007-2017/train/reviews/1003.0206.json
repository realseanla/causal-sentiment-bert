{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Feb-2010", "title": "Why has (reasonably accurate) Automatic Speech Recognition been so hard to achieve?", "abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to automatic speech recognition for more than 35 years in spite of the fact that a key HMM assumption -- the statistical independence of frames -- is obviously violated by speech data. In fact, this data/model mismatch has inspired many attempts to modify or replace HMMs with alternative models that are better able to take into account the statistical dependence of frames. However it is fair to say that in 2010 the HMM is the consensus model of choice for speech recognition and that HMMs are at the heart of both commercially available products and contemporary research systems. In this paper we present a preliminary exploration aimed at understanding how speech data depart from HMMs and what effect this departure has on the accuracy of HMM-based speech recognition. Our analysis uses standard diagnostic tools from the field of statistics -- hypothesis testing, simulation and resampling -- which are rarely used in the field of speech recognition. Our main result, obtained by novel manipulations of real and resampled data, demonstrates that real data have statistical dependency and that this dependency is responsible for significant numbers of recognition errors. We also demonstrate, using simulation and resampling, that if we `remove' the statistical dependency from data, then the resulting recognition error rates become negligible. Taken together, these results suggest that a better understanding of the structure of the statistical dependency in speech data is a crucial first step towards improving HMM-based speech recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Feb 2010 19:00:12 GMT  (82kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0206v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["steven wegmann", "larry gillick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0206"}
