We compare these descriptions to solve a cross-document event coreference task. Our com- ponent approach to event semantics defines identity and granularity of events at different levels. It performs close to state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-document event coreference task, while outperforming other works when assuming similar quality of event detection. We demonstrate how granularity and identity are interconnected and we discuss how se- mantic anomaly could be used to define differences between coreference, subevent and topical relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 19:23:43 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04259v1", "Invited keynote speech by Piek Vossen at Cicling 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Invited keynote speech by Piek Vossen at Cicling 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["piek vossen", "agata cybulska"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04259"}
