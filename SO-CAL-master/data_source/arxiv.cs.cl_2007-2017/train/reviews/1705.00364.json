(2016b). While they found LSTM recurrent networks to underperform word averaging, we present several developments that together produce the opposite conclusion. These include training on sentence pairs rather than phrase pairs, averaging states to represent sequences, and regularizing aggressively. These improve LSTMs in both transfer learning and supervised settings. We also introduce a new recurrent architecture, the Gated Recurrent Averaging Network, that is inspired by averaging and LSTMs while outperforming them both. We analyze our learned models, finding evidence of preferences for particular parts of speech and dependency relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 19:18:22 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00364v1", "Published as a long paper at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Published as a long paper at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["john wieting", "kevin gimpel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00364"}
