{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Feb-2017", "title": "A Joint Identification Approach for Argumentative Writing Revisions", "abstract": "Prior work on revision identification typically uses a pipeline method: revision extraction is first conducted to identify the locations of revisions and revision classification is then conducted on the identified revisions. Such a setting propagates the errors of the revision extraction step to the revision classification step. This paper proposes an approach that identifies the revision location and the revision type jointly to solve the issue of error propagation. It utilizes a sequence representation of revisions and conducts sequence labeling for revision identification. A mutation-based approach is utilized to update identification sequences. Results demonstrate that our proposed approach yields better performance on both revision location extraction and revision type classification compared to a pipeline baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:54:57 GMT  (2633kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00089v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["fan zhang", "diane litman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00089"}
