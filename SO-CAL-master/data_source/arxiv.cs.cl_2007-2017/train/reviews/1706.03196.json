Nevertheless, post-editing the outputs of the system is mandatory for tasks requiring high translation quality. Post-editing offers a unique opportunity for improving neural machine translation systems, using online learning techniques and treating the post-edited translations as new, fresh training data. We review classical learning methods and propose a new optimization algorithm. We thoroughly compare online learning algorithms in a post-editing scenario. Results show significant improvements in translation quality and effort reduction.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 07:41:22 GMT  (192kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03196v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["\\'alvaro peris", "luis cebri\\'an", "francisco casacuberta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03196"}
