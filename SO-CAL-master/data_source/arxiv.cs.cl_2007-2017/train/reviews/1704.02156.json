With data augmentation, super characters, and POS-tagging we gain major improvements in performance compared to a baseline model. The overall accuracy however is still lower than a state-of-the-art AMR parser. An ensemble combining our neural semantic parser with an existing, traditional parser, yields a small gain in performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 09:37:36 GMT  (59kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02156v1", "To appear in Proceedings of SemEval, 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 16:03:45 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02156v2", "To appear in Proceedings of SemEval, 2017 (camera-ready)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of SemEval, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rik van noord", "johan bos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02156"}
