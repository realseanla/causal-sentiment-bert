The absence of syntactic structure in such short pieces of text makes extracting attribute values a challenging problem. We find that combining sequence labeling algorithms such as Conditional Random Fields and Structured Perceptron with a curated normalization scheme produces an effective system for the task of extracting product attribute values from titles. To keep the discussion concrete, we will illustrate the mechanics of the system from the point of view of a particular attribute - brand. We also discuss the importance of an attribute extraction system in the context of retail websites with large product catalogs, compare our approach to other potential approaches to this problem and end the paper with a discussion of the performance of our system for extracting attributes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 03:34:13 GMT  (319kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04670v1", "Accepted at the Workshop on Enterprise Intelligence, KDD 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at the Workshop on Enterprise Intelligence, KDD 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["ajinkya more"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04670"}
