It has been previously used to derive word embeddings, where one view indicates a word, and the other view indicates its context. We describe a way to incorporate prior knowledge into CCA, give a theoretical justification for it, and test it by deriving word embeddings and evaluating them on a myriad of datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 09:39:36 GMT  (42kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01007v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 10:54:17 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01007v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 27 Jul 2016 12:46:39 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01007v3", "in Transactions of the Association of Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dominique osborne", "shashi narayan", "shay b cohen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.01007"}
