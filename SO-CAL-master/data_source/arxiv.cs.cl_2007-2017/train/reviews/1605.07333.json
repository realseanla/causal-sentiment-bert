For both models, we demonstrate the effect of different architectural choices. We present a new context representation for convolutional neural networks for relation classification (extended middle context). Furthermore, we propose connectionist bi-directional recurrent neural networks and introduce ranking loss for their optimization. Finally, we show that combining convolutional and recurrent neural networks using a simple voting scheme is accurate enough to improve results. Our neural models achieve state-of-the-art results on the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 08:20:12 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07333v1", "NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ngoc thang vu", "heike adel", "pankaj gupta", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07333"}
