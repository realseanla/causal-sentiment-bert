{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Jun-2016", "title": "Deep Feature Fusion Network for Answer Quality Prediction in Community Question Answering", "abstract": "Community Question Answering (cQA) forums have become a popular medium for soliciting direct answers to specific questions of users from experts or other experienced users on a given topic. However, for a given question, users sometimes have to sift through a large number of low-quality or irrelevant answers to find out the answer which satisfies their information need. To alleviate this, the problem of Answer Quality Prediction (AQP) aims to predict the quality of an answer posted in response to a forum question. Current AQP systems either learn models using - a) various hand-crafted features (HCF) or b) use deep learning (DL) techniques which automatically learn the required feature representations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 20:58:08 GMT  (425kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07103v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 26 Jun 2016 05:54:51 GMT  (305kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07103v2", "Neu-IR '16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval, July 21, 2016, Pisa, Italy"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["sai praneeth suggu", "kushwanth n goutham", "manoj k chinnakotla", "manish shrivastava"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07103"}
