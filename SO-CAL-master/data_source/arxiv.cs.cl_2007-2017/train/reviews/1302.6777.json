But experience shows about 4 per cent of tokens encountered in test sets are unknown even when the training set is as large as a million words. Unseen words are tagged using secondary strategies that exploit word features such as endings, capitalizations and punctuation marks. In this work, word-ending statistics are primary and whole-word statistics are secondary. First, a tagger was trained and tested on word endings only. Subsequent experiments added back whole-word statistics for the words occurring most frequently in the training set. As grew larger, performance was expected to improve, in the limit performing the same as word-based taggers. Surprisingly, the ending-based tagger initially performed nearly as well as the word-based tagger; in the best case, its performance significantly exceeded that of the word-based tagger. Lastly, and unexpectedly, an effect of negative returns was observed - as grew larger, performance generally improved and then declined. By varying factors such as ending length and tag-list strategy, we achieved a success rate of 97.5 percent.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:13:10 GMT  (574kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6777v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["greg adams", "beth millar", "eric neufeld", "tim philip"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6777"}
