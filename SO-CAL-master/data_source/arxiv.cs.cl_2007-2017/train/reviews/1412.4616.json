We present in detail the structure of a manually segmented and annotated corpus including over 160 hours of German broadcast news, and propose it as an evaluation framework of LVCSR systems. We show our own experimental results on the corpus, achieved with a state-of-the-art LVCSR decoder, measuring the effect of different feature sets and decoding parameters, and thereby demonstrate that real-time decoding of our test set is feasible on a desktop PC at 9.2% word error rate.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 14:34:38 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4616v1", "submitted to INTERSPEECH 2010 on May 3, 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to INTERSPEECH 2010 on May 3, 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["felix weninger", "bj\\\"orn schuller", "florian eyben", "martin w\\\"ollmer", "gerhard rigoll"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.4616"}
