One such context is sandhi or euphonic conjunctions, which cause a word to change owing to the presence of adjacent letters or words. The change wrought by these possible conjunctions can be so significant in Sanskrit that a simple search for the word in its given form alone can significantly reduce the success level of the search. This work presents a representational schema that represents letters in a binary format and reduces Paninian rules of euphonic conjunctions to simple bit set-unset operations. The work presents an efficient algorithm to process vowel-based sandhis using this schema. It further presents another algorithm that uses the sandhi processor to generate the possible transformed word forms of a given word to use in a comprehensive word search.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 18:08:33 GMT  (438kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4354v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["s v kasmir raja", "v rajitha", "meenakshi lakshmanan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.4354"}
