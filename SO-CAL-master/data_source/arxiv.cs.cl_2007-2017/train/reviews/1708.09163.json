We show that a strong lower bound for labeling accuracy can be obtained by relying only on simple word-based features with minimal hand-crafted feature engineering, of 90.65\\% and 86.03\\% performance scores on the standard test sets for the two tasks respectively. In particular, we demonstrate empirically the surprising efficiency of word embeddings in both of the two tasks, with both of the two models. We point out that the state-of-the-art LSTMs model does not always outperform significantly the traditional CRFs model, especially on moderate-sized data sets. Finally, we give some suggestions and discussions for efficient use of sequence labeling models in practical applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 08:32:32 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09163v1", "To appear in the Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Knowledge and Systems Engineering (KSE) 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["phuong le-hong", "minh pham quang nhat", "thai-hoang pham", "tuan-anh tran", "dang-minh nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09163"}
