We assume that a drop in similarity might be related to the emergence of a metaphorical sense at a given time. Similarity-based observations are matched to the actual year when a figurative meaning was documented in a reference dictionary and through manual inspection of corpus occurrences.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 12:22:43 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03279v1", "Proceedings of the Third Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLIC 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the Third Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics (CLIC 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco del tredici", "malvina nissim", "andrea zaninello"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03279"}
