Most previous work in social media analysis has to rely on temporal resolvers that are designed for well-edited text, and therefore suffer from the reduced performance due to domain mismatch. We present a minimally supervised method that learns from large quantities of unlabeled data and requires no hand-engineered rules or hand-annotated training corpora. TweeTIME achieves 0.68 F1 score on the end-to-end task of resolving date expressions, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 18:29:04 GMT  (532kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02904v1", "EMNLP 2016"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 03:54:13 GMT  (562kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02904v2", "EMNLP 2016"], ["v3", "Sat, 1 Oct 2016 19:24:23 GMT  (568kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02904v3", "EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["jeniya tabassum", "alan ritter", "wei xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.02904"}
