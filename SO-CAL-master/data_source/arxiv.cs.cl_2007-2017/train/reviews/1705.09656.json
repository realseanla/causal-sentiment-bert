The system identifies the most salient keywords in a news article and ranks them based on both their overall popularity and their direct relevance to the article. The system also uses a supervised regression model to identify headlines that are likely to be widely shared on social media. The user interface is designed to simplify and speed the editor's decision process on the composition of the headline. As such, the tool provides an efficient way to combine the benefits of automated predictors of engagement and search-engine optimization (SEO) with human judgments of overall headline quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:58 GMT  (3092kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09656v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC cs.IR", "authors": ["terrence szymanski", "claudia orellana-rodriguez", "mark t keane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09656"}
