We build on previous work which has shown the benefit of adding information about MWEs to syntactic parsing by implementing a similar pipeline with CCG parsing. More specifically, we collapse MWEs to one token in training and test data in CCGbank, a corpus which contains sentences annotated with CCG derivations. Our collapsing algorithm however can only deal with MWEs when they form a constituent in the data which is one of the limitations of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 May 2015 17:26:36 GMT  (98kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04420v1", "MSc thesis, The University of Edinburgh, 2014, School of Informatics, MSc Artificial Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "MSc thesis, The University of Edinburgh, 2014, School of Informatics, MSc Artificial Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["miryam de lhoneux"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04420"}
