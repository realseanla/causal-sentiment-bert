However, this leads to another problem. Several vectors of a word may actually point to the same meaning, namely pseudo multi-sense. In this paper, we introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to detect such cases. With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence of pseudo multi-sense. Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks and the analogy task. The result of the experiments shows that diminishing pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations. Thus, our method is actually an efficient way to reduce linguistic complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Jan 2017 08:52:41 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01574v1", "11 pages in CL4LC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages in CL4LC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["haoyue shi", "caihua li", "junfeng hu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.01574"}
