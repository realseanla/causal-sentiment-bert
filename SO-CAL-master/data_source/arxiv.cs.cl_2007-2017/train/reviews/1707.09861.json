We demonstrate for common sequence tagging tasks that the seed value for the random number generator can result in statistically significant (p &lt; 10^-4) differences for state-of-the-art systems. For two recent systems for NER, we observe an absolute difference of one percentage point F1-score depending on the selected seed value, making these systems perceived either as state-of-the-art or mediocre. Instead of publishing and reporting single performance scores, we propose to compare score distributions based on multiple executions. Based on the evaluation of 50.000 LSTM-networks for five sequence tagging tasks, we present network architectures that produce both superior performance as well as are more stable with respect to the remaining hyperparameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 14:25:24 GMT  (541kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09861v1", "Accepted at EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL stat.ML", "authors": ["nils reimers", "iryna gurevych"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.09861"}
