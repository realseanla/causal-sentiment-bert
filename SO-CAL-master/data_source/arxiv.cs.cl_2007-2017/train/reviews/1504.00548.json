However, developing models that learn useful representations of phrases and sentences has proved far harder. We propose using the definitions found in everyday dictionaries as a means of bridging this gap between lexical and phrasal semantics. We train a recurrent neural network (RNN) to map dictionary definitions (phrases) to (lexical) representations of the words those definitions define. We present two applications of this architecture: a reverse dictionary, for returning the name of a concept given a definition or description, and a general-knowledge (crossword) question answerer. On both tasks, the RNN trained on definitions from a handful of freely-available lexical resources performs comparably or better than existing commercial systems that rely on major task-specific engineering and far greater memory footprints. This strong performance highlights the general effectiveness of both neural language models and definition-based training for training machines to understand phrases and sentences.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 13:30:27 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00548v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 19:34:07 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00548v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 30 Aug 2015 21:34:26 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00548v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 16:30:17 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.00548v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["felix hill", "kyunghyun cho", "anna korhonen", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.00548"}
