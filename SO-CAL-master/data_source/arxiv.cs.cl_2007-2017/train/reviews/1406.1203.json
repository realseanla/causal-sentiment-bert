Also, it lacks the capability of sentence generation which is intuitive to humans. Here we present a novel method to summarize text documents taking the process to semantic levels with the use of WordNet and other resources, and using a technique for sentence generation. We involve semantic role labeling to get the semantic representation of text and use of segmentation to form clusters of the related pieces of text. Picking out the centroids and sentence generation completes the task. We evaluate our system against human composed summaries and also present an evaluation done by humans to measure the quality attributes of our summaries.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 20:22:30 GMT  (280kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1203v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["divyanshu bhartiya", "ashudeep singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1203"}
