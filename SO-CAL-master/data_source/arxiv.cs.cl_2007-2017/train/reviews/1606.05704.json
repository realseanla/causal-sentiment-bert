We evaluate dispute detection approaches on a newly created corpus of Wikipedia Talk page disputes and find that classifiers that rely on our sentiment tagging features outperform those that do not. The best model achieves a very promising F1 score of 0.78 and an accuracy of 0.80.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 23:22:39 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05704v1", "ACL 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "claire cardie"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.05704"}
