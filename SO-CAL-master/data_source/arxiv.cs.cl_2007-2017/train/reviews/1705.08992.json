This formulation is motivated by an un-supervised grammar induction problem from computational linguistics. We present a reduction to some known problems and algorithms from graph theory, provide computational complexity results, and describe an approximation algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 May 2017 22:53:56 GMT  (62kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08992v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 15 Jul 2017 20:24:11 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08992v2", "11 pages 4 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DM cs.CL cs.DS", "authors": ["nicholas harvey", "vahab mirrokni", "david karger", "virginia savova", "leonid peshkin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08992"}
