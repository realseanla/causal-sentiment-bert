The opportunity to communicate with on a one-to-one basis is highly valued. However with many hundreds of applications each year, one-to-one conversations are not feasible in most cases. The communication will require a member of academic staff to expend several hours to find suitable answers and contact each student. It would be useful to reduce his costs and time.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 16:01:10 GMT  (1916kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6762v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL", "authors": ["nikolaos polatidis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6762"}
