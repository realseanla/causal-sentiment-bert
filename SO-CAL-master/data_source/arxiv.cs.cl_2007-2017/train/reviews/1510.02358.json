In this paper, we define an automata networks approach to the Naming Game. Two problems are faced: (1) the definition of an automata networks for multi-party communicative interactions; and (2) the proof of convergence for three different orders in which the individuals are updated (updating schemes). Finally, computer simulations are explored in two-dimensional lattices with the purpose to recover the main features of the Naming Game and to describe the dynamics under different updating schemes.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 15:15:09 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02358v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 00:27:33 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02358v2", "Conflict between recently published and arxiv versions"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["javier vera", "pedro montealegre", "eric goles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.02358"}
