A bottleneck in named entity classification, however, is the data problem of sparseness, because new named entities continually emerge, making it rather difficult to maintain a dictionary for named entity classification. Thus, in this paper, we address the problem of named entity classification using matrix factorization to overcome the problem of feature sparsity. Experimental results show that our proposed model, with fewer features and a smaller size, achieves competitive accuracy to state-of-the-art models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 01:54:52 GMT  (320kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04879v1", "4+1 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "4+1 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ai hirata", "mamoru komachi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.04879"}
