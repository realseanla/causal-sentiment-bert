This paper presents a prototype Malayalam text to sign language translation system. The proposed system takes Malayalam text as input and generates corresponding Sign Language. Output animation is rendered using a computer generated model. This system will help to disseminate information to the deaf people in public utility places like railways, banks, hospitals etc. This will also act as an educational tool in learning Sign Language.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 15:51:41 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7415v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Sep 2015 04:52:42 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7415v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jestin joy", "kannan balakrishnan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7415"}
