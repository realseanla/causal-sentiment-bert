While knowledge base (KB) methods are good at answering compositional questions, their performance is often affected by the incompleteness of the KB. Au contraire, web text contains millions of facts that are absent in the KB, however in an unstructured form. {\\it Universal schema} can support reasoning on the union of both structured KBs and unstructured text by aligning them in a common embedded space. In this paper we extend universal schema to natural language question answering, employing \\emph{memory networks} to attend to the large body of facts in the combination of text and KB. Our models can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on question-answer pairs. Evaluation results on \\spades fill-in-the-blank question answering dataset show that exploiting universal schema for question answering is better than using either a KB or text alone. This model also outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 8.5 $F_1$ points.\\footnote{Code and data available in \\url{", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 00:03:02 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08384v1", "ACL 2017 (short)"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 (short)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rajarshi das", "manzil zaheer", "siva reddy", "andrew mccallum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08384"}
