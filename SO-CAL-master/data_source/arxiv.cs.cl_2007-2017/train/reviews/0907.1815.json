{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Jul-2009", "title": "Frustratingly Easy Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "We describe an approach to domain adaptation that is appropriate exactly in the case when one has enough ``target'' data to do slightly better than just using only ``source'' data. Our approach is incredibly simple, easy to implement as a preprocessing step (10 lines of Perl!) and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a range of datasets. Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-domain adaptation problem, where one has data from a variety of different domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jul 2009 13:25:48 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1815v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["hal daum\u00e9 iii"], "accepted": true, "id": "0907.1815"}
