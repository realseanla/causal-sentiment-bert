The Classifier based architecture sequentially accepts or rejects each sentence in the original document order for its membership in the final summary. The Selector architecture, on the other hand, is free to pick one sentence at a time in any arbitrary order to piece together the summary. Our models under both architectures jointly capture the notions of salience and redundancy of sentences. In addition, these models have the advantage of being very interpretable, since they allow visualization of their predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and redundancy. We show that our models reach or outperform state-of-the-art supervised models on two different corpora. We also recommend the conditions under which one architecture is superior to the other based on experimental evidence.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 03:54:10 GMT  (217kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04244v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1611.04230"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1611.04230", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ramesh nallapati", "bowen zhou", "mingbo ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04244"}
