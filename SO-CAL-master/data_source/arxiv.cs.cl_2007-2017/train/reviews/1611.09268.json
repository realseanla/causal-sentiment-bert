In MS MARCO, all questions are sampled from real anonymized user queries. The context passages, from which answers in the dataset are derived, are extracted from real web documents using the most advanced version of the Bing search engine. The answers to the queries are human generated. Finally, a subset of these queries has multiple answers. We aim to release one million queries and the corresponding answers in the dataset, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the most comprehensive real-world dataset of its kind in both quantity and quality. We are currently releasing 100,000 queries with their corresponding answers to inspire work in reading comprehension and question answering along with gathering feedback from the research community.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 18:14:11 GMT  (1852kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09268v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 02:39:53 GMT  (1852kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09268v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["tri nguyen", "mir rosenberg", "xia song", "jianfeng gao", "saurabh tiwary", "rangan majumder", "li deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09268"}
