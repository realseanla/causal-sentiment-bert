Motivated by divergent trends in model complexities in the literature, we explore the balance between model expressiveness and simplicity by studying incrementally more complex architectures. We start with LSTM-encoding of input questions and answers; build on this with context generation by LSTM-encodings of neural image and question representations and attention over images; and evaluate the diversity and predictive power of our models and the ensemble thereof. All models are evaluated against a simple baseline inspired by the current state-of-the-art, consisting of involving simple concatenation of bag-of-words and CNN representations for the text and images, respectively. Generally, we observe marked variation in image-reasoning performance between our models not obvious from their overall performance, as well as evidence of dataset bias. Our standalone models achieve accuracies up to $64.6\\%$, while the ensemble of all models achieves the best accuracy of $66.67\\%$, within $0.5\\%$ of the current state-of-the-art for Visual7W.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 15:57:23 GMT  (563kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08120v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["abhijit sharang", "eric lau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08120"}
