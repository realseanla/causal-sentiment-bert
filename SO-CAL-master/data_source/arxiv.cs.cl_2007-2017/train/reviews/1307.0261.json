Most earlier approaches to this problem rely on combining clusters of distributionally similar terms and concept-instance pairs obtained with Hearst patterns. In contrast, our method relies on a novel approach for clustering terms found in HTML tables, and then assigning concept names to these clusters using Hearst patterns. The method can be efficiently applied to a large corpus, and experimental results on several datasets show that our method can accurately extract large numbers of concept-instance pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 02:49:08 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0261v1", "10 pages; International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages; International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["bhavana dalvi", "william w cohen", "jamie callan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.0261"}
