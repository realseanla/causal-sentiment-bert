In this paper, we address shortcomings in the ability of current models to capture logical operations such as negation. As a solution we propose a tripartite formulation for a continuous vector space representation of semantics and subsequently use this representation to develop a formal compositional notion of negation within such models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 10:29:09 GMT  (25kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2158v1", "9 pages, to appear in Proceedings of the 2013 Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, to appear in Proceedings of the 2013 Workshop on Continuous Vector Space Models and their Compositionality", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["karl moritz hermann", "edward grefenstette", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2158"}
