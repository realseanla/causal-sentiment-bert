However, it is not well-suited to conventional neural network based on context-dependent state acoustic model, if the decoder is unchanged. In this paper, we propose a novel frame retaining method which is applied in decoding. The system which combined frame retaining with frame stacking could reduces the time consumption of both training and decoding. Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using it achieve almost linear training speedup and reduces relative 41\\% real time factor (RTF). At the same time, recognition performance is no degradation or improves sightly on Shenma voice search dataset in Mandarin.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 02:34:27 GMT  (182kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05992v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xu tian", "jun zhang", "zejun ma", "yi he", "juan wei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05992"}
