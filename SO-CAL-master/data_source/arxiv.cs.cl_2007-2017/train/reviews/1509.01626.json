We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 22:31:53 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01626v1", "An early version of this work entitled \"Text Understanding from Scratch\" was posted in Feb 2015 asarXiv:1502.01710.
