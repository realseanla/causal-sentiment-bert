This baseline concatenates the word features from the question and CNN features from the image to predict the answer. When evaluated on the challenging VQA dataset [2], it shows comparable performance to many recent approaches using recurrent neural networks. To explore the strength and weakness of the trained model, we also provide an interactive web demo and open-source code. .", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 19:00:54 GMT  (376kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02167v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 05:17:49 GMT  (523kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02167v2", "One comparison method's scores are put into the correct column, and a new experiment of generating attention map is added"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["bolei zhou", "yuandong tian", "sainbayar sukhbaatar", "arthur szlam", "rob fergus"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.02167"}
