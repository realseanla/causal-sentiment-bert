A similar problem is faced when modelling infant language acquisition. In these cases, categorical linguistic structure needs to be discovered directly from speech audio. We present a novel unsupervised Bayesian model that segments unlabelled speech and clusters the segments into hypothesized word groupings. The result is a complete unsupervised tokenization of the input speech in terms of discovered word types. In our approach, a potential word segment (of arbitrary length) is embedded in a fixed-dimensional acoustic vector space. The model, implemented as a Gibbs sampler, then builds a whole-word acoustic model in this space while jointly performing segmentation. We report word error rates in a small-vocabulary connected digit recognition task by mapping the unsupervised decoded output to ground truth transcriptions. The model achieves around 20% error rate, outperforming a previous HMM-based system by about 10% absolute. Moreover, in contrast to the baseline, our model does not require a pre-specified vocabulary size.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Mar 2016 11:14:23 GMT  (1054kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02845v1", "11 pages, 8 figures; Accepted to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8 figures; Accepted to the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["herman kamper", "aren jansen", "sharon goldwater"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.02845"}
