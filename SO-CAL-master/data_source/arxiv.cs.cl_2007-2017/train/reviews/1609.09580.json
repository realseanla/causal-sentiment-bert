We investigate various state-of-the-art Machine Learning algorithms and discuss the impact of scaling, representation and meaning space structure. We demonstrate that current Machine Learning techniques successfully deal with high-dimensional meaning spaces. In particular, we show that exponentially increasing dimensions linearly impact learner performance and that referential uncertainty from word sensitivity has no impact.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 03:20:52 GMT  (604kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09580v1", "Published as Spranger, M. and Beuls, K.
