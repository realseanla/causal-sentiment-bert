In this paper, we introduce LGExtract, a generic tool for generating a syntactic lexicon for NLP from the Lexicon-Grammar tables. It is based on a global table that contains undefined information and on a unique extraction script including all operations to be performed for all tables. We also present an experiment that has been conducted to generate a new lexicon of French verbs and predicative nouns.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 May 2010 06:37:40 GMT  (174kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5596v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["matthieu constant", "elsa tolone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.5596"}
