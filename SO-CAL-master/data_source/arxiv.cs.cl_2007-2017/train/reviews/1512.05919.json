In this paper, we target at essay generation, which takes as input a topic word in mind and generates an organized article under the theme of the topic. We follow the idea of text planning \\cite{Reiter1997} and develop an essay generation framework. The framework consists of three components, including topic understanding, sentence extraction and sentence reordering. For each component, we studied several statistical algorithms and empirically compared between them in terms of qualitative or quantitative analysis. Although we run experiments on Chinese corpus, the method is language independent and can be easily adapted to other language. We lay out the remaining challenges and suggest avenues for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 12:10:42 GMT  (540kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05919v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 07:49:07 GMT  (540kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05919v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bing qin", "duyu tang", "xinwei geng", "dandan ning", "jiahao liu", "ting liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05919"}
