This allows transmission of information (such as phonemes) segment by segment that decreases the bit rate. However, the encoder based on a phoneme speech recognition may create bursts of segmental errors. Segmental errors are further propagated to optional suprasegmental (such as syllable) information coding. Together with the errors of voicing detection in pitch parametrization, HMM-based speech coding creates speech discontinuities and unnatural speech sound artefacts.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 07:35:00 GMT  (242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04383v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Jul 2016 20:38:29 GMT  (863kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04383v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 07:56:01 GMT  (1002kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04383v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["milos cernak", "alexandros lazaridis", "afsaneh asaei", "philip n garner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04383"}
