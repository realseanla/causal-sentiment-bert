In this work, we propose an alternative attention mechanism based on a fixed size memory representation that is more efficient. Our technique predicts a compact set of K attention contexts during encoding and lets the decoder compute an efficient lookup that does not need to consult the memory. We show that our approach performs on-par with the standard attention mechanism while yielding inference speedups of 20% for real-world translation tasks and more for tasks with longer sequences. By visualizing attention scores we demonstrate that our models learn distinct, meaningful alignments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Jul 2017 08:16:24 GMT  (3265kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00110v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["denny britz", "melody y guan", "minh-thang luong"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.00110"}
