To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised model that uses distributed representation of words as well as domain knowledge to extract the appropriate context from the reference paper. Evaluation results show the effectiveness of our model by significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art. We furthermore demonstrate how an effective contextualization method results in improving citation-based summarization of the scientific articles.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 02:55:56 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08063v1", "SIGIR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "SIGIR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["arman cohan", "nazli goharian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08063"}
