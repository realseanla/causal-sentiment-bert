However, no previous studies that address homophily via ethnic similarity with robots exist. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties of evoking ethnic cues in a robot, as opposed to a virtual agent, and an approach to overcome those difficulties based on using ethnically salient behaviors. We outline our methodology for selecting and evaluating such behaviors, and culminate with a study that evaluates our hypotheses of the possibility of ethnic attribution of a robot character through verbal and nonverbal behaviors and of achieving the homophily effect.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Mar 2013 20:07:48 GMT  (3486kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3592v1", "10 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.RO", "authors": ["maxim makatchev", "reid simmons", "majd sakr", "micheline ziadee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.3592"}
