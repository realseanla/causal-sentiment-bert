We envision these images as well as associated meta information, such as GPS coordinates and timestamps, to form a collective visual memory that can be queried while automatically taking the ever-changing context of mobile users into account. As a first step towards this vision, in this work we present Xplore-M-Ego: a novel media retrieval system that allows users to query a dynamic database of images and videos using spatio-temporal natural language queries. We evaluate our system using a new dataset of real user queries as well as through a usability study. One key finding is that there is a considerable amount of inter-user variability, for example in the resolution of spatial relations in natural language utterances. We show that our retrieval system can cope with this variability using personalisation through an online learning-based retrieval formulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 11:04:29 GMT  (7220kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04983v1", "8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 9 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.HC", "authors": ["sreyasi nag chowdhury", "mateusz malinowski", "reas bulling", "mario fritz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04983"}
