In this paper, we analyze TREC session query logs and compare the performance of different lexical matching approaches for session search. Naive methods based on term frequency weighing perform on par with specialized session models. In addition, we investigate the viability of lexical query models in the setting of session search. We give important insights into the potential and limitations of lexical query modeling for session search and propose future directions for the field of session search.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 21:07:50 GMT  (1297kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06656v1", "ICTIR2016, Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval. 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "ICTIR2016, Proceedings of the 2nd ACM International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval. 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["christophe van gysel", "evangelos kanoulas", "maarten de rijke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06656"}
