To predict the relation between a pair of two target entities, existing methods solely rely on those direct sentences containing both entities. In fact, there are also many sentences containing only one of the target entities, which provide rich and useful information for relation extraction. To address this issue, we build inference chains between two target entities via intermediate entities, and propose a path-based neural relation extraction model to encode the relational semantics from both direct sentences and inference chains. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, our model can make full use of those sentences containing only one target entity, and achieves significant and consistent improvements on relation extraction as compared with baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Sep 2016 19:59:51 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07479v1", "9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 08:56:42 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07479v2", "9 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.
