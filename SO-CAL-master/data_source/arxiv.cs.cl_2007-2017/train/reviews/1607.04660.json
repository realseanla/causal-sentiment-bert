We present a case for the use of advanced machine learning techniques as an aide in this task and introduce a novel methodology that is shown to be capable of extracting meaningful information from large longitudinal corpora, and of tracking complex temporal changes within it.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 12:55:36 GMT  (334kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04660v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1512.08008"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1512.08008", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["victor", "rei", "ognjen arandjelovic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.04660"}
