The agent is based on an asynchronous stochastic variant of DQN (Deep Q Network) named DASQN. The inputs of the agent are plain-text descriptions of states of a game of incomplete information, i.e. real-time large scale online auctions, and the rewards are auction profits of very large scale. We apply the agent to an essential portion of JD's online RTB (real-time bidding) advertising business and find that it easily beats the former state-of-the-art bidding policy that had been carefully engineered and calibrated by human experts: during JD.com's June 18th anniversary sale, the agent increased the company's ads revenue from the portion by more than 50%, while the advertisers' ROI (return on investment) also improved significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 11:25:30 GMT  (1073kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05565v1", "8 pages, 12 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 14:05:09 GMT  (1073kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05565v2", "8 pages, 12 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.GT", "authors": ["yu wang", "jiayi liu", "yuxiang liu", "jun hao", "yang he", "jinghe hu", "weipeng p yan", "mantian li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05565"}
