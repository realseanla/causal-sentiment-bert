This paper analyses the impact of this hybridity on the performance of machine learning techniques for morphological labelling and clustering. In particular, we analyse a dataset of morphologically related word clusters to evaluate the difference in results for concatenative and nonconcatenative clusters. We also describe research carried out in morphological labelling, with a particular focus on the verb category. Two evaluations were carried out, one using an unseen dataset, and another one using a gold standard dataset which was manually labelled. The gold standard dataset was split into concatenative and non-concatenative to analyse the difference in results between the two morphological systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Mar 2017 14:56:27 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08701v1", "11pages, Proceedings of the 3rd Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP'17)"]], "COMMENTS": "11pages, Proceedings of the 3rd Arabic Natural Language Processing Workshop (WANLP'17)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["claudia borg", "albert gatt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08701"}
