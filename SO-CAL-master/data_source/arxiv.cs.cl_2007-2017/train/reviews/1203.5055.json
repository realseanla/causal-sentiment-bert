Events, durations and times are all temporal elements that can be viewed as intervals. These intervals are sometimes temporally related in text. Automatically determining the nature of such relations is a complex and unsolved problem. Some words can act as \"signals\" which suggest a temporal ordering between intervals. In this paper, we use these signal words to improve the accuracy of a recent approach to classification of temporal links.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 17:50:08 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["leon derczynski", "robert gaizauskas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.5055"}
