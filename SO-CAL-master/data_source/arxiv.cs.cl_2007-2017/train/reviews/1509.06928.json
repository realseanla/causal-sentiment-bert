We studied both generative and discriminate classifiers, and we combined these features using a multi-class Support Vector Machine (SVM). We validated our results on an Arabic/English language identification task, with an accuracy of 100%. We used these features in a binary classifier to discriminate between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Dialectal Arabic, with an accuracy of 100%. We further report results using the proposed method to discriminate between the five most widely used dialects of Arabic: namely Egyptian, Gulf, Levantine, North African, and MSA, with an accuracy of 52%. We discuss dialect identification errors in the context of dialect code-switching between Dialectal Arabic and MSA, and compare the error pattern between manually labeled data, and the output from our classifier. We also release the train and test data as standard corpus for dialect identification.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 11:41:10 GMT  (1299kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06928v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 11 Aug 2016 00:28:59 GMT  (1450kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06928v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ahmed ali", "najim dehak", "patrick cardinal", "sameer khurana", "sree harsha yella", "james glass", "peter bell", "steve renals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06928"}
