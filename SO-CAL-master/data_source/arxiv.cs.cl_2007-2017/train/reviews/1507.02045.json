This work looks at the degree to which gender and language can be inferred from a username alone by making use of unsupervised morphology induction to decompose usernames into sub-units. Experimental results on the two tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed morphological features compared to a character n-gram baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 06:52:50 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02045v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 16 Aug 2015 18:06:17 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02045v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aaron jaech", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.02045"}
