In order to facilitate this calculation, a similarity function is proposed based on five dimensions (sort, compositional, essential, restrictive and descriptive) constituting the structure of ontological knowledge. The paper includes a proposal for computing a similarity function for each dimension of knowledge. Later on, the similarity values obtained are weighted and aggregated to obtain a global similarity measure. In order to calculate those weights associated to each dimension, four training methods have been proposed. The training methods differ in the element to fit: the user, concepts or pairs of concepts, and a hybrid approach. For evaluating the proposal, the knowledge base was fed from WordNet and extended by using a knowledge editing toolkit (Cognos). The evaluation of the proposal is carried out through the comparison of system responses with those given by human test subjects, both providing a measure of the soundness of the procedure and revealing ways in which the proposal may be improved.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:09:42 GMT  (899kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4603v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["esperanza albacete", "javier calle", "elena castro", "dolores cuadra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4603"}
