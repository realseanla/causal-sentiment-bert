Recent machine learning methods for deriving vector-space embeddings of words (e.g., word2vec) have achieved considerable success in natural language processing. These vector spaces have also been shown to exhibit a surprising capacity to capture verbal analogies, with similar results for natural images, giving new life to a classic model of analogies as parallelograms that was first proposed by cognitive scientists. We evaluate the parallelogram model of analogy as applied to modern word embeddings, providing a detailed analysis of the extent to which this approach captures human relational similarity judgments in a large benchmark dataset. We find that that some semantic relationships are better captured than others. We then provide evidence for deeper limitations of the parallelogram model based on the intrinsic geometric constraints of vector spaces, paralleling classic results for first-order similarity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 May 2017 01:26:23 GMT  (471kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04416v1", "6 pages, 4 figures, To appear in the Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society"], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 20:52:12 GMT  (471kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04416v2", "6 pages, 4 figures, In the Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures, To appear in the Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dawn chen", "joshua c peterson", "thomas l griffiths"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04416"}
