Clearly the task of designing protocols for these networks is less difficult if the environment allows waiting (i.e., it provides the nodes with store-carry-forward-like mechanisms such as local buffering) than if waiting is not feasible. No quantitative corroborations of this fact exist (e.g., no answer to the question: how much easier?). In this paper, we consider these qualitative questions about dynamic networks, modeled as time-varying (or evolving) graphs, where edges exist only at some times.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 13:19:46 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1975v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.CL", "authors": ["arnaud casteigts", "paola flocchini", "emmanuel godard", "nicola santoro", "masafumi yamashita"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.1975"}
