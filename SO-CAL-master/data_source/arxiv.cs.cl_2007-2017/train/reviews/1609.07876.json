Fingerspelling comprises a significant but relatively understudied part of ASL. Recognizing fingerspelling is challenging for a number of reasons: It involves quick, small motions that are often highly coarticulated; it exhibits significant variation between signers; and there has been a dearth of continuous fingerspelling data collected. In this work we collect and annotate a new data set of continuous fingerspelling videos, compare several types of recognizers, and explore the problem of signer variation. Our best-performing models are segmental (semi-Markov) conditional random fields using deep neural network-based features. In the signer-dependent setting, our recognizers achieve up to about 92% letter accuracy. The multi-signer setting is much more challenging, but with neural network adaptation we achieve up to 83% letter accuracies in this setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:34:24 GMT  (4941kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07876v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1608.08339"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1608.08339", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["taehwan kim", "jonathan keane", "weiran wang", "hao tang", "jason riggle", "gregory shakhnarovich", "diane brentari", "karen livescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07876"}
