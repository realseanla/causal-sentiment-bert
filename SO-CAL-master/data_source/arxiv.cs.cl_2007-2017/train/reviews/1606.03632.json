We present a new approach to natural language generation using recurrent neural networks in an encoder-decoder framework. In contrast with previous work, our model uses both lexicalized and delexicalized versions of slot-value pairs for each dialogue act. This allows our model to learn from all available data, rather than being restricted to learning only from delexicalized slot-value pairs. We show that this helps our model generate more natural sentences with better grammar. We further improve our model's performance by initializing its weights from a pretrained language model. Human evaluation of our best-performing model indicates that it generates sentences which users find more natural and appealing.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 21:24:43 GMT  (334kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03632v1", "Submitted to EMNLP 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 19:13:02 GMT  (334kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03632v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:11:36 GMT  (171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03632v3", null]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shikhar sharma", "jing he", "kaheer suleman", "hannes schulz", "philip bachman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03632"}
