Therefore, many studies in conversation analysis work on this issue and suggest qualitatively con-structions that can effectively lead to audience's applause. To investigate these proposals quantitatively, in this study we an-alyze the transcripts of 2,135 TED Talks, with a particular fo-cus on the rhetorical devices that are used by the presenters for applause elicitation. Through conducting regression anal-ysis, we identify and interpret 24 rhetorical devices as triggers of audience applauding. We further build models that can rec-ognize applause-evoking sentences and conclude this work with potential implications.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:57:45 GMT  (332kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02362v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 07:39:44 GMT  (339kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02362v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhe liu", "anbang xu", "mengdi zhang", "jalal mahmud", "vibha sinha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02362"}
