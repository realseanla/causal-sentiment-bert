A tremendous number of X-ray imaging studies accompanied by radiological reports are accumulated and stored in many modern hospitals' Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS). On the other side, it is still an open question how this type of hospital-size knowledge database containing invaluable imaging informatics (i.e., loosely labeled) can be used to facilitate the data-hungry deep learning paradigms in building truly large-scale high precision computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 17:31:12 GMT  (6954kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315v1", "CVPR 2017 spotlight"], ["v2", "Fri, 19 May 2017 17:45:07 GMT  (7325kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315v2", "CVPR 2017 spotlight;V1: CVPR submission+supplementary; V2: Statistics and benchmark results on published ChestX-ray14 dataset are updated in Appendix B"], ["v3", "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 19:12:50 GMT  (7573kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315v3", "CVPR 2017 spotlight;V1: CVPR submission+supplementary; V2: Statistics and benchmark results on published ChestX-ray14 dataset are updated in Appendix B V3: Minor correction NOTE **** Dataset link will be updated soon for public access ****"], ["v4", "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 14:33:36 GMT  (7326kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02315v4", "CVPR 2017 spotlight;V1: CVPR submission+supplementary; V2: Statistics and benchmark results on published ChestX-ray14 dataset are updated in Appendix B V3: Minor correction V4: new data download link upated:this https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "CVPR 2017 spotlight", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["xiaosong wang", "yifan peng", "le lu", "zhiyong lu", "mohammadhadi bagheri", "ronald m summers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02315"}
