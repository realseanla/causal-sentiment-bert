The network is designed to incorporate two signals: the similarity between conjuncts and the observation that replacing the whole coordination phrase with a conjunct tends to produce a coherent sentences. The modeling makes use of several LSTM networks. The model is trained solely on conjunction annotations in a Treebank, without using external resources. We show improvements on predicting coordination boundaries on the PTB compared to two state-of-the-art parsers; as well as improvement over previous coordination boundary prediction systems on the Genia corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 06:42:51 GMT  (435kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03946v1", "EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jessica ficler", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.03946"}
