While they are notoriously difficult to distinguish by distributional co-occurrence models, pattern-based methods have proven effective to differentiate between the relations. In this paper, we present a novel neural network model AntSynNET that exploits lexico-syntactic patterns from syntactic parse trees. In addition to the lexical and syntactic information, we successfully integrate the distance between the related words along the syntactic path as a new pattern feature. The results from classification experiments show that AntSynNET improves the performance over prior pattern-based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 13:11:48 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02962v1", "EACL 2017, 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "EACL 2017, 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kim anh nguyen", "sabine schulte im walde", "ngoc thang vu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02962"}
