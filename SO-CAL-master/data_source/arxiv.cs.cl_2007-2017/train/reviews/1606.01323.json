{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jun-2016", "title": "Improving Coreference Resolution by Learning Entity-Level Distributed Representations", "abstract": "A long-standing challenge in coreference resolution has been the incorporation of entity-level information - features defined over clusters of mentions instead of mention pairs. We present a neural network based coreference system that produces high-dimensional vector representations for pairs of coreference clusters. Using these representations, our system learns when combining clusters is desirable. We train the system with a learning to search algorithm that teaches it which local decisions (cluster merges) will lead to a high-scoring final coreference partition. The system substantially outperforms the current state-of-the-art on the English and Chinese portions of the CoNLL 2012 Shared Task dataset despite using few hand-engineered features.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jun 2016 04:08:45 GMT  (744kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01323v1", "Accepted for publication at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 21:11:13 GMT  (255kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01323v2", "Accepted for publication at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kevin clark", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.01323"}
