We implement a simple method based on two mapping functions. The first takes as input a word embedding (as produced, e.g., by the word2vec toolkit) and maps it onto a high-level visual space (e.g., the space defined by one of the top layers of a Convolutional Neural Network). The second function maps this abstract visual representation to pixel space, in order to generate the target image. Several user studies suggest that the current system produces images that capture general visual properties of the concepts encoded in the word embedding, such as color or typical environment, and are sufficient to discriminate between general categories of objects.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 22:57:20 GMT  (2248kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03500v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 16:36:48 GMT  (2248kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03500v2", "A 6-page version to appear at the Multimodal Machine Learning NIPS 2015 Workshop"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["angeliki lazaridou", "dat tien nguyen", "raffaella bernardi", "marco baroni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03500"}
