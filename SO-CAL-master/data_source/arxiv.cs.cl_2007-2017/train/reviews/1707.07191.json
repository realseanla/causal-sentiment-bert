The aim of MoodSwipe is to create a convenient user interface to enjoy the technology of emotion classification and text suggestion, and at the same time to collect labeled data automatically for developing more advanced technologies. While users select the MoodSwipe keyboard, they can type as usual but sense the emotion conveyed by their text and receive suggestions for their message as a benefit. In MoodSwipe, the detected emotions serve as the medium for suggested texts, where viewing the latter is the incentive to correcting the former. We conduct several experiments to show the superiority of the emotion classification models trained on the dialog data, and further to verify good emotion cues are important context for text suggestion.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 16:32:16 GMT  (4100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07191v1", "6 pages (including references), EMNLP 2017 Demo paper"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages (including references), EMNLP 2017 Demo paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["chieh-yang huang", "tristan labetoulle", "ting-hao kenneth huang", "yi-pei chen", "hung-chen chen", "vallari srivastava", "lun-wei ku"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07191"}
