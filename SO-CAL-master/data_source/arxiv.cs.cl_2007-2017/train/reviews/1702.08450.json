Roughly speaking, the aim is to choose for each word in a text its best sense. One of the most popular method estimates local semantic similarity relatedness between two word senses and then extends it to all words from text. The most direct method computes a rough score for every pair of word senses and chooses the lexical chain that has the best score (we can imagine the exponential complexity that returns this comprehensive approach). In this paper, we propose to use a combinatorial optimization metaheuristic for choosing the nearest neighbors obtained by distributional selection around the word to disambiguate. The test and the evaluation of our method concern a corpus written in French by means of the semantic network BabelNet. The obtained accuracy rate is 78 % on all names and verbs chosen for the evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:37:15 GMT  (870kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08450v1", "in French"]], "COMMENTS": "in French", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mokhtar billami"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08450"}
