However, only a few studies analyze semantic representations of small corpora, particularly relevant in single-person text production studies. In the present paper, we compare Skip-gram and LSA capabilities in this scenario, and we test both techniques to extract relevant semantic patterns in single-series dreams reports. LSA showed better performance than Skip-gram in small size training corpus in two semantic tests. As a study case, we show that LSA can capture relevant words associations in dream reports series, even in cases of small number of dreams or low-frequency words. We propose that LSA can be used to explore words associations in dreams reports, which could bring new insight into this classic research area of psychology", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 16:47:17 GMT  (4567kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01520v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:43:33 GMT  (4567kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01520v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["edgar altszyler", "mariano sigman", "sidarta ribeiro", "diego fern\\'andez slezak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01520"}
