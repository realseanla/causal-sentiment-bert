A key open problem is how to construct effective EL systems for specific domains, as knowledge of the local context should in principle increase, rather than decrease, effectiveness. In this paper we propose the hybrid use of simple specialist linkers in combination with an existing generalist system to address this problem. Our main findings are the following. First, we construct a new reusable benchmark for EL on a corpus of domain-specific conversations. Second, we test the performance of a range of approaches under the same conditions, and show that specialist linkers obtain high precision in isolation, and high recall when combined with generalist linkers. Hence, we can effectively exploit local context and get the best of both worlds.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Sep 2015 23:16:45 GMT  (304kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01865v1", "SEM'15"]], "COMMENTS": "SEM'15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["alex olieman", "jaap kamps", "maarten marx", "arjan nusselder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01865"}
