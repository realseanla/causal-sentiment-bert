The role of syntactically-informed features in short answer scoring", "abstract": "Developments in the educational landscape have spurred greater interest in the problem of automatically scoring short answer questions. A recent shared task on this topic revealed a fundamental divide in the modeling approaches that have been applied to this problem, with the best-performing systems split between those that employ a knowledge engineering approach and those that almost solely leverage lexical information (as opposed to higher-level syntactic information) in assigning a score to a given response. This paper aims to introduce the NLP community to the largest corpus currently available for short-answer scoring, provide an overview of methods used in the shared task using this data, and explore the extent to which more syntactically-informed features can contribute to the short answer scoring task in a way that avoids the question-specific manual effort of the knowledge engineering approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 14:45:56 GMT  (33kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0801v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 14:50:06 GMT  (33kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0801v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["derrick higgins", "chris brew", "michael heilman", "ramon ziai", "lei chen", "aoife cahill", "michael flor", "nitin madnani", "joel tetreault", "daniel blanchard", "diane napolitano", "chong min lee", "john blackmore"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0801"}
