As a matter of fact, such a conceptualization is corpus-dependent and does not offer the main properties we expect from ontology. Furthermore, ontology extracted from text in general does not match ontology defined by expert using a formal language. It is not surprising since ontology is an extra-linguistic conceptualization whereas knowledge extracted from text is the concern of textual linguistics. Incompleteness of text and using rhetorical figures, like ellipsis, modify the perception of the conceptualization we may have. Ontological knowledge, which is necessary for text understanding, is not in general embedded into documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2010 07:45:57 GMT  (312kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2034v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["christophe roche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.2034"}
