We also implemented and evaluated the label propagation using four different word representations and similarity metrics. Our comprehensive evaluation of the four approaches was performed on a single data set, demonstrating that all four methods can generate a significant number of new sentiment assignments with high accuracy. The highest correlations (tau=0.51) and the lowest error (mean absolute error &lt; 1.1%), obtained by combining both the semantic and the distributional features, outperformed the distributional-based and semantic-based label-propagation models and approached a supervised algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 22:05:20 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09825v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["areej alhothali", "jesse hoey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09825"}
