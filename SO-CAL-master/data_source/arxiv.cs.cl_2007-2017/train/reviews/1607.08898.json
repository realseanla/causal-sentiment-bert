With this framework, we directly model content selection decisions based on a set of psychologically-motivated domain-independent personal traits including personality (e.g., extraversion and conscientiousness) and basic human values (e.g., self-transcendence and hedonism). We also demonstrate how the analysis results can be used in automated personalized content selection for persuasive message generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 19:16:08 GMT  (1846kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08898v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["tao ding", "shimei pan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.08898"}
