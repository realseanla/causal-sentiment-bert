In this work we show that by using a Siamese inspired architecture to encode the discussions, we no longer need to rely on hand-crafted features to exploit the meta thread structure. We evaluate our model on existing online discussion corpora - ABCD, IAC and AWTP. Experimental results on ABCD dataset show that by fusing lexical and word embedding features, our model achieves the state of the art performance of 0.804 average F1 score. We also show that the model trained on ABCD dataset performs competitively on relatively smaller annotated datasets (IAC and AWTP).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 12:34:11 GMT  (765kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05582v1", "In Proc. 7th Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII'17), San Antonio, TX, USA, Oct. 23-26, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proc. 7th Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII'17), San Antonio, TX, USA, Oct. 23-26, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sushant hiray", "venkatesh duppada"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05582"}
