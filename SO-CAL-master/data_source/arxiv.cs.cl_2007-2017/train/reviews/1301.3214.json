In this paper, we consider higher dimensional extensions of the sentiment concept, which represent a richer set of human emotions. Our approach goes beyond previous work in that our model contains a continuous manifold rather than a finite set of human emotions. We investigate the resulting model, compare it to psychological observations, and explore its predictive capabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 03:45:27 GMT  (127kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3214v1", "3 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["seungyeon kim", "fuxin li", "guy lebanon", "irfan essa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3214"}
