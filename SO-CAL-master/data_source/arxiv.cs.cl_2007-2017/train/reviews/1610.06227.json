Experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art in several languages used in previous work (Rasooli and Collins, 2015;Zhang and Barzilay, 2015; Ammar et al.,2016), in a setting where the only source of translation data is the Bible, a considerably smaller corpus than the Europarl corpus used in previous work. Results using the Europarl corpus as a source of translation data show additional improvements over the results of Rasooli and Collins (2015). We conclude with results on 38 datasets (26 languages) from the Universal Dependencies corpora: 13 datasets(10 languages) have unlabeled attachment ac-curacies of 80% or higher; the average unlabeled accuracy on the 38 datasets is 74.8%.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 21:25:39 GMT  (534kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06227v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 4 Feb 2017 04:05:00 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06227v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mohammad sadegh rasooli", "michael collins"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.06227"}
