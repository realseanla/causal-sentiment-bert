Inside SYNTAGMA", "abstract": "This paper discusses SYNTAGMA, a rule based NLP system addressing the tricky issues of syntactic ambiguity reduction and word sense disambiguation as well as providing innovative and original solutions for constituent generation and constraints management. To provide an insight into how it operates, the system's general architecture and components, as well as its lexical, syntactic and semantic resources are described. After that, the paper addresses the mechanism that performs selective parsing through an interaction between syntactic and semantic information, leading the parser to a coherent and accurate interpretation of the input text.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 20:19:31 GMT  (467kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05768v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniel christen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.05768"}
