{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jun-2017", "title": "Improving Legal Information Retrieval by Distributional Composition with Term Order Probabilities", "abstract": "Legal professionals worldwide are currently trying to get up-to-pace with the explosive growth in legal document availability through digital means. This drives a need for high efficiency Legal Information Retrieval (IR) and Question Answering (QA) methods. The IR task in particular has a set of unique challenges that invite the use of semantic motivated NLP techniques. In this work, a two-stage method for Legal Information Retrieval is proposed, combining lexical statistics and distributional sentence representations in the context of Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE). The combination is done with the use of disambiguation rules, applied over the rankings obtained through n-gram statistics. After the ranking is done, its results are evaluated for ambiguity, and disambiguation is done if a result is decided to be unreliable for a given query. Competition and experimental results indicate small gains in overall retrieval performance using the proposed approach. Additionally, an analysis of error and improvement cases is presented for a better understanding of the contributions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Jun 2017 06:57:09 GMT  (1559kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01038v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 10:49:15 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01038v2", "wrong version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["danilo s carvalho", "duc-vu tran", "van-khanh tran", "le-nguyen minh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01038"}
