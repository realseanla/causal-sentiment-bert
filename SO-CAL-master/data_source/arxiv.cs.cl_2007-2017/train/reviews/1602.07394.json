In this work, we combine phonetic knowledge, such as vowels, with enhanced acoustic features to build an improved accent classification system. The classifier is based on Gaussian Mixture Model-Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM), with normalized Perceptual Linear Predictive (PLP) features. The features are further optimized by Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and Hetroscedastic Linear Discriminant Analysis (HLDA). Using 7 major types of accented speech from the Foreign Accented English (FAE) corpus, the system achieves classification accuracy 54% with input test data as short as 20 seconds, which is competitive to the state of the art in this field.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 04:33:49 GMT  (520kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07394v1", "International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP) 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Congress on Image and Signal Processing (CISP) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["zhenhao ge"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07394"}
