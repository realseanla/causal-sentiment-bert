Our model expands the current recursive models by incorporating structural information around a node of a syntactic tree using both bottom-up and top-down information propagation. Also, the model utilizes structural attention to identify the most salient representations during the construction of the syntactic tree. To our knowledge, the proposed models achieve state of the art performance on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Jan 2017 09:58:49 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01811v1", "Submitted to EACL2017 for review"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to EACL2017 for review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["filippos kokkinos", "alexandros potamianos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.01811"}
