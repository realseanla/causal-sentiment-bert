Here we present a novel textual reply generation model that goes beyond the current auto-reply and predictive text entry models by taking into account the content preferences of the user, the idiosyncrasies of their conversational style, and even the structure of their social graph. Specifically, we have developed two types of models for personalized user interactions: a content-based conversation model, which makes use of location together with user information, and a social-graph-based conversation model, which combines content-based conversation models with social graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:26:50 GMT  (4243kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05512v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1603.06155by other authors"], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 15:14:22 GMT  (4365kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05512v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1603.06155by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["parminder bhatia", "marsal gavalda", "arash einolghozati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05512"}
