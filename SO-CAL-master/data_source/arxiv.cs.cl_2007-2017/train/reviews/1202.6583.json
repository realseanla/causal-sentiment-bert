We present Lamb, a lexical analyzer that produces a lexical analysis graph describing all the possible sequences of tokens that can be found within the input string. Parsers can process such lexical analysis graphs and discard any sequence of tokens that does not produce a valid syntactic sentence, therefore performing, together with Lamb, a context-sensitive lexical analysis in lexically-ambiguous language specifications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 15:59:54 GMT  (68kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6583v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.FL", "authors": ["luis quesada", "fernando berzal", "francisco j cortijo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.6583"}
