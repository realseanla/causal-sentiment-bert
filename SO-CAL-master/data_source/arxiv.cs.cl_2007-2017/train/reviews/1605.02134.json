In this paper, we propose a neural recovery machine (NRM) to model and recover DPs in Chinese, so that to avoid the non-trivial feature engineering process. The experimental results show that the proposed NRM significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on both two heterogeneous datasets. Further experiment results of Chinese zero pronoun (ZP) resolution show that the performance of ZP resolution can also be improved by recovering the ZPs to DPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 May 2016 02:41:54 GMT  (1885kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02134v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wei-nan zhang", "ting liu", "qingyu yin", "yu zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02134"}
