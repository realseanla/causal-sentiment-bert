In this paper we propose to bridge this gap by generating paraphrases of the input question with the goal that at least one of them will be correctly mapped to a knowledge-base query. We introduce a novel grammar model for paraphrase generation that does not require any sentence-aligned paraphrase corpus. Our key idea is to leverage the flexibility and scalability of latent-variable probabilistic context-free grammars to sample paraphrases. We do an extrinsic evaluation of our paraphrases by plugging them into a semantic parser for Freebase. Our evaluation experiments on the WebQuestions benchmark dataset show that the performance of the semantic parser significantly improves over strong baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 16:50:22 GMT  (216kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06068v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 Aug 2016 12:20:52 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06068v2", "10 pages, INLG 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shashi narayan", "siva reddy", "shay b cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06068"}
