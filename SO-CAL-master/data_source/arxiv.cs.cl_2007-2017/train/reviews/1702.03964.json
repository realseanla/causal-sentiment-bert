Our approach is based on cross-lingual projection: automatically produced (and manually corrected) semantic annotations for English sentences are mapped onto their word-aligned translations, assuming that the translations are meaning-preserving. The semantic annotation consists of five main steps: (i) segmentation of the text in sentences and lexical items; (ii) syntactic parsing with Combinatory Categorial Grammar; (iii) universal semantic tagging; (iv) symbolization; and (v) compositional semantic analysis based on Discourse Representation Theory. These steps are performed using statistical models trained in a semi-supervised manner. The employed annotation models are all language-neutral. Our first results are promising.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 19:52:02 GMT  (208kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03964v1", "To appear at EACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at EACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lasha abzianidze", "johannes bjerva", "kilian evang", "hessel haagsma", "rik van noord", "pierre ludmann", "duc-duy nguyen", "johan bos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03964"}
