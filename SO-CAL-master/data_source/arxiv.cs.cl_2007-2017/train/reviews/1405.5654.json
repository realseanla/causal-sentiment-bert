Non-parallel corpus resources on the web have an inestimable potential value in machine translation and other natural language processing tasks. This article proposes a semi-supervised transductive learning method for expanding the training corpus in statistical machine translation system by extracting parallel sentences from the non-parallel corpus. This method only requires a small amount of labeled corpus and a large unlabeled corpus to build a high-performance classifier, especially for when there is short of labeled corpus. The experimental results show that by combining the non-parallel corpus alignment and the semi-supervised transductive learning method, we can more effectively use their respective strengths to improve the performance of machine translation system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 May 2014 07:58:56 GMT  (321kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5654v1", "15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lijiang chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5654"}
