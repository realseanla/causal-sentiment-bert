The CNN tagger is robust across different tagging tasks: without task-specific tuning of hyper-parameters, it achieves state-of-the-art results in part-of-speech tagging, morphological tagging and supertagging. The CNN tagger is also robust against the out-of-vocabulary problem, it performs well on artificially unnormalized texts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 12:11:50 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01723v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xiang yu", "agnieszka fale\\'nska", "ngoc thang vu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01723"}
