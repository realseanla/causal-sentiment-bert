The development of such technologies is a major asset for developing countries like Cambodia and Laos, and emerging ones like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand. The MotAMot project aims to computerize an under-resourced language: Khmer, spoken mainly in Cambodia. The main goal of the project is the development of a multilingual lexical system targeted for Khmer. The macrostructure is a pivot one with each word sense of each language linked to a pivot axi. The microstructure comes from a simplification of the explanatory and combinatory dictionary. The lexical system has been initialized with data coming mainly from the conversion of the French-Khmer bilingual dictionary of Denis Richer from Word to XML format. The French part was completed with pronunciation and parts-of-speech coming from the FeM French-english-Malay dictionary. The Khmer headwords noted in IPA in the Richer dictionary were converted to Khmer writing with OpenFST, a finite state transducer tool. The resulting resource is available online for lookup, editing, download and remote programming via a REST API on a Jibiki platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 May 2014 08:57:54 GMT  (648kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5674v1", "8 pages, Languages Resources and Evaluation Conference, Reykjavik : Iceland (2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, Languages Resources and Evaluation Conference, Reykjavik : Iceland (2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mathieu mangeot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5674"}
