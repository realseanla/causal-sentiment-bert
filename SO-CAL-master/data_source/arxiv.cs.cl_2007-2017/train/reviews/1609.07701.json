Previous work relied on manually-crafted grammars or pivoting via English, both of which are unsatisfactory for building a scalable and accurate MT system. In this work, we compare standard phrase-based and neural systems on Arabic-Hebrew translation. We experiment with tokenization by external tools and sub-word modeling by character-level neural models, and show that both methods lead to improved translation performance, with a small advantage to the neural models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 05:07:55 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07701v1", "SeMaT 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "SeMaT 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yonatan belinkov", "james glass"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07701"}
