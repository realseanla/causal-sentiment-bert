{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Mar-2016", "title": "Easy-First Dependency Parsing with Hierarchical Tree LSTMs", "abstract": "We suggest a compositional vector representation of parse trees that relies on a recursive combination of recurrent-neural network encoders. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we use the representation as the backbone of a greedy, bottom-up dependency parser, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies for English and Chinese, without relying on external word embeddings. The parser's implementation is available for download at the first author's webpage.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 17:43:37 GMT  (155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00375v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 May 2016 10:11:44 GMT  (155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00375v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["eliyahu kiperwasser", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.00375"}
