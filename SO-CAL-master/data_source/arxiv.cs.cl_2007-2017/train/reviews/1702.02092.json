The Kohonen speech typewriter is a semi-supervised method comprised of self-organising maps (SOMs) that achieves low phoneme error rates. A SOM is a 2D array of cells that learn vector representations of the data based on neighbourhoods. In this paper, we report a method to evaluate pronunciation using multilevel SOMs with /hVd/ single syllable utterances for the study of vowels, for Australian pronunciation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 11:18:06 GMT  (7kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02092v1", "16th Speech Science and Technology Conference (SST2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "16th Speech Science and Technology Conference (SST2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE cs.SD", "authors": ["tom a f", "erson", "david m w powers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02092"}
