The paper analyses the stages in the evolution of early writing systems which began with the evolution of counting in the ancient Near East. A stage anterior to the stage of syllabic representation of sounds of a language, is identified. Unique geometric shapes required for tokens to categorize objects became too large to handle to abstract hundreds of categories of goods and metallurgical processes during the production of bronze-age goods. About 3500 BCE, Indus script as a writing system was developed to use hieroglyphs to represent the 'spoken words' identifying each of the goods and processes. A rebus method of representing similar sounding words of the lingua franca of the artisans was used in Indus script. This method is recognized and consistently applied for the lingua franca of the Indian sprachbund. That the ancient languages of India, constituted a sprachbund (or language union) is now recognized by many linguists. The sprachbund area is proximate to the area where most of the Indus script inscriptions were discovered, as documented in the corpora. That hundreds of Indian hieroglyphs continued to be used in metallurgy is evidenced by their use on early punch-marked coins. This explains the combined use of syllabic scripts such as Brahmi and Kharoshti together with the hieroglyphs on Rampurva copper bolt, and Sohgaura copper plate from about 6th century BCE.Indian hieroglyphs constitute a writing system for meluhha language and are rebus representations of archaeo-metallurgy lexemes. The rebus principle was employed by the early scripts and can legitimately be used to decipher the Indus script, after secure pictorial identification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Apr 2012 14:14:26 GMT  (1701kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3800v1", "49 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "49 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["srinivasan kalyanaraman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3800"}
