We show that the method's reliance on cosine similarity conflates offset consistency with largely irrelevant neighborhood structure, and propose simple baselines that should be used to improve the utility of the method in vector space evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 15:59:14 GMT  (278kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07736v1", "6 pages; The First Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages; The First Workshop on Evaluating Vector Space Representations for NLP", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tal linzen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07736"}
