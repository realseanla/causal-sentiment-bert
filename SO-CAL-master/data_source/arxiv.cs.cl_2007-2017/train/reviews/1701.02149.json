The key to reach this observation lies in phrase detection, phrase representation, phrase alignment, and more importantly how to connect those aligned phrases of different matching degrees with the final classifier. Prior work (i) has limitations in phrase generation and representation, or (ii) conducts alignment at word and phrase levels by handcrafted features or (iii) utilizes a single framework of alignment without considering the characteristics of specific tasks, which limits the framework's effectiveness across tasks. We propose an architecture based on Gated Recurrent Unit that supports (i) representation learning of phrases of arbitrary granularity and (ii) task-specific attentive pooling of phrase alignments between two sentences. Experimental results on TE and AS match our observation and show the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 12:03:11 GMT  (250kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02149v1", "EACL'2017 long paper. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1604.06896"]], "COMMENTS": "EACL'2017 long paper. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1604.06896", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenpeng yin", "hinrich sch\\\"utze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02149"}
