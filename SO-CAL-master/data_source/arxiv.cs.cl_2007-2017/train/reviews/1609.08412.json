This database consists of 80 hours of speech signals recorded from more than 1,400 speakers, where the utterances are in Chinese but each involves one or several English words. Based on the database and another two free data resources (THCHS30 and the CMU dictionary), a speech recognition (ASR) baseline was constructed with the deep neural network-hidden Markov model (DNN-HMM) hybrid system. We then report the baseline results following the MixASR-CHEN evaluation rules and demonstrate that OC16-CE80 is a reasonable data resource for mixlingual research.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 13:25:51 GMT  (92kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08412v1", "O-COCOSDA 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "O-COCOSDA 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dong wang", "zhiyuan tang", "difei tang", "qing chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08412"}
