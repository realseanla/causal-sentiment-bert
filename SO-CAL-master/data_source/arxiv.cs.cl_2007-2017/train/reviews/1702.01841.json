In this paper, we show how variants of the same writing task can lead to measurable differences in writing style. We present a case study based on the story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a), where annotators were assigned similar writing tasks with different constraints: (1) writing an entire story, (2) adding a story ending for a given story context, and (3) adding an incoherent ending to a story. We show that a simple linear classifier informed with stylistic features is able to successfully distinguish between the three cases, without even looking at the story context. In addition, our style-based classifier establishes a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge, substantially higher than previous results based on deep learning models. Our results demonstrate that different task framings can dramatically affect the way people write.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 01:39:02 GMT  (31kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01841v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 23:10:25 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01841v2", "11 pages, CoNLL 2017"], ["v3", "Thu, 13 Jul 2017 20:26:33 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01841v3", "11 pages, CoNLL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["roy schwartz", "maarten sap", "ioannis konstas", "li zilles", "yejin choi", "noah a smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01841"}
