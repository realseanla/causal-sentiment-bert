We employ recursive autoencoders to generate tree structures of phrase with embeddings at different levels of granularity (e.g., words, sub-phrases, phrases). Over these embeddings on the source and target side, we introduce a bidimensional attention network to learn their interactions encoded in a bidimensional attention matrix, from which we extract two soft attention weight distributions simultaneously. The weight distributions enable BattRAE to generate compositive phrase representations via convolution. Based on the learned phrase representations, we further use a bilinear neural model, trained via a max-margin method, to measure bilingual semantic similarity. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of BattRAE, we incorporate this semantic similarity as an additional feature into a state-of-the-art SMT system. Extensive experiments on NIST Chinese-English test sets show that our model achieves a substantial improvement of up to 1.82 BLEU points over the baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 13:29:07 GMT  (206kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07874v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 03:26:45 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07874v2", "7 pages, accepted by AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["biao zhang", "deyi xiong", "jinsong su"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07874"}
