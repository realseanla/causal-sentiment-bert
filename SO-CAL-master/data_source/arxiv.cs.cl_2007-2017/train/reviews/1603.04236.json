This contribution explores how the corpus of the Hebrew Bible created and maintained by the Eep Talstra Center for Bible and Computer has potential for redefining the way we learn from our ancient texts as modern knowledge workers. It first describes how the corpus was used for development of Bible Online Learner as a persuasive technology to enhance language learning with, in and around a database that drives interactive tasks for learners. The achievements obtained through so far are very promising, and it can help us explore textual criticism as another target for interactive study of the Hebrew Bible through corpus-technology. Because textual criticism is an increasingly specialized area of research which depends on digital resources. The commercial solution from Logos Bible Software offers advanced scholarly resources from the German Bible Society as a model for how affluent Western scholars can use technology for the Hebrew corpus. The achievements in corpus-driven learning and the potential of commercial resources can help us suggest new tasks in textual criticism based on online applications which use corpora for a new kind of textual corpus criticism. Some promising tools for text categorization, analysis of translation shifts and interpretation are recommended as potential models for the future. The main goal in the future must be more open global access for the new tools.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 12:33:00 GMT  (1040kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04236v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 13:28:05 GMT  (1423kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04236v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 14:54:10 GMT  (1432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04236v3", "Journal of Data Mining and Digital Humanities, Episciences.org, 2017"], ["v4", "Mon, 23 Oct 2017 14:49:16 GMT  (1311kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04236v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 06:18:02 GMT  (1311kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04236v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nicolai winther-nielsen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04236"}
