One approach is the attention-based encoder-decoder framework that learns a mapping between variable-length input and output sequences in one step using a purely data-driven method. The attention model has often been shown to improve the performance over another end-to-end approach, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC), mainly because it explicitly uses the history of the target character without any conditional independence assumptions. However, we observed that the attention model has shown poor results especially in noisy condition and is hard to be trained in the initial training stage with long input sequences, as compared with CTC. This is because the attention model is too flexible to predict proper alignments in such cases due to the lack of left-to-right constraints as used in CTC. This paper presents a novel method for end-to-end speech recognition to improve robustness and achieve fast convergence by using a joint CTC-attention model within the multi-task learning framework, thereby mitigating the alignment issue. An experiment on the WSJ and CHiME-4 tasks demonstrates its advantages over both the CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder baselines, showing 6.6-10.3% relative improvements in Character Error Rate (CER).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 22:48:53 GMT  (5155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06773v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 21:00:01 GMT  (5466kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06773v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["suyoun kim", "takaaki hori", "shinji watanabe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06773"}
