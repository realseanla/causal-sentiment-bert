We present an end-to-end graph-based neural network dependency parser that can be trained to reproduce matrices of edge scores, which can be directly projected across word alignments. We show that our approach to cross-lingual dependency parsing is not only simpler, but also achieves an absolute improvement of 2.25% averaged across 10 languages compared to the previous state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Jan 2017 12:54:48 GMT  (98kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01623v1", "To be published at EACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published at EACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michael sejr schlichtkrull", "anders s{\\o}gaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.01623"}
