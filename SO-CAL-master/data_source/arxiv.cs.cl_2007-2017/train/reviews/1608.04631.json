In particular, at the IWSLT 2015 evaluation campaign, NMT outperformed well established state-of-the-art PBMT systems on English-German, a language pair known to be particularly hard because of morphology and syntactic differences. To understand in what respects NMT provides better translation quality than PBMT, we perform a detailed analysis of neural versus phrase-based SMT outputs, leveraging high quality post-edits performed by professional translators on the IWSLT data. For the first time, our analysis provides useful insights on what linguistic phenomena are best modeled by neural models -- such as the reordering of verbs -- while pointing out other aspects that remain to be improved.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 15:04:18 GMT  (43kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04631v1", "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), November 1-5, 2016, Austin, Texas, USA"], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 09:20:08 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04631v2", "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), November 1-5, 2016, Austin, Texas, USA"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), November 1-5, 2016, Austin, Texas, USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["luisa bentivogli", "arianna bisazza", "mauro cettolo", "marcello federico"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04631"}
