In this paper, we address the problem of Complementary Entity Recognition (CER) as a supervised sequence labeling with the capability of expanding domain knowledge as key-value pairs from unlabeled reviews, by automatically learning and enhancing knowledge-based features. We use Conditional Random Field (CRF) as the base learner and augment CRF with knowledge-based features (called the Knowledge-based CRF or KCRF for short). We conduct experiments to show that KCRF effectively improves the performance of supervised CER task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 03:45:25 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10030v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hu xu", "lei shu", "philip s yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10030"}
