Moreover, in agglutinative languages which do not have reliable stemmers, missing various lexical formations in bilingual dictionaries degrades CLIR performance. This paper aims to introduce a probabilistic translation model to solve the ambiguity problem, and also to provide most likely formations of a dictionary candidate. We propose Minimum Edit Support Candidates (MESC) method that exploits a monolingual corpus and a bilingual dictionary to translate users' native language queries to documents' language. Our experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art dictionary-based English-Persian CLIR.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 19:15:59 GMT  (32kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1006v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 06:55:11 GMT  (33kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1006v2", "The 3rd conference of Computational Linguistic, Sharif University of Technology, November 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["javid dadashkarimi", "azadeh shakery", "heshaam faili"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.1006"}
