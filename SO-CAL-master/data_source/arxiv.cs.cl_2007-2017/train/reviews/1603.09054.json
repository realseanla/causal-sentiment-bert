To prove it, we describe and evaluate APSyn, a variant of the Average Precision that, without any optimization, outperforms the vector cosine and the co-occurrence on the standard ESL test set, with an improvement ranging between +9.00% and +17.98%, depending on the number of chosen top contexts.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 07:05:45 GMT  (790kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09054v1", "in AAAI 2016. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1603.08701"]], "COMMENTS": "in AAAI 2016. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1603.08701", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["enrico santus", "tin-shing chiu", "qin lu", "alessandro lenci", "chu-ren huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.09054"}
