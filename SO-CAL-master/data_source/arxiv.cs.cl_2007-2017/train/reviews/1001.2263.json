To develop Dictation System like Dragon for Indian languages it is most important to adapt the system to a speaker with minimum training. In this paper we focus on the importance of creating speech database at syllable units and identifying minimum text to be considered while training any speech recognition system. There are systems developed for continuous speech recognition in English and in few Indian languages like Hindi and Tamil. This paper gives the statistical details of syllables in Telugu and its use in minimizing the search space during recognition of speech. The minimum words that cover maximum syllables are identified. This words list can be used for preparing a small text which can be used for collecting speech sample while training the dictation system. The results are plotted for frequency of syllables and the number of syllables in each word. This approach is applied on the CIIL Mysore text corpus which is of 3 million words.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 18:51:08 GMT  (674kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2263v1", "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["n kalyani", "dr k v n sunitha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.2263"}
