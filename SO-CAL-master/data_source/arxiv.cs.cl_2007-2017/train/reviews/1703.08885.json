Information sources like Wikipedia, however, are not well structured and difficult to utilize in comparison with Knowledge Bases (KBs). In this work we present a two-step approach to question answering from unstructured text, consisting of a retrieval step and a comprehension step. For comprehension, we present an RNN based attention model with a novel mixture mechanism for selecting answers from either retrieved articles or a fixed vocabulary. For retrieval we introduce a hand-crafted model and a neural model for ranking relevant articles. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on W IKI M OVIES dataset, reducing the error by 40%. Our experimental results further demonstrate the importance of each of the introduced components.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 23:48:06 GMT  (249kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08885v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yusuke watanabe", "bhuwan dhingra", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08885"}
