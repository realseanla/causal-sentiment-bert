We cast the problem as sequence tagging and introduce semi-supervised methods to a neural tagging model, which builds on recent advances in named entity recognition. Since annotated training data is scarce in this domain, we introduce a graph-based semi-supervised algorithm together with a data selection scheme to leverage unannotated articles. Both inductive and transductive semi-supervised learning strategies outperform state-of-the-art information extraction performance on the 2017 SemEval Task 10 ScienceIE task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 03:33:58 GMT  (1762kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06075v1", "accepted by EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted by EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yi luan", "mari ostendorf", "hannaneh hajishirzi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.06075"}
