However, in most cases, the recurrent network that operates on word-level representations to produce context sensitive representations is trained on relatively little labeled data. In this paper, we demonstrate a general semi-supervised approach for adding pre- trained context embeddings from bidirectional language models to NLP systems and apply it to sequence labeling tasks. We evaluate our model on two standard datasets for named entity recognition (NER) and chunking, and in both cases achieve state of the art results, surpassing previous systems that use other forms of transfer or joint learning with additional labeled data and task specific gazetteers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 01:13:04 GMT  (131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00108v1", "To appear in ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["matthew e peters", "waleed ammar", "chandra bhagavatula", "russell power"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00108"}
