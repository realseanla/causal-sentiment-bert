We showed how ultrametric topology provides a most useful representational and computational framework for this. Now we look at the extent to which we can find ultrametricity in text. We use coherent and meaningful collections of nearly 1000 texts to show how we can measure inherent ultrametricity. On the basis of our findings we hypothesize that inherent ultrametricty is a basis for further exploring unconscious thought processes.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 01:00:41 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2719v1", "21 pages, 6 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:cs/0701181"], ["v2", "Mon, 6 Feb 2012 19:49:54 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2719v2", "21 pages, 6 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:cs/0701181"], ["v3", "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 12:48:24 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2719v3", "21 pages, 6 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:cs/0701181(V3: minor corrections)"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 6 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:cs/0701181", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["fionn murtagh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2719"}
