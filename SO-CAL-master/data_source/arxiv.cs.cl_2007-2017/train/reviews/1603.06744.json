We present a novel neural network architecture which generates an output sequence conditioned on an arbitrary number of input functions. Crucially, our approach allows both the choice of conditioning context and the granularity of generation, for example characters or tokens, to be marginalised, thus permitting scalable and effective training. Using this framework, we address the problem of generating programming code from a mixed natural language and structured specification. We create two new data sets for this paradigm derived from the collectible trading card games Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone. On these, and a third preexisting corpus, we demonstrate that marginalising multiple predictors allows our model to outperform strong benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 11:41:51 GMT  (1701kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06744v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 14:46:00 GMT  (2543kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06744v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["wang ling", "edward grefenstette", "karl moritz hermann", "tom\\'a\\v{s} ko\\v{c}isk\\'y", "rew senior", "fumin wang", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06744"}
