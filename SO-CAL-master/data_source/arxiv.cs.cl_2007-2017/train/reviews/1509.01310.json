Computer simulations, when compared with natural languages,show that chunking reduces mean dependency distance (MDD) of a linear sequence of nodes (constrained by continuity or projectivity) to that of natural languages. More interestingly, chunking alone brings about less dependency crossings as well, though having failed to reduce them, to such rarity as found in human languages. These results suggest that chunking may play a vital role in the minimization of dependency distance, and a somewhat contributing role in the rarity of dependency crossing. In addition, the results point to a possibility that the rarity of dependency crossings is not a mere side-effect of minimization of dependency distance, but a linguistic phenomenon with its own motivations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 23:57:46 GMT  (474kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01310v1", "6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["qian lu", "chunshan xu", "haitao liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01310"}
