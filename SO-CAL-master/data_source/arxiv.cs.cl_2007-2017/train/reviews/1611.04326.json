This paper reports a simple topic model for sarcasm detection, a first, to the best of our knowledge. Designed on the basis of the intuition that sarcastic tweets are likely to have a mixture of words of both sentiments as against tweets with literal sentiment (either positive or negative), our hierarchical topic model discovers sarcasm-prevalent topics and topic-level sentiment. Using a dataset of tweets labeled using hashtags, the model estimates topic-level, and sentiment-level distributions. Our evaluation shows that topics such as `work', `gun laws', `weather' are sarcasm-prevalent topics. Our model is also able to discover the mixture of sentiment-bearing words that exist in a text of a given sentiment-related label. Finally, we apply our model to predict sarcasm in tweets. We outperform two prior work based on statistical classifiers with specific features, by around 25\\%.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 10:40:44 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04326v1", "This paper will be presented at ExPROM workshop at COLING 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 10:55:56 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04326v2", "This version of the paper contains corrected changes, after the camera -ready submission.
