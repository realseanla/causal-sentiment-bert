The recent literature has proposed other methods which attempt to mitigate such biases. In this paper, we intend to investigate APSyn, a measure that computes the extent of the intersection between the most associated contexts of two target words, weighting it by context relevance. We evaluated this metric in a similarity estimation task on several popular test sets, and our results show that APSyn is in fact highly competitive, even with respect to the results reported in the literature for word embeddings. On top of it, APSyn addresses some of the weaknesses of Vector Cosine, performing well also on genuine similarity estimation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Aug 2016 19:57:55 GMT  (52kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07738v1", "8 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, PACLIC, cosine, vectors, DSMs"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 10:46:25 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07738v2", "8 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, PACLIC, cosine, vectors, DSMs"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables, PACLIC, cosine, vectors, DSMs", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["enrico santus", "emmanuele chersoni", "alessandro lenci", "chu-ren huang", "philippe blache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07738"}
