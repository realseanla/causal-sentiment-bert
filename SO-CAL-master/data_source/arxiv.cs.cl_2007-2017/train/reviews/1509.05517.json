Firstly, the mechanism and training process of the tagger are reviewed, and a new method for incorporating linguistic rules is proposed. Secondly, experiments are conducted to compare the performances of the tagger under different window settings, with or without Apertium-style \"forbid\" rules, with or without Constraint Grammar, and also with respect to the traditional HMM tagger in Apertium.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 06:56:38 GMT  (559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05517v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gang chen", "mikel l forcada"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05517"}
