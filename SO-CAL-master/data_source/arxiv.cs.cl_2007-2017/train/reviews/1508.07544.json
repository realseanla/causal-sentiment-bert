Recently, a surge of interest can be observed within the computational linguistics (CL) community in the social dimension of language. In this article we present a survey of the emerging field of \"Computational Sociolinguistics\" that reflects this increased interest. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of CL research on sociolinguistic themes, featuring topics such as the relation between language and social identity, language use in social interaction and multilingual communication. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential for synergy between the research communities involved, by showing how the large-scale data-driven methods that are widely used in CL can complement existing sociolinguistic studies, and how sociolinguistics can inform and challenge the methods and assumptions employed in CL studies. We hope to convey the possible benefits of a closer collaboration between the two communities and conclude with a discussion of open challenges.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Aug 2015 08:39:02 GMT  (89kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07544v1", "52 pages.
