We want to test whether a representation of informal words fulfills the promise of eliding explicit text normalization as a preprocessing step. One possible evaluation metric for such domains is the proximity of spelling variants. We propose how such a metric might be computed and how a spelling variant dataset can be collected using UrbanDictionary.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 13:39:54 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08270v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["naomi saphra", "adam lopez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08270"}
