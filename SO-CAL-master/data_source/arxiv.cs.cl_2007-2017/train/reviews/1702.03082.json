The main contributions of this paper are the following: (a) we introduce new cross-language similarity detection methods based on distributed representation of words; (b) we combine the different methods proposed to verify their complementarity and finally obtain an overall F1 score of 89.15% for English-French similarity detection at chunk level (88.5% at sentence level) on a very challenging corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 07:22:08 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03082v1", "Accepted to EACL 2017 (short)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to EACL 2017 (short)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["j ferrero", "f agnes", "l besacier", "d schwab"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03082"}
