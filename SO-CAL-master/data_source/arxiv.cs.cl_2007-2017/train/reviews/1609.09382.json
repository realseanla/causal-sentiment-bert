We experiment several cross-lingual annotation projection methods using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) models. The distinctive feature of our approach is that our multilingual word representation requires only a parallel corpus between the source and target language. More precisely, our method has the following characteristics: (a) it does not use word alignment information, (b) it does not assume any knowledge about foreign languages, which makes it applicable to a wide range of resource-poor languages, (c) it provides truly multilingual taggers. We investigate both uni- and bi-directional RNN models and propose a method to include external information (for instance low level information from POS) in the RNN to train higher level taggers (for instance, super sense taggers). We demonstrate the validity and genericity of our model by using parallel corpora (obtained by manual or automatic translation). Our experiments are conducted to induce cross-lingual POS and super sense taggers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 15:19:13 GMT  (860kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09382v1", "accepted to COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["othman zennaki", "nasredine semmar", "laurent besacier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09382"}
