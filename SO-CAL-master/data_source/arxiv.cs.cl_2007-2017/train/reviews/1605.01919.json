Speakers of different languages may have consistently different experiences, e.g., different information available in different languages at tourist attractions or different user experiences with software due to internationalization/localization choices. This paper assesses the similarity in the ratings given by speakers of different languages to London tourist attractions on TripAdvisor. The correlations between different languages are generally high, but some language pairs are more correlated than others. The results question the common practice of computing average ratings from reviews in many languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 12:52:09 GMT  (281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01919v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["scott a hale"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01919"}
