Event orderings are conveyed in text via va rious linguistic mechanisms including the use of expressions such as \"before\", \"after\" or \"during\" that explicitly assert a temporal relation -- temporal signals. In this paper, we investigate the role of temporal signals in temporal relation extraction and provide a quantitative analysis of these expres sions in the TimeBank annotated corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 18:08:47 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5066v1", "Proc.
