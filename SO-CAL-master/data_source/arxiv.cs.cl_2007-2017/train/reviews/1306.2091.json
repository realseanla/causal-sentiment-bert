Our formalism builds upon the typical representation for unlabeled dependencies, permitting a simple notation and annotation workflow. Moreover, the formalism encourages annotators to underspecify parts of the syntax if doing so would streamline the annotation process. We demonstrate the efficacy of this annotation on three languages and develop algorithms to evaluate and compare underspecified annotations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 02:54:10 GMT  (75kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2091v1", "This is an expanded version of a paper appearing in Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop &amp; Interoperability with Discourse, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 8-9, 2013"], ["v2", "Sat, 15 Jun 2013 01:44:50 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2091v2", "This is an expanded version of a paper appearing in Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop &amp; Interoperability with Discourse, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 8-9, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an expanded version of a paper appearing in Proceedings of the 7th Linguistic Annotation Workshop &amp; Interoperability with Discourse, Sofia, Bulgaria, August 8-9, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nathan schneider", "brendan o'connor", "naomi saphra", "david bamman", "manaal faruqui", "noah a smith", "chris dyer", "jason baldridge"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2091"}
