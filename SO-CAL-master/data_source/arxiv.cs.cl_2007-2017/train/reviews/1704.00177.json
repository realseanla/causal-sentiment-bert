Existing machine learning techniques for citation sentiment analysis are focusing on labor-intensive feature engineering, which requires large annotated corpus. As an automatic feature extraction tool, word2vec has been successfully applied to sentiment analysis of short texts. In this work, I conducted empirical research with the question: how well does word2vec work on the sentiment analysis of citations? The proposed method constructed sentence vectors (sent2vec) by averaging the word embeddings, which were learned from Anthology Collections (ACL-Embeddings). I also investigated polarity-specific word embeddings (PS-Embeddings) for classifying positive and negative citations. The sentence vectors formed a feature space, to which the examined citation sentence was mapped to. Those features were input into classifiers (support vector machines) for supervised classification. Using 10-cross-validation scheme, evaluation was conducted on a set of annotated citations. The results showed that word embeddings are effective on classifying positive and negative citations. However, hand-crafted features performed better for the overall classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 14:53:54 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00177v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["haixia liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00177"}
