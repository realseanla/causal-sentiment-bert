They cover products, components and project implementation. They also play an important role to ensure the quality of a building, and to minimize its environmental impact. In this paper, we are particularly interested in the modeling of the regulatory constraints derived from the Technical Guides issued by CSTB and used to validate Technical Assessments. We first describe our approach for modeling regulatory constraints in the SBVR language, and formalizing them in the SPARQL language. Second, we describe how we model the processes of compliance checking described in the CSTB Technical Guides. Third, we show how we implement these processes to assist industrials in drafting Technical Documents in order to acquire a Technical Assessment; a compliance report is automatically generated to explain the compliance or noncompliance of this Technical Documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 05:46:53 GMT  (623kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4811v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["khalil riad bouzidi", "catherine faron-zucker", "bruno fies", "olivier corby", "le-thanh nhan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4811"}
