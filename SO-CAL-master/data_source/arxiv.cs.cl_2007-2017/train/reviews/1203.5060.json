The challenge requires the automatic identification of temporal entities and relations in text. USFD2 identifies and anchors temporal expressions, and also attempts two of the four temporal relation assignment tasks. A rule-based system picks out and anchors temporal expressions, and a maximum entropy classifier assigns temporal link labels, based on features that include descriptions of associated temporal signal words. USFD2 identified temporal expressions successfully, and correctly classified their type in 90% of cases. Determining the relation between an event and time expression in the same sentence was performed at 63% accuracy, the second highest score in this part of the challenge.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 17:59:22 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5060v1", "Part of TempEval-2"]], "COMMENTS": "Part of TempEval-2", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["leon derczynski", "robert gaizauskas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.5060"}
