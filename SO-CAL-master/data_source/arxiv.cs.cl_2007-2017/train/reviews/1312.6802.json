Existing algorithms targeting this problem have been developed in a haphazard manner. In this work, we model this problem as an optimization problem. An Integer Program is being developed to overcome the shortcomings of the existing approaches. The sample results of the proposed method are also being compared with an established technique in the field for English language. An AMPL code for the same IP has also been given.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 12:06:48 GMT  (447kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6802v1", "14 pages, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["b p pande", "pawan tamta", "h s dhami"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6802"}
