We present a Dirichlet-multinomial model in which frames are latent categories that explain the linking of verb-subject-object triples, given document-level sparsity. We analyze what the model learns, and compare it to FrameNet, noting it learns some novel and interesting frames. This document also contains a discussion of inference issues, including concentration parameter learning; and a small-scale error analysis of syntactic parsing accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jul 2013 16:55:27 GMT  (5563kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7382v1", "21 pages; technical report for Data Analysis Project requirement, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages; technical report for Data Analysis Project requirement, Machine Learning Department, Carnegie Mellon University", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["brendan o'connor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7382"}
