We show theoretical evidence that the vector compositions in our model conform to the logic of DCS. Experimentally, we show that vector-based composition brings a strong ability to calculate similar phrases as similar vectors, achieving near state-of-the-art on a wide range of phrase similarity tasks and relation classification; meanwhile, DCS can guide building vectors for structured queries that can be directly executed. We evaluate this utility on sentence completion task and report a new state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 09:12:17 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02461v1", "to appear in ACL2016"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear in ACL2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ran tian", "naoaki okazaki", "kentaro inui"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02461"}
