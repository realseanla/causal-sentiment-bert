{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Oct-2013", "title": "Improved Bayesian Logistic Supervised Topic Models with Data Augmentation", "abstract": "Supervised topic models with a logistic likelihood have two issues that potentially limit their practical use: 1) response variables are usually over-weighted by document word counts; and 2) existing variational inference methods make strict mean-field assumptions. We address these issues by: 1) introducing a regularization constant to better balance the two parts based on an optimization formulation of Bayesian inference; and 2) developing a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm by introducing auxiliary Polya-Gamma variables and collapsing out Dirichlet variables. Our augment-and-collapse sampling algorithm has analytical forms of each conditional distribution without making any restricting assumptions and can be easily parallelized. Empirical results demonstrate significant improvements on prediction performance and time efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Oct 2013 09:23:10 GMT  (475kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2408v1", "9 pages, ACL 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, ACL 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL stat.AP stat.ML", "authors": ["jun zhu", "xun zheng", "bo zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.2408"}
