Our approach is aligned to mimic how a human does the natural language inference process given two statements. The model uses variants of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), attention mechanism and composable neural networks, to carry out the task. Each part of our model can be mapped to a clear functionality humans do for carrying out the overall task of natural language inference. The model is end-to-end differentiable enabling training by stochastic gradient descent. On Stanford Natural Language Inference(SNLI) dataset, the proposed model achieves better accuracy numbers than all published models in literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 08:48:22 GMT  (165kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04741v1", "8 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 05:36:05 GMT  (167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04741v2", "8 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["biswajit paria", "k m annervaz", "ambedkar dukkipati", "ankush chatterjee", "sanjay podder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04741"}
