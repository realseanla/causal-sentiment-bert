We contribute by proposing several schemes for representing the morphological analysis of a word in the context of named entity recognition. We show that a concatenation of this representation with the word and character embeddings improves the performance. The effect of these representation schemes on the tagging performance is also investigated.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 21:59:47 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00506v1", "Working draft"]], "COMMENTS": "Working draft", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["onur gungor", "eray yildiz", "suzan uskudarli", "tunga gungor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00506"}
