Our word embeddings are trained by predicting words between noun pairs using lexical relation-specific features on a large unlabeled corpus. This allows us to explicitly incorporate relation-specific information into the word embeddings. The learned word embeddings are then used to construct feature vectors for a relation classification model. On a well-established semantic relation classification task, our method significantly outperforms a baseline based on a previously introduced word embedding method, and compares favorably to previous state-of-the-art models without syntactic information or manually constructed external resources. Furthermore, when incorporating external resources, our method outperforms the previous state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 07:59:59 GMT  (193kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00095v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 17 May 2015 00:04:42 GMT  (193kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00095v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 13:48:30 GMT  (195kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00095v3", "The Nineteenth Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2015)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kazuma hashimoto", "pontus stenetorp", "makoto miwa", "yoshimasa tsuruoka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00095"}
