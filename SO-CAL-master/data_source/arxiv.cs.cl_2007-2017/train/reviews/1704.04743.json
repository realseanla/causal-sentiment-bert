An experiment on the WMT16 German-English news translation task resulted in an improved BLEU score when compared to a syntax-agnostic NMT baseline trained on the same dataset. An analysis of the translations from the syntax-aware system shows that it performs more reordering during translation in comparison to the baseline. A small-scale human evaluation also showed an advantage to the syntax-aware system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Apr 2017 09:54:50 GMT  (637kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04743v1", "Accepted as a short paper in ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 10:20:28 GMT  (1442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04743v2", "Accepted as a short paper in ACL 2017"], ["v3", "Sat, 6 May 2017 07:25:19 GMT  (1443kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04743v3", "Accepted as a short paper in ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a short paper in ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["roee aharoni", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.04743"}
