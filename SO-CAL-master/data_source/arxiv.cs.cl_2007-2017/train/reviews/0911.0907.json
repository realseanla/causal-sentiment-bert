But prior to recognition, it is necessary to segment the character from the text to sentences, words etc. Segmentation of words into individual letters has been one of the major problems in handwriting recognition. Despite several successful works all over the work, development of such tools in specific languages is still an ongoing process especially in the Indian context. This work explores the application of ANN as an aid to segmentation of handwritten characters in Assamese- an important language in the North Eastern part of India. The work explores the performance difference obtained in applying an ANN-based dynamic segmentation algorithm compared to projection- based static segmentation. The algorithm involves, first training of an ANN with individual handwritten characters recorded from different individuals. Handwritten sentences are separated out from text using a static segmentation method. From the segmented line, individual characters are separated out by first over segmenting the entire line. Each of the segments thus obtained, next, is fed to the trained ANN. The point of segmentation at which the ANN recognizes a segment or a combination of several segments to be similar to a handwritten character, a segmentation boundary for the character is assumed to exist and segmentation performed. The segmented character is next compared to the best available match and the segmentation boundary confirmed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2009 18:32:08 GMT  (529kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0907v1", "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Volume 5, pp9-16, October 2009"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Volume 5, pp9-16, October 2009", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kaustubh bhattacharyya", "kandarpa kumar sarma"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.0907"}
