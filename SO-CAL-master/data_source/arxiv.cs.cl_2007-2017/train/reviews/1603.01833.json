Building upon previous research, XRAM enhancements include (i) flag-selectable usage markers, (ii) probabilistic mildly context-sensitive POS tagging, filtering, disambiguation and ranking of alternative morphological analyses, (iii) semi-automatic increment of lexical coverage through extraction of lexical and morphological information from existing lexical resources. Testing of XRAM through a front-end Python module showed a remarkable success level.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Mar 2016 14:12:30 GMT  (243kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01833v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["giuliano lancioni", "valeria pettinari", "laura garofalo", "marta campanelli", "ivana pepe", "simona olivieri", "ilaria cicola"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01833"}
