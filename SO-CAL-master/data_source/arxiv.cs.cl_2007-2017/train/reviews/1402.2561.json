However, compared to monolingual computational lexicons like WordNet, bilingual dictionaries typically provide a lower amount of structured information, such as lexical and semantic relations, and often do not cover the entire range of possible translations for a word of interest. In this paper we present Cycles and Quasi-Cycles (CQC), a novel algorithm for the automated disambiguation of ambiguous translations in the lexical entries of a bilingual machine-readable dictionary. The dictionary is represented as a graph, and cyclic patterns are sought in the graph to assign an appropriate sense tag to each translation in a lexical entry. Further, we use the algorithms output to improve the quality of the dictionary itself, by suggesting accurate solutions to structural problems such as misalignments, partial alignments and missing entries. Finally, we successfully apply CQC to the task of synonym extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:08:40 GMT  (774kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2561v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tiziano flati", "roberto navigli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.2561"}
