Recently, neural-network based methods have been proposed for learning this representation from large corpora. This type of word-to-vector embedding is able to keep, in the learned vector space, some of the syntactic and semantic relationships present in the original word corpus. This, in turn, serves to address different types of language classification tasks by doing algebraic operations defined on the vectors. The general practice is to assume that the semantic relationships between the words can be inferred by the application of a-priori specified algebraic operations. Our general goal in this paper is to show that it is possible to learn methods for word composition in semantic spaces. Instead of expressing the compositional method as an algebraic operation, we will encode it as a program, which can be linear, nonlinear, or involve more intricate expressions. More remarkably, this program will be evolved from a set of initial random programs by means of genetic programming (GP). We show that our method is able to reproduce the same behavior as human-designed algebraic operators. Using a word analogy task as benchmark, we also show that GP-generated programs are able to obtain accuracy values above those produced by the commonly used human-designed rule for algebraic manipulation of word vectors. Finally, we show the robustness of our approach by executing the evolved programs on the word2vec GoogleNews vectors, learned over 3 billion running words, and assessing their accuracy in the same word analogy task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Feb 2017 15:29:01 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05624v1", "17 pages, 7 tables, 8 figures.
