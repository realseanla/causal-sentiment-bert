To achieve this, we adapt neural sequence models to map utterances directly to SQL with its full expressivity, bypassing any intermediate meaning representations. These models are immediately deployed online to solicit feedback from real users to flag incorrect queries. Finally, the popularity of SQL facilitates gathering annotations for incorrect predictions using the crowd, which is directly used to improve our models. This complete feedback loop, without intermediate representations or database specific engineering, opens up new ways of building high quality semantic parsers. Experiments suggest that this approach can be deployed quickly for any new target domain, as we show by learning a semantic parser for an online academic database from scratch.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 22:05:06 GMT  (477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08760v1", "Accepted at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["srinivasan iyer", "ioannis konstas", "alvin cheung", "jayant krishnamurthy", "luke zettlemoyer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08760"}
