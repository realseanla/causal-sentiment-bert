Main questions are how to get data and transform them into a good document format. But data can be sensitive to noise oftenly called ambiguities. Ambiguities are aware from a long time, mainly because polysemy is obvious in language and context is required to remove uncertainty. I claim in this paper that syntactic context is not suffisant to improve interpretation. In this paper I try to explain that firstly noise can come from natural data themselves, even involving high technology, secondly texts, seen as verified but meaningless, can spoil content of a corpus; it may lead to contradictions and background noise.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Nov 2013 13:47:21 GMT  (1335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5401v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 17:49:51 GMT  (1796kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5401v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["nicolas turenne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.5401"}
