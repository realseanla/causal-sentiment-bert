{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "13-Jun-2015", "title": "A Bayesian Model for Generative Transition-based Dependency Parsing", "abstract": "We propose a simple, scalable, fully generative model for transition-based dependency parsing with high accuracy. The model, parameterized by Hierarchical Pitman-Yor Processes, overcomes the limitations of previous generative models by allowing fast and accurate inference. We propose an efficient decoding algorithm based on particle filtering that can adapt the beam size to the uncertainty in the model while jointly predicting POS tags and parse trees. The UAS of the parser is on par with that of a greedy discriminative baseline. As a language model, it obtains better perplexity than a n-gram model by performing semi-supervised learning over a large unlabelled corpus. We show that the model is able to generate locally and syntactically coherent sentences, opening the door to further applications in language generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Jun 2015 23:39:09 GMT  (26kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04334v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 28 Jun 2015 21:18:50 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04334v2", "Depling 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jan buys", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04334"}
