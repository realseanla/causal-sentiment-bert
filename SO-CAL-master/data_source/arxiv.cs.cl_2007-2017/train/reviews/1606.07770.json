Recent captioning models are limited in their ability to scale and describe concepts outside of paired image-text corpora. Our model takes advantage of external sources - labeled images from object recognition datasets, and semantic knowledge extracted from unannotated text - and combines them to generate descriptions about novel objects. We propose minimizing a joint objective which can learn from diverse data sources and leverage distributional semantic embeddings, enabling the model to generalize and describe novel objects outside of image-caption datasets. We demonstrate that our model exploits semantic information to generate captions for hundreds of object categories in the ImageNet object recognition dataset that are not observed in image-caption training data, as well as many categories that are observed very rarely.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 17:53:45 GMT  (1873kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07770v1", "9 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 20:54:17 GMT  (8155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07770v2", "16 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables.
