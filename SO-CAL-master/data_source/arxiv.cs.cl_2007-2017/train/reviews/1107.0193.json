In this article we investigate both the locus of ambiguity in the architecture of Language and the origin of ambiguity in natural communication systems. We locate ambiguity at the \\textit{externalization branch} of Language and we study the emergence of ambiguity in communication through the concept of logical irreversibility and within the framework of Shannon's information theory. This leads us to a precise and general expression of the intuition behind Zipf's vocabulary balance in terms of a symmetry equation between the complexities of the coding and the decoding processes that imposes an unavoidable amount of logical uncertainty in natural communication. Accordingly, the emergence of irreversible computations is required if the complexities of the coding and the decoding processes are balanced in a symmetric scenario, which means that the emergence of ambiguous codes is a necessary condition for natural communication to succeed.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 11:01:52 GMT  (632kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0193v1", "43 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Dec 2011 18:24:40 GMT  (633kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0193v2", "41 pages, 4 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 1 Oct 2013 12:45:36 GMT  (416kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0193v3", "28 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "43 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jordi fortuny", "bernat corominas-murtra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0193"}
