Our model first produces (subject, verb) and (verb, object) vector representations based on the similarity of the nouns in the construction to each of the nouns in the vocabulary and the tendency of these nouns to take the subject and object roles of the verb. These vectors are then combined into a final (subject,verb,object) representation through simple vector operations. On two established tasks for the transitive verb construction our model outperforms recent previous work.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 15:10:16 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07756v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lilach edelstein", "roi reichart"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07756"}
