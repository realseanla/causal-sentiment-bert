Using the shortest dependency path between entities as input, the same architecture is used to extract intra-sentence, cross-sentence, and document creation time relations. A \"double-checking\" technique reverses entity pairs in classification, boosting the recall of positive cases and reducing misclassifications between opposite classes. An efficient pruning algorithm resolves conflicts globally. Evaluated on QA-TempEval (SemEval2015 Task 5), our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 00:02:42 GMT  (327kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05851v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 5 Oct 2017 21:38:08 GMT  (298kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05851v2", "EMNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["yuanliang meng", "anna rumshisky", "alexey romanov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.05851"}
