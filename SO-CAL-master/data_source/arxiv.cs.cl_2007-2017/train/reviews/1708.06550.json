By using tools of qualitative analysis as well as review of literature, we managed to verify a set of hypotheses related to the content created by senior tourists when participating in on-line communities. We also produced a codebook, representing various themes one may encounter in such communities. This codebook, derived from our own qualitative research, as well a literature review will serve as a basis for further development of automated tools of knowledge extraction. We also managed to find that older adults more often than other poster in tourists forums, mention their age in discussion, more often share their experiences and motivation to travel, however they do not differ in relation to describing barriers encountered while traveling.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Aug 2017 09:39:29 GMT  (100kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06550v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["bart{\\l}omiej balcerzak", "rados{\\l}aw nielek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06550"}
