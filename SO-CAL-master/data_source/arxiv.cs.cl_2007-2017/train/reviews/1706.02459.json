Although its generated summaries are similar to source texts literally, they have low semantic relevance. In this work, our goal is to improve semantic relevance between source texts and summaries for Chinese social media summarization. We introduce a Semantic Relevance Based neural model to encourage high semantic similarity between texts and summaries. In our model, the source text is represented by a gated attention encoder, while the summary representation is produced by a decoder. Besides, the similarity score between the representations is maximized during training. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms baseline systems on a social media corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 07:05:56 GMT  (167kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02459v1", "Accepted by ACL"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ACL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shuming ma", "xu sun", "jingjing xu", "houfeng wang", "wenjie li", "qi su"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.02459"}
