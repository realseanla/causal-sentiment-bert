Recently, the graph-based models and ranking algorithms have been actively investigated by the extractive document summarization community. While most work to date focuses on homogeneous connecteness of sentences and heterogeneous connecteness of documents and sentences (e.g. sentence similarity weighted by document importance), in this paper we present a novel 3-layered graph model that emphasizes not only sentence and document level relations but also the influence of under sentence level relations (e.g. a part of sentence similarity).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 May 2014 22:21:00 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7975v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["ercan canhasi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7975"}
