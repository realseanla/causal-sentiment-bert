In this paper, we propose an approach to joint POS tagging and dependency parsing using transition-based neural networks. Three neural network based classifiers are designed to resolve shift/reduce, tagging, and labeling conflicts. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms previous methods for joint POS tagging and dependency parsing across a variety of natural languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 10:22:57 GMT  (403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07616v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["liner yang", "meishan zhang", "yang liu", "nan yu", "maosong sun", "guohong fu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07616"}
