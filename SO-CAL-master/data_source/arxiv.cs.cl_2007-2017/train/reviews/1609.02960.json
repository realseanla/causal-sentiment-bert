Some Dialectal Arabic varieties, notably Egyptian Arabic, have received some attention lately and have a growing collection of resources that include annotated corpora and morphological analyzers and taggers. Gulf Arabic, however, lags behind in that respect. In this paper, we present the Gumar Corpus, a large-scale corpus of Gulf Arabic consisting of 110 million words from 1,200 forum novels. We annotate the corpus for sub-dialect information at the document level. We also present results of a preliminary study in the morphological annotation of Gulf Arabic which includes developing guidelines for a conventional orthography. The text of the corpus is publicly browsable through a web interface we developed for it.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 22:22:53 GMT  (449kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02960v1", "Language Resources and Evaluation Conference 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Language Resources and Evaluation Conference 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["salam khalifa", "nizar habash", "dana abdulrahim", "sara hassan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02960"}
