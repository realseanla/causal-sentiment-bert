Transcription was one of four tasks proposed in the MGB challenge, with the aim of advancing the state of the art of automatic speech recognition, speaker diarisation and automatic alignment of subtitles for broadcast media. Four topics are investigated in this work: Data selection techniques for training with unreliable data, automatic speech segmentation of broadcast media shows, acoustic modelling and adaptation in highly variable environments, and language modelling of multi-genre shows. The final system operates in multiple passes, using an initial unadapted decoding stage to refine segmentation, followed by three adapted passes: a hybrid DNN pass with input features normalised by speaker-based cepstral normalisation, another hybrid stage with input features normalised by speaker feature-MLLR transformations, and finally a bottleneck-based tandem stage with noise and speaker factorisation. The combination of these three system outputs provides a final error rate of 27.5% on the official development set, consisting of 47 multi-genre shows.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 14:31:31 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06643v1", "IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2015), 13-17 Dec 2015, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2015), 13-17 Dec 2015, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["oscar saz", "mortaza doulaty", "salil deena", "rosanna milner", "raymond w m ng", "madina hasan", "yulan liu", "thomas hain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06643"}
