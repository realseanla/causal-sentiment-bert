We consider two main approaches: (1) deriving simplification probabilities via an edit model that accounts for a mixture of different operations, and (2) using metadata to focus on edits that are more likely to be simplification operations. We find our methods to outperform a reasonable baseline and yield many high-quality lexical simplifications not included in an independently-created manually prepared list.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Aug 2010 20:01:59 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1008.1986v1", "4 pp; data available atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pp; data available atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mark yatskar", "bo pang", "cristian danescu-niculescu-mizil", "lillian lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1008.1986"}
