POSLDA simultaneously uncovers short-range syntactic patterns (syntax) and long-range semantic patterns (topics) that exist in document collections. This results in word distributions that are specific to both topics (sports, education, ...) and parts-of-speech (nouns, verbs, ...). For example, multinomial distributions over words are uncovered that can be understood as \"nouns about weather\" or \"verbs about law\". We describe the model and an approximate inference algorithm and then demonstrate the quality of the learned topics both qualitatively and quantitatively. Then, we discuss an NLP application where the output of POSLDA can lead to strong improvements in quality: unsupervised part-of-speech tagging. We describe algorithms for this task that make use of POSLDA-learned distributions that result in improved performance beyond the state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Mar 2013 10:20:50 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2826v1", "Currently under review for the journal Computational Linguistics"]], "COMMENTS": "Currently under review for the journal Computational Linguistics", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["william m darling", "fei song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.2826"}
