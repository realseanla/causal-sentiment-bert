Our objective function defines a metric that maximizes the value of the software component quality by minimizing the financial cost and maintenance time. This model should make it possible to classify the components and order them in order to choose the most optimized.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 15:34:28 GMT  (970kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09749v1", "in French"]], "COMMENTS": "in French", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL cs.DB", "authors": ["kouakou ive arsene koffi", "konan marcellin brou", "souleymane oumtanaga"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09749"}
