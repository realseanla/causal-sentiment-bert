Statistical machine translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field. In SMT, translations are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from bilingual data. Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 19:22:49 GMT  (1168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02003v1", "Master Thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "Master Thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["paul baltescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02003"}
