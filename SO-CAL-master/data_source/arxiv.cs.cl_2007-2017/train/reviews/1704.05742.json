However, in most existing approaches, the extracted shared features are prone to be contaminated by task-specific features or the noise brought by other tasks. In this paper, we propose an adversarial multi-task learning framework, alleviating the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with each other. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification tasks, which demonstrates the benefits of our approach. Besides, we show that the shared knowledge learned by our proposed model can be regarded as off-the-shelf knowledge and easily transferred to new tasks. The datasets of all 16 tasks are publicly available at \\url{", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 14:17:25 GMT  (402kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05742v1", "Accepted by ACL2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ACL2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pengfei liu", "xipeng qiu", "xuanjing huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.05742"}
