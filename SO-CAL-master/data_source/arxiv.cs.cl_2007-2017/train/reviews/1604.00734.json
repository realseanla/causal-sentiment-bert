We present a model that uses convolutional neural networks to capture semantic correspondence between a mention's context and a proposed target entity. These convolutional networks operate at multiple granularities to exploit various kinds of topic information, and their rich parameterization gives them the capacity to learn which n-grams characterize different topics. We combine these networks with a sparse linear model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple entity linking datasets, outperforming the prior systems of Durrett and Klein (2014) and Nguyen et al. (2014).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 03:58:31 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00734v1", "Accepted at NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["matthew francis-landau", "greg durrett", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.00734"}
