In the literature, various approaches based on SentiWordNet have been proposed. In this paper, we compare the most often used techniques together with newly proposed ones and incorporate all of them in a learning framework to see whether blending them can further improve the estimation of prior polarity scores. Using two different versions of SentiWordNet and testing regression and classification models across tasks and datasets, our learning approach consistently outperforms the single metrics, providing a new state-of-the-art approach in computing words' prior polarity for sentiment analysis. We conclude our investigation showing interesting biases in calculated prior polarity scores when word Part of Speech and annotator gender are considered.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 15:26:09 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5843v1", "To appear in Proceedings of EMNLP 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of EMNLP 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco guerini", "lorenzo gatti", "marco turchi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1309.5843"}
