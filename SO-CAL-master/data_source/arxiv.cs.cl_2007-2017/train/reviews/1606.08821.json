It is usually challenging due to pronunciation variations. This paper proposes an efficient and robust data-driven technique which automatically learns acceptable word pronunciations and updates the pronunciation dictionary to build a better lexicon without affecting recognition of other words similar to the target word. It generalizes well on datasets with various sizes, and reduces the error rate on a database with 13000+ human names by 42%, compared to a baseline with regular dictionaries already covering canonical pronunciations of 97%+ words in names, plus a well-trained spelling-to-pronunciation (STP) engine.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 18:44:38 GMT  (480kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08821v1", "Interspeech 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Interspeech 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhenhao ge", "aravind ganapathiraju", "ananth n iyer", "scott a randal", "felix i wyss"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08821"}
