Such characteristics were derived through theory, dictionary analyses, and survey research using explicit self-reports. The availability of social media data spanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derive characteristics from language use -- at large scale. Taking advantage of linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of inferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use. We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our language-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it often predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while the factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approach suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday human language use.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 23:13:02 GMT  (4396kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08038v1", "In submission to PLOS One"]], "COMMENTS": "In submission to PLOS One", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vivek kulkarni", "margaret l kern", "david stillwell", "michal kosinski", "sandra matz", "lyle ungar", "steven skiena", "h", "rew schwartz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08038"}
