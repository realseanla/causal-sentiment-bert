The task of author profiling seeks to find the demographics of people solely from their linguistic and content-based features in text. The ability to describe traits of authors clearly has applications in fields such as security and forensics, as well as marketing. Instead of seeing age as just a classification problem, we also frame age as a regression one, but use an ensemble chain method that incorporates the power of both classification and regression to learn the authors exact age.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 06:01:03 GMT  (187kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00852v1", "6 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["joey hong", "chris mattmann", "paul ramirez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00852"}
