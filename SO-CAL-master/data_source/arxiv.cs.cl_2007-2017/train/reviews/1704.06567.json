We propose two novel approaches to combine the outputs of attention mechanisms over each source sequence, flat and hierarchical. We compare the proposed methods with existing techniques and present results of systematic evaluation of those methods on the WMT16 Multimodal Translation and Automatic Post-editing tasks. We show that the proposed methods achieve competitive results on both tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:39:27 GMT  (186kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06567v1", "7 pages; Accepted to ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages; Accepted to ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["jindrich libovick\u00fd", "jindrich helcl"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06567"}
