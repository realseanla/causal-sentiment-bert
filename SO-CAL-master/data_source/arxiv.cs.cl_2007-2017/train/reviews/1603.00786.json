For languages where word boundaries are not readily identified in text, word segmentation is a key first step to generating features for an NER system. While using word boundary tags as features are helpful, the signals that aid in identifying these boundaries may provide richer information for an NER system. New state-of-the-art word segmentation systems use neural models to learn representations for predicting word boundaries. We show that these same representations, jointly trained with an NER system, yield significant improvements in NER for Chinese social media. In our experiments, jointly training NER and word segmentation with an LSTM-CRF model yields nearly 5% absolute improvement over previously published results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 16:41:40 GMT  (18kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00786v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 19:14:40 GMT  (485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00786v2", "This is the camera ready version of our ACL'16 paper.
