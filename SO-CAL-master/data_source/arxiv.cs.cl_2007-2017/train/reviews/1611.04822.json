Accurate document similarity computation improves many enterprise relevant tasks such as document clustering, text mining, and question-answering. Most contemporary techniques employ bag-of-words (BoW) based document representation models. In this paper, we show that a document's thematic flow, which is often disregarded by bag-of-word techniques, is pivotal in estimating their semantic similarity. In this direction, we propose a novel semantic document similarity framework, called SimDoc. We model documents as topic-sequences, where topics represent latent generative clusters of relative words. We then use a sequence alignment algorithm, that has been adapted from the Smith-Waterman gene-sequencing algorithm, to estimate their semantic similarity. For similarity computation at a finer granularity, we tune the alignment algorithm by integrating it with a word embedding matrix based topic-to-topic similarity measure. A document level similarity score is then computed by again using the sequence alignment algorithm over all sentence pairs. In our experiments, we see that SimDoc outperforms many contemporary bag-of-words techniques in accurately computing document similarity, and on practical applications such as document clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 13:31:28 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04822v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gaurav maheshwari", "priyansh trivedi", "harshita sahijwani", "kunal jha", "sourish dasgupta", "jens lehmann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04822"}
