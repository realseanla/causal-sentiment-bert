In this paper, we describe a staged hybrid model combining Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) with highway layers. The highway network module is incorporated in the middle takes the output of the bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN) module in the first stage and provides the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) module in the last stage with the input. The experiment shows that our model outperforms common neural network models (CNN, RNN, Bi-RNN) on a sentiment analysis task. Besides, the analysis of how sequence length influences the RCNN with highway layers shows that our model could learn good representation for the long text.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 11:30:47 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06905v1", "Neu-IR '16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 16:17:05 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06905v2", "Neu-IR '16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval"]], "COMMENTS": "Neu-IR '16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["ying wen", "weinan zhang", "rui luo", "jun wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06905"}
