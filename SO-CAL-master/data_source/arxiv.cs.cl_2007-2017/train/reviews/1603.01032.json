However, not only has this theory led to some exhaustive and meaningful applications in the study of the grammar of immunology language and its changes over time, but it also illustrates the nature of mathematical relations between chunks or subsets of a grammar and the language as a whole. This becomes most clear when dealing with the connection between metalanguage and language, as well as when reflecting on operators.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 09:33:09 GMT  (742kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01032v1", "Keywords: Zellig Sabbetai Harris, Information Structure of Language, Sublanguages of Science, Ideal Numbers, Ernst Kummer, Ideals, Richard Dedekind, Ring Theory, Right Ideals, Emmy Noether, Order Theory, Marshall Harvey Stone"], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 10:52:54 GMT  (742kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01032v2", "Keywords: Zellig Sabbetai Harris, Information Structure of Language, Sublanguages of Science, Ideal Numbers, Ernst Kummer, Ideals, Richard Dedekind, Ring Theory, Right Ideals, Emmy Noether, Order Theory, Marshall Harvey Stone"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: Zellig Sabbetai Harris, Information Structure of Language, Sublanguages of Science, Ideal Numbers, Ernst Kummer, Ideals, Richard Dedekind, Ring Theory, Right Ideals, Emmy Noether, Order Theory, Marshall Harvey Stone", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["javier arias navarro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01032"}
