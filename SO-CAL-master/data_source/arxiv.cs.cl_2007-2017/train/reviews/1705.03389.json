Traditional methods of building a semantic parser rely on high-quality lexicons, hand-crafted grammars and linguistic features which are limited by applied domain or representation. In this paper, we propose a general approach to learn from denotations based on Seq2Seq model augmented with attention mechanism. We encode input sequence into vectors and use dynamic programming to infer candidate logical forms. We utilize the fact that similar utterances should have similar logical forms to help reduce the searching space. Under our learning policy, the Seq2Seq model can learn mappings gradually with noises. Curriculum learning is adopted to make the learning smoother. We test our method on the arithmetic domain which shows our model can successfully infer the correct logical forms and learn the word meanings, compositionality and operation orders simultaneously.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 15:35:25 GMT  (250kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03389v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["liang li", "pengyu li", "yifan liu", "tao wan", "zengchang qin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03389"}
