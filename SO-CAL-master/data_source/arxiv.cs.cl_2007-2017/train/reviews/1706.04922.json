Guided by the intuition that the relational semantics might improve the effectiveness of deep neural approaches, we propose the Deep Semantic Resource Inference Model (DSRIM) that relies on: 1) a representation of raw-data that models the relational semantics of text by jointly considering objects and relations expressed in a knowledge resource, and 2) an end-to-end neural architecture that learns the query-document relevance by leveraging the distributional and relational semantics of documents and queries. The experimental evaluation carried out on two TREC datasets from TREC Terabyte and TREC CDS tracks relying respectively on WordNet and MeSH resources, indicates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art semantic and deep neural IR models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 15:24:32 GMT  (1164kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04922v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 12:32:30 GMT  (1160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04922v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["gia-hung nguyen", "laure soulier", "lynda tamine", "nathalie bricon-souf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04922"}
