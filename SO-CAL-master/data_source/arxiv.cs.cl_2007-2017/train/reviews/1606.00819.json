Evaluation on word similarity and analogy tasks shows that LexVec matches and often outperforms state-of-the-art methods on many of these tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 19:35:46 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00819v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 02:20:23 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00819v2", "Converted paper size from A4 to US Letter to avoid margin issues on arXiv"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexandre salle", "aline villavicencio", "marco idiart"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00819"}
