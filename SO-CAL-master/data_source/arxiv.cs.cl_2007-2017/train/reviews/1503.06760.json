In this paper, we show that embeddings can likewise add value to the problem of unsupervised POS induction. In two representative models of POS induction, we replace multinomial distributions over the vocabulary with multivariate Gaussian distributions over word embeddings and observe consistent improvements in eight languages. We also analyze the effect of various choices while inducing word embeddings on \"downstream\" POS induction results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 18:32:56 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06760v1", "NAACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chu-cheng lin", "waleed ammar", "chris dyer", "lori s levin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.06760"}
