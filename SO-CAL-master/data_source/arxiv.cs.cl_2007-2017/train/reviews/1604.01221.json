Storyline clustering of stories covering the same events is an essential task for inquisitorial media monitoring. We address these two problems jointly by engaging the low-dimensional semantic representation capabilities of the sequence to sequence neural translation models. To enable joint multi-task learning for multilingual neural translation of morphologically rich languages we replace the attention mechanism with the sliding-window mechanism and operate the sequence to sequence neural translation model on the character-level rather than on the word-level. The story segmentation and storyline clustering problem is tackled by examining the low-dimensional vectors produced as a side-product of the neural translation process. The results of this paper describe a novel approach to the automatic story segmentation and storyline clustering problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 11:34:11 GMT  (444kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01221v1", "LREC-2016 submission"]], "COMMENTS": "LREC-2016 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["guntis barzdins", "steve renals", "didzis gosko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01221"}
