This makes it a good candidate for public-health monitoring tasks, specifically for pharmacovigilance. We study the problem of extraction of Adverse-Drug-Reaction (ADR) mentions from social media, particularly from twitter. Medical information extraction from social media is challenging, mainly due to short and highly information nature of text, as compared to more technical and formal medical reports.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 06:42:22 GMT  (1673kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01687v1", "Accepted at DTMBIO workshop, CIKM 2017.
