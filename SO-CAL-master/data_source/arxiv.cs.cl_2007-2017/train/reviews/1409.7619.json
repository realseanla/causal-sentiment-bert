We take a different line of research and present an automated method for generating conceptual metaphors from linguistic data. Given the generated conceptual metaphors, we find corresponding linguistic metaphors in corpora. In this paper, we describe our approach and its evaluation using English and Russian data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 13:54:37 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7619v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ekaterina ovchinnikova", "vladimir zaytsev", "suzanne wertheim", "ross israel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.7619"}
