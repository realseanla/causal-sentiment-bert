We introduce a novel decoding algorithm, called simultaneous greedy decoding, that allows an existing neural machine translation model to begin translating before a full source sentence is received. This approach is unique from previous works on simultaneous translation in that segmentation and translation are done jointly to maximize the translation quality and that translating each segment is strongly conditioned on all the previous segments. This paper presents a first step toward building a full simultaneous translation system based on neural machine translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 03:38:46 GMT  (3608kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02012v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kyunghyun cho", "masha esipova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02012"}
