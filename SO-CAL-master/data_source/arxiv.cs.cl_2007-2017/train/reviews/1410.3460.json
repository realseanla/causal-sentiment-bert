So, it's important to study the public's sentiment and opinion on TCM. The rapid development of online social network, such as twitter, make it convenient and efficient to sample hundreds of millions of people for the aforementioned sentiment study. To the best of our knowledge, the present work is the first attempt that applies sentiment analysis to the domain of TCM on Sina Weibo (a twitter-like microblogging service in China). In our work, firstly we collect tweets topic about TCM from Sina Weibo, and label the tweets as supporting TCM and opposing TCM automatically based on user tag. Then, a support vector machine classifier has been built to predict the sentiment of TCM tweets without labels. Finally, we present a method to adjust the classifier result. The performance of F-measure attained with our method is 97%.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Oct 2014 11:37:37 GMT  (118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3460v1", "7 pages, 8 figures,3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 8 figures,3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["junhui shen", "peiyan zhu", "rui fan", "wei tan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.3460"}
