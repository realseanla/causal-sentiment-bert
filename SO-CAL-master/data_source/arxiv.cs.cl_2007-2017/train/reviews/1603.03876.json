Previous studies exploit discriminative models that are built on either powerful manual features or deep discourse representations. In this paper, instead, we explore generative models and propose a variational neural discourse relation recognizer. We refer to this model as VIRILE. VIRILE establishes a directed probabilistic model with a latent continuous variable that generates both a discourse and the relation between the two arguments of the discourse. In order to perform efficient inference and learning, we introduce a neural discourse relation model to approximate the posterior of the latent variable, and employ this approximated posterior to optimize a reparameterized variational lower bound. This allows VIRILE to be trained with standard stochastic gradient methods. Experiments on the benchmark data set show that VIRILE can achieve competitive results against state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Mar 2016 09:11:30 GMT  (477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03876v1", "7 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 23:33:44 GMT  (452kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03876v2", "10 pages, accepted at emnlp 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["biao zhang", "deyi xiong", "jinsong su", "qun liu", "rongrong ji", "hong duan", "min zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.03876"}
