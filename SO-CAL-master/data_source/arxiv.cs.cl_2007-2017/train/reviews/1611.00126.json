They assume all words within a tweet have the same sentiment polarity as the whole tweet, which ignores the word its own sentiment polarity. To address this problem, we propose to learn sentiment-specific word embedding by exploiting both lexicon resource and distant supervised information. We develop a multi-level sentiment-enriched word embedding learning method, which uses parallel asymmetric neural network to model n-gram, word level sentiment and tweet level sentiment in learning process. Experiments on standard benchmarks show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 04:48:09 GMT  (118kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00126v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shufeng xiong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00126"}
