There are two main modules in our algorithm. Given a natural language question about an image, the first module takes the question as input and then outputs the basic questions of the main question, given question. The second module takes the main question, image and these basic questions as input and then outputs the text-based answer of the main question. We formulate the basic questions generation problem as a LASSO optimization problem, and also propose a criterion about how to exploit these basic questions to help answer main question. Our method is evaluated on the challenging VQA dataset, and yields the competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Mar 2017 19:14:55 GMT  (1013kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06492v1", "Submitted ICCV 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 22:40:19 GMT  (1013kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06492v2", "Accepted by CVPR 2017 VQA Challenge Workshop.
