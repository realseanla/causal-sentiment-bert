The assistant visualizes text fragments and their dependencies by displaying the semantic graph of a sentence, the coreference chain of a paragraph and mined triples that are extracted from a paragraph's semantic graphs and linked using its coreference chain. Using this information and a logic programming library, we create an NLP database which is used by a series of queries to mine the triples. The algorithm is tested by translating a natural language text describing a graph to an actual graph that is shown as an annotation in the text editor.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Sep 2014 02:31:03 GMT  (225kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2073v1", "Bachelor Report"]], "COMMENTS": "Bachelor Report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tobias kortkamp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.2073"}
