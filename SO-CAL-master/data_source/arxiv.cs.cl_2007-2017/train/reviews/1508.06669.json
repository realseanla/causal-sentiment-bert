In this work, we innovatively develop two component-enhanced Chinese character embedding models and their bigram extensions. Distinguished from English word embeddings, our models explore the compositions of Chinese characters, which often serve as semantic indictors inherently. The evaluations on both word similarity and text classification demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 21:25:25 GMT  (150kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06669v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, conference, EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, conference, EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yanran li", "wenjie li", "fei sun", "sujian li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.06669"}
