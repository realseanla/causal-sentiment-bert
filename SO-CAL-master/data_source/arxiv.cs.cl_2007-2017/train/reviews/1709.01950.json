We present a first study in detecting sarcasm in numbers, as in the case of the sentence 'Love waking up at 4 am'. We analyze the challenges of the problem, and present Rule-based, Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to detect sarcasm in numerical portions of text. Our Deep Learning approach outperforms four past works for sarcasm detection and Rule-based and Machine learning approaches on a dataset of tweets, obtaining an F1-score of 0.93. This shows that special attention to text containing numbers may be useful to improve state-of-the-art in sarcasm detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 18:09:15 GMT  (266kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01950v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lakshya kumar", "arpan somani", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01950"}
