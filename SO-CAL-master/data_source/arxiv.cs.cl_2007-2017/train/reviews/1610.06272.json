This paper introduces a novel approach to sentiment analysis that integrates lexicon embeddings and an attention mechanism into Convolutional Neural Networks. Our approach performs separate convolutions for word and lexicon embeddings and provides a global view of the document using attention. Our models are experimented on both the SemEval'16 Task 4 dataset and the Stanford Sentiment Treebank, and show comparative or better results against the existing state-of-the-art systems. Our analysis shows that lexicon embeddings allow to build high-performing models with much smaller word embeddings, and the attention mechanism effectively dims out noisy words for sentiment analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 03:10:57 GMT  (1899kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06272v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Aug 2017 21:21:30 GMT  (2144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06272v2", "In Proceedings of the EMNLP Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis, of WASSA'17, 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bonggun shin", "timothy lee", "jinho d choi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06272"}
