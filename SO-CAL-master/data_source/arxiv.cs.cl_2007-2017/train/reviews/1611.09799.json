{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Nov-2016", "title": "Geometry of Compositionality", "abstract": "This paper proposes a simple test for compositionality (i.e., literal usage) of a word or phrase in a context-specific way. The test is computationally simple, relying on no external resources and only uses a set of trained word vectors. Experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with state of the art and displays high accuracy in context-specific compositionality detection of a variety of natural language phenomena (idiomaticity, sarcasm, metaphor) for different datasets in multiple languages. The key insight is to connect compositionality to a curious geometric property of word embeddings, which is of independent interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 19:23:41 GMT  (1434kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09799v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hongyu gong", "suma bhat", "pramod viswanath"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.09799"}
