We propose the use of Bayesian Optimization to efficiently tune the speed-related decoding parameters by easily incorporating speed as a noisy constraint function. The obtained parameter values are guaranteed to satisfy the speed constraint with an associated confidence margin. Across three language pairs and two speed constraint values, we report overall optimization time reduction compared to grid and random search. We also show that Bayesian Optimization can decouple speed and BLEU measurements, resulting in a further reduction of overall optimization time as speed is measured over a small subset of sentences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Apr 2016 10:27:49 GMT  (273kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05073v1", "To appear at NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniel beck", "adri\u00e0 de gispert", "gonzalo iglesias", "aurelien waite", "bill byrne"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.05073"}
