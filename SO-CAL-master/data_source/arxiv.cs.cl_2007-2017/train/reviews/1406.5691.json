{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Jun-2014", "title": "A CNL for Contract-Oriented Diagrams", "abstract": "We present a first step towards a framework for defining and manipulating normative documents or contracts described as Contract-Oriented (C-O) Diagrams. These diagrams provide a visual representation for such texts, giving the possibility to express a signatory's obligations, permissions and prohibitions, with or without timing constraints, as well as the penalties resulting from the non-fulfilment of a contract. This work presents a CNL for verbalising C-O Diagrams, a web-based tool allowing editing in this CNL, and another for visualising and manipulating the diagrams interactively. We then show how these proof-of-concept tools can be used by applying them to a small example.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 09:41:24 GMT  (1380kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5691v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.FL", "authors": ["john j camilleri", "gabriele paganelli", "gerardo schneider"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.5691"}
