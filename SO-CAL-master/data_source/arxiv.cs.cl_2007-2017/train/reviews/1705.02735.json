Sex trafficking, the dominant form of human trafficking, has seen a significant rise mostly due to the abundance of escort websites, where human traffickers can openly advertise among at-will escort advertisements. In this paper, we take a major step in the automatic detection of advertisements suspected to pertain to human trafficking. We present a novel dataset called Trafficking-10k, with more than 10,000 advertisements annotated for this task. The dataset contains two sources of information per advertisement: text and images. For the accurate detection of trafficking advertisements, we designed and trained a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network (HTDN).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 03:48:01 GMT  (15878kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02735v1", "ACL 2017 Long Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 Long Paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["edmund tong", "amir zadeh", "cara jones", "louis-philippe morency"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02735"}
