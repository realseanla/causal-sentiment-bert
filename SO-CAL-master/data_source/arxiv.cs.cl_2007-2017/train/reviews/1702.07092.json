Patient Safety Event reports are narratives describing potential adverse events to the patients and are important in identifying and preventing medical errors. We present a neural network architecture for identifying the type of safety events which is the first step in understanding these narratives. Our proposed model is based on a soft neural attention model to improve the effectiveness of encoding long sequences. Empirical results on two large-scale real-world datasets of patient safety reports demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with significant improvements over existing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 04:27:49 GMT  (22kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07092v1", "ECIR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ECIR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["arman cohan", "allan fong", "nazli goharian", "raj ratwani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07092"}
