Although considerable work has been done on modeling human language abilities, it has been difficult to bring them together to a comprehensive tabula rasa system. This work presents a cognitive system, entirely based on a large-scale neural architecture, which was developed to shed light on how the procedural knowledge involved in language elaboration arises from neural processes. The main component of this system is the central executive, which is a supervising system that coordinates the other components of the working memory. In our model, the central executive is a neural network that takes as input the neural activation states of the short-term memory and yields as output mental actions, which control the flow of information among the working memory components through neural gating mechanisms. The proposed system is capable of learning to communicate through natural language starting from tabula rasa, without any a priori knowledge of the structure of phrases, meaning of words, role of the different classes of words, only by interacting with a human through a text-based interface, using an open-ended incremental learning process. It is able to learn nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns and other word classes, to use them in sentences and to generalize this knowledge both in receptive and expressive language. The model was validated on a corpus of 1587 input sentences, based on literature on early language assessment, at the level of about 4-years old child, and produced 521 output sentences, expressing a broad range of functionalities that characterize human communication in language elaboration.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 09:25:59 GMT  (2758kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03229v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 16:58:57 GMT  (2762kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03229v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 16:43:59 GMT  (3352kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03229v3", "The source code of the software, the User Guide and the datasets used for its validation are available in the ANNABELL web site atthis https URL"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bruno golosio", "angelo cangelosi", "olesya gamotina", "giovanni luca masala"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03229"}
