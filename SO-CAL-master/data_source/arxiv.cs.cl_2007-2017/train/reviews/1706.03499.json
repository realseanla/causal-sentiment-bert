Our system is based on an attentional sequence-to-sequence neural network model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, with joint training of morphological inflection and the inverse transformation, i.e. lemmatization and morphological analysis. Our system outperforms the baseline with a large margin, and our submission ranks as the 4th best team for the track we participate in (task 1, high-resource).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 08:08:00 GMT  (275kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03499v1", "4 pages, to appear at CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, to appear at CoNLL-SIGMORPHON 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["robert \\\"ostling", "johannes bjerva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03499"}
