{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Mar-2011", "title": "Natural Language Processing (almost) from Scratch", "abstract": "We propose a unified neural network architecture and learning algorithm that can be applied to various natural language processing tasks including: part-of-speech tagging, chunking, named entity recognition, and semantic role labeling. This versatility is achieved by trying to avoid task-specific engineering and therefore disregarding a lot of prior knowledge. Instead of exploiting man-made input features carefully optimized for each task, our system learns internal representations on the basis of vast amounts of mostly unlabeled training data. This work is then used as a basis for building a freely available tagging system with good performance and minimal computational requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Mar 2011 11:34:50 GMT  (338kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0398v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["ronan collobert", "jason weston", "leon bottou", "michael karlen", "koray kavukcuoglu", "pavel kuksa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.0398"}
