Open Information Extraction (Open IE) provides a way to generate semi-structured knowledge for QA, but to date such knowledge has only been used to answer simple questions with retrieval-based methods. We overcome this limitation by presenting a method for reasoning with Open IE knowledge, allowing more complex questions to be handled. Using a recently proposed support graph optimization framework for QA, we develop a new inference model for Open IE, in particular one that can work effectively with multiple short facts, noise, and the relational structure of tuples. Our model significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art structured solver on complex questions of varying difficulty, while also removing the reliance on manually curated knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 01:07:56 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05572v1", "Accepted as short paper at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as short paper at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["tushar khot", "ashish sabharwal", "peter clark"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.05572"}
