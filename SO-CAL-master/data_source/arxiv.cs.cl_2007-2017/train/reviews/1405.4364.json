For this we first define a notion of categorical tfidf which measures the relevance of terms in categories. Using this measure as a weight we calculate a maximal spanning tree of the Wikipedia corpus considered as a directed graph of pages and categories. This tree provides us with a unique path of \"most related categories\" between each page and the top of the hierarchy. We reinforce tfidf of words in a page by aggregating it with categorical tfidfs of the nodes of these paths, and define a thematically reinforced ESA semantic relatedness measure which is more robust than standard ESA and less sensitive to noise caused by out-of-context words. We apply our method to the French Wikipedia corpus, evaluate it through a text classification on a 37.5 MB corpus of 20 French newsgroups and obtain a precision increase of 9-10% compared with standard ESA.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 May 2014 07:58:58 GMT  (155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4364v1", "13 pages, 2 figures, presented at CICLing 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures, presented at CICLing 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yannis haralambous", "vitaly klyuev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4364"}
