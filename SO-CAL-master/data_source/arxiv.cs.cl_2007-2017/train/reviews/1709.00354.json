Here, we propose an end-to-end query-by-example STD model based on an attention-based multi-hop network, whose input is a spoken query and an audio segment containing several utterances; the output states whether the audio segment includes the query. The model can be trained in either a supervised scenario using labeled data, or in an unsupervised fashion. In the supervised scenario, we find that the attention mechanism and multiple hops improve performance, and that the attention weights indicate the time span of the detected terms. In the unsupervised setting, the model mimics the behavior of the existing query-by-example STD system, yielding performance comparable to the existing system but with a lower search time complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 14:56:53 GMT  (2339kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00354v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.MM", "authors": ["chia-wei ao", "hung-yi lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00354"}
