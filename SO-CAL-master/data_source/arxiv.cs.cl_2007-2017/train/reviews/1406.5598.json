The problem of text classification has been widely studied in different communities like natural language processing, data mining and information retrieval. Text classification is an important constituent in many information management tasks like topic identification, spam filtering, email routing, language identification, genre classification, readability assessment etc. The performance of text classification improves notably when phrase patterns are used. The use of phrase patterns helps in capturing non-local behaviours and thus helps in the improvement of text classification task. Phrase structure extraction is the first step to continue with the phrase pattern identification. In this survey, detailed study of phrase structure learning methods have been carried out. This will enable future work in several NLP tasks, which uses syntactic information from phrase structure like grammar checkers, question answering, information extraction, machine translation, text classification. The paper also provides different levels of classification and detailed comparison of the phrase structure learning methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Jun 2014 11:30:05 GMT  (300kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5598v1", "14 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 3, No.2, April 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 3, No.2, April 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["reshma prasad", "mary priya sebastian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.5598"}
