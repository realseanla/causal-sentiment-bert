Based on the sequence to sequence learning, especially the encoder-decoder framework, we propose a two-phase approach, namely initialization then adaptation, to model the responding style of human and then generate personalized responses. For evaluation, we propose a novel human aided method to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generation models by online real-time conversation and offline human judgement. Moreover, the lexical divergence of the responses generated by the 5 personalized models indicates that the proposed two-phase approach achieves good results on modeling the responding style of human and generating personalized responses for the conversational systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 06:42:57 GMT  (367kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02073v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["weinan zhang", "ting liu", "yifa wang", "qingfu zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02073"}
