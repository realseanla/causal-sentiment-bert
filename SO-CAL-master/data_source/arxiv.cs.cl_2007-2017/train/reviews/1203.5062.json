There is a richness to tense in language that is not fully captured by existing temporal annotation schemata. Following Reichenbach we present an analysis of tense in terms of abstract time points, with the aim of supporting automated processing of tense and temporal relations in language. This allows for precise reasoning about tense in documents, and the deduction of temporal relations between the times and verbal events in a discourse. We define the syntax of RTMML, and demonstrate the markup in a range of situations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 18:05:26 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5062v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["leon derczynski", "robert gaizauskas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.5062"}
