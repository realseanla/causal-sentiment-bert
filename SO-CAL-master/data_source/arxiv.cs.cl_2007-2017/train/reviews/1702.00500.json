During training, graph-to-string rules are learned using a heuristic extraction algorithm. At test time, a graph transducer is applied to collapse input AMRs and generate output sentences. Evaluated on SemEval-2016 Task 8, our method gives a BLEU score of 25.62, which is the best reported so far.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 23:36:33 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00500v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 18:22:24 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00500v2", "Also there is a crucial error in section 2.2, 2.3 and 4.1"], ["v3", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 02:39:14 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00500v3", "Accepted by ACL 2017"], ["v4", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 13:37:00 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00500v4", "camera-ready version of ACL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["linfeng song", "xiaochang peng", "yue zhang", "zhiguo wang", "daniel gildea"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.00500"}
