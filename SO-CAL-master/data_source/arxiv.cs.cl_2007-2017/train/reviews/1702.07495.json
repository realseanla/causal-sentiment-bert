VMFMix is analogous to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in that they can capture the co-occurrence patterns acorss multiple documents. The difference is that in VMFMix, the topic-word distribution is defined on a continuous n-dimensional hypersphere. Hence VMFMix is used to derive topic embeddings, i.e., representative vectors, from multiple sets of embedding vectors. An efficient Variational Expectation-Maximization inference algorithm is derived. The performance of VMFMix on two document classification tasks is reported, with some preliminary analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 08:35:10 GMT  (4kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07495v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shaohua li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07495"}
