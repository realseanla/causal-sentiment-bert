{"conference": "HLT-NAACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2014", "title": "Type-Driven Incremental Semantic Parsing with Polymorphism", "abstract": "Semantic parsing is a burgeoning field, but most current semantic parsers are extremely slow (CKY-based) and rather primitive in representation (simply typed lambda calculus). We introduce two new techniques to tackle these problems. First, we design a linear-time, type-driven, incremental parsing algorithm that use type checking to reduce the search space, which is orders of magnitude faster than conventional cubic-time bottom-up semantic parsers, and also eliminates the need for a formal grammar such as CCG. Second, to fully exploit the power of type-driven semantic parsing beyond simple types (such as entities and truth values), we introduce a sophisticated subtype hierarchy and parametric polymorphism to the system, so that the type system is powerful enough to better guide the parsing. Together with max-violation perceptron training, our system learns very accurate parses in GeoQuery, Jobs and Atis domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 21:06:15 GMT  (182kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5379v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 13 Dec 2014 21:35:32 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5379v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 16:41:48 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5379v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kai zhao", "liang huang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.5379"}
