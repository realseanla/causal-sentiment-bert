The technique provides a bird's-eye view of text sources, e.g. text summaries and their source material, and enables users to explore text sources like a geographical map. Word vector representations capture many linguistic properties such as gender, tense, plurality and even semantic concepts like \"capital city of\". Using dimensionality reduction, a 2D map can be computed where semantically similar words are close to each other. The technique uses the word2vec model from the gensim Python library and t-SNE from scikit-learn.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Jul 2016 17:17:22 GMT  (1059kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00534v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hendrik heuer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00534"}
