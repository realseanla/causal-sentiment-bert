As part of our analysis of dialectal terms, we release DAREDS, a dataset for evaluating dialect term detection methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 06:35:55 GMT  (89kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04008v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 00:38:27 GMT  (89kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04008v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 01:18:58 GMT  (707kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04008v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["afshin rahimi", "trevor cohn", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.04008"}
