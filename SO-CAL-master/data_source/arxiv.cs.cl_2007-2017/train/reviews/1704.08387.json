{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Apr-2017", "title": "Learning Structured Natural Language Representations for Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "We introduce a neural semantic parser which is interpretable and scalable. Our model converts natural language utterances to intermediate, domain-general natural language representations in the form of predicate-argument structures, which are induced with a transition system and subsequently mapped to target domains. The semantic parser is trained end-to-end using annotated logical forms or their denotations. We obtain competitive results on various datasets. The induced predicate-argument structures shed light on the types of representations useful for semantic parsing and how these are different from linguistically motivated ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 00:24:20 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08387v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 May 2017 09:57:29 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08387v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 04:18:26 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08387v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jianpeng cheng 0001", "siva reddy", "vijay saraswat", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08387"}
