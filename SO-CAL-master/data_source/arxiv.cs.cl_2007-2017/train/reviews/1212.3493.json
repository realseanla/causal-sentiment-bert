In this work we present a sentence compressions approach guided by level-sentence discourse segmentation and probabilistic language models (LM). The results presented here show that the proposed solution is able to generate coherent summaries with grammatical compressed sentences. The approach is simple enough to be transposed into other languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 14:51:22 GMT  (19kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3493v1", "7 pages, 3 tables"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Dec 2012 13:10:47 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3493v2", "7 pages, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["alejandro molina", "juan-manuel torres-moreno", "iria da cunha", "eric sanjuan", "gerardo sierra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.3493"}
