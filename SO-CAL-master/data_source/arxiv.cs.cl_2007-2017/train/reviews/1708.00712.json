With the recent increase in popularity of neural machine translation (NMT), we explore in this paper to what extent and how NMT can also benefit from data selection. While state-of-the-art data selection (Axelrod et al., 2011) consistently performs well for PBMT, we show that gains are substantially lower for NMT. Next, we introduce dynamic data selection for NMT, a method in which we vary the selected subset of training data between different training epochs. Our experiments show that the best results are achieved when applying a technique we call gradual fine-tuning, with improvements up to +2.6 BLEU over the original data selection approach and up to +3.1 BLEU over a general baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 11:55:57 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00712v1", "Accepted at EMNLP2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EMNLP2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marlies van der wees", "arianna bisazza", "christof monz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.00712"}
