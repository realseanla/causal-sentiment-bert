In order to address semantic modeling of relational patterns, this paper constructs a new dataset that provides multiple similarity ratings for every pair of relational patterns on the existing dataset. In addition, we conduct a comparative study of different encoders including additive composition, RNN, LSTM, and GRU for composing distributed representations of relational patterns. We also present Gated Additive Composition, which is an enhancement of additive composition with the gating mechanism. Experiments show that the new dataset does not only enable detailed analyses of the different encoders, but also provides a gauge to predict successes of distributed representations of relational patterns in the relation classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Jul 2017 08:12:59 GMT  (233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07265v1", "Published as a conference paper at ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Published as a conference paper at ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sho takase", "naoaki okazaki", "kentaro inui"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07265"}
