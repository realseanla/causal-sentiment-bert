We present a sentence-compression-based framework for the task, and design a series of learning-based compression models built on parse trees. An innovative beam search decoder is proposed to efficiently find highly probable compressions. Under this framework, we show how to integrate various indicative metrics such as linguistic motivation and query relevance into the compression process by deriving a novel formulation of a compression scoring function. Our best model achieves statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art systems on several metrics (e.g. 8.0% and 5.4% improvements in ROUGE-2 respectively) for the DUC 2006 and 2007 summarization task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 02:57:04 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07548v1", "ACL 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "hema raghavan", "vittorio castelli", "radu florian", "claire cardie"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.07548"}
