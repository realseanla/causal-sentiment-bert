For Brazilian Portuguese (BP), there are two studies recently concluded that perform SRL in journalistic texts. [1] obtained F1-measure scores of 79.6, using the PropBank.Br corpus, which has syntactic trees manually revised, [8], without using a treebank for training, obtained F1-measure scores of 68.0 for the same corpus. However, the use of manually revised syntactic trees for this task does not represent a real scenario of application. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the performance of SRL on revised and non-revised syntactic trees using a larger and balanced corpus of BP journalistic texts. First, we have shown that [1]'s system also performs better than [8]'s system on the larger corpus. Second, the SRL system trained on non-revised syntactic trees performs better over non-revised trees than a system trained on gold-standard data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 19:02:18 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03016v1", "PROPOR International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese, 2016, 8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "PROPOR International Conference on the Computational Processing of Portuguese, 2016, 8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nathan siegle hartmann", "magali sanches duran", "sandra maria alu\\'isio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03016"}
