We start by comparing two methods of generating such visualizations. First is based on linear principal component analysis (PCA). Second makes use of the modern nonlinear t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding method (t-SNE). We apply both PCA and t-SNE to a corpus of judgments from different courts in Poland. It emerges that t-SNE provides better, more interpretable results than PCA. As a next test, we apply t-SNE to randomly selected sample of common court judgments corresponding to different keywords. We show that t-SNE, in this case, reveals hidden topical structure of the documents related to keyword,,pension\". In conclusion, we find that the t-SNE method could be a promising tool to facilitate the exploitative analysis of legal texts, e.g., by complementing search or browse functionality in legal databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 13:52:40 GMT  (1061kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03421v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 09:05:49 GMT  (1405kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03421v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michal jungiewicz", "micha{\\l} {\\l}opuszy\\'nski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.03421"}
