But due to the omnifariousness of the subjects mentioned in each data item; it is inefficient to run a data mining algorithm on the raw data. This paper discusses an algorithm to accurately classify the entire stream in to a given number of mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive streams upon each of which the data mining algorithm can be run separately yielding more relevant results with a high efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 May 2017 22:16:35 GMT  (113kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09995v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nisansa de silva", "danaja maldeniya", "chamilka wijeratne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09995"}
