Self-training is a semi-supervised technique designed to increase the performance of machine learning algorithms by automatically classifying instances of a task and adding these as additional training material to the same classifier. In the context of language processing tasks, this training material is mostly an (annotated) corpus. Unfortunately self-training does not always lead to a performance increase and whether it will is largely unpredictable. We show that the similarity between corpora can be used to identify those setups for which self-training can be beneficial. We consider this research as a step in the process of developing a classifier that is able to adapt itself to each new test corpus that it is presented with.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 15:55:36 GMT  (394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03288v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vincent van asch", "walter daelemans"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.03288"}
