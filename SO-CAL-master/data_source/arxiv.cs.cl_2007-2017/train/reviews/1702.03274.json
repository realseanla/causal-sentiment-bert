We introduce Hybrid Code Networks (HCNs), which combine an RNN with domain-specific knowledge encoded as software and system action templates. Compared to existing end-to-end approaches, HCNs considerably reduce the amount of training data required, while retaining the key benefit of inferring a latent representation of dialog state. In addition, HCNs can be optimized with supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or a mixture of both. HCNs attain state-of-the-art performance on the bAbI dialog dataset, and outperform two commercially deployed customer-facing dialog systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 18:24:13 GMT  (1499kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03274v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:39:27 GMT  (1500kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03274v2", "Accepted as a long paper for the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["jason d williams", "kavosh asadi", "geoffrey zweig"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.03274"}
