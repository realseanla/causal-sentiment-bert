We address this problem by posing query-relevant summarization as a video frame subset selection problem, which lets us optimise for summaries which are simultaneously diverse, representative of the entire video, and relevant to a text query. We quantify relevance by measuring the distance between frames and queries in a common textual-visual semantic embedding space induced by a neural network. In addition, we extend the model to capture query-independent properties, such as frame quality. We compare our method against previous state of the art on textual-visual embeddings for thumbnail selection and show that our model outperforms them on relevance prediction. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset, annotated with diversity and query-specific relevance labels. On this dataset, we train and test our complete model for video summarization and show that it outperforms standard baselines such as Maximal Marginal Relevance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 16:28:18 GMT  (8913kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00581v1", "Submitted to ACM Multimedia 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 13:18:56 GMT  (3909kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00581v2", "ACM Multimedia 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ACM Multimedia 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.MM", "authors": ["arun balajee vasudevan", "michael gygli", "anna volokitin", "luc van gool"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00581"}
