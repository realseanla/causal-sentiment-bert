However, existing models still have a couple of limitations in interpreting the dimensions of word vector. In this paper, we provide a new approach---roots and affixes model(RAAM)---to interpret it from the intrinsic structures of natural language. Also it can be used as an evaluation measure of the quality of word embedding. We introduce the information entropy into our model and divide the dimensions into two categories, just like roots and affixes in lexical semantics. Then considering each category as a whole rather than individually. We experimented with English Wikipedia corpus. Our result show that there is a negative linear relation between the two attributes and a high positive correlation between our model and downstream semantic evaluation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 08:35:01 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07601v1", "7 pages,3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages,3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kebin peng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07601"}
