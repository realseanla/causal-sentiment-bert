It is an important problem since keywords are the basic elements for representing abstract objects such as documents, user profiles, topics and many things else. Our model is very effective since it combines four important factors in scientific publications: content, publicity, impact and randomness. Particularly, a recommendation system (called SciRecSys) has been presented to support users to efficiently find out relevant articles.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 19:35:24 GMT  (45kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08033v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["vu le anh", "vo hoang hai", "hung nghiep tran", "jason j jung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.08033"}
