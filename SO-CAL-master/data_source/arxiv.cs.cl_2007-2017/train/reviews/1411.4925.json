This solution combines in an innovative way computing with perceptions techniques and strategies for linguistic description of data together with a natural language generation (NLG) system. The application, named GALiWeather, extracts relevant information from weather forecast input data and encodes it into intermediate descriptions using linguistic variables and temporal references. These descriptions are later translated into natural language texts by the natural language generation system. The obtained forecast results have been thoroughly validated by an expert meteorologist from MeteoGalicia using a quality assessment methodology which covers two key dimensions of a text: the accuracy of its content and the correctness of its form. Following this validation GALiWeather will be released as a real service offering custom forecasts for a wide public.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 17:35:59 GMT  (6443kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4925v1", "13 pages, 20 figures, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 20 figures, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["a ramos-soto", "a bugar\\'in", "s barro", "j taboada"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4925"}
