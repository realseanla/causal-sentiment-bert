It is able to find clues of common authorship even when the documents are very short and about disparate topics. While it is easy to make statistically significant predictions regarding authorship, it is difficult to group documents into definite clusters with high accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 05:04:46 GMT  (554kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04485v1", "14 pages, 5 figures; notebook for PAN@CLEF 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 5 figures; notebook for PAN@CLEF 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["douglas bagnall"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04485"}
