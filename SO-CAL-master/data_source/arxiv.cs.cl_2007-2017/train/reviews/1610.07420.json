We are proposing a rich set of rules for better reordering. The idea is to facilitate the training process by better alignments and parallel phrase extraction for a phrase-based SMT system. Reordering also helps the decoding process and hence improving the machine translation quality. We have observed significant improvements in the translation quality by using our approach over the baseline SMT. We have used BLEU, NIST, multi-reference word error rate, multi-reference position independent error rate for judging the improvements. We have exploited open source SMT toolkit MOSES to develop the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 14:08:59 GMT  (25kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07420v1", "8 pages, Published at the Second Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation, ACL 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, Published at the Second Workshop on Hybrid Approaches to Translation, ACL 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["raj nath patel", "rohit gupta", "prakash b pimpale", "sasikumar m"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07420"}
