Recently, research on using NL to support human-robot cooperation (HRC) has received increasing attention in several domains such as robotic daily assistance, robotic health caregiving, intelligent manufacturing, autonomous navigation and robot social accompany. However, a high-level review that can reveal the realization process and the latest methodologies of using NL to facilitate HRC is missing. In this review, a comprehensive summary about the methodology development of natural-language-facilitated human-robot cooperation (NLC) has been made. We first analyzed driving forces for NLC developments. Then, with a temporal realization order, we reviewed three main steps of NLC: human NL understanding, knowledge representation, and knowledge-world mapping. Last, based on our paper review and perspectives, potential research trends in NLC was discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 18:59:04 GMT  (1854kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08756v1", "30 pages, 15 figures, article submitted to Knowledge-based Systems, 2017 Jan"], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 19:20:07 GMT  (1866kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08756v2", "30 pages, 15 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 17 Aug 2017 19:52:20 GMT  (883kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08756v3", "13 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages, 15 figures, article submitted to Knowledge-based Systems, 2017 Jan", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["rui liu", "xiaoli zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08756"}
