This software, the CHAracters and PLaces Interaction Network (CHAPLIN) tool, is implemented in Visual Basic. By means of it, characters and places of a literary work can be extracted from a list of raw words. The software interface helps users to select their names out of this list. Setting some parameters, CHAPLIN creates a network where nodes represent characters/places and edges give their interactions. Nodes and edges are labelled by performances. In this paper, we propose to use CHAPLIN for the analysis a William Shakespeare's play, the famous 'Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'. Performances of characters in the play as a whole and in each act of it are given by graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 12:06:34 GMT  (1168kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07001v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["a c sparavigna", "r marazzato"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07001"}
