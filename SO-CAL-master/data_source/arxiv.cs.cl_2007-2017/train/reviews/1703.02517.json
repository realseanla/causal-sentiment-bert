In this paper, we present a computationally implemented learning theory for one grammatical theory of opacity: a Maximum Entropy version of Stratal OT (Berm\\'udez-Otero 1999, Kiparsky 2000), and test it on simplified versions of opaque French tense-lax vowel alternations and the opaque interaction of diphthong raising and flapping in Canadian English. We find that the difficulty of opacity can be influenced by evidence for stratal affiliation: the Canadian English case is easier if the learner encounters application of raising outside the flapping context, or non-application of raising between words (i.e., &lt;life&gt; with a raised vowel; &lt;lie for&gt; with a non-raised vowel).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 18:35:33 GMT  (828kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02517v1", "23 pages; to appear in Phonology; pre-publication version"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages; to appear in Phonology; pre-publication version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aleksei nazarov", "joe pater"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02517"}
