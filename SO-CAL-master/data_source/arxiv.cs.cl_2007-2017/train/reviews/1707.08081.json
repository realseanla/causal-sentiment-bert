However, many corpora today reflect significant longitudinal collections ranging from 20 years of the Web to hundreds of years of digitized newspapers and books. Understanding the temporal intent of the user and retrieving the most relevant historical content has become a significant challenge. Common search features, such as query expansion, leverage the relationship between terms but cannot function well across all times when relationships vary temporally. In this work, we introduce a temporal relationship model that is extracted from longitudinal data collections. The model supports the task of identifying, given two words, when they relate to each other. We present an algorithmic framework for this task and show its application for the task of query expansion, achieving high gain.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 16:41:49 GMT  (1050kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08081v1", "11 pages, EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Sun, 30 Jul 2017 17:03:35 GMT  (1021kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08081v2", "11 pages, EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["guy d rosin", "eytan adar", "kira radinsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.08081"}
