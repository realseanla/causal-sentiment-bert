The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for existing dialogue systems. We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. To model both structured knowledge and unstructured language, we propose a neural model with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that evolve as the dialogue progresses. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective at achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 10:38:24 GMT  (1204kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07130v1", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["he he", "anusha balakrishnan", "mihail eric", "percy liang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07130"}
