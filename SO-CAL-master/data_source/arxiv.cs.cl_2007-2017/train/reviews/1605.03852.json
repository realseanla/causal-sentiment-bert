The curricula are modeled by a linear ranking function which is the scalar product of a learned weight vector and an engineered feature vector that characterizes the different aspects of the complexity of each instance in the training corpus. We show that learning the curriculum improves performance on a variety of downstream tasks over random orders and in comparison to the natural corpus order.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 15:15:58 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03852v1", "ACL 2016 submission, 10 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 18:35:29 GMT  (124kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03852v2", "In proceedings of ACL 2016, 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2016 submission, 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yulia tsvetkov", "manaal faruqui", "wang ling", "brian macwhinney", "chris dyer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.03852"}
