For sets of search terms the NWD gives a similarity on a scale from 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different). The NWD approximates the similarity according to all (upper semi)computable properties. We develop the theory and give applications. The derivation of the NWD method is based on Kolmogorov complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Feb 2015 17:55:58 GMT  (205kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05957v1", "LaTeX 25 pages, 3 tables.
