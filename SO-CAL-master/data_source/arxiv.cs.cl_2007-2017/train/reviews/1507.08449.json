We test the approach on the Universal Dependency Treebanks, training with MaltParser and MaltOptimizer.The results show that these bilingual parsers are more than competitive, as some combinations not only preserve the performance, but even achieve significant improvements over the corresponding monolingual parsers. Preliminary experiments also show the approach to be promising on texts with code-switching.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jul 2015 10:53:11 GMT  (90kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08449v1", "6 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Thu, 19 May 2016 14:57:45 GMT  (112kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08449v2", "7 pages, 4 tables, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["david vilares", "carlos g\u00f3mez-rodr\u00edguez", "miguel a alonso"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.08449"}
