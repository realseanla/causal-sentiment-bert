By marginalizing over word alignments the model captures a larger semantic context than prior work relying on hard alignments. The advantage of this approach is demonstrated in a cross-lingual classification task, where we outperform the prior published state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 16:24:09 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0947v1", "Proceedings of ACL 2014 (Short Papers)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of ACL 2014 (Short Papers)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tom\u00e1s kocisk\u00fd", "karl moritz hermann", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.0947"}
