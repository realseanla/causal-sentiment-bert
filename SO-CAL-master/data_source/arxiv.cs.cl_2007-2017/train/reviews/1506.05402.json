The goals of the workshop were to answer questions like: How can we enhance author network analysis and Bibliometrics using data obtained by text analytics? What insights can NLP provide on the structure of scientific writing, on citation networks, and on in-text citation analysis? This workshop is the first step to foster the reflection on the interdisciplinarity and the benefits that the two disciplines Bibliometrics and Natural Language Processing can drive from it.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 18:03:25 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05402v1", "4 pages, Workshop on Mining Scientific Papers: Computational Linguistics and Bibliometrics at ISSI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, Workshop on Mining Scientific Papers: Computational Linguistics and Bibliometrics at ISSI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR", "authors": ["iana atanassova", "marc bertin", "philipp mayr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05402"}
