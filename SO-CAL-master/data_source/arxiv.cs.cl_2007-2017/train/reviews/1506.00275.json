Our approach works by creating multiple spectral models where noise is added to the underlying features in the training set before the estimation of each model. We describe three ways to decode with multiple models. In addition, we describe a simple variant of the spectral algorithm for L-PCFGs that is fast and leads to compact models. Our experiments for natural language parsing, for English and German, show that we get a significant improvement over baselines comparable to state of the art. For English, we achieve the $F_1$ score of 90.18, and for German we achieve the $F_1$ score of 83.38.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 May 2015 19:21:26 GMT  (57kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00275v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 15 Aug 2015 12:02:57 GMT  (95kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00275v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shashi narayan", "shay b cohen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.00275"}
