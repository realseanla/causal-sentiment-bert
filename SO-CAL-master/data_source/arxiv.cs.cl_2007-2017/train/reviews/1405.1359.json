Whether counting how frequently nouns and verbs combine in Google search queries, or extracting eigenvectors from matrices made up of Wikipedia lines and Shakespeare plots, these latent semantics approximate the associative links that form concepts. However, cognition is fundamentally intertwined with action; even passively reading verbs has been shown to activate the same motor circuits as when we tap a finger or observe actual movements. If languages evolved by adapting to the brain, sensorimotor constraints linking articulatory gestures with aspects of motion might also be reflected in the statistics of word co-occurrences. To probe this hypothesis 3 x 20 emotion, face, and hand related verbs known to activate premotor areas in the brain were selected, and latent semantic analysis LSA was applied to create a weighted adjacency matrix. Transforming the verbs into their constituent phonemes, the corresponding consonant vowel transitions can be represented in an articulatory space defined by tongue height and formant frequencies. Here the vowels appear positioned along a front to back continuum reflecting aspects of size and intensity related to the actions described by the verbs. More forceful verbs combine plosives and sonorants with fricatives characterized by sustained turbulent airflows, while positive and negative emotional expressions tend to incorporate up- or downwards shifts in formant frequencies. Suggesting, that articulatory gestures reflect parameters of size and intensity which might be retrieved from the latent semantics of action verbs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 May 2014 16:52:34 GMT  (289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1359v1", "16 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 31 Aug 2014 14:21:10 GMT  (747kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1359v2", "15 pages"], ["v3", "Sat, 29 Nov 2014 21:14:29 GMT  (744kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1359v3", "15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michael kai petersen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1359"}
