However, some recorded events may correspond to activities on a very low level of abstraction. When events are recorded on a too low level of granularity, process discovery methods tend to generate overgeneralizing process models. Grouping low-level events to higher level activities, i.e., event abstraction, can be used to discover better process models. Existing event abstraction methods are mainly based on common sub-sequences and clustering techniques. In this paper, we propose to first discover local process models and then use those models to lift the event log to a higher level of abstraction. Our conjecture is that process models discovered on the obtained high-level event log return process models of higher quality: their fitness and precision scores are more balanced. We show this with preliminary results on several real-life event logs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 20:08:14 GMT  (481kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03520v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 16 May 2017 16:48:18 GMT  (613kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03520v2", "Accepted at Enabling Business Transformation by Business Process Modeling, Development, and Support Working Conference 2017 (BPMDS)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["felix mannhardt", "niek tax"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03520"}
