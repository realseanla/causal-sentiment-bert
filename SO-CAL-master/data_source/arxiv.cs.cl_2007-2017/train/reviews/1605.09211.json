The detector banks are trained to detect a total of 9,918 sentiment-biased visual concepts from six major languages: English, Spanish, Italian, French, German and Chinese. In the original MVSO release, adjective-noun pair (ANP) detectors were trained for the six languages using an AlexNet-styled architecture by fine-tuning from DeepSentiBank. Here, through a more extensive set of experiments, parameter tuning, and training runs, we detail and release higher accuracy models for detecting ANPs across six languages from the same image pool and setting as in the original release using a more modern architecture, GoogLeNet, providing comparable or better performance with reduced network parameter cost.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 12:57:44 GMT  (694kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09211v1", "technical report, 7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "technical report, 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["brendan jou", "shih-fu chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09211"}
