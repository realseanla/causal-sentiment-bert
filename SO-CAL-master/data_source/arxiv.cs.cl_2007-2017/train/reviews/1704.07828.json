Because ideas are naturally embedded in texts, we propose the first framework to systematically characterize the relations between ideas based on their occurrence in a corpus of documents, independent of how these ideas are represented. Combining two statistics --- cooccurrence within documents and prevalence correlation over time --- our approach reveals a number of different ways in which ideas can cooperate and compete. For instance, two ideas can closely track each other's prevalence over time, and yet rarely cooccur, almost like a \"cold war\" scenario. We observe that pairwise cooccurrence and prevalence correlation exhibit different distributions. We further demonstrate that our approach is able to uncover intriguing relations between ideas through in-depth case studies on news articles and research papers.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 18:00:01 GMT  (1005kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07828v1", "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, code and data available atthis https URL"], ["v2", "Sun, 16 Jul 2017 16:34:49 GMT  (1005kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07828v2", "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, code and data available atthis https URL(fixed a typo)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, code and data available atthis https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL physics.soc-ph", "authors": ["chenhao tan", "dallas card", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07828"}
