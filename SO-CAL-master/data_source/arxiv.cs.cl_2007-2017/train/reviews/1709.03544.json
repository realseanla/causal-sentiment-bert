A novel modular framework divides the knowledge into four categories according to the depth of knowledge they convey. Each category consists of a set of features automatically generated from different information sources (such as a knowledge-base, a list of names or document-specific semantic annotations) and is used to train a conditional random field (CRF). Since those information sources are usually multilingual, KnowNER can be easily trained for a wide range of languages. In this paper, we show that the incorporation of deeper knowledge systematically boosts accuracy and compare KnowNER with state-of-the-art NER approaches across three languages (i.e., English, German and Spanish) performing amongst state-of-the art systems in all of them.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 18:54:15 GMT  (929kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03544v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dominic seyler", "tatiana dembelova", "luciano del corro", "johannes hoffart", "gerhard weikum"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03544"}
