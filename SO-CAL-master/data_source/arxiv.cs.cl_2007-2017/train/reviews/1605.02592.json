This paper describes improvements made to the GLEU metric that address problems that arise when using an increasing number of reference sets. Unlike the originally presented metric, the modified metric does not require tuning. We recommend that this version be used instead of the original version.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 May 2016 14:05:57 GMT  (13kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02592v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["courtney napoles", "keisuke sakaguchi", "matt post", "joel tetreault"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02592"}
