A significant number of neural architectures for this task (neural readers) have recently been developed and evaluated on large cloze-style datasets. We present experiments supporting the existence of logical structure in the hidden state vectors of \"aggregation readers\" such as the Attentive Reader and Stanford Reader. The logical structure of aggregation readers reflects the architecture of \"explicit reference readers\" such as the Attention-Sum Reader, the Gated Attention Reader and the Attention-over-Attention Reader. This relationship between aggregation readers and explicit reference readers presents a case study in emergent logical structure. In an independent contribution, we show that the addition of linguistics features to the input to existing neural readers significantly boosts performance yielding the best results to date on the Who-did-What datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:51:34 GMT  (1229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07954v1", "ICLR 2017 submission"], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 01:32:26 GMT  (879kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07954v2", "Accepted for Repl4NLP: 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2017 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hai wang", "takeshi onishi", "kevin gimpel", "david mcallester"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07954"}
