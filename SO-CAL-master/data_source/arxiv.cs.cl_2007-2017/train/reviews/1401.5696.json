This paper investigates synonym resolution in the context of unsupervised information extraction, where neither hand-tagged training examples nor domain knowledge is available. The paper presents a scalable, fully-implemented system that runs in O(KN log N) time in the number of extractions, N, and the maximum number of synonyms per word, K. The system, called Resolver, introduces a probabilistic relational model for predicting whether two strings are co-referential based on the similarity of the assertions containing them. On a set of two million assertions extracted from the Web, Resolver resolves objects with 78% precision and 68% recall, and resolves relations with 90% precision and 35% recall. Several variations of resolvers probabilistic model are explored, and experiments demonstrate that under appropriate conditions these variations can improve F1 by 5%. An extension to the basic Resolver system allows it to handle polysemous names with 97% precision and 95% recall on a data set from the TREC corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:33:07 GMT  (448kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5696v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexander pieter yates", "oren etzioni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5696"}
