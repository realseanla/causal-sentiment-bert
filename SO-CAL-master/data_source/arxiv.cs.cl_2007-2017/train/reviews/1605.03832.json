We apply these to the problem of modeling phone sequences---a domain in which universal symbol inventories and cross-linguistically shared feature representations are a natural fit. Intrinsic evaluation on held-out perplexity, qualitative analysis of the learned representations, and extrinsic evaluation in two downstream applications that make use of phonetic features show (i) that polyglot models better generalize to held-out data than comparable monolingual models and (ii) that polyglot phonetic feature representations are of higher quality than those learned monolingually.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 14:37:51 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03832v1", "Proceedings of NAACL 2016; 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of NAACL 2016; 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yulia tsvetkov", "sunayana sitaram", "manaal faruqui", "guillaume lample", "patrick littell", "david r mortensen", "alan w black", "lori s levin", "chris dyer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.03832"}
