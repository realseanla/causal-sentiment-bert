On the limits of algorithmic approaches to syntactic semantic structure", "abstract": "In computer science, divide and conquer (D&amp;C) is an algorithm design paradigm based on multi-branched recursion. A D&amp;C algorithm works by recursively and monotonically breaking down a problem into sub problems of the same (or a related) type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem. The present work identifies D&amp;C algorithms assumed within contemporary syntactic theory, and discusses the limits of their applicability in the realms of the syntax semantics and syntax morphophonology interfaces. We will propose that D&amp;C algorithms, while valid for some processes, fall short on flexibility given a mixed approach to the structure of linguistic phrase markers. Arguments in favour of a computationally mixed approach to linguistic structure will be presented as an alternative that offers advantages to uniform D&amp;C approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Sep 2016 10:20:48 GMT  (810kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03148v1", "Ms. 36 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Ms. 36 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.FL", "authors": ["diego gabriel krivochen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03148"}
