However, little is known about what these models learn about source and target languages during the training process. In this work, we analyze the representations learned by neural MT models at various levels of granularity and empirically evaluate the quality of the representations for learning morphology through extrinsic part-of-speech and morphological tagging tasks. We conduct a thorough investigation along several parameters: word-based vs. character-based representations, depth of the encoding layer, the identity of the target language, and encoder vs. decoder representations. Our data-driven, quantitative evaluation sheds light on important aspects in the neural MT system and its ability to capture word structure.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 18:01:07 GMT  (3628kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03471v1", "Accepted to ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 15 May 2017 13:38:20 GMT  (1418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03471v2", "ACL 2017 camera-ready"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yonatan belinkov", "nadir durrani", "fahim dalvi", "hassan sajjad", "james r glass"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.03471"}
