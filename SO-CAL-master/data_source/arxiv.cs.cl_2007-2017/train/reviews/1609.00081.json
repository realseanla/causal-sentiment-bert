Here, we posit that measuring the intensity of a reference is crucial not only to perceive better understanding of research endeavor, but also to improve the quality of citation-based applications. To this end, we collect a rich annotated dataset with references labeled by the intensity, and propose a novel graph-based semi-supervised model, GraLap to label the intensity of references. Experiments with AAN datasets show a significant improvement compared to the baselines to achieve the true labels of the references (46% better correlation). Finally, we provide four applications to demonstrate how the knowledge of reference intensity leads to design better real-world applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 01:34:56 GMT  (263kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00081v1", "11 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables, Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["tanmoy chakraborty 0002", "ramasuri narayanam"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.00081"}
