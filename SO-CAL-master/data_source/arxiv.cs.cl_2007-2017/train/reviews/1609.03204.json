Our goal is to investigate the similarities and differences between non-native language productions and translations, contrasting both with native language. Using a collection of computational methods we establish three main results: (1) the three types of texts are easily distinguishable; (2) non-native language and translations are closer to each other than each of them is to native language; and (3) some of these characteristics depend on the source or native language, while others do not, reflecting, perhaps, unified principles that similarly affect translations and non-native language.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Sep 2016 19:51:46 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03204v1", "ACL2016, 12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL2016, 12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ella rabinovich", "sergiu nisioi", "noam ordan", "shuly wintner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.03204"}
