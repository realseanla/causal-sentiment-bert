We demonstrate that a better approach is to utilize POS tags as a regularizer of learned representations. We propose a simple method for learning a stacked pipeline of models which we call \"stack-propagation\". We apply this to dependency parsing and tagging, where we use the hidden layer of the tagger network as a representation of the input tokens for the parser. At test time, our parser does not require predicted POS tags. On 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies, our method is 1.3% (absolute) more accurate than a state-of-the-art graph-based approach and 2.7% more accurate than the most comparable greedy model.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 20:12:44 GMT  (709kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06598v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 01:39:25 GMT  (729kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06598v2", "10 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yuan zhang", "david weiss"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06598"}
