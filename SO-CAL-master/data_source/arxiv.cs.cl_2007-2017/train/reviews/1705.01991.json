Here, we focus on efficient decoding, with a goal of achieving accuracy close the state-of-the-art in neural machine translation (NMT), while achieving CPU decoding speed/throughput close to that of a phrasal decoder.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 May 2017 19:50:35 GMT  (137kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01991v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jacob devlin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.01991"}
