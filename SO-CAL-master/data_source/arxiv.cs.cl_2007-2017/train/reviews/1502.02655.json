Results from several complexity types are presented, including lexical diversity, density, readability and syntactic complexity. The language of WoW texts is found to be comparable to the general corpus on some complexity measures, yet more specialized on other measures. Our findings can be used by educators willing to include game-related activities into school curricula.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Feb 2015 21:59:21 GMT  (335kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02655v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["simon \\v{s}uster"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02655"}
