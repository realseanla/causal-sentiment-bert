Since existing attentive models exert attention on the sequential structure, we propose a way to incorporate attention into the tree topology. Specially, given a pair of sentences, our attentive encoder uses the representation of one sentence, which generated via an RNN, to guide the structural encoding of the other sentence on the dependency parse tree. We evaluate the proposed attentive encoder on three tasks: semantic similarity, paraphrase identification and true-false question selection. Experimental results show that our encoder outperforms all baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on two tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 08:52:36 GMT  (375kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02806v1", "10 pages, 3 figures, COLING2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 3 figures, COLING2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yao zhou", "cong liu", "yan pan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02806"}
