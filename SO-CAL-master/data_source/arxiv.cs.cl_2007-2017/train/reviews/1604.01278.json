The first extension com-bines the smatch scoring script with the C6.0 rule-based classifier to produce a human-readable report on the error patterns frequency observed in the scored AMR graphs. This first extension results in 4% gain over the state-of-art CAMR baseline parser by adding to it a manually crafted wrapper fixing the identified CAMR parser errors. The second extension combines a per-sentence smatch with an en-semble method for selecting the best AMR graph among the set of AMR graphs for the same sentence. This second modification au-tomatically yields further 0.4% gain when ap-plied to outputs of two nondeterministic AMR parsers: a CAMR+wrapper parser and a novel character-level neural translation AMR parser. For AMR parsing task the character-level neural translation attains surprising 7% gain over the carefully optimized word-level neural translation. Overall, we achieve smatch F1=62% on the SemEval-2016 official scor-ing set and F1=67% on the LDC2015E86 test set.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 14:46:18 GMT  (610kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01278v1", "NAACL HLT 2016, SemEval-2016 Task 8 submission"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL HLT 2016, SemEval-2016 Task 8 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["guntis barzdins", "didzis gosko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01278"}
