{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Aug-2016", "title": "SimVerb-3500: A Large-Scale Evaluation Set of Verb Similarity", "abstract": "Verbs play a critical role in the meaning of sentences, but these ubiquitous words have received little attention in recent distributional semantics research. We introduce SimVerb-3500, an evaluation resource that provides human ratings for the similarity of 3,500 verb pairs. SimVerb-3500 covers all normed verb types from the USF free-association database, providing at least three examples for every VerbNet class. This broad coverage facilitates detailed analyses of how syntactic and semantic phenomena together influence human understanding of verb meaning. Further, with significantly larger development and test sets than existing benchmarks, SimVerb-3500 enables more robust evaluation of representation learning architectures and promotes the development of methods tailored to verbs. We hope that SimVerb-3500 will enable a richer understanding of the diversity and complexity of verb semantics and guide the development of systems that can effectively represent and interpret this meaning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 15:35:12 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00869v1", "EMNLP 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 15:39:53 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00869v2", "EMNLP 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 06:20:24 GMT  (382kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00869v3", "EMNLP 2016"], ["v4", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 14:35:14 GMT  (378kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00869v4", "EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniela gerz", "ivan vulic", "felix hill", "roi reichart", "anna korhonen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.00869"}
