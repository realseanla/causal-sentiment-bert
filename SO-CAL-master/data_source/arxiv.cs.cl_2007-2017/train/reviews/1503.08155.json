We propose IIKE (Imperfect and Incomplete Knowledge Embedding), a probabilistic model which measures the probability of each belief, i.e. $\\langle h,r,t\\rangle$, in large-scale knowledge bases such as NELL and Freebase, and our objective is to learn a better low-dimensional vector representation for each entity ($h$ and $t$) and relation ($r$) in the process of minimizing the loss of fitting the corresponding confidence given by machine learning (NELL) or crowdsouring (Freebase), so that we can use $||{\\bf h} + {\\bf r} - {\\bf t}||$ to assess the plausibility of a belief when conducting inference. We use subsets of those inexact knowledge bases to train our model and test the performances of link prediction and triplet classification on ground truth beliefs, respectively. The results of extensive experiments show that IIKE achieves significant improvement compared with the baseline and state-of-the-art approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 17:13:03 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08155v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["miao fan", "qiang zhou", "thomas fang zheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.08155"}
