This generalisation process is done via the grounding process: different objects are being interacted, and associated, with different motor behaviours, following a learning approach inspired by developmental language acquisition in infants. This cognitive model is based on Multiple Time-scale Recurrent Neural Networks (MTRNN).With the data obtained from object manipulation tasks with a humanoid robot platform, the robotic agent implemented with this model can ground the primitive embodied structure of verbs through training with verb-noun combination samples. Moreover, we show that a functional hierarchical architecture, based on MTRNN, is able to generalise and produce novel combinations of noun-verb sentences. Further analyses of the learned network dynamics and representations also demonstrate how the generalisation is possible via the exploitation of this functional hierarchical recurrent network.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 02:31:21 GMT  (1672kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03261v1", "Submitted to Autonomous Robots"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Autonomous Robots", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CL", "authors": ["junpei zhong", "martin peniak", "jun tani", "tetsuya ogata", "angelo cangelosi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.03261"}
