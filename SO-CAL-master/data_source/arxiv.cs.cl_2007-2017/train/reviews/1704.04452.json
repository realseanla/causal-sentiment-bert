Therefore, we study a variant of multi-document summarization that produces summaries in the form of concept maps. However, suitable evaluation datasets for this task are currently missing. To close this gap, we present a newly created corpus of concept maps that summarize heterogeneous collections of web documents on educational topics. It was created using a novel crowdsourcing approach that allows us to efficiently determine important elements in large document collections. We release the corpus along with a baseline system and proposed evaluation protocol to enable further research on this variant of summarization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:23:45 GMT  (33kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04452v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 13:44:37 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04452v2", "Published at EMNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tobias falke", "iryna gurevych"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.04452"}
