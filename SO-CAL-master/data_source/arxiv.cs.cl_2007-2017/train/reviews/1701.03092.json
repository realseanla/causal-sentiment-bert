We identify people's job category based on their tweets. As a preliminary work, we limited our task to identify only IT workers from other job holders. We have used and compared both simple bag of words model and a document representation based on Skip-gram model. Our results show that the model based on Skip-gram, achieves a 76\\% precision and 82\\% recall.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 18:42:09 GMT  (33kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03092v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["besat kassaie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.03092"}
