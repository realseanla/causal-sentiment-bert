With the arrival of the computer, it became possible to offer language learners different types of language activities such as comprehension tasks, simulations, etc. However, these have limits that cannot be overcome without some contribution from the field of natural language processing (NLP). In what follows, we examine the challenges faced and the issues raised by integrating NLP into CALL. We hope to demonstrate that the key to success in integrating NLP into CALL is to be found in multidisciplinary work between computer experts, linguists, language teachers, didacticians and NLP specialists.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 05:47:44 GMT  (241kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4814v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["georges antoniadis", "sylviane granger", "olivier kraif", "claude ponton", "virginie zampa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4814"}
