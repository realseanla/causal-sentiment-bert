Existing natural language processing techniques are either based on words as units or use units such as grams only for basic classification tasks. How close can a machine come to reasoning about the meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without using any lexicon, based only on grams?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:19:58 GMT  (441kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3228v1", "5 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["peiyou song", "anhei shu", "david phipps", "dan wallach", "mohit tiwari", "jedidiah crandall", "george luger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.3228"}
