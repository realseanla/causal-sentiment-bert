We are using deep convolutional neural networks to represent complex features. We train the network on a dataset providing a broad categorization of health information. Through a detailed evaluation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms several approaches widely used in natural language processing tasks by about 15%.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 19:39:32 GMT  (481kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06841v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mark hughes", "irene li", "spyros kotoulas", "toyotaro suzumura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.06841"}
