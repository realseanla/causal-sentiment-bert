Different architectures are explored for integrating participant role and context information into a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) language model. The conversational model can function as a language model or a language generation model. Experiments on the Ubuntu Dialog Corpus show that our model can capture multiple turn interaction between participants. The proposed method outperforms a traditional LSTM model as measured by language model perplexity and response ranking. Generated responses show characteristic differences between the two participant roles.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 05:14:10 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09457v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yi luan", "yangfeng ji", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09457"}
