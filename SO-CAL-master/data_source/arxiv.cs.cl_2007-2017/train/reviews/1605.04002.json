In particular we focus on situations where the rule that must be learned concerns two components of a stimulus being identical. We call such a basis for discrimination an identity-based rule. Identity-based rules have proven to be difficult or impossible for certain types of learning algorithms to acquire from limited datasets. This is in contrast to human behaviour on similar tasks. Here we provide a framework for rigorously establishing which learning algorithms will fail at generalizing identity-based rules to novel stimuli. We use this framework to show that such algorithms are unable to generalize identity-based rules to novel inputs unless trained on virtually all possible inputs. We demonstrate these results computationally with a multilayer feedforward neural network.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 22:42:48 GMT  (164kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04002v1", "6 pages, accepted abstract at COGSCI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, accepted abstract at COGSCI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["paul tupper", "bobak shahriari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04002"}
