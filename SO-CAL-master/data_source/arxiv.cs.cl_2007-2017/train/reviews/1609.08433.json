However, PLDA training requires a large amount of labeled development data, which is highly expensive in most cases. A possible approach to mitigate the problem is various unsupervised adaptation methods, which use unlabeled data to adapt the PLDA scattering matrices to the target domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 13:37:13 GMT  (757kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08433v1", "O-COCOSDA 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "O-COCOSDA 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["chenghui zhao", "lantian li", "dong wang", "april pu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08433"}
