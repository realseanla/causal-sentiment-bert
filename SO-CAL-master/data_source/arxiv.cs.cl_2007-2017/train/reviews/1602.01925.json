Our estimation methods, multiCluster and multiCCA, use dictionaries and monolingual data; they do not require parallel data. Our new evaluation method, multiQVEC+, is shown to correlate better than previous ones with two downstream tasks (text categorization and parsing). On this evaluation and others, our estimation methods outperform existing ones. We also describe a web portal for evaluation that will facilitate further research in this area, along with open-source releases of all our methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 04:26:38 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01925v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 21 May 2016 08:08:21 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01925v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["waleed ammar", "george mulcaire", "yulia tsvetkov", "guillaume lample", "chris dyer", "noah a smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01925"}
