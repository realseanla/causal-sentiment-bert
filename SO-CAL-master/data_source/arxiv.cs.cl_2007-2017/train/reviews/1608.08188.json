However, close examination of the VQA problem reveals an unavoidable, entangled problem that multiple humans may or may not always agree on a single answer to a visual question. We train a model to automatically predict from a visual question whether a crowd would agree on a single answer. We then propose how to exploit this system in a novel application to efficiently allocate human effort to collect answers to visual questions. Specifically, we propose a crowdsourcing system that automatically solicits fewer human responses when answer agreement is expected and more human responses when answer disagreement is expected. Our system improves upon existing crowdsourcing systems, typically eliminating at least 20% of human effort with no loss to the information collected from the crowd.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 19:24:25 GMT  (5041kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08188v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.HC", "authors": ["danna gurari", "kristen grauman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08188"}
