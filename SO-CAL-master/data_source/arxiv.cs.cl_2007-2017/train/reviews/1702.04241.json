Now a day,in different communication mediums like internet, mobile services etc. people use few words, which are slang in nature. This approach detects those abusive words using supervised learning procedure. But in the real life scenario, the slang words are not used in complete word forms always. Most of the times, those words are used in different abbreviated forms like sounds alike forms, taboo morphemes etc. This proposed approach can detect those abbreviated forms also using semi supervised learning procedure. Using the synset and concept analysis of the text, the probability of a suspicious word to be a slang word is also evaluated.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 11:38:42 GMT  (493kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04241v1", "13 pages in International Journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications (IJAIA), Vol. 4, No. 5, September 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages in International Journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications (IJAIA), Vol. 4, No. 5, September 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alok ranjan pal", "diganta saha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04241"}
