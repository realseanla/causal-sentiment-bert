While it has brought significant improvements in a number of NLP tasks, mixed results have been reported, and little is known about the conditions under which MTL leads to gains in NLP. This paper sheds light on the specific task relations that can lead to gains from MTL models over single-task setups.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 14:37:21 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08303v1", "Accepted for publication at EACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at EACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["joachim bingel", "anders s{\\o}gaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08303"}
