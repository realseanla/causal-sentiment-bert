These approaches all make use of type theory at least to compose the meanings. We present here with some details one of these approaches, ours, which makes use of sec- ond order lambda calculus as a type theory for meaning assembly and of multi sorted higher order predicate logic for semantic representation.The advantages of such an approach are illustrated both in formal semantics (determiners, quantifiers, plurals) and in lexical pragmatics (coercions, possible and impossible copredication over different senses, deverbal am- biguities, fictive motion,..). Thereafter we explain the similar approaches by pointing out the differences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 17:42:19 GMT  (1368kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Jan 2014 23:58:30 GMT  (1383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Jan 2014 15:43:25 GMT  (1383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4938v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.CL", "authors": ["christian retor\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4938"}
