However, programmers have a rich use of natural language within their code through comments, text literals and naming entities. The programmer defined names that can be found in source code are a rich source of information to build a high level understanding of the project. The goal of this paper is to apply topic modeling to names used in over 13.6 million repositories and perceive the inferred topics. One of the problems in such a study is the occurrence of duplicate repositories not officially marked as forks (obscure forks). We show how to address it using the same identifiers which are extracted for topic modeling.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 08:16:20 GMT  (120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00135v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 20 May 2017 08:29:00 GMT  (350kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00135v2", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.CL", "authors": ["vadim markovtsev", "eiso kant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00135"}
