Version 2 is a revision of the supersense inventory proposed for English by Schneider et al. (2015, 2016) and documented in PrepWiki (henceforth \"v1\"), which in turn was based on previous schemes. The present inventory was developed after extensive review of the v1 corpus annotations for English, as well as consideration of adposition and case phenomena in Hebrew, Hindi, and Korean. Examples in this document are limited to English; a multilingual and more detailed online lexical resource is forthcoming.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 08:42:45 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02134v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nathan schneider", "jena d hwang", "archna bhatia", "na-rae han", "vivek srikumar", "tim o'gorman", "omri abend"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02134"}
