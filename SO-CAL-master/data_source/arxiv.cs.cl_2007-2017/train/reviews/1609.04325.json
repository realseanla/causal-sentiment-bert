Where previous results are only as multilingual as Wikipedia, we show how to use training data from Wikipedia as surrogate training for any language. Thus, the problem becomes one of ranking Wikipedia languages in order of suitability with respect to a target language. We introduce several task-specific methods for ranking languages, and show that our approach is comparable to the oracle ceiling, and even outperforms it in some cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 15:58:55 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04325v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stephen mayhew", "christos christodoulopoulos", "dan roth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.04325"}
