For example, a statement like, \"Tyler entered his house\" implies that his house is bigger than Tyler.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 18:24:25 GMT  (741kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03799v1", "11 pages, published in Proceedings of ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Jul 2017 02:19:45 GMT  (742kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03799v2", "11 pages, published in Proceedings of ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, published in Proceedings of ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["maxwell forbes", "yejin choi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.03799"}
