STIR uses information-theoretic measures from n-gram models as its principal decision features in a pipeline of classifiers detecting the the different stages of repairs. Results on the Switchboard disfluency tagged corpus show utterance-final accuracy on a par with state-of-the-art incremental repair detection methods, but with better incremental accuracy, faster time-to-detection and less computational overhead. We evaluate its performance using incremental metrics and propose new repair processing evaluation standards.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 17:29:55 GMT  (179kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6788v1", "12 pages, 6 figures, EMNLP conference long paper 2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 08:44:09 GMT  (179kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6788v2", "12 pages, 6 figures, EMNLP conference long paper 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 6 figures, EMNLP conference long paper 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["julian hough", "matthew purver"], "accepted": true, "id": "1408.6788"}
