There are various methods for estimating the quality of output sentences, but in this paper we focus on Na\\\"ive Bayes classifier to build model using features which are extracted from the input sentences. These features are used for finding the likelihood of each of the sentences of the training data which are then further used for determining the scores of the test data. On the basis of these scores we determine the class labels of the test data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Dec 2013 09:39:52 GMT  (91kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7223v1", "In Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of 2013 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communications and Informatics", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rashmi gupta", "nisheeth joshi", "iti mathur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.7223"}
