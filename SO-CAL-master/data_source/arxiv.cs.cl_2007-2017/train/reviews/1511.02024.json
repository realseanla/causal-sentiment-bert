Under certain conditions, they showed that both models end up optimizing equivalent objective functions. This paper explores this connection in more detail and lays out the factors leading to differences between these models. We find that the most relevant differences from an optimization perspective are (i) predict models work in a low dimensional space where embedding vectors can interact heavily; (ii) since predict models have fewer parameters, they are less prone to overfitting.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 10:29:26 GMT  (199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02024v1", "17 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["s sathiya keerthi", "tobias schnabel", "rajiv khanna"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02024"}
