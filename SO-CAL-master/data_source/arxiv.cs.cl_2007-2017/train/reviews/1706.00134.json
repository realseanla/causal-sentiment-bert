This paper presents a new approach to NLG by using recurrent neural networks (RNN), in which a gating mechanism is applied before RNN computation. This allows the proposed model to generate appropriate sentences. The RNN-based generator can be learned from unaligned data by jointly training sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language responses. The model was extensively evaluated on four different NLG domains. The results show that the proposed generator achieved better performance on all the NLG domains compared to previous generators.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 00:37:46 GMT  (450kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00134v1", "has been accepted to appear at PACLING 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 3 Jun 2017 00:45:11 GMT  (436kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00134v2", "To be appear at PACLING 2017"], ["v3", "Thu, 6 Jul 2017 15:32:59 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00134v3", "To be appear at PACLING 2017"], ["v4", "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 14:40:56 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00134v4", "To be appear at PACLING 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "has been accepted to appear at PACLING 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["van-khanh tran", "le-minh nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00134"}
