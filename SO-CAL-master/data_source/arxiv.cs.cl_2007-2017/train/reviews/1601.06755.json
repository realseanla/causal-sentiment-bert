We extend results showing that negated assertions are of use in developing shared categories, to include assertions modified by linguistic hedges. Results show that using hedged assertions positively affects the emergence of shared categories in two distinct ways. Firstly, using contraction hedges like `very' gives better convergence over time. Secondly, using expansion hedges such as `quite' reduces concept overlap. However, both these improvements come at a cost of slower speed of development.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 20:24:50 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06755v1", "AISB 2013, updated to include cross-reference to previous work"]], "COMMENTS": "AISB 2013, updated to include cross-reference to previous work", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.MA", "authors": ["martha lewis", "jonathan lawry"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06755"}
