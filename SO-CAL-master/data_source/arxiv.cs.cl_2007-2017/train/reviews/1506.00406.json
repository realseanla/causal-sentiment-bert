We only use monolingual data with the assumption that the phrase table is given to us, but all of its scores have been removed.Our method is based on two recently introduced neural network vector representation models for words and sentences. It is the first use of these models in an end to end phrase based machine translation system. Scores obtained from our method can recover more than 80% of BLEU loss caused by removing phrase table probabilities. We also show that our features combined with the phrase table probabilities improve the BLEU score by 0.74 points", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 09:36:23 GMT  (367kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00406v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 16:44:32 GMT  (393kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00406v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 24 May 2016 15:42:50 GMT  (223kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00406v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amir pouya aghasadeghi", "mohadeseh bastan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00406"}
