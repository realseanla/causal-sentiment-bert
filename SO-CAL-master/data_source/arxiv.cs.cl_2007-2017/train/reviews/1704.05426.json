In addition to being one of the largest corpora available for the task of NLI, at 433k examples, this corpus improves upon available resources in its coverage: it offers data from ten distinct genres of written and spoken English--making it possible to evaluate systems on nearly the full complexity of the language--and it offers an explicit setting for the evaluation of cross-genre domain adaptation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 17:10:13 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426v1", "10 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, submitted to EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 18 May 2017 16:40:41 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426v2", "10 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, submitted to EMNLP 2017. v2 corrects a misreported accuracy number for the CBOW model in the 'matched' setting"], ["v3", "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 18:25:11 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05426v3", "12 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables. v2 corrects a misreported accuracy number for the CBOW model in the 'matched' setting. v3 adds a discussion of the difficulty of the corpus to the analysis section"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, submitted to EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["adina williams", "nikita nangia", "samuel r bowman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05426"}
