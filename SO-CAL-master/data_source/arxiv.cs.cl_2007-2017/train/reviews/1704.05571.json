In this paper, we explore a word embedding-based architecture for predicting the relevance of a role between two financial entities within the context of natural language sentences. In this extended abstract, we propose a pooled approach that uses a collection of sentences to train word embeddings using the skip-gram word2vec architecture. We use the word embeddings to obtain context vectors that are assigned one or more labels based on manual annotations. We train a machine learning classifier using the labeled context vectors, and use the trained classifier to predict contextual role relevance on test data. Our approach serves as a good minimal-expertise baseline for the task as it is simple and intuitive, uses open-source modules, requires little feature crafting effort and performs well across roles.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 00:55:23 GMT  (787kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05571v1", "DSMM 2017 workshop at ACM SIGMOD conference"]], "COMMENTS": "DSMM 2017 workshop at ACM SIGMOD conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mayank kejriwal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05571"}
