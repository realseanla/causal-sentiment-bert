In this work, we describe lda2vec, a model that learns dense word vectors jointly with Dirichlet-distributed latent document-level mixtures of topic vectors. In contrast to continuous dense document representations, this formulation produces sparse, interpretable document mixtures through a non-negative simplex constraint. Our method is simple to incorporate into existing automatic differentiation frameworks and allows for unsupervised document representations geared for use by scientists while simultaneously learning word vectors and the linear relationships between them.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 18:13:18 GMT  (175kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02019v1", "Submitted to CoNLL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to CoNLL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["christopher e moody"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02019"}
