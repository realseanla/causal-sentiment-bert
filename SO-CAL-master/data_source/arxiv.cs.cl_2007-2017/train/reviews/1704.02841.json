It evolves the classifications and the methods of the literature on ambiguities for Natural Language and Visual Language, empirically defining an original classification of ambiguities for multimodal interaction using a linguistic perspective. This classification distinguishes between Semantic and Syntactic multimodal ambiguities and their subclasses, which are intercepted using a rule-based method implemented in a software module. The experimental results have achieved an accuracy of the obtained classification compared to the expected one, which are defined by the human judgment, of 94.6% for the semantic ambiguities classes, and 92.1% for the syntactic ambiguities classes.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 12:06:51 GMT  (1016kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02841v1", "23 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL", "authors": ["maria chiara caschera", "fernando ferri", "patrizia grifoni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02841"}
