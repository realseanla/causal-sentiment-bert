We refer to this problem as Relation Schema Induction (RSI). While Open Information Extraction (OIE) techniques aim at extracting surface level triples of the form (John, underwent, Angioplasty), they don't induce the yet unknown schema of relations themselves. Tensors provide a natural representation for such triples, and factorization of such tensors provide a plausible solution for the RSI problem. To the best of our knowledge, tensor factorization methods have not been used for the RSI problem. We fill this gap and propose Coupled Non-negative Tensor Factorization (CNTF), a tensor factorization method which is able to incorporate additional side information in a principled way for more effective Relation Schema Induction. We report our findings on multiple real-world datasets and demonstrate CNTF's effectiveness over state-of-the-art baselines both in terms of accuracy and speed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 19:44:04 GMT  (323kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04227v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 17 May 2016 04:57:09 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04227v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 04:53:42 GMT  (286kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04227v3", "Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, November 2016.
