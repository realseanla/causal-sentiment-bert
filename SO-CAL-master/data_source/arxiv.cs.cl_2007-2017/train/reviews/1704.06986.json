Although character-level language models offer a partial solution in that they can create word types not attested in the training corpus, they do not capture the \"bursty\" distribution of such words. In this paper, we augment a hierarchical LSTM language model that generates sequences of word tokens character by character with a caching mechanism that learns to reuse previously generated words. To validate our model we construct a new open-vocabulary language modeling corpus (the Multilingual Wikipedia Corpus, MWC) from comparable Wikipedia articles in 7 typologically diverse languages and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model across this range of languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 21:31:22 GMT  (668kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06986v1", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kazuya kawakami", "chris dyer", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06986"}
