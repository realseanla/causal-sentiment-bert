In this paper, we improve this model by explicitly incorporating source-side syntactic trees. More specifically, we propose (1) a bidirectional tree encoder which learns both sequential and tree structured representations; (2) a tree-coverage model that lets the attention depend on the source-side syntax. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrate that our proposed models outperform the sequential attentional model as well as a stronger baseline with a bottom-up tree encoder and word coverage.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 01:53:58 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05436v1", "Accepted as a long paper by ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a long paper by ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["huadong chen", "shujian huang", "david chiang", "jiajun chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.05436"}
