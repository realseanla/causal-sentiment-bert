The basic idea is to encourage two asymmetric latent-variable translation models (i.e., source-to-target and target-to-source) to agree on identifying latent phrase and word alignments. The agreement is defined at both word and phrase levels. We develop a Viterbi EM algorithm for jointly training the two unidirectional models efficiently. Experiments on the Chinese-English dataset show that agreement-based learning significantly improves both alignment and translation performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:28:51 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04597v1", "Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication in the Proceedings of ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chunyang liu", "yang liu 0005", "maosong sun", "huan-bo luan", "heng yu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04597"}
