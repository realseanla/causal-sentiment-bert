However, most of the existing methods encode two sequences with separate encoders, in which a sentence is encoded with little or no information from the other sentence. In this paper, we propose a deep architecture to model the strong interaction of sentence pair with two coupled-LSTMs. Specifically, we introduce two coupled ways to model the interdependences of two LSTMs, coupling the local contextualized interactions of two sentences. We then aggregate these interactions and use a dynamic pooling to select the most informative features. Experiments on two very large datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed architecture and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 May 2016 13:33:21 GMT  (344kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05573v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 20 May 2016 01:28:43 GMT  (317kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05573v2", "Submitted to IJCAI 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pengfei liu", "xipeng qiu", "yaqian zhou", "jifan chen", "xuanjing huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.05573"}
