Based on this analysis, we provide a set of requirements that an image description system should have in order to generate negation sentences. As a pilot experiment, we used our categorization to manually annotate sentences containing negations in the Flickr30K corpus, with an agreement score of K=0.67. With this paper, we hope to open up a broader discussion of subjective language in image descriptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 15:08:22 GMT  (1411kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06164v1", "Accepted as a short paper for the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, collocated with ACL 2016, Berlin"], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 09:06:28 GMT  (1489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06164v2", "Accepted as a short paper for the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, collocated with ACL 2016, Berlin"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a short paper for the 5th Workshop on Vision and Language, collocated with ACL 2016, Berlin", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["emiel van miltenburg", "roser morante", "desmond elliott"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06164"}
