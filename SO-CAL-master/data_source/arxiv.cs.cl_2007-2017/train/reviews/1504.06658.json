In this work, we focus on the task of inferring missing entity type instances in a KB, a fundamental task for KB competition yet receives little attention. Due to the novelty of this task, we construct a large-scale dataset and design an automatic evaluation methodology. Our knowledge base completion method uses information within the existing KB and external information from Wikipedia. We show that individual methods trained with a global objective that considers unobserved cells from both the entity and the type side gives consistently higher quality predictions compared to baseline methods. We also perform manual evaluation on a small subset of the data to verify the effectiveness of our knowledge base completion methods and the correctness of our proposed automatic evaluation method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 22:32:40 GMT  (349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06658v1", "North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics- Human Language Technologies, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics- Human Language Technologies, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL stat.ML", "authors": ["arvind neelakantan", "ming-wei chang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.06658"}
