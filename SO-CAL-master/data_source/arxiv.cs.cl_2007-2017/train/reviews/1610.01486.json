The model can be used as a scoring function for local and global pairwise alignment of phoneme sequences, and the distances can be used as prior probabilities for Bayesian analyses on the phylogenetic relationship between languages, particularly for cognate identification in cases where no empirical prior probability is available.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 15:48:08 GMT  (79kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01486v1", "draft, 1 table, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 15:41:08 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01486v2", "draft, 6 tables, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "draft, 1 table, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tiago tresoldi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01486"}
