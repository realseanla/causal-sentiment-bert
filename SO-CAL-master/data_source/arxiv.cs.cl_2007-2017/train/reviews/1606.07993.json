{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Jun-2016", "title": "Learning for Biomedical Information Extraction: Methodological Review of Recent Advances", "abstract": "Biomedical information extraction (BioIE) is important to many applications, including clinical decision support, integrative biology, and pharmacovigilance, and therefore it has been an active research. Unlike existing reviews covering a holistic view on BioIE, this review focuses on mainly recent advances in learning based approaches, by systematically summarizing them into different aspects of methodological development. In addition, we dive into open information extraction and deep learning, two emerging and influential techniques and envision next generation of BioIE.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Jun 2016 04:39:39 GMT  (689kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07993v1", "The version under review of Briefings in Bioinformatics(submitted on 06/16/2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "The version under review of Briefings in Bioinformatics(submitted on 06/16/2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["feifan liu", "jinying chen", "abhyuday jagannatha", "hong yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07993"}
