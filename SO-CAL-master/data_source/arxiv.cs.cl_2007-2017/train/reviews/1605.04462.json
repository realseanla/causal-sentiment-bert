While counseling and psychotherapy can be effective treatments, our knowledge about how to conduct successful counseling conversations has been limited due to lack of large-scale data with labeled outcomes of the conversations. In this paper, we present a large-scale, quantitative study on the discourse of text-message-based counseling conversations. We develop a set of novel computational discourse analysis methods to measure how various linguistic aspects of conversations are correlated with conversation outcomes. Applying techniques such as sequence-based conversation models, language model comparisons, message clustering, and psycholinguistics-inspired word frequency analyses, we discover actionable conversation strategies that are associated with better conversation outcomes.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 May 2016 20:02:05 GMT  (14102kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04462v1", "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Jul 2016 16:55:12 GMT  (14102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04462v2", "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016"], ["v3", "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 20:45:55 GMT  (14102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04462v3", "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "preprint of paper accepted to TACL, Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["tim althoff", "kevin clark", "jure leskovec"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.04462"}
