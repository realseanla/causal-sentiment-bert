We approach instruction following as a search over plans, scoring sequences of actions conditioned on structured observations of text and the environment. By explicitly modeling both the low-level compositional structure of individual actions and the high-level structure of full plans, we are able to learn both grounded representations of sentence meaning and pragmatic constraints on interpretation. To demonstrate the model's flexibility, we apply it to a diverse set of benchmark tasks. On every task, we outperform strong task-specific baselines, and achieve several new state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 13:44:54 GMT  (909kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06491v1", "in proceedings of EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 19:51:09 GMT  (1062kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06491v2", "in proceedings of EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in proceedings of EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jacob andreas", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.06491"}
