The task consisted in predicting a real continuous variable from -1.0 to +1.0 representing the polarity and intensity of sentiment concerning companies/stocks mentioned in short texts. We modeled the task as a regression analysis problem and combined traditional techniques such as pre-processing short texts, bag-of-words representations and lexical-based features with enhanced financial specific bag-of-embeddings. We used an external collection of tweets and news headlines mentioning companies/stocks from S\\&amp;P 500 to create financial word embeddings which are able to capture domain-specific syntactic and semantic similarities. The resulting approach obtained a cosine similarity score of 0.69 in sub-task 5.1 - Microblogs and 0.68 in sub-task 5.2 - News Headlines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 18:48:00 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05091v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["pedro saleiro", "eduarda mendes rodrigues", "carlos soares", "eug\\'enio oliveira"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05091"}
