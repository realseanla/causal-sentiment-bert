We experimented with a variety of regression and nearest-neighbor methods for use in classification over a set of 325 languages and six syntactic rules drawn from WALS. To classify each rule, we consider the typological features of the other five rules; linguistic features extracted from a word-aligned Bible in each language; and genealogical features (genus and family) of each language. In general, we find that propagating the majority label among all languages of the same genus achieves the best accuracy in label pre- diction. Following this, a logistic regression model that combines typological and linguistic features offers the next best performance. Interestingly, this model actually outperforms the majority labels among all languages of the same family.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 20:09:29 GMT  (58kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08016v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 18:40:55 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08016v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["reed coke", "ben king", "dragomir radev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08016"}
