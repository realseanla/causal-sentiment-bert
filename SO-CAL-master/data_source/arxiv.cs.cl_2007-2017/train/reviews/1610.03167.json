We investigate three kinds of skip connections connecting to LSTM cells: (a) skip connections to the gates, (b) skip connections to the internal states and (c) skip connections to the cell outputs. We present comprehensive experiments showing that skip connections to cell outputs outperform the remaining two. Furthermore, we observe that using gated identity functions as skip mappings works pretty well. Based on this novel skip connections, we successfully train deep stacked bidirectional LSTM models and obtain state-of-the-art results on CCG supertagging and comparable results on POS tagging.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 03:02:38 GMT  (159kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03167v1", "Accepted at COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["huijia wu", "jiajun zhang", "chengqing zong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03167"}
