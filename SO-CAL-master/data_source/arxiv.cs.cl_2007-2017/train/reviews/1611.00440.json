We use 33,708 tweets gathered since December 16, 2015 until February 29, 2016. We introduce a simpler data preprocessing method to label the data and train the model. The model achieves 95.8% accuracy on 10-fold cross validation and predicts Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders as Republican and Democratic nominee respectively. It achieves a comparable result to those in its competitor methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 01:45:28 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00440v1", "This is the non-final version of the paper.
