However, most current research focuses instead on important but narrow applications, such as image classification or machine translation. We believe this to be largely due to the lack of objective ways to measure progress towards broad machine intelligence. In order to fill this gap, we propose here a set of concrete desiderata for general AI, together with a platform to test machines on how well they satisfy such desiderata, while keeping all further complexities to a minimum.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 09:20:17 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08954v1", "Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track"], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 18:47:01 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08954v2", "Published in ICLR 2017 Workshop Track"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["marco baroni", "armand joulin", "allan jabri", "germ\\`an kruszewski", "angeliki lazaridou", "klemen simonic", "tomas mikolov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08954"}
