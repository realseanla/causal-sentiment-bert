Most of the existing models generate one representation per word and do not consider different meanings of a word. We present two approaches to learn multiple topic-sensitive representations per word by using Hierarchical Dirichlet Process. We observe that by modeling topics and integrating topic distributions for each document we obtain representations that are able to distinguish between different meanings of a given word. Our models yield statistically significant improvements for the lexical substitution task indicating that commonly used single word representations, even when combined with contextual information, are insufficient for this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 08:16:56 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00441v1", "5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marzieh fadaee", "arianna bisazza", "christof monz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00441"}
