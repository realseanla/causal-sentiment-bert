However, in order for a machine to understand and make inferences on these health conditions, the ability to recognise when laymen's terms refer to a particular medical concept (i.e.\\ text normalisation) is required. To achieve this, we propose to adapt an existing phrase-based machine translation (MT) technique and a vector representation of words to map between a social media phrase and a medical concept. We evaluate our proposed approach using a collection of phrases from tweets related to adverse drug reactions. Our experimental results show that the combination of a phrase-based MT technique and the similarity between word vector representations outperforms the baselines that apply only either of them by up to 55%.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 15:29:22 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02285v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nut limsopatham", "nigel collier"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.02285"}
