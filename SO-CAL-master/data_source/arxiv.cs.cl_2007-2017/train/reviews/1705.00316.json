However, these latent variables are highly randomized, leading to uncontrollable generated responses. In this paper, we propose a framework allowing conditional response generation based on specific attributes. These attributes can be either manually assigned or automatically detected. Moreover, the dialog states for both speakers are modeled separately in order to reflect personal features. We validate this framework on two different scenarios, where the attribute refers to genericness and sentiment states respectively. The experiment result testified the potential of our model, where meaningful responses can be generated in accordance with the specified attributes.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 13:52:49 GMT  (89kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00316v1", "Accepted by ACL2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 26 May 2017 08:08:53 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00316v2", "Accepted by ACL2017"], ["v3", "Wed, 31 May 2017 19:58:49 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00316v3", "Accepted by ACL2017"], ["v4", "Thu, 6 Jul 2017 09:03:45 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00316v4", "Accepted by ACL2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ACL2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xiaoyu shen", "hui su", "yanran li", "wenjie li", "shuzi niu", "yang zhao", "akiko aizawa", "guoping long"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00316"}
