However, current methods do not take full advantage of the RNN structure. We show that the most widely-used approach to adaptation (concatenating the context with the word embedding at the input to the recurrent layer) is outperformed by a model that has some low-cost improvements: adaptation of both the hidden and output layers. and a feature hashing bias term to capture context idiosyncrasies. Experiments on language modeling and classification tasks using three different corpora demonstrate the advantages of the proposed techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 02:27:26 GMT  (92kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06380v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aaron jaech", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.06380"}
