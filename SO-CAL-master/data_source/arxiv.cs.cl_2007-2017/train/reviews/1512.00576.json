Topic modeling is a technique that has been developed to produce document representation in form of keywords. The keywords will be used in the indexing process and document retrieval as needed by users. In this research, we will discuss specifically about Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA). It will cover PLSA mechanism which involves Expectation Maximization (EM) as the training algorithm, how to conduct testing, and obtain the accuracy result.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 04:41:58 GMT  (356kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00576v1", "17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, Technical Report Program Studi Doktor Ilmu Komputer Universitas Indonesia"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables, Technical Report Program Studi Doktor Ilmu Komputer Universitas Indonesia", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["derwin suhartono"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.00576"}
