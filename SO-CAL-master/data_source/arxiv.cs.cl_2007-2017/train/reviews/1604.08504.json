The rigid anti-spam rules have resulted in emergence of \"smart\" spammers. They resemble legitimate users who are difficult to identify. In this paper, we present a novel spammer classification approach based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation(LDA), a topic model. Our approach extracts both the local and the global information of topic distribution patterns, which capture the essence of spamming. Tested on one benchmark dataset and one self-collected dataset, our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of averaged F1-score.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 16:36:35 GMT  (328kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08504v1", "NAACL-HLT 2016, Student Research Workshop"], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 06:50:36 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08504v2", "NAACL-HLT 2016, Student Research Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL-HLT 2016, Student Research Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["linqing liu", "yao lu", "ye luo", "renxian zhang", "laurent itti", "jianwei lu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.08504"}
