We simply concatenate the source sentences to form a single long multi-source input sentence while keeping the target side sentence as it is and train an NMT system using this augmented corpus. We evaluate our method in a low resource, general domain setting and show its effectiveness (+2 BLEU using 2 source languages and +6 BLEU using 5 source languages) along with some insights on how the NMT system leverages multilingual information in such a scenario by visualizing attention.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 19:00:06 GMT  (159kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06135v1", "Work in progress.
