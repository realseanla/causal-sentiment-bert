In this paper we propose the new task of predicting the derivational form of a given base-form lemma that is appropriate for a given context. We present an encoder--decoder style neural network to produce a derived form character-by-character, based on its corresponding character-level representation of the base form and the context. We demonstrate that our model is able to generate valid context-sensitive derivations from known base forms, but is less accurate under a lexicon agnostic setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 04:50:23 GMT  (160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06675v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ekaterina vylomova", "ryan cotterell", "timothy baldwin", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06675"}
