Feed-forward and recurrent neural network layers (namely Long Short-Term Memory; LSTM) are stacked to form a single structure which is trained by back-propagating error gradients through all the layers. The performance of such a stacked network was experimentally evaluated and compared to a standard Support Vector Machine classifier using conventional computer vision features (Eigenlips and Histograms of Oriented Gradients). The evaluation was performed on data from 19 speakers of the publicly available GRID corpus. With 51 different words to classify, we report a best word accuracy on held-out evaluation speakers of 79.6% using the end-to-end neural network-based solution (11.6% improvement over the best feature-based solution evaluated).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 16:48:07 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.08188v1", "Accepted for publication at ICASSP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at ICASSP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["michael wand", "jan koutn\\'ik", "j\\\"urgen schmidhuber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.08188"}
