{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-May-2016", "title": "Anchoring and Agreement in Syntactic Annotations", "abstract": "We present a study on two key characteristics of human syntactic annotations: anchoring and agreement. Anchoring is a well known cognitive bias in human decision making, where judgments are drawn towards pre-existing values. We study the influence of anchoring on a standard approach to creation of syntactic resources where syntactic annotations are obtained via human editing of tagger and parser output. Our experiments demonstrate a clear anchoring effect and reveal unwanted consequences, including overestimation of parsing performance and lower quality of annotations in comparison with human-based annotations. Using sentences from the Penn Treebank WSJ, we also report the first systematically obtained inter-annotator agreement estimates for English syntactic parsing. Our agreement results control for anchoring bias, and are consequential in that they are \\emph{on par} with state of the art parsing performance for English. We discuss the impact of our findings on strategies for future annotation efforts and parser evaluations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 May 2016 00:26:26 GMT  (3453kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04481v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 16:49:41 GMT  (3763kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04481v2", "Added references, minor revisions"], ["v3", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 22:34:47 GMT  (3454kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04481v3", "EMNLP 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yevgeni berzak", "yan huang 0014", "andrei barbu", "anna korhonen", "boris katz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.04481"}
