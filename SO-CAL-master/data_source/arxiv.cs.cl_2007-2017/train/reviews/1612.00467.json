Proposing a convolutional document embedding approach, our empirical investigation using the MIMIC-III intensive care database shows significant performance gains compared to previously employed methods such as latent topic distributions or generic doc2vec embeddings. These improvements are especially pronounced for the difficult problem of post-discharge mortality prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:06:54 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00467v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["paulina grnarova", "florian schmidt", "stephanie l hyland", "carsten eickhoff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00467"}
