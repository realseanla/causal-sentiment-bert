Unlike conventional approaches to duration modelling -- which assume that duration distributions have a particular form (e.g., a Gaussian) and use the mean of that distribution for synthesis -- our approach can in principle model any distribution supported on the non-negative integers. Generation from this model can be performed in many ways; here we consider output generation based on the median predicted duration. The median is more typical (more probable) than the conventional mean duration, is robust to training-data irregularities, and enables incremental generation. Furthermore, a frame-level approach to duration prediction is consistent with a longer-term goal of modelling durations and acoustic features together. Results indicate that the proposed method is competitive with baseline approaches in approximating the median duration of held-out natural speech.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 11:52:55 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06134v1", "7 pages, 1 figure -- Under review at IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2016)"], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 13:24:44 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06134v2", "7 pages, 1 figure -- Accepted for presentation at IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure -- Under review at IEEE Workshop on Spoken Language Technology (SLT 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["srikanth ronanki", "oliver watts", "simon king", "gustav eje henter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06134"}
