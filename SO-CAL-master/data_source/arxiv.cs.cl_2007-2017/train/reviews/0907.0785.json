{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jul-2009", "title": "A Bayesian Model for Discovering Typological Implications", "abstract": "A standard form of analysis for linguistic typology is the universal implication. These implications state facts about the range of extant languages, such as ``if objects come after verbs, then adjectives come after nouns.'' Such implications are typically discovered by painstaking hand analysis over a small sample of languages. We propose a computational model for assisting at this process. Our model is able to discover both well-known implications as well as some novel implications that deserve further study. Moreover, through a careful application of hierarchical analysis, we are able to cope with the well-known sampling problem: languages are not independent.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jul 2009 18:43:16 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0785v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hal daum\u00e9 iii", "lyle campbell"], "accepted": true, "id": "0907.0785"}
