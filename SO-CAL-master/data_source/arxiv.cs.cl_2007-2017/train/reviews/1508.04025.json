However, there has been little work exploring useful architectures for attention-based NMT. This paper examines two simple and effective classes of attentional mechanism: a global approach which always attends to all source words and a local one that only looks at a subset of source words at a time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. Our attentional NMTs provide a boost of up to 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. For the English to German direction, we have established new state-of-the-art results of 23.0 BLEU for WMT'14 and 25.9 BLEU for WMT'15. Our in-depth analysis sheds light on which architectures are best and we are first to assess attentional models using alignment error rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 13:43:19 GMT  (91kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v1", "EMNLP 2015 camera-ready version"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Aug 2015 10:27:26 GMT  (91kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v2", "EMNLP 2015 camera-ready version"], ["v3", "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 08:14:59 GMT  (92kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v3", "11 pages, EMNLP 2015 camera-ready version"], ["v4", "Sat, 29 Aug 2015 09:03:04 GMT  (95kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v4", "11 pages, 7 figures, EMNLP 2015 camera-ready version, minor fixes"], ["v5", "Sun, 20 Sep 2015 08:25:52 GMT  (73kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025v5", "11 pages, 7 figures, EMNLP 2015 camera-ready version, more training details"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2015 camera-ready version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thang luong", "hieu pham", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.04025"}
