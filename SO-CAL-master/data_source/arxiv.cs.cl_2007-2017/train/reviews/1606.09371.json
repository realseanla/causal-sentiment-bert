Such methods are further limited by the scope of these features or in other words, their ability to cover the contexts or word dependencies within a sentence. In this work, we focus on reducing such dependencies and propose a domain-invariant framework for the disease name recognition task. In particular, we propose various end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) models for the tasks of disease name recognition and their classification into four pre-defined categories. We also utilize convolution neural network (CNN) in cascade of RNN to get character-based embedded features and employ it with word-embedded features in our model. We compare our models with the state-of-the-art results for the two tasks on NCBI disease dataset. Our results for the disease mention recognition task indicate that state-of-the-art performance can be obtained without relying on feature engineering. Further the proposed models obtained improved performance on the classification task of disease names.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 07:15:56 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09371v1", "This work has been accepted in ACL-2016 as long paper"]], "COMMENTS": "This work has been accepted in ACL-2016 as long paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sunil kumar sahu", "ashish anand"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.09371"}
