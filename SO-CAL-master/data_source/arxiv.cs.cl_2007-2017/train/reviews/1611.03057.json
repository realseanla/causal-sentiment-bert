We show that training the tagger on native Twitter data enriched with little amounts of specifically selected gold data and additional silver-labelled data scraped from Facebook, yields better results than using large amounts of manually annotated data from a mix of genres.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 19:39:15 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03057v1", "Proceedings of the 5th Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian (EVALITA 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 5th Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Speech Tools for Italian (EVALITA 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["barbara plank", "malvina nissim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03057"}
