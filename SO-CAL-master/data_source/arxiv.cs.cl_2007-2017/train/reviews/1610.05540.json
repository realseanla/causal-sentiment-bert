NMT systems have a large number of training configurations and the training process of such systems is usually very long, often a few weeks, so role of experimentation is critical and important to share. In this work, we present our approach to production-ready systems simultaneously with release of online demonstrators covering a large variety of languages (12 languages, for 32 language pairs). We explore different practical choices: an efficient and evolutive open-source framework; data preparation; network architecture; additional implemented features; tuning for production; etc. We discuss about evaluation methodology, present our first findings and we finally outline further work.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 11:32:42 GMT  (302kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05540v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["josep crego", "jungi kim", "guillaume klein", "anabel rebollo", "kathy yang", "jean senellart", "egor akhanov", "patrice brunelle", "aurelien coquard", "yongchao deng", "satoshi enoue", "chiyo geiss", "joshua johanson", "ardas khalsa", "raoum khiari", "byeongil ko", "catherine kobus", "jean lorieux", "leidiana martins", "dang-chuan nguyen", "alexandra priori", "thomas riccardi", "natalia segal", "christophe servan", "cyril tiquet", "bo wang", "jin yang", "dakun zhang", "jing zhou", "peter zoldan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05540"}
