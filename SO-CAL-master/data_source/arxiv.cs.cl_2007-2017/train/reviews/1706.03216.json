In this paper we show on utterance level in spontaneous Swedish speech that i) for the youngest children, articulation rate in CDS is lower than in adult-directed speech (ADS), ii) there is a significant negative correlation between articulation rate and surprisal (the negative log probability) in ADS, and iii) the increase in articulation rate in Swedish CDS as a function of the age of the child holds, even when surprisal along with utterance length and differences in articulation rate between speakers are controlled for. These results indicate that adults adjust their articulation rate to make it fit the linguistic capacity of the child.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 10:25:20 GMT  (1344kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03216v1", "5 pages, to appear at Interspeech 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, to appear at Interspeech 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["johan sjons", "thomas h\\\"orberg", "robert \\\"ostling", "johannes bjerva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03216"}
