{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Jun-2016", "title": "Intrinsic Subspace Evaluation of Word Embedding Representations", "abstract": "We introduce a new methodology for intrinsic evaluation of word representations. Specifically, we identify four fundamental criteria based on the characteristics of natural language that pose difficulties to NLP systems; and develop tests that directly show whether or not representations contain the subspaces necessary to satisfy these criteria. Current intrinsic evaluations are mostly based on the overall similarity or full-space similarity of words and thus view vector representations as points. We show the limits of these point-based intrinsic evaluations. We apply our evaluation methodology to the comparison of a count vector model and several neural network models and demonstrate important properties of these models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Jun 2016 12:27:17 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07902v1", "Long paper accepted in ACL2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Long paper accepted in ACL2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yadollah yaghoobzadeh", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.07902"}
