We constructed large-scale gazetteers by using a graph crawler algorithm to extract relevant entity and domain information from a semantic knowledge base, Freebase. The constructed gazetteers contains approximately 300K entities with thousands of fine-grained entity types under 77 different domains. Since automated processes are prone to ambiguity, we also introduce two new content specific noise reduction methodologies. Moreover, we map fine-grained entity types to the equivalent four coarse-grained types: person, loc, org, misc. Eventually, we construct six different dataset versions and evaluate the quality of annotations by comparing ground truths from human annotators. We make these datasets publicly available to support studies on Turkish named-entity recognition (NER) and text categorization (TC).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 10:45:23 GMT  (108kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02363v1", "10 page, 1 figure, white paper"], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 08:35:12 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02363v2", "10 page, 1 figure, white paper, update: added correct download link for dataset"]], "COMMENTS": "10 page, 1 figure, white paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["h bahadir sahin", "caglar tirkaz", "eray yildiz", "mustafa tolga eren", "ozan sonmez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02363"}
