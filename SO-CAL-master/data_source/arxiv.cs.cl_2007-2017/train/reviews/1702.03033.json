This work is motivated by the fact that the commonly used binary system voting models only assign each input system a global weight which is responsible for the global impact of each input system on all translations. This prevents individual systems with low system weights from having influence on the system combination output, although in some situations this could be helpful. Further, words which have only been seen by one or few systems rarely have a chance of being present in the combined output. We train a local system voting model by a neural network which is based on the words themselves and the combinatorial occurrences of the different system outputs. This gives system combination the option to prefer other systems at different word positions even for the same sentence.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 01:27:00 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03033v1", "published WMT 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "published WMT 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["markus freitag", "jan-thorsten peter", "stephan peitz", "minwei feng", "hermann ney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03033"}
