{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "13-Jan-2015", "title": "Towards Deep Semantic Analysis Of Hashtags", "abstract": "Hashtags are semantico-syntactic constructs used across various social networking and microblogging platforms to enable users to start a topic specific discussion or classify a post into a desired category. Segmenting and linking the entities present within the hashtags could therefore help in better understanding and extraction of information shared across the social media. However, due to lack of space delimiters in the hashtags (e.g #nsavssnowden), the segmentation of hashtags into constituent entities (\"NSA\" and \"Edward Snowden\" in this case) is not a trivial task. Most of the current state-of-the-art social media analytics systems like Sentiment Analysis and Entity Linking tend to either ignore hashtags, or treat them as a single word. In this paper, we present a context aware approach to segment and link entities in the hashtags to a knowledge base (KB) entry, based on the context within the tweet. Our approach segments and links the entities in hashtags such that the coherence between hashtag semantics and the tweet is maximized. To the best of our knowledge, no existing study addresses the issue of linking entities in hashtags for extracting semantic information. We evaluate our method on two different datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in improving the overall entity linking in tweets via additional semantic information provided by segmenting and linking entities in a hashtag.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 23:51:29 GMT  (610kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03210v1", "To Appear in 37th European Conference on Information Retrieval"]], "COMMENTS": "To Appear in 37th European Conference on Information Retrieval", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["piyush bansal", "romil bansal", "vasudeva varma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03210"}
