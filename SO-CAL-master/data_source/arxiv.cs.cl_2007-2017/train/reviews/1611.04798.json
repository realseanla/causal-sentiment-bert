We are then able to employ attention-based NMT for many-to-many multilingual translation tasks. Our approach does not require any special treatment on the network architecture and it allows us to learn minimal number of free parameters in a standard way of training. Our approach has shown its effectiveness in an under-resourced translation scenario with considerable improvements up to 2.6 BLEU points. In addition, the approach has achieved interesting and promising results when applied in the translation task that there is no direct parallel corpus between source and target languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 11:47:42 GMT  (437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04798v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thanh-le ha", "jan niehues", "alexander waibel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04798"}
