Named entity extraction is a main task in the process of information extraction and is a classification problem in which words are assigned to one or more semantic classes or to a default non-entity class. A word which can belong to one or more classes and which has a level of uncertainty in it can be best handled by a self learning Fuzzy Logic Technique. This paper proposes a method for detecting the presence of spatial uncertainty in the text and dealing with spatial ambiguity using named entity extraction techniques coupled with self learning fuzzy logic techniques", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Mar 2013 01:21:58 GMT  (91kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0445v1", "National Conference on Recent Trends in Data Mining and Distributed Systems September 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "National Conference on Recent Trends in Data Mining and Distributed Systems September 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["kanagavalli v r", "raja k"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0445"}
