We propose a neural architecture that is composed of two modules trained jointly: a recurrent neural network (RNN) module and a structured prediction model. The RNN outputs are considered as feature functions to the structured model. The overall model is trained with a structured loss function which can be designed to the given segmentation task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to two simple tasks commonly used in phonetic studies: word segmentation and voice onset time segmentation. Results sug- gest the proposed model is superior to previous methods, ob- taining state-of-the-art results on the tested datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 15:21:25 GMT  (138kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07918v1", "under review"]], "COMMENTS": "under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yossi adi", "joseph keshet", "emily cibelli", "matthew goldrick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07918"}
