Such whole-word segmental systems rely on a function that maps a variable-length speech segment to a vector in a fixed-dimensional space; the resulting acoustic word embeddings need to allow for accurate discrimination between different word types, directly in the embedding space. We compare several old and new approaches in a word discrimination task. Our best approach uses side information in the form of known word pairs to train a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN): a pair of tied networks that take two speech segments as input and produce their embeddings, trained with a hinge loss that separates same-word pairs and different-word pairs by some margin. A word classifier CNN performs similarly, but requires much stronger supervision. Both types of CNNs yield large improvements over the best previously published results on the word discrimination task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 05:25:32 GMT  (353kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01032v1", "5 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 14:54:44 GMT  (353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01032v2", "5 pages, 3 figures; added reference, acknowledgement and link to code"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["herman kamper", "weiran wang", "karen livescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.01032"}
