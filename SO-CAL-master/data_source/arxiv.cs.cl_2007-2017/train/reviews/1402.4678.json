The compelling interest of human language acquisition is that the learning succeeds in virtually every case, despite the fact that the input data are formally inadequate to explain the success of learning. Our model explains how a learner can successfully learn from or even surpass its imperfect source without possessing any additional biases or constraints about the types of patterns that exist in the language. We use the data collected by Singleton and Newport (2004) on the performance of a 7-year boy Simon, who mastered the American Sign Language (ASL) by learning it from his parents, both of whom were imperfect speakers of ASL. We show that the algorithm possesses a frequency-boosting property, whereby the frequency of the most common form of the source is increased by the learner. We also explain several key features of Simon's ASL.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 02:18:10 GMT  (1392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4678v1", "21 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yelena mandelshtam", "natalia komarova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4678"}
