We focus here on the LAMBADA dataset, a word prediction task requiring broader context than the immediate sentence. We view the LAMBADA task as a reading comprehension problem and apply off-the-shelf comprehension models based on neural networks. Though these models are constrained to choose a word from the context, they improve the state of the art on LAMBADA from 7.3% to 45.4%. We analyze 100 instances, finding that neural network readers perform well in cases that involve selecting a name from the context based on dialogue or discourse cues but struggle when coreference resolution or external knowledge is needed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 17:25:38 GMT  (18kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08431v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Dec 2016 18:54:44 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08431v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 21:33:30 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08431v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zewei chu", "hai wang", "kevin gimpel", "david mcallester"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08431"}
