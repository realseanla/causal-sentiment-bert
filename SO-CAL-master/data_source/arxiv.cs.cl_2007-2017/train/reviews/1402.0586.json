We present two new corpora of email and blog conversations annotated with topics, and evaluate annotator reliability for the segmentation and labeling tasks in these asynchronous conversations. We propose a complete computational framework for topic segmentation and labeling in asynchronous conversations. Our approach extends state-of-the-art methods by considering a fine-grained structure of an asynchronous conversation, along with other conversational features by applying recent graph-based methods for NLP. For topic segmentation, we propose two novel unsupervised models that exploit the fine-grained conversational structure, and a novel graph-theoretic supervised model that combines lexical, conversational and topic features. For topic labeling, we propose two novel (unsupervised) random walk models that respectively capture conversation specific clues from two different sources: the leading sentences and the fine-grained conversational structure. Empirical evaluation shows that the segmentation and the labeling performed by our best models beat the state-of-the-art, and are highly correlated with human annotations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:43:35 GMT  (1192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0586v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shafiq rayhan joty", "giuseppe carenini", "raymond t ng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0586"}
