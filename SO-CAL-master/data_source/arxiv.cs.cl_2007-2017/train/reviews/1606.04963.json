Motivated by the complementary nature of syntactical machine translation and neural machine translation (NMT), we exploit the synergies of Hiero and NMT in different combination schemes. Starting out with a simple neural lattice rescoring approach, we show that the Hiero lattices are often too narrow for NMT ensembles. Therefore, instead of a hard restriction of the NMT search space to the lattice, we propose to loosely couple NMT and Hiero by composition with a modified version of the edit distance transducer. The loose combination outperforms lattice rescoring, especially when using multiple NMT systems in an ensemble.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 20:08:01 GMT  (420kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04963v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["felix stahlberg", "eva hasler", "bill byrne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04963"}
