Using large scale color--name pairs obtained from an online color design forum, we evaluate our model on a \"color Turing test\" and find that, given a name, the colors predicted by our model are preferred by annotators to color names created by humans. Our datasets and demo system are available online at", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 05:41:18 GMT  (1056kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08777v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 16:08:36 GMT  (827kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08777v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kazuya kawakami\u007f", "chris dyer\u007f", "bryan r routledge", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.08777"}
