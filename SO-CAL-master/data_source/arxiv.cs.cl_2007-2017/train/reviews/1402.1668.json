No modifications were directly made to these systems, but output concepts were filtered using stop concepts, stop concept text and UMLS semantic type. Con- cept boundaries were also adjusted using a small collection of rules to increase precision on the strict task. Overall MetaMap had better per- formance than YTEX on the strict task, primarily due to a 20% perfor- mance improvement in precision. In the relaxed task YTEX had better performance in both precision and recall giving it an overall F-Score 4.6% higher than MetaMap on the test data. Our results also indicated a 1.3% higher accuracy for YTEX in UMLS CUI mapping.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 15:33:44 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1668v1", "6 pages, working notes to the ShareClef eHealth 2013 Shared Task"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, working notes to the ShareClef eHealth 2013 Shared Task", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["john david osborne", "binod gyawali", "thamar solorio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.1668"}
