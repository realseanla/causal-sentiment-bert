This paper discusses LAF-Fabric, a new tool to analyse LAF resources in general with an extension to process the Hebrew Bible in particular. We first walk through the history of the Hebrew Bible as text database in decennium-wide steps. Then we describe how LAF-Fabric may serve as an analysis tool for this corpus. Finally, we describe three analytic projects/workflows that benefit from the new LAF representation:", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 16:53:35 GMT  (525kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0286v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dirk roorda", "gino kalkman", "martijn naaijer", "reas van cranenburgh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0286"}
