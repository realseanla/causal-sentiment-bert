Inspired by the theories from sociolinguistics, the latest work indicates that interactive language can reveal individuals' asymmetric opinions on their interrelationship. In this work, in order to explain the opinions' asymmetry on interrelationship with more latent factors, we extend the investigation from single relationship to the structural context in online social network. We analyze the correlation between interactive language features and the structural context of interrelationships. The structural context of vertex, edges and triangles in social network are considered. With statistical analysis on Enron email dataset, we find that individuals' opinions (measured by interactive language features) on their interrelationship are related to some of their important structural context in social network. This result can help us to understand and measure the individuals' opinions on their interrelationship with more intrinsic information.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 03:11:10 GMT  (961kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00457v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["bo wang", "yingjun sun", "yuan wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00457"}
