Although names are strong gender indicators, the names of Twitter users are rarely used as a feature; probably due to the high number of ill-formed names, which cannot be found in any name dictionary. Instead of relying solely on a name database, we propose a novel name classifier. Our approach extracts characteristics from the user names and uses those in order to assign the names to a gender. This enables us to classify international first names as well as ill-formed names.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 10:24:29 GMT  (228kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05467v1", "9 pages (8 pages in actual proceedings), 2 figures, 8 tables, conference: MISNC, SI, DS '16, August 15 - 17, 2016, Union, NJ, USA"], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 12:38:04 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05467v2", "9 pages (8 pages in actual proceedings), 2 figures, 8 tables, conference: MISNC, SI, DS '16, August 15 - 17, 2016, Union, NJ, USA"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages (8 pages in actual proceedings), 2 figures, 8 tables, conference: MISNC, SI, DS '16, August 15 - 17, 2016, Union, NJ, USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["juergen mueller", "gerd stumme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05467"}
