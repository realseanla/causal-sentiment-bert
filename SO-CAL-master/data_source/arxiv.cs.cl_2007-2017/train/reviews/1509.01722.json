Here we explore additional support for this constraint and suggest further connections from quantitative linguistics and information theory.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Sep 2015 17:52:16 GMT  (124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01722v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 05:44:59 GMT  (53kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01722v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ramon ferrer-i-cancho"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01722"}
