Natural language processing methods for medical auto-coding, or automatic generation of medical billing codes from electronic health records, generally assign each code independently of the others. They may thus assign codes for closely related procedures or diagnoses to the same document, even when they do not tend to occur together in practice, simply because the right choice can be difficult to infer from the clinical narrative.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 22:36:08 GMT  (2449kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04734v1", "Submitted to Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michael subotin", "anthony r davis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04734"}
