Inspired by machine learning ensemble techniques, the system uses a range of convolutional and recurrent neural networks. I-vector modeling and lattice-free MMI training provide significant gains for all acoustic model architectures. Language model rescoring with multiple forward and backward running RNNLMs, and word posterior-based system combination provide a 20% boost. The best single system uses a ResNet architecture acoustic model with RNNLM rescoring, and achieves a word error rate of 6.9% on the NIST 2000 Switchboard task. The combined system has an error rate of 6.3%, representing an improvement over previously reported results on this benchmark task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 18:59:29 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03528v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 08:27:28 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03528v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["w xiong", "j droppo", "x huang", "f seide", "m seltzer", "a stolcke", "d yu", "g zweig"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03528"}
