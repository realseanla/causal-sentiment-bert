This implies that in image captioning, all word categories other than nouns can be evoked by a powerful language model without sacrificing performance on the precision-oriented metric BLEU. The paper also investigates lower and upper bounds of how much individual word categories in the captions contribute to the final BLEU score. A large possible improvement exists for nouns, verbs, and prepositions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 13:42:03 GMT  (3074kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03708v1", "This paper is accepted to the ECCV2016 2nd Workshop on Storytelling with Images and Videos (VisStory)"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 09:35:03 GMT  (3076kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03708v2", "This paper was presented at the ECCV2016 2nd Workshop on Storytelling with Images and Videos (VisStory)"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper is accepted to the ECCV2016 2nd Workshop on Storytelling with Images and Videos (VisStory)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["hendrik heuer", "christof monz", "arnold w m smeulders"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03708"}
