However, when multilingual document collections are considered, training such models separately for each language entails linear parameter growth and lack of cross-language transfer. Learning a single multilingual model with fewer parameters is therefore a challenging but potentially beneficial objective. To this end, we propose multilingual hierarchical attention networks for learning document structures, with shared encoders and/or attention mechanisms across languages, using multi-task learning and an aligned semantic space as input. We evaluate the proposed models on multilingual document classification with disjoint label sets, on a large dataset which we provide, with 600k news documents in 8 languages, and 5k labels. The multilingual models outperform strong monolingual ones in low-resource as well as full-resource settings, and use fewer parameters, thus confirming their computational efficiency and the utility of cross-language transfer.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 10:28:04 GMT  (2326kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00896v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Jul 2017 10:37:52 GMT  (2334kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00896v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 15:06:16 GMT  (2337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00896v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 10:47:26 GMT  (2337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00896v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nikolaos pappas", "andrei popescu-belis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.00896"}
