In the BoW principle, word histograms were first used as features in document classification, but the idea was and can easily be adapted to, e.g., acoustic or visual low-level descriptors, introducing a prior step of vector quantisation. The openXBOW toolkit supports arbitrary numeric input features and text input and concatenates computed subbags to a final bag. It provides a variety of extensions and options. To our knowledge, openXBOW is the first publicly available toolkit for the generation of crossmodal bags-of-words. The capabilities of the tool are exemplified in two sample scenarios: time-continuous speech-based emotion recognition and sentiment analysis in tweets where improved results over other feature representation forms were observed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 May 2016 12:14:55 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06778v1", "9 pages, 1 figure, pre-print"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 1 figure, pre-print", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["maximilian schmitt", "bj\\\"orn w schuller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06778"}
