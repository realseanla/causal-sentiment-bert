Similarly, convolutional neural network (CNN) is introduced into NMT for speeding recently, however, CNN focus on capturing the local feature of the sequence; To relieve this issue, we incorporate a relation network into the standard encoder-decoder framework to enhance information-propogation in neural network, ensuring that the information of the source sentence can flow into the decoder adequately. Experiments show that proposed framework outperforms the statistical MT model and the state-of-art NMT model significantly on two data sets with different scales.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 11:13:50 GMT  (2308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01766v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wen zhang", "jiawei hu", "yang feng", "qun liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01766"}
