However, there have been few attempts to explain skipping behavior with computational models, as most existing work has focused on predicting reading times (e.g.,~using surprisal). In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models both skipping and reading, using an unsupervised architecture that combines a neural attention with autoencoding, trained on raw text using reinforcement learning. Our model explains human reading behavior as a tradeoff between precision of language understanding (encoding the input accurately) and economy of attention (fixating as few words as possible). We evaluate the model on the Dundee eye-tracking corpus, showing that it accurately predicts skipping behavior and reading times, is competitive with surprisal, and captures known qualitative features of human reading.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 14:03:46 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05604v1", "To appear in Proceedings of EMNLP 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 09:38:46 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05604v2", "EMNLP 2016, pp. 85-95, Austin, TX"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michael hahn 0001", "frank keller"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.05604"}
