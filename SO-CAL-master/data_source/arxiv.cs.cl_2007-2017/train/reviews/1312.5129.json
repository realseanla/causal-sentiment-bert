Embeddings are mostly computed for word forms although a number of recent papers have extended this to other linguistic units like morphemes and phrases. In this paper, we argue that learning embeddings for discontinuous linguistic units should also be considered. In an experimental evaluation on coreference resolution, we show that such embeddings perform better than word form embeddings.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Dec 2013 13:34:16 GMT  (16kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5129v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 11:01:02 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5129v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenpeng yin", "hinrich sch\\\"utze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5129"}
