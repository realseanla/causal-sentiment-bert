In this paper, we develop the Computational Linking Theory framework as a method for implementing and testing linking theories proposed in the theoretical literature. We deploy this framework to assess two cross-cutting types of linking theory: local v. global models and categorical v. featural models. To further investigate the behavior of these models, we develop a measurement model in the spirit of previous work in semantic role induction: the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model. We use this model, which implements a generalization of Dowty's seminal Proto-Role Theory, to induce semantic proto-roles, which we compare to those Dowty proposes.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 15:24:50 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02544v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aaron steven white", "drew reisinger", "rachel rudinger", "kyle rawlins", "benjamin van durme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02544"}
