We explore a CNN architecture for classifying modal sense in English and German. We show that CNNs are superior to manually designed feature-based classifiers and a standard NN classifier. We analyze the feature maps learned by the CNN and identify known and previously unattested linguistic features. We benchmark the CNN on a standard WSD task, where it compares favorably to models using sense-disambiguated target vectors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 11:41:45 GMT  (197kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05243v1", "Final version, accepted at the 1st Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, held in conjunction with ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Final version, accepted at the 1st Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, held in conjunction with ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ana marasovi\\'c", "anette frank"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05243"}
