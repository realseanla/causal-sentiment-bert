This industry, among other industries, is currently experiencing a phenomenal growth in its technical and regulatory texts. Therefore, it is urgent and crucial to improve the process of creating regulations by automating it as much as possible. We focus on the creation of particular technical documents issued by the French Scientific and Technical Centre for Building (CSTB), called Technical Assessments, and we propose services based on Semantic Web models and techniques for modelling the process of their creation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 20:09:08 GMT  (505kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4726v1", "In the International Council for Building Conference, CIB 2011 (2011)"]], "COMMENTS": "In the International Council for Building Conference, CIB 2011 (2011)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["khalil riad bouzidi", "bruno fies", "marc bourdeau", "catherine faron-zucker", "nhan le-thanh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4726"}
