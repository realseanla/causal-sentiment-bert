We find that source contexts have a direct impact on the adequacy of a translation while target contexts on the fluency. Intuitively, generation of a content word should rely more on the source context and generation of a functional word should rely more on the target context. Due to lack of effective control on the influence from source and target contexts, conventional NMT tends to yield fluent but inadequate translations. To address this problem, we propose to use context gates to dynamically control the ratios at which source and target contexts contribute to the generation of target words. In this way, we can enhance the adequacy of NMT while keeping the fluency unchanged. Experiments show that our approach significantly improves upon a standard attention-based NMT system by +2.3 BLEU points.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 03:19:27 GMT  (775kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06043v1", "Our code is publicly available atthis https URL"], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 03:09:50 GMT  (821kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06043v2", "Accepted by TACL 2016"], ["v3", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 07:14:27 GMT  (821kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06043v3", "Accepted by TACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Our code is publicly available atthis https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhaopeng tu", "yang liu", "zhengdong lu", "xiaohua liu", "hang li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.06043"}
