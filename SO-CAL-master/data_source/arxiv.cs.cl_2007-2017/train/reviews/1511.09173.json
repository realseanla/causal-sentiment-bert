Early detection of individual suicide risk plays a key role in suicide prevention. In this paper, we propose to look into individual suicide risk through time series analysis of personal linguistic expression on social media (Weibo). We examined temporal patterns of the linguistic expression of individuals on Chinese social media (Weibo). Then, we used such temporal patterns as predictor variables to build classification models for estimating levels of individual suicide risk. Characteristics of time sequence curves to linguistic features including parentheses, auxiliary verbs, personal pronouns and body words are reported to affect performance of suicide most, and the predicting model has a accuracy higher than 0.60, shown by the results. This paper confirms the efficiency of the social media data in detecting individual suicide risk. Results of this study may be insightful for improving the performance of suicide prevention programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 06:15:31 GMT  (298kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09173v1", "16 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["aiqi zhang", "ang li", "tingshao zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.09173"}
