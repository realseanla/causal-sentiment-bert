Usually ASR systems use a finite lexicon that provides one or more pronunciations for each word. In this paper, we focus on learning a similarity function between two pronunciations. The pronunciation can be the canonical and the surface pronunciations of the same word or it can be two surface pronunciations of different words. This task generalizes problems such as lexical access (the problem of learning the mapping between words and their possible pronunciations), and defining word neighborhoods. It can also be used to dynamically increase the size of the pronunciation lexicon, or in predicting ASR errors. We propose two methods, which are based on recurrent neural networks, to learn the similarity function. The first is based on binary classification, and the second is based on learning the ranking of the pronunciations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on the task of lexical access using a subset from the Switchboard conversational speech corpus. Results suggest that our method is superior to previous methods which are based on graphical Bayesian methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 21:47:16 GMT  (208kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09817v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 28 May 2017 19:05:38 GMT  (209kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09817v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 18 Jun 2017 11:52:54 GMT  (209kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09817v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["einat naaman", "yossi adi", "joseph keshet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09817"}
