This is mostly due to a its ease of computation, lack of dependence on external tools like speech recognition pipeline and a good theoretical justification for why it should work. Despite this, there has been no dearth of criticism for this metric. Most of this criticism center around lack of correlation with extrinsic metrics like word error rate(WER), dependence upon shared vocabulary for model comparison and unsuitability for un-normalized language model evaluation. In this paper we address the last problem of inability to evaluate un-normalized models by introducing a new discriminative evaluation metric that predicts model's performance based on its ability to discriminate between test sentences and their deformed version. Due to its discriminative formulation, this approach can work with un-normalized probabilities while retaining perplexity's ease of computation. We show a strong correlation between our new metric and perplexity across a range of models on WSJ datasets. We also hypothesize a stronger correlation between WER and our new metric vis-a-vis perplexity due to similar discriminative objective.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Jan 2016 05:47:42 GMT  (207kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00248v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 13:53:47 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00248v2", "submitted to INTERSPEECH 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kushal arora", "anand rangarajan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00248"}
