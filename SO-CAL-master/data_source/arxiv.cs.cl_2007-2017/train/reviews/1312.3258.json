Some of these limitations are: how to take into account and reflect (in the generated summary) the implicit information conveyed in the text, the author intention, the reader intention, the context influence, the general world knowledge. Thus, if we want machines to mimic human abilities, then they will need access to this same large variety of knowledge. The implicit is affecting the orientation and the argumentation of the text and consequently its summary. Most of Text Summarizers (TS) are processing as compressing the initial data and they necessarily suffer from information loss. TS are focusing on features of the text only, not on what the author intended or why the reader is reading the text. In this paper, we address this problem and we present a system focusing on acquiring knowledge that is implicit. We principally spotlight the implicit information conveyed by the argumentative connectives such as: but, even, yet and their effect on the summary.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 17:50:21 GMT  (274kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3258v1", "4 pages, 2 figures, journal IJACSA; (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 2 figures, journal IJACSA; (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 4, No. 11, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["henda chorfi ouertani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.3258"}
