However, we formulate the hypothesis that some of its limitations are mainly due to a poor representation of the constraints used. Finally, we show how a better representation of the constraints used would yield better results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 May 2014 18:51:06 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6682v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thierry poibeau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6682"}
