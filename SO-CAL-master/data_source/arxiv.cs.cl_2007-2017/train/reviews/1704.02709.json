{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Apr-2017", "title": "Improving Implicit Semantic Role Labeling by Predicting Semantic Frame Arguments", "abstract": "We introduce an approach to implicit semantic role labeling (iSRL) based on a recurrent neural semantic frame model that learns probability distributions over sequences of explicit semantic frame arguments. On the NomBank iSRL test set, the approach results in better state-of-the-art performance with much less reliance on manually constructed language resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 04:48:53 GMT  (185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02709v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 5 Oct 2017 10:32:17 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02709v2", "IJCNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["quynh ngoc thi do", "steven bethard", "marie-francine moens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02709"}
