The main advantage of a deep semantic analyse is too represent meaning by logical formulae that can be easily used e.g. for inferences. Determiners and quantifiers play a fundamental role in the construction of those formulae. But in our rich type system the usual semantic terms do not work. We propose a solution ins- pired by the tau and epsilon operators of Hilbert, kinds of generic elements and choice functions. This approach unifies the treatment of the different determi- ners and quantifiers as well as the dynamic binding of pronouns. Above all, this fully computational view fits in well within the wide coverage parser Grail, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 16:26:49 GMT  (18kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1422v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 17 May 2013 14:17:49 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1422v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["christian retor\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1422"}
