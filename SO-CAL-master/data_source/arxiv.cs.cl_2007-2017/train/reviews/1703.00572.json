Our proposed model, structural embedding of syntactic trees (SEST), takes each word in a sentence, constructs a sequence of syntactic nodes extracted from syntactic parse trees, and encodes the sequence into a vector representation. The learned vector is then incorporated into neural attention models, which allows learning the mapping of syntactic structures between question and context pairs. We evaluate our approach on SQuAD dataset and demonstrate that our model can accurately identify the syntactic boundaries of the sentences and to extract answers that are syntactically coherent over the baseline methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 01:08:10 GMT  (1054kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00572v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 00:45:25 GMT  (1171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00572v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 23:20:59 GMT  (1414kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00572v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rui liu", "junjie hu", "wei wei", "zi yang", "eric nyberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.00572"}
