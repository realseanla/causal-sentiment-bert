The former, introduced by Denise et al, associates weights with letters, while the latter, recently explored by Weinberg et al in the context of random generation, associates weights to transitions. In this short note, we use a simple modification of the Greibach Normal Form transformation algorithm, due to Blum and Koch, to show the equivalent expressivities, in term of their induced distributions, of these two formalisms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 May 2012 06:49:59 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0627v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yann ponty"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.0627"}
