An important source for such opinions is user reviews on online app markets. However, manual review analysis for useful opinions is often challenging due to the large amount and the noisy-nature of user reviews. To address this problem, we propose M.A.R.K, a keyword-based framework for semiautomated review analysis. The key task of M.A.R.K is to analyze reviews for keywords of potential interest which developers can use to search for useful opinions. We have developed several techniques for that task including: 1) keyword extracting with customized regularization algorithms; 2) keyword grouping with distributed representation; and 3) keyword ranking with ratings and frequencies analysis. Our empirical evaluation and case studies show that M.A.R.K can identify keywords of high interest and provide developers with useful user opinions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 May 2015 14:25:03 GMT  (692kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04657v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 02:23:32 GMT  (2333kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04657v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["phong minh vu", "tam the nguyen", "hung viet pham", "tung thanh nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04657"}
