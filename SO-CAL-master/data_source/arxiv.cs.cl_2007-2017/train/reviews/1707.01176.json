{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jul-2017", "title": "Charmanteau: Character Embedding Models For Portmanteau Creation", "abstract": "Portmanteaus are a word formation phenomenon where two words are combined to form a new word. We propose character-level neural sequence-to-sequence (S2S) methods for the task of portmanteau generation that are end-to-end-trainable, language independent, and do not explicitly use additional phonetic information. We propose a noisy-channel-style model, which allows for the incorporation of unsupervised word lists, improving performance over a standard source-to-target model. This model is made possible by an exhaustive candidate generation strategy specifically enabled by the features of the portmanteau task. Experiments find our approach superior to a state-of-the-art FST-based baseline with respect to ground truth accuracy and human evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 23:11:52 GMT  (262kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01176v1", "Accepted for publication in EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Jul 2017 16:27:55 GMT  (262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01176v2", "Accepted for publication in EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication in EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["varun gangal", "harsh jhamtani", "graham neubig", "eduard h hovy", "eric nyberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.01176"}
