In this thesis we present a framework for an integrated temporal and causal relation extraction system. We first develop a robust extraction component for each type of relations, i.e. temporal order and causality. We then combine the two extraction components into an integrated relation extraction system, CATENA---CAusal and Temporal relation Extraction from NAtural language texts---, by utilizing the presumption about event precedence in causality, that causing events must happened BEFORE resulting events. Several resources and techniques to improve our relation extraction systems are also discussed, including word embeddings and training data expansion. Finally, we report our adaptation efforts of temporal information processing for languages other than English, namely Italian and Indonesian.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 15:52:18 GMT  (1106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08120v1", "PhD Thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "PhD Thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["paramita mirza"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.08120"}
