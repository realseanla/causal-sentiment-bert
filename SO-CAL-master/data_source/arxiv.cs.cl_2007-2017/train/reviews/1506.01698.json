The recent advances in image captioning as well as the release of large-scale movie description datasets such as MPII Movie Description allow to study this task in more depth. Many of the proposed methods for image captioning rely on pre-trained object classifier CNNs and Long-Short Term Memory recurrent networks (LSTMs) for generating descriptions. While image description focuses on objects, we argue that it is important to distinguish verbs, objects, and places in the challenging setting of movie description. In this work we show how to learn robust visual classifiers from the weak annotations of the sentence descriptions. Based on these visual classifiers we learn how to generate a description using an LSTM. We explore different design choices to build and train the LSTM and achieve the best performance to date on the challenging MPII-MD dataset. We compare and analyze our approach and prior work along various dimensions to better understand the key challenges of the movie description task.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 19:45:36 GMT  (1347kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01698v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["anna rohrbach", "marcus rohrbach", "bernt schiele"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01698"}
