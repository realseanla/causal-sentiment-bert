Our model has the additional advantage of being very interpretable, since it allows visualization of its predictions broken up by abstract features such as information content, salience and novelty. Another novel contribution of our work is abstractive training of our extractive model that can train on human generated reference summaries alone, eliminating the need for sentence-level extractive labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 02:44:14 GMT  (76kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04230v1", "Published at AAAI 2017, The Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Published at AAAI 2017, The Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ramesh nallapati", "feifei zhai", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.04230"}
