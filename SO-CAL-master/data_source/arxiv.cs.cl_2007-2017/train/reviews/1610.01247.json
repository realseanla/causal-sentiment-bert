{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Oct-2016", "title": "ECAT: Event Capture Annotation Tool", "abstract": "This paper introduces the Event Capture Annotation Tool (ECAT), a user-friendly, open-source interface tool for annotating events and their participants in video, capable of extracting the 3D positions and orientations of objects in video captured by Microsoft's Kinect(R) hardware. The modeling language VoxML (Pustejovsky and Krishnaswamy, 2016) underlies ECAT's object, program, and attribute representations, although ECAT uses its own spec for explicit labeling of motion instances. The demonstration will show the tool's workflow and the options available for capturing event-participant relations and browsing visual data. Mapping ECAT's output to VoxML will also be addressed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 01:24:42 GMT  (2904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01247v1", "4 pages, 4 figures, ISA workshop 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 4 figures, ISA workshop 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["tuan do", "nikhil krishnaswamy", "james pustejovsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01247"}
