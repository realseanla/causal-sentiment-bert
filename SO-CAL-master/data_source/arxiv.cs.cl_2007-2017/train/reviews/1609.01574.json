Online health knowledge resources contain a wealth of information. However, because of the time investment needed to disseminate and rank pertinent information, there is a need to summarize the information in a more concise format. Our aim of the study is to provide clinicians with a concise overview of popular treatments for a given disease using information automatically computed from Medline abstracts. We analyzed the treatments of two disorders - Atrial Fibrillation and Congestive Heart Failure. We calculated the precision, recall, and f-scores of our two ranking methods to measure the accuracy of the results. For Atrial Fibrillation disorder, maximum f-score for the New Treatments weighing method is 0.611, which occurs at 60 treatments. For Congestive Heart Failure disorder, maximum f-score for the New Treatments weighing method is 0.503, which occurs at 80 treatments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 14:30:18 GMT  (350kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01574v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["prakash reddy putta", "john j dzak iii", "siddhartha r jonnalagadda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01574"}
