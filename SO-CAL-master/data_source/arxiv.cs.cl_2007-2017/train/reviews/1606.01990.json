Surface features achieve good performance, but they are not readily applicable to other languages without semantic lexicons. Previous neural models require parses, surface features, or a small label set to work well. Here, we propose neural network models that are based on feedforward and long-short term memory architecture without any surface features. To our surprise, our best configured feedforward architecture outperforms LSTM-based model in most cases despite thorough tuning. Under various fine-grained label sets and a cross-linguistic setting, our feedforward models perform consistently better or at least just as well as systems that require hand-crafted surface features. Our models present the first neural Chinese discourse parser in the style of Chinese Discourse Treebank, showing that our results hold cross-linguistically.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 01:17:00 GMT  (118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01990v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["attapol t rutherford", "vera demberg", "nianwen xue"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01990"}
