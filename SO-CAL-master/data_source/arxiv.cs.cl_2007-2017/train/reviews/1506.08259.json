Experiments over three Twitter benchmark datasets achieve state-of-the-art results, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the enhancements.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Jun 2015 04:51:18 GMT  (106kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08259v1", "To appear in ACL 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 00:43:39 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08259v2", "To appear in ACL 2015"], ["v3", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 01:14:20 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08259v3", "To appear in ACL 2015, Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["afshin rahimi", "trevor cohn", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.08259"}
