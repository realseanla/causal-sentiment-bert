{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Nov-2016", "title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence. In this paper we present a faster and conceptually simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers. This allows to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies. We achieve a new state-of-the-art on WMT'16 English-Romanian translation and outperform several recently published results on the WMT'15 English-German task. We also achieve almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation. Our convolutional encoder speeds up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bi-directional LSTM baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 23:46:45 GMT  (175kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02344v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 01:45:37 GMT  (175kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02344v2", "13 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 01:36:14 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02344v3", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jonas gehring", "michael auli", "david grangier", "yann dauphin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.02344"}
