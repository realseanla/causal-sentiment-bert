We show that this relationship is the result of a misspecified model that does not consider the temporal aspect of the data by presenting a similar but nonsensical relationship between the global annual mean sea level and lexical diversity. Given the fact that in the recent past, several studies were published that seem to suffer from this problem, we explain the cause of the misspecification and show that it has profound consequences. We demonstrate how simple transformation of the time series can often solve problems of this type and argue that the evaluation of the plausibility of a relationship is important in this context. We hope that our paper will help both researchers and reviewers to understand why it is important to use special models for the analysis of data with a natural temporal ordering.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 09:39:24 GMT  (1114kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02014v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 07:48:26 GMT  (1101kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02014v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexander koplenig", "carolin mueller-spitzer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02014"}
