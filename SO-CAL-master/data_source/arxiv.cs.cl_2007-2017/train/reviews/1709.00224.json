Here we make two contributions to this framework. The first is to show how a type of logical inference can be performed by evaluating conditional probabilities. The second is to make these calculations tractable by means of a variational approximation. This approximation also enables faster convergence during training, allowing us to close the gap with state-of-the-art vector space models when evaluating on semantic similarity. We demonstrate promising performance on two tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 09:55:44 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00224v1", "Conference on Logic and Machine Learning in Natural Language (LaML)"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference on Logic and Machine Learning in Natural Language (LaML)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["guy emerson", "ann copestake"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00224"}
