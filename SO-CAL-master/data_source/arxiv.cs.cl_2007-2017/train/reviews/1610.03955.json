However, it is unwise to track all previous utterances in the current session as not all of them are equally important. In this paper, we address the problem of session segmentation. We propose an embedding-enhanced TextTiling approach, inspired by the observation that conversation utterances are highly noisy, and that word embeddings provide a robust way of capturing semantics. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better performance than the TextTiling, MMD approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 07:07:50 GMT  (403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03955v1", "INTERSPEECH-16, pages 2706--2710"]], "COMMENTS": "INTERSPEECH-16, pages 2706--2710", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["yiping song", "lili mou", "rui yan", "li yi", "zinan zhu", "xiaohua hu", "ming zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03955"}
