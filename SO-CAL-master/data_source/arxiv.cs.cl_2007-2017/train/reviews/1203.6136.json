Many varieties of tree transducers have been explored in the automata theory literature, and more recently, in the machine translation literature. In this paper I review T and xT transducers, situate them among related formalisms, and show how they can be used to implement rules for machine translation systems that cover all of the cross-language structural divergences described in Bonnie Dorr's influential article on the topic. I also present an implementation of xT transduction, suitable and convenient for experimenting with translation rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Mar 2012 02:13:39 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6136v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alex rudnick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.6136"}
