The purpose of this segment of the project was to develop specific tools that would allow for automatic and semi-automatic processing of large quantities of acoustic speech data. The tools include the following: grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, speech-to-text alignment, voice activity detection, speaker diarization, keyword spotting and automatic speech transcription. Furthermore, in order to develop these tools, a large high-quality studio speech corpus was recorded and released under an open license, to encourage development in the area of Polish speech research. Another purpose of the corpus was to serve as a reference for studies in phonetics and pronunciation. All the tools and resources were released on the the Polish CLARIN website. This paper discusses the current status and future plans for the project.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 10:27:07 GMT  (561kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00245v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["danijel kor\\v{z}inek", "krzysztof marasek", "{\\l}ukasz brocki", "krzysztof wo{\\l}k"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00245"}
