We show that subword-level pivot translation via a related pivot language is: (i) highly competitive with the best direct translation model and (ii) better than a pivot model which uses an unrelated pivot language, but has at its disposal large parallel corpora to build the source-pivot (S-P) and pivot-target (P-T) translation models. In contrast, pivot models trained at word and morpheme level are far inferior to their direct counterparts. We also show that using multiple related pivot languages can outperform a direct translation model. Thus, the use of subwords as translation units coupled with the use of multiple related pivot languages can compensate for the lack of a direct parallel corpus. Subword units make pivot models competitive by (i) utilizing lexical similarity to improve the underlying S-P and P-T translation models, and (ii) reducing loss of translation candidates during pivoting.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 13:13:53 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07203v1", "Submitted to ACL 2017, 10 pages, 9 tables"], ["v2", "Wed, 4 Oct 2017 20:55:03 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07203v2", "Accepted at IJCNLP 2017, 7 pages, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ACL 2017, 10 pages, 9 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["anoop kunchukuttan", "maulik shah", "pradyot prakash", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07203"}
