Our model uses bidirectional LSTMs to learn feature representations shared for both POS tagging and dependency parsing tasks, thus handling the feature-engineering problem. Our extensive experiments, on 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies project, show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art neural network-based Stack-propagation model for joint POS tagging and transition-based dependency parsing, resulting in a new state of the art. Our code is open-source and available at:", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 23:09:00 GMT  (53kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05952v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 18:25:57 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05952v2", "v2: also include universal POS tagging, UAS and LAS accuracies w.r.t gold-standard segmentation on Universal Dependencies 2.0 - CoNLL 2017 shared task test data; in CoNLL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dat quoc nguyen", "mark dras", "mark johnson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05952"}
