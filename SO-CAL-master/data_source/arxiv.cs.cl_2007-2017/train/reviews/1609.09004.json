The system uses only byte representations in a deep residual network (ResNet). The system, named ResIdent, is trained only on the data released with the task (closed training). We obtain 84.88% accuracy on subtask A, 68.80% accuracy on subtask B1, and 69.80% accuracy on subtask B2. A large difference in accuracy on development data can be observed with relatively minor changes in our network's architecture and hyperparameters. We therefore expect fine-tuning of these parameters to yield higher accuracies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 16:51:56 GMT  (146kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09004v1", "6 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1609.07053"], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 15:28:29 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09004v2", "7 pages.
