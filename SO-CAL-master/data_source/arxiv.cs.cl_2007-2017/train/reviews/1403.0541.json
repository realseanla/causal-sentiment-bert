Diseases occur when normal functionality of these processes is disrupted. Thus, understanding these biochemical processes and their interrelationships is a primary task in biomedical research and a prerequisite for diagnosing diseases, and drug development. Scientists studying these processes have identified various pathways responsible for drug metabolism, and signal transduction, etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 19:45:41 GMT  (707kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0541v1", "thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CE cs.CL", "authors": ["saadat anwar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0541"}
