However, this data may contain errors and consequently systems trained using distant supervision tend not to perform as well as those based on manually labelled data. This work proposes a novel method for detecting potential false negative training examples using a knowledge inference method. Results show that our approach improves the performance of relation extraction systems trained using distantly supervised data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Sep 2015 12:59:05 GMT  (43kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03739v1", "In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers)"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 2: Short Papers)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["roland roller", "eneko agirre", "aitor soroa", "mark stevenson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.03739"}
