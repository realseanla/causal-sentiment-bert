{"conference": "aaai", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jul-2017", "title": "In-Order Transition-based Constituent Parsing", "abstract": "Both bottom-up and top-down strategies have been used for neural transition-based constituent parsing. The parsing strategies differ in terms of the order in which they recognize productions in the derivation tree, where bottom-up strategies and top-down strategies take post-order and pre-order traversal over trees, respectively. Bottom-up parsers benefit from rich features from readily built partial parses, but lack lookahead guidance in the parsing process; top-down parsers benefit from non-local guidance for local decisions, but rely on a strong encoder over the input to predict a constituent hierarchy before its construction.To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel parsing system based on in-order traversal over syntactic trees, designing a set of transition actions to find a compromise between bottom-up constituent information and top-down lookahead information. Based on stack-LSTM, our psycholinguistically motivated constituent parsing system achieves 91.8 F1 on WSJ benchmark. Furthermore, the system achieves 93.6 F1 with supervised reranking and 94.2 F1 with semi-supervised reranking, which are the best results on the WSJ benchmark.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 04:27:11 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05000v1", "Accepted by TACL"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by TACL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jiangming liu", "yue zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.05000"}
