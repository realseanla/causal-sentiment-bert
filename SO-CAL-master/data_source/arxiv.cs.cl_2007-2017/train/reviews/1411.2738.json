The vector representations of words learned by word2vec models have been proven to be able to carry semantic meanings and are useful in various NLP tasks. As an increasing number of researchers would like to experiment with word2vec, I notice that there lacks a material that comprehensively explains the parameter learning process of word2vec in details, thus preventing many people with less neural network experience from understanding how exactly word2vec works.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 09:24:00 GMT  (242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 19:33:04 GMT  (569kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 21:35:51 GMT  (569kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 5 Jun 2016 07:17:40 GMT  (569kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2738v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xin rong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2738"}
