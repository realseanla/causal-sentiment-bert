To address this, we propose to augment traditional features used for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection, with cognitive features derived from the eye-movement patterns of readers. Statistical classification using our enhanced feature set improves the performance (F-score) of polarity detection by a maximum of 3.7% and 9.3% on two datasets, over the systems that use only traditional features. We perform feature significance analysis, and experiment on a held-out dataset, showing that cognitive features indeed empower sentiment analyzers to handle complex constructs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 19:58:26 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05581v1", "The SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "The SIGNLL Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["abhijit mishra", "diptesh kanojia", "seema nagar", "kuntal dey", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.05581"}
