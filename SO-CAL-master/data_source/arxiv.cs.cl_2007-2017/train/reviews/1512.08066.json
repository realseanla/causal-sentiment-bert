The proposed algorithm is based on the comparative study of English and Korean negative sentences.

We established a new algorithm for the negative sentence translation and evaluated it.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Dec 2015 01:52:03 GMT  (415kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08066v1", "9 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chung-hyok jang", "kwang-hyok kim foreign language faculty", "kim il sung university", "computer science college", "kim il sung university)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.08066"}
