In contrast to most modern neural systems of translation, which discard the identity for rare words, in this paper we propose several architectures for learning word representations from character and morpheme level word decompositions. We incorporate these representations in a novel machine translation model which jointly learns word alignments and translations via a hard attention mechanism. Evaluating on translating from several morphologically rich languages into English, we show consistent improvements over strong baseline methods, of between 1 and 1.5 BLEU points.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:04:37 GMT  (382kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04217v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL", "authors": ["ekaterina vylomova", "trevor cohn", "xuanli he", "gholamreza haffari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04217"}
