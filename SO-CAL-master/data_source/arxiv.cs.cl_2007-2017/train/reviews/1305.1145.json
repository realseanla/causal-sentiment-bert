From the phonological point of view, it little can be said on the basis of the waveform itself. However, past research in mathematics, acoustics, and speech technology have provided many methods for converting data that can be considered as information if interpreted correctly. In order to find some statistically relevant information from incoming data, it is important to have mechanisms for reducing the information of each segment in the audio signal into a relatively small number of parameters, or features. These features should describe each segment in such a characteristic way that other similar segments can be grouped together by comparing their features. There are enormous interesting and exceptional ways to describe the speech signal in terms of parameters. Though, they all have their strengths and weaknesses, we have presented some of the most used methods with their importance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 May 2013 10:42:34 GMT  (239kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1145v1", "Pages: 9 Figures : 3"]], "COMMENTS": "Pages: 9 Figures : 3", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["urmila shrawankar", "v m thakare"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1145"}
