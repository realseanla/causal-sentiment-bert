In particular, dependency parsers perform poorly in coordination construction (i.e., correctly attaching the \"conj\" relation). We extend a state-of-the-art dependency parser with conjunction-specific features, focusing on the similarity between the conjuncts head words. Training the extended parser yields an improvement in \"conj\" attachment as well as in overall dependency parsing accuracy on the Stanford dependency conversion of the Penn TreeBank.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 10:10:44 GMT  (224kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06733v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jessica ficler", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06733"}
