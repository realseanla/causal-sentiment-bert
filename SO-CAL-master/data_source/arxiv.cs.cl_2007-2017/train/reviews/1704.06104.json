We frame the problem as a token-based dependency parsing as well as a token-based sequence tagging model, including a multi-task learning setup. Contrary to models that operate on the argument component level, we find that framing the problem as dependency parsing leads to subpar performance results. In contrast, less complex (local) tagging models based on BiLSTMs perform robustly across classification scenarios, being able to catch long-range dependencies inherent to the argumentation mining problem. Moreover, we find that jointly learning 'natural' subtasks, in a multi-task learning setup, improves performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 12:20:43 GMT  (62kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06104v1", "To be published at ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 12:20:45 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06104v2", "To be published at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["steffen eger", "johannes daxenberger", "iryna gurevych"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06104"}
