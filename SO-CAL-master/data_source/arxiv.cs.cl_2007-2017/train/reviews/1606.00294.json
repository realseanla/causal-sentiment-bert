We change the PTB representation of ACC to be more suitable for learning by a statistical PCFG parser, affecting 125 trees in the training set. Training on the modified trees yields a slight improvement in EVALB scores on sections 22 and 23. The main evaluation is on a corpus of 4th grade science exams, in which ACC structures are prevalent. On this corpus, we obtain an impressive x2.7 improvement in recovering ACC structures compared to a parser trained on the original PTB trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 14:06:41 GMT  (195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00294v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jessica ficler", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00294"}
