When used for single-document summarization, our approach, combined with the \"beginning of document\" heuristic, outperforms a state-of-the-art summarizer and the beginning-of-article baseline in both automatic and manual evaluations. These results represent an important advance because in the absence of cross-document repetition, single document summarizers for news have not been able to consistently outperform the strong beginning-of-article baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Feb 2017 08:07:26 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07998v1", "Accepted By EACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted By EACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yinfei yang", "forrest sheng bao", "ani nenkova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07998"}
