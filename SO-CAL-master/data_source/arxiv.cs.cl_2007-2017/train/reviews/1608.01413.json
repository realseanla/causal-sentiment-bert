This is the first algorithmic approach that can handle arithmetic problems with multiple steps and operations, without depending on additional annotations or predefined templates. We develop a theory for expression trees that can be used to represent and evaluate the target arithmetic expressions; we use it to uniquely decompose the target arithmetic problem to multiple classification problems; we then compose an expression tree, combining these with world knowledge through a constrained inference framework. Our classifiers gain from the use of {\\em quantity schemas} that supports better extraction of features. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing systems, achieving state of the art performance on benchmark datasets of arithmetic word problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Aug 2016 01:47:23 GMT  (143kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01413v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 20 Aug 2016 11:50:41 GMT  (153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01413v2", "EMNLP 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["subhro roy", "dan roth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.01413"}
