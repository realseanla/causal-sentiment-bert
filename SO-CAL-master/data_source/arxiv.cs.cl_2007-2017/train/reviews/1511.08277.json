Existing deep models rely on a single sentence representation or multiple granularity representations for matching. However, such methods cannot well capture the contextualized local information in the matching process. To tackle this problem, we present a new deep architecture to match two sentences with multiple positional sentence representations. Specifically, each positional sentence representation is a sentence representation at this position, generated by a bidirectional long short term memory (Bi-LSTM). The matching score is finally produced by aggregating interactions between these different positional sentence representations, through $k$-Max pooling and a multi-layer perceptron. Our model has several advantages: (1) By using Bi-LSTM, rich context of the whole sentence is leveraged to capture the contextualized local information in each positional sentence representation; (2) By matching with multiple positional sentence representations, it is flexible to aggregate different important contextualized local information in a sentence to support the matching; (3) Experiments on different tasks such as question answering and sentence completion demonstrate the superiority of our model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 02:57:54 GMT  (161kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08277v1", "Accepted by AAAI-2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by AAAI-2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["shengxian wan", "yanyan lan", "jiafeng guo", "jun xu", "liang pang", "xueqi cheng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.08277"}
