We propose to use word embeddings to perform word alignment for segment-level MT evaluation. We performed experiments with three types of alignment methods using word embeddings. We evaluated our proposed methods with various translation datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed methods outperform previous word embeddings-based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Apr 2017 22:36:56 GMT  (141kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00380v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["junki matsuo", "mamoru komachi", "katsuhito sudoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00380"}
