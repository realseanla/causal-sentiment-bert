The main goal of the field is to discover which sets of possible phenomena are universal, and which are merely frequent. For example, all languages have vowels, while most---but not all---languages have an /u/ sound. In this paper we present the first probabilistic treatment of a basic question in phonological typology: What makes a natural vowel inventory? We introduce a series of deep stochastic point processes, and contrast them with previous computational, simulation-based approaches. We provide a comprehensive suite of experiments on over 200 distinct languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 May 2017 03:13:03 GMT  (1106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01684v1", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ryan cotterell", "jason eisner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.01684"}
