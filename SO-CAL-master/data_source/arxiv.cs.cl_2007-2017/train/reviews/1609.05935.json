We propose a novel symbol inventory, and a novel iterated-CTC method in which a second system is used to transform a noisy initial output into a cleaner version. We present a number of stabilization and initialization methods we have found useful in training these networks. We evaluate our system on the commonly used NIST 2000 conversational telephony test set, and significantly exceed the previously published performance of similar systems, both with and without the use of an external language model and decoding technology.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 20:52:44 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05935v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 08:30:10 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05935v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["g zweig", "c yu", "j droppo", "a stolcke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05935"}
