The approach is demonstrated for text (where the data are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are real-valued). It is then extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the network to condition its predictions on a text sequence. The resulting system is able to generate highly realistic cursive handwriting in a wide variety of styles.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Aug 2013 21:04:36 GMT  (3854kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 11 Aug 2013 21:20:24 GMT  (3854kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:51:54 GMT  (3854kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 16:22:09 GMT  (3854kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 16:04:02 GMT  (3887kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850v5", "Thanks to Peng Liu and Sergey Zyrianov for various corrections"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL", "authors": ["alex graves"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0850"}
