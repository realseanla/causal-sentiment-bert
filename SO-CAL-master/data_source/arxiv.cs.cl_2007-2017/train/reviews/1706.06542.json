We implement a rank based sentence selection using continuous vector representations along with key-phrases. Furthermore, we propose a model to tackle summary coherence for increasing readability. We conduct experiments on the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004 datasets using ROUGE toolkit. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods bring significant improvements over the state of the art methods in terms of informativity and coherence.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 04:54:41 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06542v1", "6 pages, Accepted in TextGraphs-11: Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing, Workshop at ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, August 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, Accepted in TextGraphs-11: Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing, Workshop at ACL 2017, Vancouver, Canada, August 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mir tafseer nayeem", "yllias chali"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.06542"}
