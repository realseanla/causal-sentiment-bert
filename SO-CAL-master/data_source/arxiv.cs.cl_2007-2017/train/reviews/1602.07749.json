In this work, we investigate the robustness of the mention detection systems, one of the fundamental tasks in information extraction, via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The advantage of RNNs over the traditional approaches is their capacity to capture long ranges of context and implicitly adapt the word embeddings, trained on a large corpus, into a task-specific word representation, but still preserve the original semantic generalization to be helpful across domains. Our systematic evaluation for RNN architectures demonstrates that RNNs not only outperform the best reported systems (up to 9\\% relative error reduction) in the general setting but also achieve the state-of-the-art performance in the cross-domain setting for English. Regarding other languages, RNNs are significantly better than the traditional methods on the similar task of named entity recognition for Dutch (up to 22\\% relative error reduction).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 23:14:01 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07749v1", "13 pages, 11 tables, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 11 tables, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thien huu nguyen", "avirup sil", "georgiana dinu", "radu florian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07749"}
