While one new captioning approach, dense captioning, can potentially describe images in finer levels of detail by captioning many regions within an image, it in turn is unable to produce a coherent story for an image. In this paper we overcome these limitations by generating entire paragraphs for describing images, which can tell detailed, unified stories. We develop a model that decomposes both images and paragraphs into their constituent parts, detecting semantic regions in images and using a hierarchical recurrent neural network to reason about language. Linguistic analysis confirms the complexity of the paragraph generation task, and thorough experiments on a new dataset of image and paragraph pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 23:10:51 GMT  (1782kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06607v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 17:59:15 GMT  (1784kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06607v2", "CVPR 2017 spotlight"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["jonathan krause", "justin johnson", "ranjay krishna", "li fei-fei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06607"}
