{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Jun-2016", "title": "Semantic Parsing to Probabilistic Programs for Situated Question Answering", "abstract": "Situated question answering is the problem of answering questions about an environment such as an image. This problem requires interpreting both a question and the environment, and is challenging because the set of interpretations is large, typically superexponential in the number of environmental objects. Existing models handle this challenge by making strong -- and untrue -- independence assumptions. We present Parsing to Probabilistic Programs (P3), a novel situated question answering model that utilizes approximate inference to eliminate these independence assumptions and enable the use of global features of the question/environment interpretation. Our key insight is to treat semantic parses as probabilistic programs that execute nondeterministically and whose possible executions represent environmental uncertainty. We evaluate our approach on a new, publicly-released data set of 5000 science diagram questions, finding that our approach outperforms several competitive baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 19:19:29 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07046v1", "EMNLP 2016 submission, 10 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 00:37:43 GMT  (3772kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07046v2", "EMNLP 2016, 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2016 submission, 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jayant krishnamurthy", "oyvind tafjord", "aniruddha kembhavi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.07046"}
