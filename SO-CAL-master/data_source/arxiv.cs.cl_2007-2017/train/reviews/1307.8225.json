Blogs can be of various natures i.e. personal blogs which contain posts on mixed issues or blogs can be domain specific which contains posts on particular topics, this is the reason, they offer wide variety of relevant information which is often focused. A general search engine gives back a huge collection of web pages which may or may not give correct answers, as web is the repository of information of all kinds and a user has to go through various documents before he gets what he was originally looking for, which is a very time consuming process. So, the search can be made more focused and accurate if it is limited to blogosphere instead of web pages. The reason being that the blogs are more focused in terms of information. So, User will only get related blogs in response to his query. These results will be then ranked according to our proposed method and are finally presented in front of user in descending order", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 05:40:59 GMT  (468kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8225v1", "13 Pages.
