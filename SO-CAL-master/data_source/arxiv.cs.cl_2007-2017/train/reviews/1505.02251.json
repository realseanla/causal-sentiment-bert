Given a hierarchy of classes, two main approaches are used, to automatically classify new instances: flat classification and cascade classification. Flat classification ignores the hierarchy, while cascade classification greedily traverses the hierarchy from the root to the predicted leaf. In this paper we propose a new approach, which extends cascade classification to predict the right leaf by estimating the probability of each root-to-leaf path. We provide experimental results which indicate that, using the same classification algorithm, one can achieve better results with our approach, compared to the traditional flat and cascade classifications.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 May 2015 09:39:04 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02251v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["aris kosmopoulos", "georgios paliouras", "ion", "routsopoulos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02251"}
