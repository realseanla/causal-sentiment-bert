The corpus contains edit, add before, split, merge, add after, move and other error types. We are concerned with the first four error types as they contribute more than 90% of the spelling errors in the corpus. The proposed system has many models to address each error type on its own and then integrating all the models to provide an efficient and robust system that achieves an overall recall of 0.59, precision of 0.58 and F1 score of 0.58 including all the error types on the development set. Our system participated in the QALB 2014 shared task \"Automatic Arabic Error Correction\" and achieved an F1 score of 0.6, earning the sixth place out of nine participants.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 20:18:12 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8309v1", "System description paper that is submitted in the EMNLP 2014 conference shared task \"Automatic Arabic Error Correction\" (Mohit et al., 2014) in the Arabic NLP workshop. 6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "System description paper that is submitted in the EMNLP 2014 conference shared task \"Automatic Arabic Error Correction\" (Mohit et al., 2014) in the Arabic NLP workshop. 6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["youssef hassan", "mohamed aly", "amir atiya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8309"}
