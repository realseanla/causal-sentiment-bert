Yet the natural language generation (NLG) component for many of these systems remains largely handcrafted. This limitation greatly restricts the range of applications; it also means that it is impossible to take advantage of recent work in expressive and statistical language generation that can dynamically and automatically produce a large number of variations of given content. We propose that a solution to this problem lies in new methods for developing language generation resources. We describe the ES-Translator, a computational language generator that has previously been applied only to fables, and quantitatively evaluate the domain independence of the EST by applying it to personal narratives from weblogs. We then take advantage of recent work on language generation to create a parameterized sentence planner for story generation that provides aggregation operations, variations in discourse and in point of view. Finally, we present a user evaluation of different personal narrative retellings.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 03:11:20 GMT  (667kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08580v1", "SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "SIGdial Meeting on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stephanie m lukin", "lena i reed", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08580"}
