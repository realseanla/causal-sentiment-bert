In contrast to traditional, monologic resources such as news, highly social dialogue is very frequent in social media. We aim to automatically identify sarcastic and nasty utterances in unannotated online dialogue, extending a bootstrapping method previously applied to the classification of monologic subjective sentences in Riloff and Weibe 2003. We have adapted the method to fit the sarcastic and nasty dialogic domain. Our method is as follows: 1) Explore methods for identifying sarcastic and nasty cue words and phrases in dialogues; 2) Use the learned cues to train a sarcastic (nasty) Cue-Based Classifier; 3) Learn general syntactic extraction patterns from the sarcastic (nasty) utterances and define fine-tuned sarcastic patterns to create a Pattern-Based Classifier; 4) Combine both Cue-Based and fine-tuned Pattern-Based Classifiers to maximize precision at the expense of recall and test on unannotated utterances.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 02:21:48 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08575v1", "Pacific Northwest Natural Language Processing Workshop (NWNLP 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Pacific Northwest Natural Language Processing Workshop (NWNLP 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stephanie m lukin", "luke eisenberg", "thomas corcoran", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08575"}
