At every step, the decoder uses this mechanism to focus on different parts of the source sentence to gather the most useful information before outputting its target word. Recently, the effectiveness of the attention mechanism has also been explored for multimodal tasks, where it becomes possible to focus both on sentence parts and image regions that they describe. In this paper, we compare several attention mechanism on the multimodal translation task (English, image to German) and evaluate the ability of the model to make use of images to improve translation. We surpass state-of-the-art scores on the Multi30k data set, we nevertheless identify and report different misbehavior of the machine while translating.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 13:57:04 GMT  (1158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00995v1", "Accepted to EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jean-benoit delbrouck", "st\\'ephane dupont"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.00995"}
