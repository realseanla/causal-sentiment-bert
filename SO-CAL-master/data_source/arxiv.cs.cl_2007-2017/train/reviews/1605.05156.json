This holds true for communication on any platform, including social media platforms such as Twitter. In this paper, we explored speech act recognition on Twitter by treating it as a multi-class classification problem. We created a taxonomy of six speech acts for Twitter and proposed a set of semantic and syntactic features. We trained and tested a logistic regression classifier using a data set of manually labelled tweets. Our method achieved a state-of-the-art performance with an average F1 score of more than $0.70$. We also explored classifiers with three different granularities (Twitter-wide, type-specific and topic-specific) in order to find the right balance between generalization and overfitting for our task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 May 2016 13:31:14 GMT  (181kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05156v1", "ICWSM'16, May 17-20, Cologne, Germany.
