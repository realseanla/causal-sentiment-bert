We propose a very simple feature construction algorithm that potentially overcomes many weaknesses in current distributional vector representations and other composite document representation methods widely used for text representation. Through extensive experiments on multi-class classification on 20newsgroup dataset and multi-label text classification on Reuters-21578, we achieve better performance results and also a significant reduction in training and prediction time compared to composite document representation methods gwBoWV and TWE Liu et al., 2015b.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 17:38:57 GMT  (375kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06778v1", "Submitted to proceedings of EACL 2017"], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Jan 2017 17:26:54 GMT  (376kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06778v2", "Submitted to proceedings of EACL 2017.
