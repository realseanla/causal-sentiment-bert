As syntactically complex sentences often pose a challenge for current Open RE approaches, we have developed a simplification framework that performs a pre-processing step by taking a single sentence as input and using a set of syntactic-based transformation rules to create a textual input that is easier to process for subsequently applied Open RE systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 11:15:58 GMT  (141kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09013v1", "26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["christina niklaus", "bernhard bermeitinger", "siegfried handschuh", "r\\'e freitas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09013"}
