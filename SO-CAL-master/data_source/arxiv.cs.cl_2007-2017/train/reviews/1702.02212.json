This framework is the first to consider vocabulary-wide syntactico-semantic information for this task. We also analyze the deficiencies of available benchmarking datasets and introduce our own dataset that was created on the basis of compositionality. We validate our algorithm across datasets and present state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 21:49:13 GMT  (121kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02212v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Feb 2017 00:13:28 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02212v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 1 May 2017 12:36:34 GMT  (129kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02212v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tarek sakakini", "suma bhat", "pramod viswanath"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.02212"}
