In this work, we propose a novel framework called AC-BLSTM for modeling setences and documents, which combines the asymmetric convolution neural network (ACNN) with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BLSTM). Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all six tasks, including sentiment analysis, question type classification, and subjectivity classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 03:39:52 GMT  (112kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01884v1", "7 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Dec 2016 03:22:12 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01884v2", "7 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 03:47:15 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01884v3", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["depeng liang", "yongdong zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01884"}
