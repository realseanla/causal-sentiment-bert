{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Mar-2016", "title": "Harnessing Deep Neural Networks with Logic Rules", "abstract": "Combining deep neural networks with structured logic rules is desirable to harness flexibility and reduce unpredictability of the neural models. We propose a general framework capable of enhancing various types of neural networks (e.g., CNNs and RNNs) with declarative first-order logic rules. Specifically, we develop an iterative distillation method that transfers the structured information of logic rules into the weights of neural networks. We deploy the framework on a CNN for sentiment analysis, and an RNN for named entity recognition. With a few highly intuitive rules, we obtain substantial improvements and achieve state-of-the-art or comparable results to previous best-performing systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 03:33:20 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06318v1", "18 pages, 3 figures.
