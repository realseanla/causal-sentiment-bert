We demonstrate its superiority over classical text classification approaches, including traditional classifier ensembles. The method consists in combining a document categorization technique with a single classifier or a classifier ensemble (SEMCOM algorithm - Committee with Semantic Categorizer).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Jan 2017 14:02:19 GMT  (82kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04292v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["piotr borkowski", "krzysztof ciesielski", "mieczys{\\l}aw a k{\\l}opotek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04292"}
