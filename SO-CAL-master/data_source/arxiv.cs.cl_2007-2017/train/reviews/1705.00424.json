However, parallel data is not readily available for many languages, limiting the applicability of these approaches. We address these drawbacks in our framework which takes advantage of cross-lingual word embeddings trained solely on a high coverage bilingual dictionary. We propose a novel neural network model for joint training from both sources of data based on cross-lingual word embeddings, and show substantial empirical improvements over baseline techniques. We also propose several active learning heuristics, which result in improvements over competitive benchmark methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 05:58:56 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00424v1", "5 pages with 2 pages reference.
