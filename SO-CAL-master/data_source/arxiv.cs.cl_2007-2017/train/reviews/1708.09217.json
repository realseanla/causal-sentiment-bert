However, we find that the generation of a target word does not only depend on the source sentence, but also rely heavily on the previous generated target words, especially the distant words which are difficult to model by using recurrent neural networks. To solve this problem, we propose in this paper a novel look-ahead attention mechanism for generation in NMT, which aims at directly capturing the dependency relationship between target words. We further design three patterns to integrate our look-ahead attention into the conventional attention model. Experiments on NIST Chinese-to-English and WMT English-to-German translation tasks show that our proposed look-ahead attention mechanism achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 11:27:02 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09217v1", "12 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["long zhou", "jiajun zhang", "chengqing zong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09217"}
