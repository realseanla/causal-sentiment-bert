Documents clustering aim to automatically group similar documents in one cluster using different similarity/distance measures. This task is often affected by the documents length, useful information on the documents is often accompanied by a large amount of noise, and therefore it is necessary to eliminate this noise while keeping useful information to boost the performance of Documents clustering. In this paper, we propose to evaluate the impact of text summarization using the Latent Semantic Analysis Model on Arabic Documents Clustering in order to solve problems cited above, using five similarity/distance measures: Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Coefficient, Pearson Correlation Coefficient and Averaged Kullback-Leibler Divergence, for two times: without and with stemming. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed approach effectively solves the problems of noisy information and documents length, and thus significantly improve the clustering performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 23:24:37 GMT  (260kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1612v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["hanane froud", "abdelmonaime lachkar", "said alaoui ouatik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1612"}
