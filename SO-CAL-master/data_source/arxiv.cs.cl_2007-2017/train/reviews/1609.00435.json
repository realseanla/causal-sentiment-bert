However, our understanding of citation behavior has been limited to small-scale manual citation analysis. We perform the largest behavioral study of citations to date, analyzing how citations are both framed and taken up by scholars in one entire field: natural language processing. We introduce a new dataset of nearly 2,000 citations annotated for function and centrality, and use it to develop a state-of-the-art classifier and label the entire ACL Reference Corpus. We then study how citations are framed by authors and use both papers and online traces to track how citations are followed by readers. We demonstrate that authors are sensitive to discourse structure and publication venue when citing, that online readers follow temporal links to previous and future work rather than methodological links, and that how a paper cites related work is predictive of its citation count. Finally, we use changes in citation roles to show that the field of NLP is undergoing a significant increase in consensus.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 00:40:15 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00435v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["david jurgens", "srijan kumar", "raine hoover", "dan mcfarland", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00435"}
