Our compression system first automatically derives the syntactic structure of each sentence and the overall discourse structure of the text given as input. The system then uses a statistical hierarchical model of text production in order to drop non-important syntactic and discourse constituents so as to generate coherent, grammatical document compressions of arbitrary length. The system outperforms both a baseline and a sentence-based compression system that operates by simplifying sequentially all sentences in a text. Our results support the claim that discourse knowledge plays an important role in document summarization.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jul 2009 22:26:47 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0806v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hal daum\\'e iii", "daniel marcu"], "accepted": true, "id": "0907.0806"}
