In standard topic models, a topic (such as sports, business, or politics) is viewed as a probability distribution $\\vec a_i$ over words, and a document is generated by first selecting a mixture $\\vec w$ over topics, and then generating words i.i.d. from the associated mixture $A{\\vec w}$. Given a large collection of such documents, the goal is to recover the topic vectors and then to correctly classify new documents according to their topic mixture.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 03:45:03 GMT  (1119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01259v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.DS cs.IR", "authors": ["avrim blum", "nika haghtalab"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01259"}
