Such empirical approaches allow statistical evaluation of a much larger set of hypothesis about phonetic variation and its conditioning factors (among them geographical / dialectal variants). This paper illustrates this vision and proposes to challenge automatic methods for the analysis of a not easily observable phenomenon: vowel length contrast. We focus on Wolof, an under-resourced language from Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, we propose multiple features to make a fine evaluation of the degree of length contrast under different factors such as: read vs semi spontaneous speech ; standard vs dialectal Wolof. Our measures made fully automatically on more than 20k vowel tokens show that our proposed features can highlight different degrees of contrast for each vowel considered. We notably show that contrast is weaker in semi-spontaneous speech and in a non standard semi-spontaneous dialect.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 19:20:50 GMT  (1003kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00465v1", "Accepted to Interspeech 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to Interspeech 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["elodie gauthier", "laurent besacier", "sylvie voisin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00465"}
