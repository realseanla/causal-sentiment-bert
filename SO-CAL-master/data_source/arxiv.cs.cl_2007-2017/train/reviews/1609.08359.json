{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Sep-2016", "title": "emoji2vec: Learning Emoji Representations from their Description", "abstract": "Many current natural language processing applications for social media rely on representation learning and utilize pre-trained word embeddings. There currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has increased. In this paper we release emoji2vec, pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emoji which are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing applications alongside word2vec. We demonstrate, for the downstream task of sentiment analysis, that emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in which emoji need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 11:32:25 GMT  (2655kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08359v1", "7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, In Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media at EMNLP 2016 (SocialNLP at EMNLP 2016)"], ["v2", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 22:43:46 GMT  (2655kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08359v2", "7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, In Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media at EMNLP 2016 (SocialNLP at EMNLP 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures, 1 table, In Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media at EMNLP 2016 (SocialNLP at EMNLP 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ben eisner", "tim rockt\\\"aschel", "isabelle augenstein", "matko bo\\v{s}njak", "sebastian riedel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08359"}
