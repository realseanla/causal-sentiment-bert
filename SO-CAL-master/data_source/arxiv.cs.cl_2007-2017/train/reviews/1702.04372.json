Recent work exploits such annotations to produce speech-to-translation alignments, without access to any text transcriptions. We investigate whether providing such information can aid in producing better (mismatched) crowdsourced transcriptions, which in turn could be valuable for training speech recognition systems, and show that they can indeed be beneficial through a small-scale case study as a proof-of-concept. We also present a simple phonetically aware string averaging technique that produces transcriptions of higher quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 20:06:15 GMT  (450kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04372v1", "to be presented at ComputEL-2"]], "COMMENTS": "to be presented at ComputEL-2", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["antonios anastasopoulos", "david chiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04372"}
