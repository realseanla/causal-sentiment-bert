However, adapting these models to other languages has met with difficulties. Previous comparative work has shown that Modern Arabic is one of the most difficult languages to parse due to rich morphology and free word order. Classical Arabic is the ancient form of Arabic, and is understudied in computational linguistics, relative to its worldwide reach as the language of the Quran. The thesis is based on seven publications that make significant contributions to knowledge relating to annotating and parsing Classical Arabic.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 00:53:03 GMT  (4384kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07193v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kais dukes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07193"}
