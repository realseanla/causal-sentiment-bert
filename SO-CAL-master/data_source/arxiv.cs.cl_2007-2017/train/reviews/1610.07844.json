A common approach is to normalize the spelling of historical words to modern forms. We explore the suitability of a deep neural network architecture for this task, particularly a deep bi-LSTM network applied on a character level. Our model compares well to previously established normalization algorithms when evaluated on a diverse set of texts from Early New High German. We show that multi-task learning with additional normalization data can improve our model's performance further.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 12:30:26 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07844v1", "Accepted to COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marcel bollmann", "anders s{\\o}gaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07844"}
