In our first approach, we modify a popular and widely cited Persian document summarization framework to see how it works on a realistic corpus of news articles. Human evaluation on generated summaries shows that graph-based methods perform better than the modified systems. We carry this intuition forward in our second approach, and probe deeper into the nature of graph-based systems by designing several summarizers based on centrality measures. Ad hoc evaluation using ROUGE score on these summarizers suggests that there is a small class of centrality measures that perform better than three strong unsupervised baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 23:32:41 GMT  (1132kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03143v1", "42 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "42 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["saeid parvandeh", "shibamouli lahiri", "fahimeh boroumand"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03143"}
