This paper presents a Recurrent Neural Network based Encoder-Decoder architecture, in which an LSTM-based decoder is introduced to select, aggregate semantic elements produced by an attention mechanism over the input elements, and to produce the required utterances. The proposed generator can be jointly trained both sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language sentences. The proposed model was extensively evaluated on four different NLG datasets. The experimental results showed that the proposed generators not only consistently outperform the previous methods across all the NLG domains but also show an ability to generalize from a new, unseen domain and learn from multi-domain datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 01:06:17 GMT  (222kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00139v1", "has been accepted to appear at CoNLL 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 05:54:56 GMT  (222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00139v2", "has been accepted to appear at CoNLL 2017"], ["v3", "Sat, 12 Aug 2017 15:41:14 GMT  (1164kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00139v3", "has been accepted to appear at CoNLL 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1706.06714"]], "COMMENTS": "has been accepted to appear at CoNLL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["van-khanh tran", "le-minh nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00139"}
