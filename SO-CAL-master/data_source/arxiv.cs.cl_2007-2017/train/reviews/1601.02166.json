In cross-lingual part-of-speech (POS) tagging, our target language training data consists of sequences of sentences with word-by-word labels projected from translations in $k$ languages for which we have labeled data, via word alignments. Our training data is therefore very noisy, and if Rademacher complexity is high, learning algorithms are prone to overfit. Norm-based regularization assumes a constant width and zero mean prior. We instead propose to use the $k$ source language models to estimate the parameters of a Gaussian prior for learning new POS taggers. This leads to significantly better performance in multi-source transfer set-ups. We also present a drop-out version that injects (empirical) Gaussian noise during online learning. Finally, we note that using empirical Gaussian priors leads to much lower Rademacher complexity, and is superior to optimally weighted model interpolation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Jan 2016 23:34:05 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02166v1", "Presented at NIPS 2015 Workshop on Transfer and Multi-Task Learning"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at NIPS 2015 Workshop on Transfer and Multi-Task Learning", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["anders s{\\o}gaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02166"}
