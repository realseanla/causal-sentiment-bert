We focus on a recent dataset of question pairs annotated with binary paraphrase labels and show that a variant of the decomposable attention model (Parikh et al., 2016) results in accurate performance on this task, while being far simpler than many competing neural architectures. Furthermore, when the model is pretrained on a noisy dataset of automatically collected question paraphrases, it obtains the best reported performance on the dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 02:09:31 GMT  (35kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04565v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 20 Aug 2017 02:41:42 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04565v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gaurav singh tomar", "thyago duque", "oscar t\\\"ackstr\\\"om", "jakob uszkoreit", "dipanjan das"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04565"}
