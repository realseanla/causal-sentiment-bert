These studies rely on either GPS coordinates attached to individual messages, or on the user-supplied location field in each profile. In this paper, we compare these data acquisition techniques and quantify the biases that they introduce; we also measure their effects on linguistic analysis and text-based geolocation. GPS-tagging and self-reported locations yield measurably different corpora, and these linguistic differences are partially attributable to differences in dataset composition by age and gender. Using a latent variable model to induce age and gender, we show how these demographic variables interact with geography to affect language use. We also show that the accuracy of text-based geolocation varies with population demographics, giving the best results for men above the age of 40.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 15:29:26 GMT  (148kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02275v1", "in review at EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Aug 2015 15:25:59 GMT  (1051kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02275v2", "final version for EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in review at EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["umashanthi pavalanathan", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02275"}
