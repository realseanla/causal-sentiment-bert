In an effort to explore a conversational QA setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but inter-related questions. We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553 question-answer pairs in total. Existing QA systems face two major problems when evaluated on our dataset: (1) handling questions that contain coreferences to previous questions or answers, and (2) matching words or phrases in a question to corresponding entries in the associated table. We conclude by proposing strategies to handle both of these issues.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 01:54:03 GMT  (1555kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01242v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mohit iyyer", "wen-tau yih", "ming-wei chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01242"}
