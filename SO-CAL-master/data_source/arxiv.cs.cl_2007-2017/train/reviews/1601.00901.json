Meaning representation capturing all the concepts in the text may not always be available or may not be sufficiently complete. Ontologies provide a structured and reasoning-capable way to model the content of a collection of texts. In this work, we present a novel approach to joint learning of ontology and semantic parser from text. The method is based on semi-automatic induction of a context-free grammar from semantically annotated text. The grammar parses the text into semantic trees. Both, the grammar and the semantic trees are used to learn the ontology on several levels -- classes, instances, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relations. The approach was evaluated on the first sentences of Wikipedia pages describing people.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 16:56:28 GMT  (676kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00901v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["janez starc", "dunja mladeni\\'c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00901"}
