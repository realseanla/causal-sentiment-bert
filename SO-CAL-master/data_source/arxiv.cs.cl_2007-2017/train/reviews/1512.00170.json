The combination of source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models can induce a new translation model through the pivot language. However, the errors in two models may compound as noise, and still, the combined model may suffer from a serious phrase sparsity problem. In this paper, we directly employ the word lexical model in IBM models as an additional resource to augment pivot phrase table. In addition, we also propose a phrase table pruning method which takes into account both of the source and target phrasal coverage. Experimental result shows that our pruning method significantly outperforms the conventional one, which only considers source side phrasal coverage. Furthermore, by including the entries in the lexicon model, the phrase coverage increased, and we achieved improved results in Chinese-to-Japanese translation using English as pivot language.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 08:10:49 GMT  (511kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00170v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yiming cui", "conghui zhu", "xiaoning zhu", "tiejun zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.00170"}
