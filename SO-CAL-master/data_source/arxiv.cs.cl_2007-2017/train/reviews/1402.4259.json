Its name is CHAPLIN, CHAracters and PLaces Interaction Network, implemented in VB.NET. Characters and places of the narrative works are extracted in a list of raw words. Aided by the interface, the user selects names out of them. After this choice, the tool allows the user to enter some parameters, and, according to them, creates a network where the nodes are the characters and places, and the edges their interactions. Edges are labelled by performances. The output is a GV file, written in the DOT graph scripting language, which is rendered by means of the free open source software Graphviz.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 09:35:19 GMT  (445kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4259v1", "Keywords: Literary experiments, Networks, Graph Visualization Software, Text Data Analysis"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: Literary experiments, Networks, Graph Visualization Software, Text Data Analysis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL", "authors": ["roberto marazzato", "amelia carolina sparavigna"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4259"}
