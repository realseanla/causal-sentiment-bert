Here we show that seemingly minor choices made on (1) the use of pre-trained word embeddings, and (2) the representation of out-of-vocabulary tokens at test time, can turn out to have a larger impact than architectural choices on the final performance. We systematically explore several options for these choices, and provide recommendations to researchers working in this area.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 23:58:54 GMT  (698kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00993v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bhuwan dhingra", "hanxiao liu", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "william w cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00993"}
