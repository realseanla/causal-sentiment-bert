Robots similarly have access to audio and visual sensors. Recent work has shown that images and spoken captions can be mapped into a meaningful common space, allowing images to be retrieved using speech and vice versa. In this setting of images paired with untranscribed spoken captions, we consider whether computer vision systems can be used to obtain textual labels for the speech. Concretely, we use an image-to-words multi-label visual classifier to tag images with soft textual labels, and then train a neural network to map from the speech to these soft targets. We show that the resulting speech system is able to predict which words occur in an utterance---acting as a spoken bag-of-words classifier---without seeing any parallel speech and text. We find that the model often confuses semantically related words, e.g. \"man\" and \"person\", making it even more effective as a semantic keyword spotter.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 16:46:00 GMT  (569kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08136v1", "5 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables"], ["v2", "Thu, 25 May 2017 20:49:15 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08136v2", "5 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables; small updates, added link to code; accepted to Interspeech 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["herman kamper", "shane settle", "gregory shakhnarovich", "karen livescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08136"}
