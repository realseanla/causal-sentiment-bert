In this paper, we present a novel approach for extracting - in a totally automated way - a high-coverage and high-precision lexicon of roughly 37 thousand terms annotated with emotion scores, called DepecheMood. Our approach exploits in an original way 'crowd-sourced' affective annotation implicitly provided by readers of news articles from rappler.com. By providing new state-of-the-art performances in unsupervised settings for regression and classification tasks, even using a na\\\"{\\i}ve approach, our experiments show the beneficial impact of harvesting social media data for affective lexicon building.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 May 2014 13:40:47 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1605v1", "To appear at ACL 2014. 7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at ACL 2014. 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["jacopo staiano", "marco guerini"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.1605"}
