This research is grounded in a paradigmatic conception of derivational morphology where the morphological structure is a structure of the entire lexicon and not one of the individual words it contains. The discovery of this structure relies on a measure of morphological similarity between words, on formal analogy and on the properties of two morphological paradigms:", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 May 2010 08:12:12 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3902v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nabil hathout"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.3902"}
