There were three related systems in the formal evaluation which are discussed here, along with numerous post--evaluation runs. All of these systems identified synonyms between WordNet and other dictionaries by measuring the gloss overlaps between them. These systems perform better than the random baseline and one post--evaluation variation was within a respectable margin of the median result attained by all participating systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 00:36:59 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00390v1", "4 pages, Appears in the Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2016), June 2016, pp. 1328-1331, San Diego, CA"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, Appears in the Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2016), June 2016, pp. 1328-1331, San Diego, CA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ted pedersen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00390"}
