The core feature of the technique, the text readability index, embodies the hypothesis that complex text is more information-rich than the rest. When applied on tasks like biomedical relation bearing text extraction, keyphrase indexing and extracting sentences describing protein interactions, it is evident that the reduced set of text produced by text denoising is more information-rich than the rest.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 17:36:53 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8060v1", "26th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI-2013), Regina, Canada, May 29-31, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "26th Canadian Conference on Artificial Intelligence (CAI-2013), Regina, Canada, May 29-31, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["rushdi shams"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.8060"}
