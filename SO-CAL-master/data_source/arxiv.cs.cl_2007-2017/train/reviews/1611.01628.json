{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Nov-2016", "title": "Reference-Aware Language Models", "abstract": "We propose a general class of language models that treat reference as an explicit stochastic latent variable. This architecture allows models to create mentions of entities and their attributes by accessing external databases (required by, e.g., dialogue generation and recipe generation) and internal state (required by, e.g. language models which are aware of coreference). This facilitates the incorporation of information that can be accessed in predictable locations in databases or discourse context, even when the targets of the reference may be rare words. Experiments on three tasks shows our model variants based on deterministic attention.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 10:55:37 GMT  (314kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01628v1", "iclr submission"], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 22:51:28 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01628v2", "iclr submission"], ["v3", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 20:33:12 GMT  (311kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01628v3", "9 pages"], ["v4", "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 17:05:33 GMT  (967kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01628v4", "emnlp camera ready"], ["v5", "Wed, 9 Aug 2017 00:39:51 GMT  (967kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01628v5", "emnlp camera ready"]], "COMMENTS": "iclr submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zichao yang", "phil blunsom", "chris dyer", "wang ling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.01628"}
