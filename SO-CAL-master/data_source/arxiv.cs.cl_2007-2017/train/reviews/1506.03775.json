However, the problem of classifying the sentiment of user comments on news sites has not been addressed yet. News sites cover a wide range of domains including politics, sports, technology, and entertainment, in contrast to other online social sites such as forums and review sites, which are specific to a particular domain. A user associated with a news site is likely to post comments on diverse topics (e.g., politics, smartphones, and sports) or diverse entities (e.g., Obama, iPhone, or Google). Classifying the sentiment of users tied to various entities may help obtain a holistic view of their personality, which could be useful in applications such as online advertising, content personalization, and political campaign planning. In this paper, we formulate the problem of entity-specific sentiment classification of comments posted on news articles in Yahoo News and propose novel features that are specific to news comments. Experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 18:53:56 GMT  (758kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03775v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["prakhar biyani", "cornelia caragea", "narayan bhamidipati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03775"}
