Our proposal is to use derivations for evaluations, which reflect the reasoning process of the solver by explaining how the equation system was constructed. We accomplish this by developing an algorithm for checking the equivalence between two derivations, and showing how derivation annotations can be semi-automatically added to existing datasets. To make our experiments more comprehensive, we also annotated DRAW-1K , a new dataset of 1000 general algebra word problems. In total, our experiments span over 2300 algebra word problems. We found that the annotated derivation enable a superior evaluation of automatic solvers than previously used metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Sep 2016 00:38:59 GMT  (134kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07197v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 20:05:38 GMT  (134kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07197v2", "EACL 2017 long paper"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shyam upadhyay", "ming-wei chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07197"}
