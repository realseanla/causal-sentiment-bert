Specifically, we integrate both a neural language model and distributional semantics trained on large text corpora into a recent LSTM-based architecture for video description. We evaluate our approach on a collection of Youtube videos as well as two large movie description datasets showing significant improvements in grammaticality while maintaining or modestly improving descriptive quality. Further, we show that such techniques can be beneficial for describing unseen object classes with no paired training data (zeroshot captioning).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 19:01:28 GMT  (708kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01729v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 20:37:42 GMT  (1584kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01729v2", "Accepted at EMNLP 2016.
