Comparison studies of SGD, MSGD, DOWNPOUR and EASGD/EAMSGD algorithms have been presented. Experimental results show that the message passing interface based distributed framework can accelerate the convergence speed at a sublinear scale. This paper demonstrates the importance of distributed training: with 120 workers, an 83x speedup is achievable and running time is decreased from 107.9 hours to 1.3 hours, which will benefit the productivity significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 23:18:35 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01158v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 13 May 2016 15:41:54 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01158v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 4 Aug 2016 16:41:37 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01158v3", "This paper will appear in the Proceeding of The 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016), Indianapolis, USA"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.DC", "authors": ["minwei feng", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01158"}
