In fact, a review of the literature on unstructured as well as structured data revealed a deficiency in research on the abstract conceptualization required to organize relations. We believe that such an abstract conceptualization can benefit various communities and applications such as natural language processing, information extraction, machine learning and ontology engineering. In this paper, we present CEVO (i.e., a Comprehensive EVent Ontology) built on Levin's conceptual hierarchy of English verbs that categorizes verbs with the shared meaning and syntactic behavior. We present the fundamental concepts and requirements for this ontology. Furthermore, we present three use cases for demonstrating the benefits of this ontology on annotation tasks: 1) annotating relations in plain text, 2) annotating ontological properties and 3) linking textual relations to ontological properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 22:14:25 GMT  (900kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05625v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["saeedeh shekarpour", "valerie shalin", "krishnaprasad thirunarayan", "amit p sheth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.05625"}
