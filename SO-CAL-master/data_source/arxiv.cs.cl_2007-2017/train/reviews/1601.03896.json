In this survey, we classify the existing approaches based on how they conceptualize this problem, viz., models that cast description as either generation problem or as a retrieval problem over a visual or multimodal representational space. We provide a detailed review of existing models, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, we give an overview of the benchmark image datasets and the evaluation measures that have been developed to assess the quality of machine-generated image descriptions. Finally we extrapolate future directions in the area of automatic image description generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 12:50:32 GMT  (4282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03896v1", "To appear in JAIR"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 09:47:20 GMT  (4282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03896v2", "Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 55, 409-442, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in JAIR", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["raffaella bernardi", "ruket cakici", "desmond elliott", "aykut erdem", "erkut erdem", "nazli ikizler-cinbis", "frank keller", "adrian muscat", "barbara plank"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.03896"}
