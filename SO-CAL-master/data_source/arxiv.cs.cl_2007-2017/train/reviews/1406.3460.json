The Case of Koenig & Bauer AG", "abstract": "Controlled natural languages for industrial application are often regarded as a response to the challenges of translation and multilingual communication. This paper presents a quite different approach taken by Koenig &amp; Bauer AG, where the main goal was the improvement of the authoring process for technical documentation. Most importantly, this paper explores the notion of a controlled language and demonstrates how style guides can emerge from non-linguistic considerations. Moreover, it shows the transition from loose language recommendations into precise and prescriptive rules and investigates whether such rules can be regarded as a full-fledged controlled language.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 09:23:53 GMT  (13kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3460v1", "Fourth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Fourth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language (CNL 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["karolina suchowolec"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.3460"}
