We define this task as being able to classify a tweet as racist, sexist or neither. The complexity of the natural language constructs makes this task very challenging. We perform extensive experiments with multiple deep learning architectures to learn semantic word embeddings to handle this complexity. Our experiments on a benchmark dataset of 16K annotated tweets show that such deep learning methods outperform state-of-the-art char/word n-gram methods by ~18 F1 points.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 07:25:22 GMT  (25kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00188v1", "In Proceedings of ACM WWW'17 Companion, Perth, Western Australia, Apr 2017 (WWW'17), 2 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of ACM WWW'17 Companion, Perth, Western Australia, Apr 2017 (WWW'17), 2 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["pinkesh badjatiya", "shashank gupta", "manish gupta", "vasudeva varma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00188"}
