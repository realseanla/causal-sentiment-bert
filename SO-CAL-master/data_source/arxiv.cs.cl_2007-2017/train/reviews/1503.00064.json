Whereas substantial efforts have been made to tackle this problem, previous approaches focusing primarily on generating a single sentence for each image, which is not sufficient for describing complex scenes. We attempt to go beyond this, by generating coherent descriptions with multiple sentences. Our approach is distinguished from conventional ones in several aspects: (1) a 3D visual parsing system that jointly infers objects, attributes, and relations; (2) a generative grammar learned automatically from training text; and (3) a text generation algorithm that takes into account the coherence among sentences. Experiments on the augmented NYU-v2 dataset show that our framework can generate natural descriptions with substantially higher ROGUE scores compared to those produced by the baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 04:26:21 GMT  (6435kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00064v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["dahua lin", "chen kong", "sanja fidler", "raquel urtasun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00064"}
