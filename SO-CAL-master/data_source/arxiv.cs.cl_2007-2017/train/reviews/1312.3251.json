This paper describes the development of a text-based corpus for the Bishnupriya Manipuri language. A Corpus is considered as a building block for any language processing tasks. Due to the lack of awareness like other Indian languages, it is also studied less frequently. As a result the language still lacks a good corpus and basic language processing tools. As per our knowledge this is the first effort to develop a corpus for Bishnupriya Manipuri language.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 17:24:35 GMT  (859kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3251v1", "5 pages, conference at National Conference on Recent Trends in Computer Sciences at Bodoland University, 25th-26th March, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, conference at National Conference on Recent Trends in Computer Sciences at Bodoland University, 25th-26th March, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nayan jyoti kalita", "navanath saharia", "smriti kumar sinha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.3251"}
