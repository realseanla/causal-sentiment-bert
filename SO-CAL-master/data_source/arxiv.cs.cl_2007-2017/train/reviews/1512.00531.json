Given the growing assortment of sentiment measuring instruments, comparisons between them are evidently required. Here, we perform detailed tests of 6 dictionary-based methods applied to 4 different corpora, and briefly examine a further 8 methods. We show that a dictionary-based method will only perform both reliably and meaningfully if (1) the dictionary covers a sufficiently large enough portion of a given text's lexicon when weighted by word usage frequency; and (2) words are scored on a continuous scale.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 00:34:51 GMT  (4342kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00531v1", "34 pages, 30 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 17:42:46 GMT  (4583kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00531v2", "34 pages, 30 figures.
