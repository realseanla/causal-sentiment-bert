Most attempts at this problem are pipelined rather than end-to-end, sophisticated, and not self-contained: they assume gold-standard text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units), and use external parsers for syntactic features. In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse parser that jointly parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first syntacto-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank with the RST Treebank. Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint syntacto-discourse parser requires no preprocessing whatsoever (such as segmentation or feature extraction), achieves the state-of-the-art end-to-end discourse parsing accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:57:50 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08484v1", "Accepted at EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kai zhao", "liang huang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.08484"}
