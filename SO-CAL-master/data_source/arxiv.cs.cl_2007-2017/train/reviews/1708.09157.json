In the work presented here, we explore a transfer learning scheme, whereby we train character-level recurrent neural taggers to predict morphological taggings for high-resource languages and low-resource languages together. Learning joint character representations among multiple related languages successfully enables knowledge transfer from the high-resource languages to the low-resource ones, improving accuracy by up to 30%", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 08:14:34 GMT  (729kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09157v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ryan cotterell", "georg heigold"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.09157"}
