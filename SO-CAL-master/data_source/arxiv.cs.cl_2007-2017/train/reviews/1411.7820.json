The method combines three ideas: a two-level LDA model that filters out words that do not convey themes, an HMM that models the ordering of themes in the collection of documents, and language-independent concept annotations to serve as a cross-language bridge and to strengthen the connection between paragraphs in the same segment through concept relations. The method is evaluated on English and French data previously used for monolingual alignment. The results show state-of-the-art performance in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 11:33:02 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7820v1", "9 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vivi nastase", "angela fahrni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.7820"}
