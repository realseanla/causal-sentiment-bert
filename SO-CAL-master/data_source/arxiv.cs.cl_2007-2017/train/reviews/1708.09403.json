We plug our minimal feature set into the dynamic-programming framework of Huang and Sagae (2010) and Kuhlmann et al. (2011) to produce the first implementation of worst-case O(n^3) exact decoders for arc-hybrid and arc-eager transition systems. With our minimal features, we also present O(n^3) global training methods. Finally, using ensembles including our new parsers, we achieve the best unlabeled attachment score reported (to our knowledge) on the Chinese Treebank and the \"second-best-in-class\" result on the English Penn Treebank.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:01:08 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09403v1", "Proceedings of EMNLP, 2017. 12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of EMNLP, 2017. 12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tianze shi", "liang huang", "lillian lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.09403"}
