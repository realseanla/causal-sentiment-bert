Our method incorporates some of the latest advances in the study of authorship attribution, particularly techniques from support vector machines. By introducing the notion of relative frequency as a feature ranking metric our method proves to be highly effective and robust.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 04:31:11 GMT  (637kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6211v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["xianfeng hu", "yang wang", "qiang wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6211"}
