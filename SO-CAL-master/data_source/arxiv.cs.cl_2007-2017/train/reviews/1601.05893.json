In this paper we present an algorithm for location tagging of textual documents. Our approach makes use of previous work in natural language processing by using a state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagger and named entity recognizer to find blocks of text which may refer to locations. A knowledge base (OpenStreatMap) is then used to find a list of possible locations for each block. Finally, one location is chosen for each block by assigning distance-based scores to each location and repeatedly selecting the location and block with the best score. We tested our geolocation algorithm with Wikipedia articles about topics with a well-defined geographical location that are geotagged by the articles' authors, where classification approaches have achieved median errors as low as 11 km, with attainable accuracy limited by the class size. Our approach achieved a 10th percentile error of 490 metres and median error of 54 kilometres on the Wikipedia dataset we used. When considering the five location tags with the greatest scores, 50% of articles were assigned at least one tag within 8.5 kilometres of the article's author-assigned true location. We also tested our approach on Twitter messages that are tagged with the location from which the message was sent. Twitter texts are challenging because they are short and unstructured and often do not contain words referring to the location they were sent from, but we obtain potentially useful results. We explain how we use the Spark framework for data analytics to collect and process our test data. In general, classification-based approaches for location tagging may be reaching their upper accuracy limit, but our precision-focused approach has high accuracy for some texts and shows significant potential for improvement overall.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 07:09:54 GMT  (498kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05893v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.DB cs.IR", "authors": ["shawn brunsting", "hans de sterck", "remco dolman", "teun van sprundel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.05893"}
