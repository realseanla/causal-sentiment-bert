The research community focused its effort on the initialization and on the optimization part of this method, without paying attention to the final cluster assignments. We propose a game theoretic framework in which each object to be clustered is represented as a player, which has to choose its cluster membership. The information obtained with NMF is used to initialize the strategy space of the players and a weighted graph is used to model the interactions among the players. These interactions allow the players to choose a cluster which is coherent with the clusters chosen by similar players, a property which is not guaranteed by NMF, since it produces a soft clustering of the data. The results on common benchmarks show that our model is able to improve the performances of many NMF formulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 13:23:43 GMT  (4181kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04628v1", "6 pages, 3 figures.
