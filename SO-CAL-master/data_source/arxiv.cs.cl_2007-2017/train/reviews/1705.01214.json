From the moment that an utterance is sent to a group, to the moment that it is replied in the group by a member, several activities must be done by the system: utterance understanding, information search, reasoning, among others. In this paper we present the challenges of designing and building multi-party conversational systems, the state of the art, our proposed hybrid architecture using both rules and machine learning and some insights after implementing and evaluating one on the finance domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 May 2017 01:05:14 GMT  (510kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01214v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 May 2017 18:28:13 GMT  (510kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01214v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["maira gatti de bayser", "paulo cavalin", "renan souza", "alan braz", "heloisa candello", "claudio pinhanez", "jean-pierre briot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01214"}
