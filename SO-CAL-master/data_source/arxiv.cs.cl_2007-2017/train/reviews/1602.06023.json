(2014)). Our experiments show that the proposed architecture significantly outperforms the state-of-the art model of Rush et al. (2015) on the Gigaword dataset without any additional tuning. We also propose additional extensions to the standard architecture, which we show contribute to further improvement in performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 02:04:18 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023v1", "4 pages with references"], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 22:50:03 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023v2", "9 pages with references"], ["v3", "Sat, 23 Apr 2016 02:38:01 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023v3", "8 pages plus references"], ["v4", "Wed, 10 Aug 2016 22:56:10 GMT  (314kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 26 Aug 2016 16:13:13 GMT  (314kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06023v5", null]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages with references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ramesh nallapati", "bowen zhou", "cicero nogueira dos santos", "caglar gulcehre", "bing xiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06023"}
