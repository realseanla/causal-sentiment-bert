A bipartite graph model is proposed where document groups are represented as one node set and the comparison criteria are represented as the other node set. Using this model, we present basic algorithms to extract insights into similarities and differences among the document groups. Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of our framework through an analysis of NSF funding programs for basic research.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 18:14:34 GMT  (314kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05902v1", "6 pages; 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP '15)"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages; 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP '15)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["arun maiya"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.05902"}
