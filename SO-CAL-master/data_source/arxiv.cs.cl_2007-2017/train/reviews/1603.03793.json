(2015) to support a training-with-exploration procedure using dynamic oracles(Goldberg and Nivre, 2013) instead of cross-entropy minimization. This form of training, which accounts for model predictions at training time rather than assuming an error-free action history, improves parsing accuracies for both English and Chinese, obtaining very strong results for both languages. We discuss some modifications needed in order to get training with exploration to work well for a probabilistic neural-network.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 21:34:20 GMT  (24kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03793v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 14:54:51 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03793v2", "In proceedings of EMNLP 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["miguel ballesteros", "yoav goldberg", "chris dyer", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.03793"}
