The practice of tagging is done in a collective environment. Folksonomies are self constructed, based on co-occurrence of definitions, rather than a hierarchical structure of the data. The downside of this was that a few sites and applications are able to successfully exploit the sharing of bookmarks. The need for tools that are able to resolve the ambiguity of the definitions is becoming urgent as the need of simple instruments for their visualization, editing and exploitation in web applications still hinders their diffusion and wide adoption. An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces. To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called \"Folksodriven\" is used in this paper. While it is presented the Folksodriven Structure Network (FSN) to resolve the ambiguity of definitions of folksonomy tags suggestions for the user. On this base a Human-Computer Interactive (HCI) systems is developed for the visualization, navigation, updating and maintenance of folksonomies Knowledge Bases - the FSN - through the web. System functionalities as well as its internal architecture will be introduced.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Mar 2012 18:59:40 GMT  (410kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6339v1", "*** This paper has been accepted to the 5th International Workshop on Intelligent Interfaces for Human-Computer Interaction (IIHCI 2012) - Palermo Italy, 4-6 July 2012 *** 7 pages, 7 figures; for details see:this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "*** This paper has been accepted to the 5th International Workshop on Intelligent Interfaces for Human-Computer Interaction (IIHCI 2012) - Palermo Italy, 4-6 July 2012 *** 7 pages, 7 figures; for details see:this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL cs.CY cs.IR", "authors": ["massimiliano dal mas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.6339"}
