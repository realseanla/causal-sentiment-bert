The limitation causes inaccurate matching between units in a peer and reference summaries. The present study introduces a new Keyphrase based Summary Evaluator KpEval for evaluating automatic summaries. The KpEval relies on the keyphrases since they convey the most important concepts of a text. In the evaluation process, the keyphrases are used in their lemma form as the matching text unit. The system was applied to evaluate different summaries of Arabic multi-document data set presented at TAC2011. The results showed that the new evaluation technique correlates well with the known evaluation systems: Rouge1, Rouge2, RougeSU4, and AutoSummENG MeMoG. KpEval has the strongest correlation with AutoSummENG MeMoG, Pearson and spearman correlation coefficient measures are 0.8840, 0.9667 respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 21:12:35 GMT  (461kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06228v1", "4 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["fatma elghannam", "tarek el-shishtawy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06228"}
