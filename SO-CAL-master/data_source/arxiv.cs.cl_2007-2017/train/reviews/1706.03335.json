However, lack of appropriate methodology for rating nonnative English speakers' essays has meant a lopsided advancement in this field. In this paper, we report initial results of our experiments with nonnative AES that learns from manual evaluation of nonnative essays. For this purpose, we conducted an exercise in which essays written by nonnative English speakers in test environment were rated both manually and by the automated system designed for the experiment. In the process, we experimented with a few features to learn about nuances linked to nonnative evaluation. The proposed methodology of automated essay evaluation has yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.750 with the manual evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 10:18:46 GMT  (428kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03335v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 09:52:35 GMT  (428kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03335v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 07:08:50 GMT  (652kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03335v3", "Accepted for publication at EUROPHRAS 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amber nigam", "vibhore goyal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03335"}
