Recently, word graph-based approaches have been proposed and become popular in MSC. Their key assumption is that redundancy among a set of related sentences provides a reliable way to generate informative and grammatical sentences. In this paper, we propose an effective approach to enhance the word graph-based MSC and tackle the issue that most of the state-of-the-art MSC approaches are confronted with: i.e., improving both informativity and grammaticality at the same time. Our approach consists of three main components: (1) a merging method based on Multiword Expressions (MWE); (2) a mapping strategy based on synonymy between words; (3) a re-ranking step to identify the best compression candidates generated using a POS-based language model (POS-LM). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach using a dataset made of clusters of English newswire sentences. The observed improvements on informativity and grammaticality of the generated compressions show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art MSC methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 May 2016 06:39:57 GMT  (473kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02150v1", "19 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["elaheh shafieibavani", "mohammad ebrahimi", "raymond wong", "fang chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02150"}
