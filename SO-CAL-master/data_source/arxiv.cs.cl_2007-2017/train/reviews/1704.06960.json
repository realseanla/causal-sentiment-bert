{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Apr-2017", "title": "Translating Neuralese", "abstract": "Several approaches have recently been proposed for learning decentralized deep multiagent policies that coordinate via a differentiable communication channel. While these policies are effective for many tasks, interpretation of their induced communication strategies has remained a challenge. Here we propose to interpret agents' messages by translating them. Unlike in typical machine translation problems, we have no parallel data to learn from. Instead we develop a translation model based on the insight that agent messages and natural language strings mean the same thing if they induce the same belief about the world in a listener. We present theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that our approach preserves both the semantics and pragmatics of messages by ensuring that players communicating through a translation layer do not suffer a substantial loss in reward relative to players with a common language.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 18:46:42 GMT  (7288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06960v1", "To appear in ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 21:28:48 GMT  (7285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06960v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 15:10:24 GMT  (7472kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06960v3", null]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["jacob andreas", "anca d dragan", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06960"}
