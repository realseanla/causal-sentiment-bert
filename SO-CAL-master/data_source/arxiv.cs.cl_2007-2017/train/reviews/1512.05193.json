{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Dec-2015", "title": "ABCNN: Attention-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Modeling Sentence Pairs", "abstract": "How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification (PI) and textual entailment (TE). Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a specific system; (ii) models each sentence separately, without considering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually designed, task-specific linguistic features. This work presents a general Attention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of sentences. We make three contributions. (i) ABCNN can be applied to a wide variety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs. (ii) We propose three attention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNN; thus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its counterpart. These interdependent sentence pair representations are more powerful than isolated sentence representations. (iii) ABCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 14:55:17 GMT  (281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05193v1", "11 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Dec 2015 10:39:53 GMT  (328kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05193v2", "12 pages, 3 figures"], ["v3", "Sat, 9 Apr 2016 11:59:39 GMT  (312kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05193v3", "Accepted by TACL, to appear"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenpeng yin", "hinrich sch\\\"utze", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.05193"}
