We find that models of subsamples can equal the topic similarity of models over the whole corpus. As the sample size increases, topic distance decreases and topic overlap increases. The requisite subsample size differs by field and by number of topics. While this study focuses on only five areas, we find significant differences in the behavior of these areas that can only be investigated with large corpora like the Hathi Trust.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 23:07:58 GMT  (155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05004v1", "HTRC ACS Technical Report; 8 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 21:12:17 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05004v2", "HTRC ACS Technical Report; 10 pages, 3 figures"], ["v3", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 15:48:16 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05004v3", "2016 International Conference on Computational Social Science (IC2S2), June 23-26, 2016. 3 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "HTRC ACS Technical Report; 8 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jaimie murdock", "jiaan zeng", "colin allen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05004"}
