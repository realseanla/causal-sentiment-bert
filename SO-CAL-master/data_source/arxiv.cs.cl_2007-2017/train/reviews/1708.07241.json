Our toolkit is a combination of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Conditional Random Field (CRF), using pre-trained word embeddings as input, which outperforms previously published toolkits on these three tasks. We provide both API and web demo for this toolkit.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 01:26:48 GMT  (605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07241v1", "4 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IJCNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 15:16:26 GMT  (605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07241v2", "4 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IJCNLP 2017, updated POS tagging results"], ["v3", "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 03:58:42 GMT  (605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07241v3", "4 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IJCNLP 2017, updated experiment results"], ["v4", "Thu, 21 Sep 2017 17:07:41 GMT  (605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07241v4", "4 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, accepted to IJCNLP 2017, updated experiment results"], ["v5", "Thu, 19 Oct 2017 14:26:43 GMT  (605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07241v5", "4 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables, accepted to IJCNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, submitted to IJCNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thai-hoang pham", "xuan-khoai pham", "tuan-anh nguyen", "phuong le-hong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07241"}
