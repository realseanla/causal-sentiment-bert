For the GMM-free training of a HMM/DNN hybrid we have to solve two problems, namely the initial alignment of the frame-level state labels and the creation of context-dependent states. Although flat-start training via iteratively realigning and retraining the DNN using a frame-level error function is viable, it is quite cumbersome. Here, we propose to use a sequence-discriminative training criterion for flat start. While sequence-discriminative training is routinely applied only in the final phase of model training, we show that with proper caution it is also suitable for getting an alignment of context-independent DNN models. For the construction of tied states we apply a recently proposed KL-divergence-based state clustering method, hence our whole training process is GMM-free. In the experimental evaluation we found that the sequence-discriminative flat start training method is not only significantly faster than the straightforward approach of iterative retraining and realignment, but the word error rates attained are slightly better as well.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 09:52:57 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03256v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["g\\'abor gosztolya", "tam\\'as gr\\'osz", "l\\'aszl\\'o t\\'oth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03256"}
