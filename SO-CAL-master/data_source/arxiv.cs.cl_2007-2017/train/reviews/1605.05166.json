Consequently, there is increasing interest in matching user accounts and profiles across different social networks in order to create aggregate profiles of users. In this paper, we present models for Digital Stylometry, which is a method for matching users through stylometry inspired techniques. We experimented with linguistic, temporal, and combined temporal-linguistic models for matching user accounts, using standard and novel techniques. Using publicly available data, our best model, a combined temporal-linguistic one, was able to correctly match the accounts of 31% of 5,612 distinct users across Twitter and Facebook.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 May 2016 13:47:24 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05166v1", "SocInfo'15, Beijing, China.
