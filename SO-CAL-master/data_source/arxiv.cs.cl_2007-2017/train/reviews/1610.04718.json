In particular, it studies the algorithm k-Nearest Neighbours for its application to sequential data. A method of generalization of metric classification algorithms is proposed. As a part of it, there has been developed an algorithm for solving the problem of classification and labelling of sequential data. The advantages of the developed algorithm of classification in comparison with the existing one are also discussed in the article. There is a comparison of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with the algorithm of CRF in the task of chunking in the open data set CoNLL2000.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Oct 2016 11:04:44 GMT  (174kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04718v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Dec 2016 05:32:34 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04718v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["roman samarev", "rey vasnetsov", "elizaveta smelkova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04718"}
