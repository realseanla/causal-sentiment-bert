{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Jun-2016", "title": "Divergent discourse between protests and counter-protests: #BlackLivesMatter and #AllLivesMatter", "abstract": "Since the shooting of Black teenager Michael Brown by White police officer Darren Wison in Ferguson, Missouri, the protest hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has amplified critiques of extrajudicial killings of Black Americans. In response to #BlackLivesMatter, other Twitter users have adopted #AllLivesMatter, a counter-protest hashtag whose content argues that equal attention should be given to all lives regardless of race. Through a multi-level analysis, we study how these protests and counter-protests diverge by quantifying aspects of their discourse. In particular, we introduce methodology that not only quantifies these divergences, but also reveals whether they are from widespread discussion or a few popular retweets within these groups. We find that #BlackLivesMatter exhibits many informationally rich conversations, while those within #AllLivesMatter are more muted and susceptible to hijacking. We also show that the discussion within #BlackLivesMatter is more likely to center around the deaths of Black Americans, while that of #AllLivesMatter is more likely to sympathize with the lives of police officers and express politically conservative views.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 05:23:01 GMT  (938kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v1", "24 pages, 29 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 15:52:06 GMT  (938kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v2", "24 pages, 29 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 28 Jul 2016 17:28:11 GMT  (937kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v3", "24 pages, 29 figures"], ["v4", "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 02:41:31 GMT  (753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v4", "25 pages, 28 figures"], ["v5", "Sat, 20 May 2017 03:36:05 GMT  (750kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06820v5", "26 pages, 27 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 29 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["ryan j gallagher", "rew j reagan", "christopher m danforth", "peter sheridan dodds"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06820"}
