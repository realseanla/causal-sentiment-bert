This effort achieved the top score in Task A on supervised stance detection, producing an average F1 score of 67.8 when assessing whether a tweet author was in favor or against a topic. We employed a recurrent neural network initialized with features learned via distant supervision on two large unlabeled datasets. We trained embeddings of words and phrases with the word2vec skip-gram method, then used those features to learn sentence representations via a hashtag prediction auxiliary task. These sentence vectors were then fine-tuned for stance detection on several hundred labeled examples. The result was a high performing system that used transfer learning to maximize the value of the available training data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 00:12:49 GMT  (309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03784v1", "International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["guido zarrella", "amy marsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03784"}
