A word or sentence is represented using a character n-gram count vector, followed by a single nonlinear transformation to yield a low-dimensional embedding. We use three tasks for evaluation: word similarity, sentence similarity, and part-of-speech tagging. We demonstrate that Charagram embeddings outperform more complex architectures based on character-level recurrent and convolutional neural networks, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on several similarity tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 Jul 2016 21:59:19 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02789v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["john wieting", "mohit bansal", "kevin gimpel", "karen livescu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.02789"}
