{"conference": "HLT-NAACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Apr-2012", "title": "Segmentation Similarity and Agreement", "abstract": "We propose a new segmentation evaluation metric, called segmentation similarity (S), that quantifies the similarity between two segmentations as the proportion of boundaries that are not transformed when comparing them using edit distance, essentially using edit distance as a penalty function and scaling penalties by segmentation size. We propose several adapted inter-annotator agreement coefficients which use S that are suitable for segmentation. We show that S is configurable enough to suit a wide variety of segmentation evaluations, and is an improvement upon the state of the art. We also propose using inter-annotator agreement coefficients to evaluate automatic segmenters in terms of human performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 22:01:27 GMT  (41kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2847v1", "10 pages, Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2012 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL-HLT 2012), Montr\\'eal, Canada, June 2012"], ["v2", "Sat, 19 May 2012 19:15:56 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2847v2", "10 pages, LaTeX, corrected a typo in equation 4"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2012 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL-HLT 2012), Montr\\'eal, Canada, June 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chris fournier", "diana inkpen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1204.2847"}
