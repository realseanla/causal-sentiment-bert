Although previous approaches exist, they are often restricted to specific domains (e.g., booking an airline ticket) and require hand-crafted rules. In this paper, we present a simple approach for this task which uses the recently proposed sequence to sequence framework. Our model converses by predicting the next sentence given the previous sentence or sentences in a conversation. The strength of our model is that it can be trained end-to-end and thus requires much fewer hand-crafted rules. We find that this straightforward model can generate simple conversations given a large conversational training dataset. Our preliminary suggest that, despite optimizing the wrong objective function, the model is able to extract knowledge from both a domain specific dataset, and from a large, noisy, and general domain dataset of movie subtitles. On a domain-specific IT helpdesk dataset, the model can find a solution to a technical problem via conversations. On a noisy open-domain movie transcript dataset, the model can perform simple forms of common sense reasoning. As expected, we also find that the lack of consistency is a common failure mode of our model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 02:52:23 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869v1", "ICML Deep Learning Workshop 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 22:12:47 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869v2", "ICML Deep Learning Workshop 2015"], ["v3", "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 03:29:47 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05869v3", "ICML Deep Learning Workshop 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML Deep Learning Workshop 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["oriol vinyals", "quoc le"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05869"}
