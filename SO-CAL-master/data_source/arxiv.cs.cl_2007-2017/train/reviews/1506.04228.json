The presented software is written entirely in Java and is distributed as a GATE plugin. To our best knowledge, at the time of writing this article, there are not any other free lemmatization tools specifically targeting the Bulgarian language. The presented lemmatizer is a work in progress and currently yields an accuracy of about 95% in comparison to the manually annotated corpus BulTreeBank-Morph, which contains 273933 tokens.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Jun 2015 05:47:50 GMT  (267kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04228v1", "5 pages, Sixth International Scientific Conference - FMNS2015"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, Sixth International Scientific Conference - FMNS2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["grigor iliev", "nadezhda borisova", "elena karashtranova", "dafina kostadinova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04228"}
