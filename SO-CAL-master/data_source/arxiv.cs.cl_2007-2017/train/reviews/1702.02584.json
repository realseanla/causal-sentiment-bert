Compared to previous data resources supporting humor recognition research, ours has several advantages, including (a) both positive and negative instances coming from a homogeneous data set, (b) containing a large number of speakers, and (c) being open. Focusing on using lexical cues for humor recognition, we systematically compare a newly emerging text classification method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a well-established conventional method using linguistic knowledge. The CNN method shows its advantages on both higher recognition accuracies and being able to learn essential features automatically.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 19:10:53 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02584v1", "5 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Tue, 9 May 2017 17:42:31 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02584v2", "5 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lei chen", "chong min lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02584"}
