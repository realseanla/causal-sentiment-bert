{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Mar-2016", "title": "Topic Modeling Using Distributed Word Embeddings", "abstract": "We propose a new algorithm for topic modeling, Vec2Topic, that identifies the main topics in a corpus using semantic information captured via high-dimensional distributed word embeddings. Our technique is unsupervised and generates a list of topics ranked with respect to importance. We find that it works better than existing topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation for identifying key topics in user-generated content, such as emails, chats, etc., where topics are diffused across the corpus. We also find that Vec2Topic works equally well for non-user generated content, such as papers, reports, etc., and for small corpora such as a single-document.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 16:21:58 GMT  (3675kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04747v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ramandeep s randhawa", "parag jain", "gagan madan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04747"}
