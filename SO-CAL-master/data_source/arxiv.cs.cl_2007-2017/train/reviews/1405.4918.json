Textual information, such as product or service reviews, is an important and increasingly popular type of content that is being used as a foundation of many trendy community-based reviewing sites, such as TripAdvisor and Yelp. Some recent results have shown that, due partly to their specialized/topical nature, sets of reviews authored by the same person are readily linkable based on simple stylometric features. In practice, this means that individuals who author more than a few reviews under different accounts (whether within one site or across multiple sites) can be linked, which represents a significant loss of privacy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 23:26:44 GMT  (2354kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4918v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL", "authors": ["mishari almishari", "ekin oguz", "gene tsudik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4918"}
