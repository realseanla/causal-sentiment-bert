In response to this problem, we propose a semi-supervised approach to recall possibly missing pronouns in the translation. Firstly, we build training data for DP generation in which the DPs are automatically labelled according to the alignment information from a parallel corpus. Secondly, we build a deep learning-based DP generator for input sentences in decoding when no corresponding references exist. More specifically, the generation is two-phase: (1) DP position detection, which is modeled as a sequential labelling task with recurrent neural networks; and (2) DP prediction, which employs a multilayer perceptron with rich features. Finally, we integrate the above outputs into our translation system to recall missing pronouns by both extracting rules from the DP-labelled training data and translating the DP-generated input sentences. Experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement of 1.58 BLEU points in translation performance with 66% F-score for DP generation accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 12:55:29 GMT  (328kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06285v1", "To appear in NAACL2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in NAACL2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["longyue wang", "zhaopeng tu", "xiaojun zhang", "hang li", "andy way", "qun liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.06285"}
