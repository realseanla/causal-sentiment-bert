Such statements vary in the degree of certainty the author expresses toward the outcome:\"Leonardo DiCaprio will win Best Actor\" vs. \"Leonardo DiCaprio may win\" or \"No way Leonardo wins!\". Can popular beliefs on social media predict who will win? To answer this question, we build a corpus of tweets annotated for veridicality on which we train a log-linear classifier that detects positive veridicality with high precision. We then forecast uncertain outcomes using the wisdom of crowds, by aggregating users' explicit predictions. Our method for forecasting winners is fully automated, relying only on a set of contenders as input. It requires no training data of past outcomes and outperforms sentiment and tweet volume baselines on a broad range of contest prediction tasks. We further demonstrate how our approach can be used to measure the reliability of individual accounts' predictions and retrospectively identify surprise outcomes.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 20:34:53 GMT  (511kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07212v1", "Accepted at EMNLP 2017 (long paper)"], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 05:06:17 GMT  (511kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07212v2", "Accepted at EMNLP 2017 (long paper)"], ["v3", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 01:15:44 GMT  (511kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07212v3", "Accepted at EMNLP 2017 (long paper)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EMNLP 2017 (long paper)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sandesh swamy", "alan ritter", "marie-catherine de marneffe"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07212"}
