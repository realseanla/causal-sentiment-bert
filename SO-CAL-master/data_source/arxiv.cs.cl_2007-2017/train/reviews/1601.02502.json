We use our new method to compute aligned wordembeddings for twenty-one languages using English as a pivot language. We show that some linguistic features are aligned across languages for which we do not have aligned data, even though those properties do not exist in the pivot language. We also achieve state of the art results on standard cross-lingual text classification and word translation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 16:12:32 GMT  (315kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02502v1", "EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jocelyn coulmance", "jean-marc marty", "guillaume wenzek", "amine benhalloum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.02502"}
