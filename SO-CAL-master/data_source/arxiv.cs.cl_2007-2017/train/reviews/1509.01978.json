It consists in the textural analysis of the script types. In the first step, each letter is coded by the equivalent script type, which is defined by its typographical features. Obtained coded text is subjected to the run-length statistical analysis and to the adjacent local binary pattern analysis in order to extract the features. The result shows a diversity between the extracted features of the scripts, which makes the feature classification more effective. It is the basis for the classification process of the script identification by using an extension of a state-of-the-art approach for document clustering. The proposed method is evaluated on an example of hand-engraved in stone and hand-printed in paper labels in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic. Experiments demonstrate very positive results, which prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Sep 2015 10:39:20 GMT  (800kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01978v1", "15 pages, 9 figures, 3rd Workshop on Recognition and Action for Scene Understanding (REACTS 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 9 figures, 3rd Workshop on Recognition and Action for Scene Understanding (REACTS 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["darko brodic", "alessia amelio", "zoran n milivojevic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01978"}
