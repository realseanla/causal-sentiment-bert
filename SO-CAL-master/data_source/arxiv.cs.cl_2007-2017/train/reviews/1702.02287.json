{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Feb-2017", "title": "Name Disambiguation in Anonymized Graphs using Network Embedding", "abstract": "In real-world, our DNA is unique but many people share same names. This phenomenon often causes erroneous aggregation of documents of multiple persons who are namesake of one another. Such mistakes deteriorate the performance of document retrieval, web search, and more seriously, cause improper attribution of credit or blame in digital forensic. To resolve this issue, the name entity disambiguation task is designed which aims to partition the documents associated with a name reference such that each partition contains documents pertaining to a unique real-life person. Existing solutions to this task substantially rely on feature engineering, such as biographical feature extraction, or construction of auxiliary features from Wikipedia. However, for many scenarios, such features may be costly to obtain or unavailable due to the risk of privacy violation. In this work, we propose a novel name disambiguation method. Our proposed method is non-intrusive of privacy because instead of using attributes pertaining to a real-life person, our method leverages only relational data in the form of anonymized graphs. In the aspect of methodological novelty, the proposed method uses a representation learning strategy to embed each document in a low dimensional vector space where name disambiguation can be solved by a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is significantly better than the existing name entity disambiguation methods working in a similar setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 04:54:09 GMT  (94kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02287v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 May 2017 00:40:44 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02287v2", "Made critical mistake in the experimental section"], ["v3", "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 14:29:03 GMT  (487kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02287v3", "The 26th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2017) research track full paper"], ["v4", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 23:05:04 GMT  (486kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02287v4", "The 26th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2017) research track full paper"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["baichuan zhang", "mohammad al hasan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02287"}
