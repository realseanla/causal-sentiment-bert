In addition to the word sequence, the model takes as input pattern match features that were developed to reduce sensitivity to vocabulary size in training, which lead to improved performance over the word sequence alone. The BLSTM takes advantage of explicit repair states in addition to the standard reparandum states. The final output leverages integer linear programming to incorporate constraints of disfluency structure. In experiments on the Switchboard corpus, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance for both the standard disfluency detection task and the correction detection task. Analysis shows that the model has better detection of non-repetition disfluencies, which tend to be much harder to detect.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 02:34:00 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03209v1", "Submitted to INTERSPEECH 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to INTERSPEECH 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vicky zayats", "mari ostendorf", "hannaneh hajishirzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03209"}
