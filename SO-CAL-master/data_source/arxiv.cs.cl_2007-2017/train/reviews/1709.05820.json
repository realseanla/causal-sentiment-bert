This paper tries to fill this gap by presenting some of our findings from building an in-house travel domain NMT system in a large scale E-commerce setting. The three major topics that we cover are op- timization and training (including different optimization strategies and corpus sizes), handling real-world content and evaluating results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 08:46:20 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05820v1", "11 pages, 4 figures, presented at the Commercial MT Users and Translators Track"], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 10:26:44 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05820v2", "11 pages, 4 figures, presented at MT Summit XVI, Commercial MT Users and Translators Track"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 4 figures, presented at the Commercial MT Users and Translators Track", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pavel levin", "nishikant dhanuka", "talaat khalil", "fedor kovalev", "maxim khalilov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05820"}
