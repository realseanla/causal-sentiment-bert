{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Apr-2017", "title": "Neural Lattice-to-Sequence Models for Uncertain Inputs", "abstract": "The input to a neural sequence-to-sequence model is often determined by an up-stream system, e.g. a word segmenter, part of speech tagger, or speech recognizer. These up-stream models are potentially error-prone. Representing inputs through word lattices allows making this uncertainty explicit by capturing alternative sequences and their posterior probabilities in a compact form. In this work, we extend the TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015) into a LatticeLSTM that is able to consume word lattices, and can be used as encoder in an attentional encoder-decoder model. We integrate lattice posterior scores into this architecture by extending the TreeLSTM's child-sum and forget gates and introducing a bias term into the attention mechanism. We experiment with speech translation lattices and report consistent improvements over baselines that translate either the 1-best hypothesis or the lattice without posterior scores.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 13:03:40 GMT  (415kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00559v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 13:31:07 GMT  (420kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00559v2", "EMNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["matthias sperber", "graham neubig", "jan niehues", "alex waibel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.00559"}
