{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-May-2016", "title": "Tweet2Vec: Character-Based Distributed Representations for Social Media", "abstract": "Text from social media provides a set of challenges that can cause traditional NLP approaches to fail. Informal language, spelling errors, abbreviations, and special characters are all commonplace in these posts, leading to a prohibitively large vocabulary size for word-level approaches. We propose a character composition model, tweet2vec, which finds vector-space representations of whole tweets by learning complex, non-local dependencies in character sequences. The proposed model outperforms a word-level baseline at predicting user-annotated hashtags associated with the posts, doing significantly better when the input contains many out-of-vocabulary words or unusual character sequences. Our tweet2vec encoder is publicly available.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 15:30:09 GMT  (559kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03481v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, accepted as conference paper at ACL 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 May 2016 15:00:38 GMT  (559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03481v2", "6 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, accepted as conference paper at ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, accepted as conference paper at ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["bhuwan dhingra", "zhong zhou", "dylan fitzpatrick", "michael muehl", "william w cohen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.03481"}
