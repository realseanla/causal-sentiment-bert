WSD is the ability of determining a word sense among different ones within a polysemic lexical unit taking into account the context. The most straightforward approach uses a semantic proximity measure between the word sense candidates of the target word and those of its context. Such a method very easily entails a combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we propose two methods based on distributional analysis which enable to reduce the exponential complexity without losing the coherence. We present a comparison between the selection of distributional neighbors and the linearly nearest neighbors. The figures obtained show that selecting distributional neighbors leads to better results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 13:38:08 GMT  (670kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08451v1", "in French, Journ\\'ees internationales d'Analyse statistique des Donn\\'ees Textuelles (JADT), Jun 2016, Nice, France"]], "COMMENTS": "in French, Journ\\'ees internationales d'Analyse statistique des Donn\\'ees Textuelles (JADT), Jun 2016, Nice, France", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mokhtar billami", "n\\'uria gala"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08451"}
