But how is that research in turn transmitted to new generations of researchers? We tell a story of Bible and computer across the decades and then point out the current challenges: (1) finding a stable data representation for changing methods of computation; (2) sharing results in inter- and intra-disciplinary ways, for reproducibility and cross-fertilization. We report recent developments in meeting these challenges. The scene is the text database of the Hebrew Bible, constructed by the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer (ETCBC), which is still growing in detail and sophistication. We show how a subtle mix of computational ingredients enable scholars to research the transmission and interpretation of the Hebrew Bible in new ways: (1) a standard data format, Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF); (2) the methods of scientific computing, made accessible by (interactive) Python and its associated ecosystem. Additionally, we show how these efforts have culminated in the construction of a new, publicly accessible search engine SHEBANQ, where the text of the Hebrew Bible and its underlying data can be queried in a simple, yet powerful query language MQL, and where those queries can be saved and shared.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 14:21:39 GMT  (1157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01866v1", "12 pages, 5 figures, follow up on the workshop Biblical Scholarship and Humanities Computing: Data Types, Text, Language and Interpretation, held at the Lorentz Centre Leiden from 6 Feb 2012 through 10 Feb 2012,this http URL&amp;venue=Oort"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 5 figures, follow up on the workshop Biblical Scholarship and Humanities Computing: Data Types, Text, Language and Interpretation, held at the Lorentz Centre Leiden from 6 Feb 2012 through 10 Feb 2012,this http URL&amp;venue=Oort", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["dirk roorda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.01866"}
