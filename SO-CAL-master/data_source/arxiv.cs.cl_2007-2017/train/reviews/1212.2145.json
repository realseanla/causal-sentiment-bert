By embedding an original signal into a family of gradually coarsen signals parameterized with a continuous scale parameter, it provides a formal framework to capture the structure of a signal at different scales in a consistent way. In this paper, we present a scale space theory for text by integrating semantic and spatial filters, and demonstrate how natural language documents can be understood, processed and analyzed at multiple resolutions, and how this scale-space representation can be used to facilitate a variety of NLP and text analysis tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 17:39:44 GMT  (186kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2145v1", "9 pages, 6 figures; Nature language processing"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 6 figures; Nature language processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["shuang-hong yang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.2145"}
