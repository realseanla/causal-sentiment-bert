However, this increases the length of the sentences resulting in increased decoding time. The increase in length is also impacted by the specific choice of data format for representing the sentences as subwords. In a phrase-based SMT framework, we investigate different choices of decoder parameters as well as data format and their impact on decoding time and translation accuracy. We suggest best options for these settings that significantly improve decoding time with little impact on the translation accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 19:56:36 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00354v1", "Accepted at VarDial3 (Third Workshop on NLP for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects) collocated with COLING 2016; 7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at VarDial3 (Third Workshop on NLP for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects) collocated with COLING 2016; 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["anoop kunchukuttan", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00354"}
