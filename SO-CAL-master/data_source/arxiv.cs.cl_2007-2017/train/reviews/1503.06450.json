However, current state-of-the-art relation extraction systems are available only for English because of their heavy reliance on linguistic tools such as part-of-speech taggers and dependency parsers. We present a cross-lingual annotation projection method for language independent relation extraction. We evaluate our method on a manually annotated test set and present results on three typologically different languages. We release these manual annotations and extracted relations in ten languages from Wikipedia.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Mar 2015 18:05:08 GMT  (83kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06450v1", "Proceedings of NAACL 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 19:05:14 GMT  (46kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06450v2", "Proceedings of NAACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of NAACL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui", "shankar kumar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.06450"}
