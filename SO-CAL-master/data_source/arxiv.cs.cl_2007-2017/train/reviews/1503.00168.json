But how much more complex? In this paper we make an attempt to develop a general framework and methodology for computing the informational and/or processing complexity of NLP applications and tasks. We define a universal framework akin to a Turning Machine that attempts to fit (most) NLP tasks into one paradigm. We calculate the complexities of various NLP tasks using measures of Shannon Entropy, and compare `simple' ones such as part of speech tagging to `complex' ones such as machine translation. This paper provides a first, though far from perfect, attempt to quantify NLP tasks under a uniform paradigm. We point out current deficiencies and suggest some avenues for fruitful research.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 19:46:50 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00168v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jiwei li", "eduard hovy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00168"}
