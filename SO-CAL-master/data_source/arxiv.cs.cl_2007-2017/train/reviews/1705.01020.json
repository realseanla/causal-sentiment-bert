Specifically, we linearize parse trees of source sentences to obtain structural label sequences. On the basis, we propose three different sorts of encoders to incorporate source syntax into NMT: 1) Parallel RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors parallelly; 2) Hierarchical RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors in a two-level hierarchy; and 3) Mixed RNN encoder that stitchingly learns word and label annotation vectors over sequences where words and labels are mixed. Experimentation on Chinese-to-English translation demonstrates that all the three proposed syntactic encoders are able to improve translation accuracy. It is interesting to note that the simplest RNN encoder, i.e., Mixed RNN encoder yields the best performance with an significant improvement of 1.4 BLEU points. Moreover, an in-depth analysis from several perspectives is provided to reveal how source syntax benefits NMT.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 15:21:46 GMT  (785kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01020v1", "Accepted by ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["junhui li", "deyi xiong", "zhaopeng tu", "muhua zhu", "min zhang", "guodong zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.01020"}
