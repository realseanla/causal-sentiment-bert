However, the amount of geographic information avail- able on Twitter is low, which makes the pursuit of many applications challenging. Under such circumstances, estimating the location of a tweet is an important goal of the study. Unlike most previous studies that estimate the pre-defined district as the classification task, this study employs a probability distribution to represent richer information of the tweet, not only the location but also its ambiguity. To realize this modeling, we propose the convolutional mixture density network (CMDN), which uses text data to estimate the mixture model parameters. Experimentally obtained results reveal that CMDN achieved the highest prediction performance among the method for predicting the exact coordinates. It also provides a quantitative representation of the location ambiguity for each tweet that properly works for extracting the reliable location estimations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 05:50:47 GMT  (1957kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02750v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hayate iso", "shoko wakamiya", "eiji aramaki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02750"}
