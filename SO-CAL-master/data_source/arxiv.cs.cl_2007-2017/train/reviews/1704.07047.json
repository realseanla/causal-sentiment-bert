However, both training and working procedures of the current neural models are computationally inefficient. This paper presents a greedy neural word segmenter with balanced word and character embedding inputs to alleviate the existing drawbacks. Our segmenter is truly end-to-end, capable of performing segmentation much faster and even more accurate than state-of-the-art neural models on Chinese benchmark datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 05:50:29 GMT  (3422kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07047v1", "To appear in ACL2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["deng cai", "hai zhao", "zhisong zhang", "yuan xin", "yongjian wu", "feiyue huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07047"}
