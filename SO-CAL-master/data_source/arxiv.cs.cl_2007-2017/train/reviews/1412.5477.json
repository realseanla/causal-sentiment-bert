The case-inflectional forms of a noun normally number 24 owing to the fact that in Sanskrit there are eight cases and three numbers-singular, dual and plural. The traditional method of generating these inflectional forms is rather elaborate owing to the fact that there are differences in the forms generated between even very similar words and there are subtle nuances involved. Further, it would be a cumbersome exercise to generate and search for 24 forms of a word during a word search in a large text, using the currently available case-inflectional form generators. This study presents a new approach to generating case-inflectional forms that is simpler to compute. Further, an optimized model that is sufficient for generating only those word forms that are required in a word search and is more than 80% efficient compared to the complete case-inflectional forms generator, is presented in this study for the first time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:56:43 GMT  (120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5477v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["s v kasmir raja", "v rajitha", "lakshmanan meenakshi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5477"}
