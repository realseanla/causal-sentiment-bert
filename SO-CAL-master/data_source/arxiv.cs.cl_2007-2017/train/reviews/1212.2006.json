In this paper, we propose a novel supervised approach that can incorporate rich sentence features into Bayesian topic models in a principled way, thus taking advantages of both topic model and feature based supervised learning methods. Experiments on TAC2008 and TAC2009 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 09:41:12 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2006v1", "Submitted on 1 Oct 2012; Accepted on 8 Dec 2012"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Dec 2013 17:28:14 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2006v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign error in equation"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted on 1 Oct 2012; Accepted on 8 Dec 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jiwei li", "sujian li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1212.2006"}
