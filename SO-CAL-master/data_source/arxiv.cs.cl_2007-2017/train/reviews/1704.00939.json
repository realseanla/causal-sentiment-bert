Inferring Sentiment towards Brands from Financial News Headlines", "abstract": "In this paper, we describe a methodology to infer Bullish or Bearish sentiment towards companies/brands. More specifically, our approach leverages affective lexica and word embeddings in combination with convolutional neural networks to infer the sentiment of financial news headlines towards a target company. Such architecture was used and evaluated in the context of the SemEval 2017 challenge (task 5, subtask 2), in which it obtained the best performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 10:01:47 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00939v1", "6 pages, 1 figure; accepted for publication at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017) to be held in conjunction with ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 1 figure; accepted for publication at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2017) to be held in conjunction with ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["youness mansar", "lorenzo gatti", "sira ferradans", "marco guerini", "jacopo staiano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00939"}
