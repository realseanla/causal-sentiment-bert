The objective of the contest was to explore the effectiveness of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) for Indian language to Indian language and English-Hindi machine translation. In this paper, we have proposed that suffix separation and word splitting for SMT from agglutinative languages to Hindi significantly improves over the baseline (BL). We have also shown that the factored model with reordering outperforms the phrase-based SMT for English-Hindi (\\enhi). We report our work on all five pairs of languages, namely Bengali-Hindi (\\bnhi), Marathi-Hindi (\\mrhi), Tamil-Hindi (\\tahi), Telugu-Hindi (\\tehi), and \\enhi for Health, Tourism, and General domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 14:06:31 GMT  (21kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07418v1", "5 pages, Published at NLP Tools Contest: Statistical Machine Translation in Indian Languages, ICON-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, Published at NLP Tools Contest: Statistical Machine Translation in Indian Languages, ICON-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["raj nath patel", "prakash b pimpale", "sasikumar m"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07418"}
