Algorithms were trained to classify texts with respect to their publication date taking into account lexical variation represented as word n-grams, and morphosyntactic variation represented by part-of-speech (POS) distribution. We report results of 99.8% accuracy using word unigram features with a Support Vector Machines classifier to predict the publication date of documents in time intervals of both one century and half a century. A feature analysis is performed to investigate the most informative features for this task and how they are linked to language change.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 20:57:01 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00030v1", "Proceedings of Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marcos zampieri", "shervin malmasi", "mark dras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00030"}
