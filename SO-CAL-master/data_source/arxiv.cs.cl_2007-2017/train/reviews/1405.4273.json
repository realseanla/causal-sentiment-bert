Our approach is evaluated in the context of log-bilinear language models, rendered suitably efficient for implementation inside a machine translation decoder by factoring the vocabulary. We perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations, presenting results on a range of languages which demonstrate that our model learns morphological representations that both perform well on word similarity tasks and lead to substantial reductions in perplexity. When used for translation into morphologically rich languages with large vocabularies, our models obtain improvements of up to 1.2 BLEU points relative to a baseline system using back-off n-gram models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 May 2014 19:08:14 GMT  (756kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4273v1", "Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jan a botha", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.4273"}
