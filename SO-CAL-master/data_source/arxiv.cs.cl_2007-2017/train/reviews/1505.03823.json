It studies on aligning a textual entity mention to its corresponding disambiguated entry in a knowledge repository. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm named distantly supervised entity linking (DSEL), in the sense that the disambiguated entities that belong to a huge knowledge repository (Freebase) are automatically aligned to the corresponding descriptive webpages (Wiki pages). In this way, a large scale of weakly labeled data can be generated without manual annotation and fed to a classifier for linking more newly discovered entities. Compared with traditional paradigms based on solo knowledge base, DSEL benefits more via jointly leveraging the respective advantages of Freebase and Wikipedia. Specifically, the proposed paradigm facilitates bridging the disambiguated labels (Freebase) of entities and their textual descriptions (Wikipedia) for Web-scale entities. Experiments conducted on a dataset of 140,000 items and 60,000 features achieve a baseline F1-measure of 0.517. Furthermore, we analyze the feature performance and improve the F1-measure to 0.545.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 May 2015 18:15:49 GMT  (478kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03823v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 19 May 2015 14:45:19 GMT  (499kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03823v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 5 Aug 2015 01:25:26 GMT  (478kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03823v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["miao fan", "qiang zhou", "thomas fang zheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03823"}
