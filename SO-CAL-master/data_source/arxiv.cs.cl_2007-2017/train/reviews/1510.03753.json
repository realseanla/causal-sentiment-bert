First, we use an in-house implementation of previously reported models to do an independent evaluation using the same data. Second, we evaluate the performances of various LSTMs, Bi-LSTMs and CNNs on the dataset. Third, we create an ensemble by averaging predictions of multiple models. The ensemble further improves the performance and it achieves a state-of-the-art result for this dataset. Finally, we discuss our future plans using this corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 15:56:26 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03753v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 08:23:50 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03753v2", "Accepted to Machine Learning for SLU &amp; Interaction NIPS 2015 Workshop"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rudolf kadlec", "martin schmid", "jan kleindienst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.03753"}
