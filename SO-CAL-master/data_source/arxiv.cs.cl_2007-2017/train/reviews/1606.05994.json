It has been recently proposed that the CNL approach could be scaled up, building on the concept of embedded CNL and, thus, allowing for CNL-based information extraction from e.g. normative or medical texts that are rather controlled by nature but still infringe the boundaries of CNL. Although it is arguable if CNL can be exploited to approach the robust wide-coverage semantic parsing for use cases like media monitoring, its potential becomes much more obvious in the opposite direction: generation of story highlights from the summarized AMR graphs, which is in the focus of this position paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:15:55 GMT  (251kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05994v1", "Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Controlled Natural Language, 2016 (to appear)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Controlled Natural Language, 2016 (to appear)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["normunds gruzitis", "guntis barzdins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05994"}
