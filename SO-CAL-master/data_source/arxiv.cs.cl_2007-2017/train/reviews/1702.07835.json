However, the costs of acquiring corpora can prevent some researchers from going further in their endeavours. The ease of access to freely available corpora is urgent needed in the NLP research community especially for language such as Arabic. Currently, there is not easy was to access to a comprehensive and updated list of freely available Arabic corpora. We present in this paper, the results of a recent survey conducted to identify the list of the freely available Arabic corpora and language resources. Our preliminary results showed an initial list of 66 sources. We presents our findings in the various categories studied and we provided the direct links to get the data when possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 05:16:15 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07835v1", "Published in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC'2014), OSACT Workshop.
