Traditionally, the mean or median vector is selected. Ontology classes are sets of homogeneous instance objects that can be converted to a vector space by word vector embeddings. This study proposes a methodology to derive a representative vector for ontology classes whose instances were converted to the vector space. We start by deriving five candidate vectors which are then used to train a machine learning model that would calculate a representative vector for the class. We show that our methodology out-performs the traditional mean and median vector representations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 03:01:37 GMT  (1398kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02909v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vindula jayawardana", "dimuthu lakmal", "nisansa de silva", "amal shehan perera", "keet sugathadasa", "buddhi ayesha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02909"}
