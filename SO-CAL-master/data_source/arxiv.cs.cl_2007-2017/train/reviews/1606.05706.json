An isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential model is proposed to make predictions on sentence- or segment-level. We automatically construct a socially-tuned lexicon that is bootstrapped from existing general-purpose sentiment lexicons to further improve the performance. We evaluate our agreement and disagreement tagging model on two disparate online discussion corpora -- Wikipedia Talk pages and online debates. Our model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both datasets. For example, the isotonic CRF model achieves F1 scores of 0.74 and 0.67 for agreement and disagreement detection, when a linear chain CRF obtains 0.58 and 0.56 for the discussions on Wikipedia Talk pages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 23:29:11 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05706v1", "ACL WASSA workshop 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL WASSA workshop 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "claire cardie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05706"}
