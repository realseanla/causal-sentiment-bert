We compare the performance of a number of representative models for several test settings over data of varying sizes, and over test items of various frequency. Our results show that neural network-based models underperform when the data is small, and that the most reliable model over data of varying sizes and frequency ranges is the inverted factorized model.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 07:38:29 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08293v1", "Accepted at EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["magnus sahlgren", "alessandro lenci"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.08293"}
