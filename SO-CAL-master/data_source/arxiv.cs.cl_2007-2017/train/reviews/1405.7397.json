We submitted runs for Bengali, English, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. A statistical HMM (Hidden Markov Models) based model has been used to implement our system. The system has been trained and tested on the NLP TOOLS CONTEST: ICON 2013 datasets. Our system obtains F-measures of 0.8599, 0.7704, 0.7520, 0.4289, 0.5455, 0.4466, and 0.4003 for Bengali, English, Hindi, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 May 2014 21:05:00 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7397v1", "The ICON 2013 tools contest on Named Entity Recognition in Indian languages (IL) co-located with the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Processing(ICON), CDAC Noida, India,18-20 December, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "The ICON 2013 tools contest on Named Entity Recognition in Indian languages (IL) co-located with the 10th International Conference on Natural Language Processing(ICON), CDAC Noida, India,18-20 December, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vivekananda gayen", "kamal sarkar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7397"}
