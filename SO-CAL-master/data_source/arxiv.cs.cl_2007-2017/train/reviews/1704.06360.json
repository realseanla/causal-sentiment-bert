Our approach views biomedical resources like lexicons as function primitives for autogenerating weak supervision. We then use a generative model to unify and denoise this supervision and construct large-scale, probabilistically labeled datasets for training high-accuracy NER taggers. In three biomedical NER tasks, SwellShark achieves competitive scores with state-of-the-art supervised benchmarks using no hand-labeled training data. In a drug name extraction task using patient medical records, one domain expert using SwellShark achieved within 5.1% of a crowdsourced annotation approach -- which originally utilized 20 teams over the course of several weeks -- in 24 hours.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 23:02:14 GMT  (1047kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06360v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jason fries", "sen wu", "alex ratner", "christopher r\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.06360"}
