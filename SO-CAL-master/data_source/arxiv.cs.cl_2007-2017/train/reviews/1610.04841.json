The objective of the shared task was to predict if the given word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given sentence. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for word level Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture. RNN-LMs have been found very effective in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. RNN-LM is mainly used for vector space language modeling for different NLP problems. For this task, we modify the architecture of RNN-LM. The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD) in the slot rather than predicting the word. The input to the system is a word sequence, similar to the standard RNN-LM. The approach is language independent and requires only the translated text for QE. To estimate the phrase level quality, we use the output of the word level QE system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Oct 2016 10:54:23 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04841v1", "7 pages, published at First Conference on Machine Translation"], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Oct 2016 07:01:05 GMT  (23kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04841v2", "7 pages, published at First Conference on Machine Translation"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, published at First Conference on Machine Translation", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["raj nath patel", "sasikumar m"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04841"}
