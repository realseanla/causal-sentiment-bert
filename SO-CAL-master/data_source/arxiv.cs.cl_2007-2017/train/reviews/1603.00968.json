MGNC-CNN extracts features from input embedding sets independently and then joins these at the penultimate layer in the network to form a final feature vector. We then adopt a group regularization strategy that differentially penalizes weights associated with the subcomponents generated from the respective embedding sets. This model is much simpler than comparable alternative architectures and requires substantially less training time. Furthermore, it is flexible in that it does not require input word embeddings to be of the same dimensionality. We show that MGNC-CNN consistently outperforms baseline models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 04:12:02 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00968v1", "This paper got accepted by NAACL 2016"], ["v2", "Sun, 27 Mar 2016 03:28:31 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00968v2", "This paper got accepted by NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper got accepted by NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ye zhang", "stephen roller", "byron wallace"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.00968"}
