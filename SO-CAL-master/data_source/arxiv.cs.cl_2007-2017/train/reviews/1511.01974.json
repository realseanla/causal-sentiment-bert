Not only does our method save the time and cost of developing geoparsers for each language separately, but also it allows the possibility of a wide range of language capabilities within a single interface. We evaluated our method in our LanguageBridge prototype on location named entities using newswire, broadcast news and telephone conversations in English, Arabic and Chinese data from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). Our results for geoparsing Chinese and Arabic text using our multi-lingual geoparsing method are comparable to our results for geoparsing English text with our English tools. Furthermore, experiments using our machine translation approach results in accuracy comparable to results from the same data that was translated manually.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 03:07:20 GMT  (393kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01974v1", "7 pages, 4 figures,"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures,", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["xu chen", "han zhang", "judith gelernter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01974"}
