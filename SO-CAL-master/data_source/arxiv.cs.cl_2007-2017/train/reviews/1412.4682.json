We introduce RBEM-Emo as an extension to the Rule-Based Emission Model algorithm to deduce such emotions from human-written messages. We evaluate our approach on two different datasets and compare its performance with the current state-of-the-art techniques for emotion detection, including a recursive auto-encoder. The results of the experimental study suggest that RBEM-Emo is a promising approach advancing the current state-of-the-art in emotion detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 17:20:47 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4682v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["erik tromp", "mykola pechenizkiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.4682"}
