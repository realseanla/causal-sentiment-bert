We propose a language model based on compressed suffix trees, a representation that is highly compact and can be easily held in memory, while supporting queries needed in computing language model probabilities on-the-fly. We present several optimisations which improve query runtimes up to 2500x, despite only incurring a modest increase in construction time and memory usage. For large corpora and high Markov orders, our method is highly competitive with the state-of-the-art KenLM package. It imposes much lower memory requirements, often by orders of magnitude, and has runtimes that are either similar (for training) or comparable (for querying).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 02:33:21 GMT  (930kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04465v1", "14 pages in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ehsan shareghi", "matthias petri", "gholamreza haffari", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04465"}
