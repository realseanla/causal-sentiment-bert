Specifically, we evaluate whether language that originated in an amicus brief acquired legal precedent status by being cited in the Court's opinion. Using plagiarism detection software, automated querying of a large legal database, and manual analysis, we establish seven instances where interest group amici were able to formulate constitutional case law, setting binding legal precedent. We discuss several such instances for their implications in the Supreme Court's creation of case law. Our results indicate that around 100 more instances can be found in our data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 08:21:29 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04672v1", "Stanford University \"Law, Order, and Algorithms\" Final Project"], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Jul 2016 10:20:35 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04672v2", "Stanford University \"Law, Order, and Algorithms\" Final Project"]], "COMMENTS": "Stanford University \"Law, Order, and Algorithms\" Final Project", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["allen huang", "lars roemheld"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04672"}
