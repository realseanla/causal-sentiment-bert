{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Mar-2016", "title": "A Parallel-Hierarchical Model for Machine Comprehension on Sparse Data", "abstract": "Understanding unstructured text is a major goal within natural language processing. Comprehension tests pose questions based on short text passages to evaluate such understanding. In this work, we investigate machine comprehension on the challenging {\\it MCTest} benchmark. Partly because of its limited size, prior work on {\\it MCTest} has focused mainly on engineering better features. We tackle the dataset with a neural approach, harnessing simple neural networks arranged in a parallel hierarchy. The parallel hierarchy enables our model to compare the passage, question, and answer from a variety of trainable perspectives, as opposed to using a manually designed, rigid feature set. Perspectives range from the word level to sentence fragments to sequences of sentences; the networks operate only on word-embedding representations of text. When trained with a methodology designed to help cope with limited training data, our Parallel-Hierarchical model sets a new state of the art for {\\it MCTest}, outperforming previous feature-engineered approaches slightly and previous neural approaches by a significant margin (over 15\\% absolute).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 18:52:46 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08884v1", "9 pages, submitted to ACL"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, submitted to ACL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["adam trischler", "zheng ye", "xingdi yuan", "jing he", "philip bachman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.08884"}
