We tackled the problem using a number of approaches, utilising a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM). We found an improvement of 4-6% using the LSTM model over the SVR and came fourth in the track. We report a number of different evaluations using a finance specific word embedding model and reflect on the effects of using different evaluation metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 15:57:41 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00571v1", "5 pages, to Appear in the Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2017), August 2017, Vancouver, BC"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, to Appear in the Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval 2017), August 2017, Vancouver, BC", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["andrew moore", "paul rayson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00571"}
