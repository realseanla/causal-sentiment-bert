However, tree-based models are seldom studied in the context of structured learning despite their recent success on various classification and ranking tasks. In this paper, we propose S-MART, a tree-based structured learning framework based on multiple additive regression trees. S-MART is especially suitable for handling tasks with dense features, and can be used to learn many different structures under various loss functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 17:01:03 GMT  (134kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08075v1", "Appeared in ACL 2015 proceedings.
