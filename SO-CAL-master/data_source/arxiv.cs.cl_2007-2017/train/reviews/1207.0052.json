We begin with a brief discussion of some early hardness results which show that unrestricted language learning is impossible, and unrestricted CFL learning is computationally infeasible; we then briefly survey the literature on algorithms for learning restricted subclasses of the CFLs. Finally, we introduce a new family of subclasses, the principled parametric context-free grammars (and a corresponding family of principled parametric context-sensitive grammars), which roughly model the \"Principles and Parameters\" framework in psycholinguistics. We present three hardness results: first, that the PPCFGs are not efficiently learnable given equivalence and membership oracles, second, that the PPCFGs are not efficiently learnable from positive presentations unless P = NP, and third, that the PPCSGs are not efficiently learnable from positive presentations unless integer factorization is in P.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 06:36:04 GMT  (9kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0052v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 03:49:57 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0052v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 15:20:17 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0052v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.CL", "authors": ["jacob", "reas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1207.0052"}
