In response to this problem, we maintain a coverage vector to keep track of the attention history. The coverage vector is fed to the attention model to help adjust the future attention, which guides NMT to pay more attention to the untranslated source words. Experiments show that coverage-based NMT significantly improves both alignment and translation quality over NMT without coverage.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 07:09:38 GMT  (904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 01:38:45 GMT  (904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 01:45:22 GMT  (558kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811v3", "Results over a stronger NMT baseline, which is now comparable with Moses"], ["v4", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 09:51:50 GMT  (1198kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811v4", "Accepted by ACL 2016, Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2016)"], ["v5", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 05:03:33 GMT  (1199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811v5", "The paper is accepted by ACL 2016"], ["v6", "Sat, 6 Aug 2016 17:13:04 GMT  (606kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04811v6", "Add subjective evaluation on top of ACL version: 25% of source words are under-translated by NMT"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhaopeng tu", "zhengdong lu", "yang liu", "xiaohua liu", "hang li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.04811"}
