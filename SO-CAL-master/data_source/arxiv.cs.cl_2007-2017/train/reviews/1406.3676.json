Our model learns low-dimensional embeddings of words and knowledge base constituents; these representations are used to score natural language questions against candidate answers. Training our system using pairs of questions and structured representations of their answers, and pairs of question paraphrases, yields state-of-the-art results on a competitive benchmark of the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Jun 2014 03:00:23 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3676v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Sep 2014 01:02:11 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3676v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 4 Sep 2014 00:25:35 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3676v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["antoine bordes", "sumit chopra", "jason weston"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3676"}
