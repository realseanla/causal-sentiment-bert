For any given source sentence, phraseNet scans the phrase memory to determine the candidate phrase pairs and integrates tagging information in the representation of source sentence accordingly. The decoder utilizes a mixture of word-generating component and phrase-generating component, with a specifically designed strategy to generate a sequence of multiple words all at once. The phraseNet not only approaches one step towards incorporating external knowledge into neural machine translation, but also makes an effort to extend the word-by-word generation mechanism of recurrent neural network. Our empirical study on Chinese-to-English translation shows that, with carefully-chosen phrase table in memory, phraseNet yields 3.45 BLEU improvement over the generic neural machine translator.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 15:45:41 GMT  (309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01792v1", "8 figures, 9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 figures, 9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yaohua tang", "fandong meng", "zhengdong lu", "hang li", "philip l h yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01792"}
