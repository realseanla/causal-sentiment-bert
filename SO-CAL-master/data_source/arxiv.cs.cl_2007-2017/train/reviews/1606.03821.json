Color descriptions have many challenging properties: they can be vague, compositionally complex, and denotationally rich. We present an effective approach to generating color descriptions using recurrent neural networks and a Fourier-transformed color representation. Our model outperforms previous work on a conditional language modeling task over a large corpus of naturalistic color descriptions. In addition, probing the model's output reveals that it can accurately produce not only basic color terms but also descriptors with non-convex denotations (\"greenish\"), bare modifiers (\"bright\", \"dull\"), and compositional phrases (\"faded teal\") not seen in training.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 06:17:32 GMT  (625kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03821v1", "5 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables.
