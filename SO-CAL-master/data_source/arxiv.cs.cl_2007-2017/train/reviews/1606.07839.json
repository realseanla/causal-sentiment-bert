In these contexts, it is beneficial to provide these oracle mechanisms with multiple highly likely hypotheses rather than a single prediction. In this work, we pose the task of producing multiple outputs as a learning problem over an ensemble of deep networks -- introducing a novel stochastic gradient descent based approach to minimize the loss with respect to an oracle. Our method is simple to implement, agnostic to both architecture and loss function, and parameter-free. Our approach achieves lower oracle error compared to existing methods on a wide range of tasks and deep architectures. We also show qualitatively that solutions produced from our approach often provide interpretable representations of task ambiguity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 21:48:55 GMT  (7242kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07839v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 20:44:55 GMT  (12050kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07839v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 17:12:00 GMT  (6655kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07839v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["stefan lee", "senthil purushwalkam", "michael cogswell", "viresh ranjan", "david j crandall", "dhruv batra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.07839"}
