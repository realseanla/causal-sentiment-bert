Therefore, such methods cannot be easily applied on noisy sequences which are expected in real-world applications. We present the Temporal Attention-Gated Model (TAGM) which is able to deal with noisy sequences. Our model assimilates ideas from attention models and gated recurrent networks. Specifically, we employ an attention model to measure the relevance of each time step of a sequence to the final decision. We then use the relevant segments based on their attention scores in a novel gated recurrent network to learn the hidden representation for the classification. More importantly, our attention weights provide a physically meaningful interpretation for the salience of each time step in the sequence. We demonstrate the merits of our model in both interpretability and classification performance on a variety of tasks, including speech recognition, textual sentiment analysis and event recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 19:11:24 GMT  (3920kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00385v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 12:53:28 GMT  (4716kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00385v2", "Accepted by CVPR 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["wenjie pei", "tadas baltru\\v{s}aitis", "david m j tax", "louis-philippe morency"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00385"}
