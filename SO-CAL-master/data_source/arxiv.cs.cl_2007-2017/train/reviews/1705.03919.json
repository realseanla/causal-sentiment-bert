We show that this model is not only compatible with classical dynamic programming techniques, but also admits a novel greedy top-down inference algorithm based on recursive partitioning of the input. We demonstrate empirically that both prediction schemes are competitive with recent work, and when combined with basic extensions to the scoring model are capable of achieving state-of-the-art single-model performance on the Penn Treebank (91.79 F1) and strong performance on the French Treebank (82.23 F1).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 18:44:15 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03919v1", "To appear in ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mitchell stern", "jacob andreas", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.03919"}
