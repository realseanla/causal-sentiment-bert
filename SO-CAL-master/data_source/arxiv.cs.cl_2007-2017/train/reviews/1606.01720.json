This is the first proof net calculus which models the Displacement calculus directly and not by some sort of translation into another formalism. The proof net calculus opens up new possibilities for parsing and proof search with the Displacement calculus.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 12:55:57 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01720v1", "Formal Grammar, Aug 2016, Bolzano, Italy.
