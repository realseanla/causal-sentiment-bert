We describe a convolutional architecture dubbed the Dynamic Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) that we adopt for the semantic modelling of sentences. The network uses Dynamic k-Max Pooling, a global pooling operation over linear sequences. The network handles input sentences of varying length and induces a feature graph over the sentence that is capable of explicitly capturing short and long-range relations. The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language. We test the DCNN in four experiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision. The network achieves excellent performance in the first three tasks and a greater than 25% error reduction in the last task with respect to the strongest baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Apr 2014 15:46:44 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.2188v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nal kalchbrenner", "edward grefenstette", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.2188"}
