Here, we analyze causal precedence in the biomedical domain as distinct from open-domain, temporal precedence. First, we describe a novel, hand-annotated text corpus of causal precedence in the biomedical domain. Second, we use this corpus to investigate a battery of models of precedence, covering rule-based, feature-based, and latent representation models. The highest-performing individual model achieved a micro F1 of 43 points, approaching the best performers on the simpler temporal-only precedence tasks. Feature-based and latent representation models each outperform the rule-based models, but their performance is complementary to one another. We apply a sieve-based architecture to capitalize on this lack of overlap, achieving a micro F1 score of 46 points.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Jun 2016 21:55:40 GMT  (473kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08089v1", "To appear in the proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the proceedings of the 2016 Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gus hahn-powell", "dane bell", "marco a valenzuela-esc\\'arcega", "mihai surdeanu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08089"}
