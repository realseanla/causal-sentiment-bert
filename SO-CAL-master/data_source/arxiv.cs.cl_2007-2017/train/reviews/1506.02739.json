We introduce connotation frames to encode the rich dimensions of implied sentiment, value judgements, and effect evaluation as typed relations that these choices influence, and propose a factor graph formulation that captures the inter-play among different types of connotative relations at the lexicon-level. Experimental results confirm that our model is effective in predicting connotative sentiments compared to strong baselines and existing sentiment lexicons.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 00:58:51 GMT  (276kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02739v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 23:03:20 GMT  (340kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02739v2", "11 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 03:49:42 GMT  (533kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02739v3", "11 pages, published in Proceedings of ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hannah rashkin", "sameer singh 0001", "yejin choi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02739"}
