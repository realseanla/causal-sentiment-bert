However there are a number of challenges to overcome to allow such an interface to operate robustly in realistic settings, including the intrinsic difficulties of recognising child speech and high levels of background noise often present in classrooms. As part of the EU EASEL project we have provided several contributions to address these challenges, implementing our own ASR module for use in robotics applications. We used the latest deep neural network algorithms which provide a leap in performance over the traditional GMM approach, and apply data augmentation methods to improve robustness to noise and speaker variation. We provide a close integration between the ASR module and the rest of the dialogue system, allowing the ASR to receive in real-time the language models relevant to the current section of the dialogue, greatly improving the accuracy. We integrated our ASR module into an interactive, multimodal system using a small humanoid robot to help children learn about exercise and energy. The system was installed at a public museum event as part of a research study where 320 children (aged 3 to 14) interacted with the robot, with our ASR achieving 90% accuracy for fluent and near-fluent speech.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 09:50:30 GMT  (6892kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02695v1", "Submission to Computer Speech and Language, special issue on Interaction Technologies for Children"]], "COMMENTS": "Submission to Computer Speech and Language, special issue on Interaction Technologies for Children", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["samuel fernando", "roger k moore", "david cameron", "emily c collins", "abigail millings", "amanda j sharkey", "tony j prescott"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02695"}
