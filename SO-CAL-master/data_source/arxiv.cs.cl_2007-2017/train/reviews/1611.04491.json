However, medical jargon, which abounds in EHR notes, has been shown to be a barrier for patient EHR comprehension. Existing knowledge bases that link medical jargon to lay terms or definitions play an important role in alleviating this problem but have low coverage of medical jargon in EHRs. We developed a data-driven approach that mines EHRs to identify and rank medical jargon based on its importance to patients, to support the building of EHR-centric lay language resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 17:36:05 GMT  (1162kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04491v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jinying chen", "abhyuday n jagannatha", "samah j jarad", "hong yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04491"}
