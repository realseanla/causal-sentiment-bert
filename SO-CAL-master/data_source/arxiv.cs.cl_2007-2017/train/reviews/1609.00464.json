At its heart, the Semantic Knowledge Graph leverages an inverted index, along with a complementary uninverted index, to represent nodes (terms) and edges (the documents within intersecting postings lists for multiple terms/nodes). This provides a layer of indirection between each pair of nodes and their corresponding edge, enabling edges to materialize dynamically from underlying corpus statistics. As a result, any combination of nodes can have edges to any other nodes materialize and be scored to reveal latent relationships between the nodes. This provides numerous benefits: the knowledge graph can be built automatically from a real-world corpus of data, new nodes - along with their combined edges - can be instantly materialized from any arbitrary combination of preexisting nodes (using set operations), and a full model of the semantic relationships between all entities within a domain can be represented and dynamically traversed using a highly compact representation of the graph. Such a system has widespread applications in areas as diverse as knowledge modeling and reasoning, natural language processing, anomaly detection, data cleansing, semantic search, analytics, data classification, root cause analysis, and recommendations systems. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a novel system - the Semantic Knowledge Graph - which is able to dynamically discover and score interesting relationships between any arbitrary combination of entities (words, phrases, or extracted concepts) through dynamically materializing nodes and edges from a compact graphical representation built automatically from a corpus of data representative of a knowledge domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 04:26:54 GMT  (1232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00464v1", "Accepted to be published in 2016 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics"], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Sep 2016 15:06:45 GMT  (1229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00464v2", "Accepted for publication in 2016 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to be published in 2016 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["trey grainger", "khalifeh aljadda", "mohammed korayem", "ries smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00464"}
