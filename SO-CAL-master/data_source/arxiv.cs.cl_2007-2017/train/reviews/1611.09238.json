Text classification just makes up for these deficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization system called TCSum, which leverages plentiful text classification data to improve the performance of multi-document summarization. TCSum projects documents onto distributed representations which act as a bridge between text classification and summarization. It also utilizes the classification results to produce summaries of different styles. Extensive experiments on DUC generic multi-document summarization datasets show that, TCSum can achieve the state-of-the-art performance without using any hand-crafted features and has the capability to catch the variations of summary styles with respect to different text categories.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 16:53:06 GMT  (161kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09238v1", "7 pages, 3 figures, AAAI-17"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 3 figures, AAAI-17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["ziqiang cao", "wenjie li", "sujian li", "furu wei"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.09238"}
