Databases are often hard to use in cooperating with the users because of their rigid interface. A good NLIDB allows a user to enter commands and ask questions in native language and then after interpreting respond to the user in native language. For a large number of applications requiring interaction between humans and the computer systems, it would be convenient to provide the end-user friendly interface. Punjabi language interface to database would proof fruitful to native people of Punjab, as it provides ease to them to use various e-governance applications like Punjab Sewa, Suwidha, Online Public Utility Forms, Online Grievance Cell, Land Records Management System,legacy matters, e-District, agriculture, etc. Punjabi is the mother tongue of more than 110 million people all around the world.
