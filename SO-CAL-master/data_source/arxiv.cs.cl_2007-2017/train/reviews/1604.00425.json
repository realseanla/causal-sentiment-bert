We perform an extensive evaluation of four popular approaches of inducing cross-lingual embeddings, each requiring a different form of supervision, on four typographically different language pairs. Our evaluation setup spans four different tasks, including intrinsic evaluation on mono-lingual and cross-lingual similarity, and extrinsic evaluation on downstream semantic and syntactic applications. We show that models which require expensive cross-lingual knowledge almost always perform better, but cheaply supervised models often prove competitive on certain tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 22:18:51 GMT  (225kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00425v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 03:14:08 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00425v2", "To appear at ACL 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shyam upadhyay", "manaal faruqui", "chris dyer", "dan roth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.00425"}
