Most NLG systems in common use employ rules and heuristics and tend to generate rigid and stylised responses without the natural variation of human language. They are also not easily scaled to systems covering multiple domains and languages. This paper presents a statistical language generator based on a semantically controlled Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) structure. The LSTM generator can learn from unaligned data by jointly optimising sentence planning and surface realisation using a simple cross entropy training criterion, and language variation can be easily achieved by sampling from output candidates. An objective evaluation in two differing test domains showed improved performance compared to previous methods with fewer heuristics. Human judges scored the LSTM system higher on informativeness and naturalness and overall preferred it to the other systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Aug 2015 16:16:44 GMT  (643kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01745v1", "To be appear in EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 17:16:25 GMT  (813kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.01745v2", "To be appear in EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To be appear in EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tsung-hsien wen", "milica gasic", "nikola mrksic", "pei-hao su", "david vandyke", "steve j young"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.01745"}
