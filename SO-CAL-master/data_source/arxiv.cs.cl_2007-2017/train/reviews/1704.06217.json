First, the state representation, which characterizes the history of comments tracked in a discussion at a particular point, is augmented to incorporate the global context represented by discussions on world events available in an external knowledge source. Second, a two-stage Q-learning framework is introduced, making it feasible to search the combinatorial action space while also accounting for redundancy among sub-actions. We experiment with five Reddit communities, showing that the two methods improve over previous reported results on this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:30:39 GMT  (1085kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06217v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ji he", "mari ostendorf", "xiaodong he"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.06217"}
