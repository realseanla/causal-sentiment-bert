There has been a lot of research in this direction but the problem of integrating state-of-the-art neural language models with affective information remains an area ripe for exploration. In this paper, we propose an extension to an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) language model for generating conversational text, conditioned on affect categories. Our proposed model, Affect-LM enables us to customize the degree of emotional content in generated sentences through an additional design parameter. Perception studies conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk show that Affect-LM generates naturally looking emotional sentences without sacrificing grammatical correctness. Affect-LM also learns affect-discriminative word representations, and perplexity experiments show that additional affective information in conversational text can improve language model prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 21:10:10 GMT  (346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06851v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sayan ghosh", "mathieu chollet", "eugene laksana", "louis-philippe morency", "stefan scherer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06851"}
