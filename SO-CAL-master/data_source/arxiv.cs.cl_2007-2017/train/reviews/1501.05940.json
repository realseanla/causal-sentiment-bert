Their enormous success and their increased use led to the fact that thousands of Web services are present on the Internet. This significant number of Web services which not cease to increase has led to problems of the difficulty in locating and classifying web services, these problems are encountered mainly during the operations of web services discovery and substitution. Traditional ways of search based on keywords are not successful in this context, their results do not support the structure of Web services and they consider in their search only the identifiers of the web service description language (WSDL) interface elements. The methods based on semantics (WSDLS, OWLS, SAWSDL...) which increase the WSDL description of a Web service with a semantic description allow raising partially this problem, but their complexity and difficulty delays their adoption in real cases. Measuring the similarity between the web services interfaces is the most suitable solution for this kind of problems, it will classify available web services so as to know those that best match the searched profile and those that do not match. Thus, the main goal of this work is to study the degree of similarity between any two web services by offering a new method that is more effective than existing works.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 22:18:45 GMT  (603kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05940v1", "7 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA),Vol. 5, No. 8, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications (IJACSA),Vol. 5, No. 8, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR cs.SE", "authors": ["t rachad", "j boutahar", "s el ghazi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.05940"}
