However for real applications, further enhancement of this accuracy levels are required. One of the bottle necks in further enhancement of the accuracy is identified as close-matching characters. In this paper, we delineate the close matching characters in Malayalam and report the development of a specialised classifier for these close-matching characters. The output of a state of the art of OCR is taken and characters falling into the close-matching character set is further fed into this specialised classifier for enhancing the accuracy. The classifier is based on support vector machine algorithm and uses feature vectors derived out of spectral coefficients of projection histogram signals of close-matching characters.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 May 2012 09:25:14 GMT  (235kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1639v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.IR", "authors": ["sajilal divakaran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.1639"}
