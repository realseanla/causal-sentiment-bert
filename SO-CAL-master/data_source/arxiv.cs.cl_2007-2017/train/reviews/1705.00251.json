It shows that if the system has performed aspect extraction from many past domains and retained their results as knowledge, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) can leverage this knowledge in a lifelong learning manner to extract in a new domain markedly better than the traditional CRF without using this prior knowledge. The key innovation is that even after CRF training, the model can still improve its extraction with experiences in its applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 23:33:13 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00251v1", "Accepted at ACL 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1612.07940"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ACL 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1612.07940", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lei shu", "hu xu", "bing liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00251"}
