While it has been shown to correlate well with human judgements, it is biased towards surface lexical similarities. This makes it unsuitable for the evaluation of abstractive summarization, or summaries with substantial paraphrasing. We study the effectiveness of word embeddings to overcome this disadvantage of ROUGE. Specifically, instead of measuring lexical overlaps, word embeddings are used to compute the semantic similarity of the words used in summaries instead. Our experimental results show that our proposal is able to achieve better correlations with human judgements when measured with the Spearman and Kendall rank coefficients.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 05:04:53 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06034v1", "Pre-print - To appear in proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "Pre-print - To appear in proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jun-ping ng", "viktoria abrecht"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.06034"}
