In other words, what kind of cognitive processes mediate sensing capability, and the formation of sensible impressions ---e.g., abstractions, analogies, hypotheses and theory formation, beliefs and their revision, argument formation--- in domain-specific problem solving, or in regular activities of everyday living, working and simply going around in the environment? How can knowledge and reasoning about such capabilities, as exhibited by humans in particular problem contexts, be used as a model and benchmark for the development of collaborative cognitive (interaction) systems concerned with human assistance, assurance, and empowerment?", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 10:01:29 GMT  (29kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3040v1", "5 pages, research statement summarising recent publications"], ["v2", "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 10:22:29 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3040v2", "5 pages, research statement summarising recent publications"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, research statement summarising recent publications", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.HC cs.RO", "authors": ["mehul bhatt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3040"}
