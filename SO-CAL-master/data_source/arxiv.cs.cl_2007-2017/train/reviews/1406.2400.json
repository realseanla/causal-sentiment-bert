The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, it offers a methodological approach to automatically generate the grammar based on semantico-syntactic valence patterns extracted from FrameNet-annotated corpora. Second, it provides a proof of concept for two use cases illustrating how the acquired multilingual grammar can be exploited in different CNL applications in the domains of arts and tourism.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 01:01:48 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2400v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dana dann\\'ells", "normunds gr\\=uz\\=itis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2400"}
