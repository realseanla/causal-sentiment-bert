This article discusses the question of core change rate and the degree to which the core words cover the texts. Different periods of the last three centuries and six main European languages presented in Google Books Ngram are compared. The main result is high stability of core change rate, which is analogous to stability of the Swadesh list.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 10:51:20 GMT  (362kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10112v1", "This report was presented at the Workshop \"Computational linguistics and language science\", Moscow, Russia on April 25, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This report was presented at the Workshop \"Computational linguistics and language science\", Moscow, Russia on April 25, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["valery d solovyev", "vladimir v bochkarev", "anna v shevlyakova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10112"}
