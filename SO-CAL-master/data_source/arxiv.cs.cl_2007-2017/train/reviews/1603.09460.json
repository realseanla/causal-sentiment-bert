This paper presents a combination approach to improve short utterance speaker recognition (SUSR), where two phonetic-aware systems are combined together: one is the DNN-based i-vector system and the other is the subregion-based GMM-UBM system proposed by us recently. The former employs phone posteriors to construct an i-vector model in which the shared statistics offer stronger robustness against limited test data. The latter establishes a phone-dependent GMM-UBM system which represents speaker characteristics with more details. A scorelevel system combination approach is proposed to integrate the respective advantages of the two systems. Experimental results confirm that on the text-independent SUSR task, both the DNN-based i-vector system and the subregion-based GMM-UBM system outperform their respective baselines, and the score-level system combination delivers significant performance improvement.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 05:47:03 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09460v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 13:49:05 GMT  (1288kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09460v2", "APSIPA ASC 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["lantian li", "dong wang", "xiaodong zhang", "thomas fang zheng", "panshi jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09460"}
