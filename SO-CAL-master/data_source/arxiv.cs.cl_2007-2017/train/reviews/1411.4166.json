{"conference": "HLT-NAACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Nov-2014", "title": "Retrofitting Word Vectors to Semantic Lexicons", "abstract": "We have proposed a simple, effective and fast method named retrofitting to improve word vectors using word relation knowledge found in semantic lexicons constructed either automatically or by humans. Retrofitting is used as a post-processing step to improve vector quality and is simpler to use than other approaches that use semantic information while training. It can be used for improving vectors obtained from any word vector training model and performs better than current state-of-the-art approaches to semantic enrichment of word vectors. We validated the applicability of our method across tasks, semantic lexicons, and languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 17:34:20 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4166v1", "Appeared in NIPS Deep learning and representation learning workshop 2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 04:16:50 GMT  (191kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4166v2", "Appeared in NIPS Deep learning and Representation learning workshop 2014"], ["v3", "Sun, 1 Feb 2015 03:13:17 GMT  (199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4166v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 22 Mar 2015 17:55:20 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4166v4", "Proceedings of NAACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in NIPS Deep learning and representation learning workshop 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui", "jesse dodge", "sujay kumar jauhar", "chris dyer", "eduard h hovy", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.4166"}
