For example, international relations can be strained by how the media in one country describes an event in another; and papers can be rejected because they overstate or understate their findings. It is thus important to understand the effects of statement strength. A first step is to be able to distinguish between strong and weak statements. However, even this problem is understudied, partly due to a lack of data. Since strength is inherently relative, revisions of texts that make claims are a natural source of data on strength differences. In this paper, we introduce a corpus of sentence-level revisions from academic writing. We also describe insights gained from our annotation efforts for this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 May 2014 20:05:23 GMT  (328kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1439v1", "6 pages, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2014 (short paper)"], ["v2", "Sat, 31 May 2014 23:44:18 GMT  (327kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1439v2", "6 pages, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2014 (short paper)"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, to appear in Proceedings of ACL 2014 (short paper)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chenhao tan", "lillian lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.1439"}
