Moreover, despite the lack of direct supervision at the attribute level, the model learns to assign plausible attributes to objects (sofa-has_cushion). Finally, we present a preliminary experiment confirming the referential success of the predicted discriminative attributes.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 18:39:46 GMT  (1896kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02618v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 17:04:15 GMT  (2006kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02618v2", "Accepted as an ACL-short sumbmission"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["angeliki lazaridou", "nghia the pham", "marco baroni"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.02618"}
