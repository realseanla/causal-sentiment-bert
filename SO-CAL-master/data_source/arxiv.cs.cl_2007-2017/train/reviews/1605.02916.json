These are ways of expressing instance enumerations of a class in natural language. While these lexico-syntactic patterns prove quite useful, they may not capture all taxonomical relations expressed in text. Therefore in this paper we describe a novel method of IS-A relation extraction from patterns, which uses morpho-syntactical annotations along with grammatical case of noun phrases that constitute entities participating in IS-A relation. We also describe a method for increasing the number of extracted relations that we call pseudo-subclass boosting which has potential application in any pattern-based relation extraction method. Experiments were conducted on a corpus of about 0.5 billion web documents in Polish language.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 May 2016 10:03:48 GMT  (95kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02916v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["pawe{\\l} {\\l}ozi\\'nski", "dariusz czerski", "mieczys{\\l}aw a k{\\l}opotek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02916"}
