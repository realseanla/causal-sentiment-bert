{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "31-May-2016", "title": "Hierarchical Question-Image Co-Attention for Visual Question Answering", "abstract": "A number of recent works have proposed attention models for Visual Question Answering (VQA) that generate spatial maps highlighting image regions relevant to answering the question. In this paper, we argue that in addition to modeling \"where to look\" or visual attention, it is equally important to model \"what words to listen to\" or question attention. We present a novel co-attention model for VQA that jointly reasons about image and question attention. In addition, our model reasons about the question and consequently the image via the co-attention mechanism in a hierarchical fashion via a novel 1-dimensional convolution neural networks (CNN) model. Our final model outperforms all reported methods, improving the state-of-the-art on the VQA dataset from 60.4% to 62.1%, and from 61.6% to 65.4% on the COCO-QA dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 22:02:01 GMT  (4284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061v1", "11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 01:51:13 GMT  (3549kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061v2", "11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables"], ["v3", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 02:15:57 GMT  (3669kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061v3", "11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables"], ["v4", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 16:18:03 GMT  (3669kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061v4", "11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables in 2016 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)"], ["v5", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 05:03:33 GMT  (3669kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00061v5", "11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables in 2016 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["jiasen lu", "jianwei yang", "dhruv batra", "devi parikh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00061"}
