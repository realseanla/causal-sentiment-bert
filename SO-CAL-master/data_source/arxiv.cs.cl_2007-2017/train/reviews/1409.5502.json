For the given site, processed with a crowdsourcing system, a sentence-aligned corpus can be fetched, which covers a very narrow domain of terminology and language patterns - a site-specific domain. These data can be used for training and estimation of site-specific statistical machine translation engine", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 02:50:04 GMT  (181kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5502v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexander kalinin", "george savchenko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5502"}
