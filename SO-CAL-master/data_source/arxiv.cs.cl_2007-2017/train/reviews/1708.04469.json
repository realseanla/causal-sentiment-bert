The CTC loss function maps an input sequence of observable feature vectors to an output sequence of symbols. Output symbols are conditionally independent of each other under CTC loss, so a language model (LM) can be incorporated conveniently during decoding, retaining the traditional separation of acoustic and linguistic components in ASR. For fixed vocabularies, Weighted Finite State Transducers provide a strong baseline for efficient integration of CTC AMs with n-gram LMs. Character-based neural LMs provide a straight forward solution for open vocabulary speech recognition and all-neural models, and can be decoded with beam search. Finally, sequence-to-sequence models can be used to translate a sequence of individual sounds into a word string. We compare the performance of these three approaches, and analyze their error patterns, which provides insightful guidance for future research and development in this important area.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 12:05:02 GMT  (509kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04469v1", "5 pages.
