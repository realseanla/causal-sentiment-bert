While much attention has been directed towards the modeling algorithms and their various extensions, comparatively few studies have concerned how to present or visualize topic models in meaningful ways. In this paper, we present a novel design that uses graphs to visually communicate topic structure and meaning. By connecting topic nodes via descriptive keyterms, the graph representation reveals topic similarities, topic meaning and shared, ambiguous keyterms. At the same time, the graph can be used for information retrieval purposes, to find documents by topic or topic subsets. To exemplify the utility of the design, we illustrate its use for organizing and exploring corpora of financial patents.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 12:26:39 GMT  (437kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5623v1", "Online demo atthis http URLappears in Proceedings of the 2014 Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis)"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 12:31:03 GMT  (438kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5623v2", "Online demo atthis http URLappears in Proceedings of the 2014 Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis)"]], "COMMENTS": "Online demo atthis http URLappears in Proceedings of the 2014 Eurographics Conference on Visualization (EuroVis)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["samuel r\\\"onnqvist", "xiaolu wang", "peter sarlin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5623"}
