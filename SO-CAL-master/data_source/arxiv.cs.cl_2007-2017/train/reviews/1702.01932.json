Nevertheless, these models have yet to demonstrate that they can incorporate content in the form of factual information or entity-grounded opinion that would enable them to serve in more task-oriented conversational applications. This paper presents a novel, fully data-driven, and knowledge-grounded neural conversation model aimed at producing more contentful responses without slot filling. We generalize the widely-used Seq2Seq approach by conditioning responses on both conversation history and external \"facts\", allowing the model to be versatile and applicable in an open-domain setting. Our approach yields significant improvements over a competitive Seq2Seq baseline. Human judges found that our outputs are significantly more informative.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 09:16:46 GMT  (2637kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01932v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marjan ghazvininejad", "chris brockett", "ming-wei chang", "bill dolan", "jianfeng gao", "wen-tau yih", "michel galley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01932"}
