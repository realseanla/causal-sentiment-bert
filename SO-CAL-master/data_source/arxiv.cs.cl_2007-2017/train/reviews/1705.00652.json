{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-May-2017", "title": "Efficient Natural Language Response Suggestion for Smart Reply", "abstract": "This paper presents a computationally efficient machine-learned method for natural language response suggestion. Feed-forward neural networks using n-gram embedding features encode messages into vectors which are optimized to give message-response pairs a high dot-product value. An optimized search finds response suggestions. The method is evaluated in a large-scale commercial e-mail application, Inbox by Gmail. Compared to a sequence-to-sequence approach, the new system achieves the same quality at a small fraction of the computational requirements and latency.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 18:24:15 GMT  (431kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00652v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["matthew henderson", "rami al-rfou", "brian strope", "yun-hsuan sung", "laszlo lukacs", "ruiqi guo", "sanjiv kumar", "balint miklos", "ray kurzweil"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00652"}
