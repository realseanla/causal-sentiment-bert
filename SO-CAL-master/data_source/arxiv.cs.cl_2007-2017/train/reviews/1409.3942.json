Opinion Mining or Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing task that mines information from various text forms such as reviews, news, and blogs and classify them on the basis of their polarity as positive, negative or neutral. But, from the last few years, user content in Hindi language is also increasing at a rapid rate on the Web. So it is very important to perform opinion mining in Hindi language as well.
