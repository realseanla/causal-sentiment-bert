{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Aug-2016", "title": "Automatic Selection of Context Configurations for Improved Class-Specific Word Representations", "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that state-of-the-art word embedding models require different context types to produce high-quality representations for different word classes such as adjectives (A), verbs (V), and nouns (N). This paper is concerned with identifying contexts useful for learning A/V/N-specific representations. We introduce a simple yet effective framework for selecting class-specific context configurations that yield improved representations for each class. We propose an automatic A* style selection algorithm that effectively searches only a fraction of the large configuration space. The results on predicting similarity scores for the A, V, and N subsets of the benchmarking SimLex-999 evaluation set indicate that our method is useful for each class: the improvements are 6% (A), 6% (V), and 5% (N) over the best previously proposed context type for each class. At the same time, the model trains on only 14% (A), 26.2% (V), and 33.6% (N) of all dependency-based contexts, resulting in much shorter training time.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 08:30:35 GMT  (159kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05528v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 09:26:29 GMT  (160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05528v2", "CoNLL 2017"], ["v3", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 13:11:53 GMT  (153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05528v3", "CoNLL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ivan vuli\\'c", "roy schwartz", "ari rappoport", "roi reichart", "anna korhonen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05528"}
