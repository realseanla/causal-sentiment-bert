Fingerspelling comprises a significant but relatively understudied part of ASL, and recognizing it is challenging for a number of reasons: It involves quick, small motions that are often highly coarticulated; it exhibits significant variation between signers; and there has been a dearth of continuous fingerspelling data collected. In this work, we propose several types of recognition approaches, and explore the signer variation problem. Our best-performing models are segmental (semi-Markov) conditional random fields using deep neural network-based features. In the signer-dependent setting, our recognizers achieve up to about 8% letter error rates. The signer-independent setting is much more challenging, but with neural network adaptation we achieve up to 17% letter error rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 06:12:22 GMT  (4909kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08339v1", "PhD Thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "PhD Thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["taehwan kim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08339"}
