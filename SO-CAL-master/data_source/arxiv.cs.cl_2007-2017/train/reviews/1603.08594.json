The motivation for the work comes from NLP applications like Machine Translation, for which, getting the correct attachment of prepositions is very crucial. The idea is to correct the PP-attachments for a sentence with the help of alignments from parallel data in another language. The novelty of our work lies in the formulation of the problem into a dual decomposition based algorithm that enforces agreement between the parse trees from two languages as a constraint. Experiments were performed on the English-Hindi language pair and the performance improved by 10% over the baseline, where the baseline is the attachment predicted by the MSTParser model trained for English.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 00:06:11 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08594v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["geetanjali rakshit", "sagar sontakke", "pushpak bhattacharyya", "gholamreza haffari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08594"}
