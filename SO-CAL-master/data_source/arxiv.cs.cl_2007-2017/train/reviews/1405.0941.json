In this paper, we present two datasets we built to cope with the combination of the Textual Entailment framework and bipolar abstract argumentation. In our approach, such datasets are used to automatically identify through a Textual Entailment system the relations among the arguments (i.e., attack, support), and then the resulting bipolar argumentation graphs are analyzed to compute the accepted arguments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 16:03:04 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0941v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["elena cabrio", "serena villata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0941"}
