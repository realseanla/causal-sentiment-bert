The proposed model emerges naturally from the representational framework we use and as such, has a clear semantic grounding. We give generalisations of these hedge models and show that they can be composed with themselves and with other functions, going on to examine their behaviour in the limit of composition.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 19:38:37 GMT  (240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06738v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["martha lewis", "jonathan lawry"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06738"}
