In this work, we propose a model to take into account both the similarities and dissimilarities by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. The model represents each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for each word based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the semantic matching vector. After this, a two-channel CNN model is employed to capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase identification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 03:08:50 GMT  (587kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07019v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 19:51:10 GMT  (719kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07019v2", "In Proceedings of Coling 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhiguo wang", "haitao mi", "abraham ittycheriah"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07019"}
