It allows for a systematic translation of the system requirements into the system architecture expressed as an ensemble-based component system (EBCS). However, since the requirements are captured using natural language, there exists the danger of their misinterpretation due to natural language requirements' ambiguity, which could eventually lead to design errors. Thus, automation and validation of the design process is desirable. In this paper, we (i) analyze the translation process of natural language requirements into the IRM-SA model, (ii) identify individual steps that can be automated and/or validated using natural language processing techniques, and (iii) propose suitable methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 04:34:39 GMT  (258kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08636v1", "In Proceedings FESCA 2016,arXiv:1603.08371"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings FESCA 2016,arXiv:1603.08371", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL", "authors": ["jiri vinarek", "petr hnetynka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08636"}
