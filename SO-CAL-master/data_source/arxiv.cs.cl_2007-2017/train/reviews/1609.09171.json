In this paper, a hybrid architecture is proposed and we present the first empirical study using LSTMs to compare performance of the three RNN structures on sentence classification task. Experimental results show that the Tail Model and Hybrid Model consistently get a better performance over Pooling Model, and Hybrid Model is comparable with Tail Model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 01:53:08 GMT  (170kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09171v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 15:16:57 GMT  (195kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09171v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lei shen", "junlin zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09171"}
