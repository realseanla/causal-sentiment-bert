Person names, birth information, career, friends, family and special achievements are some possible items in the record for an individual. The relationships between individuals, such as kinship and friendship, provide invaluable insights about hidden communities which are not directly recorded in databases. We show that some simple matrix and graph-based operations are effective for inferring relationships among individuals, and illustrate the main ideas with the China Biographical Database (CBDB).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 16:01:08 GMT  (409kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02968v1", "3 pages, 3 figures, 2017 Annual Meeting of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 3 figures, 2017 Annual Meeting of the Japanese Association for Digital Humanities", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.DB", "authors": ["chao-lin liu", "hongsu wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02968"}
