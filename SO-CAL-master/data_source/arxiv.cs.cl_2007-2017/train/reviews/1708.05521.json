We introduce a representation learning approach based on inner attention on top of an RNN. Results show that our model offers good capabilities and is able to successfully identify emotion-bearing words to predict intensity without leveraging on lexicons, obtaining the 13th place among 22 shared task competitors.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 06:59:16 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05521v1", "WASSA 2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity"]], "COMMENTS": "WASSA 2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["edison marrese-taylor", "yutaka matsuo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05521"}
