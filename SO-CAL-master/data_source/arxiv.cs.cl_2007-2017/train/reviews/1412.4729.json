The field appears to be advancing closer to this goal with recent breakthroughs in deep learning for natural language grounding in static images. In this paper, we propose to translate videos directly to sentences using a unified deep neural network with both convolutional and recurrent structure. Described video datasets are scarce, and most existing methods have been applied to toy domains with a small vocabulary of possible words. By transferring knowledge from 1.2M+ images with category labels and 100,000+ images with captions, our method is able to create sentence descriptions of open-domain videos with large vocabularies. We compare our approach with recent work using language generation metrics, subject, verb, and object prediction accuracy, and a human evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 19:21:50 GMT  (1859kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4729v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 00:58:38 GMT  (1859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4729v2", "Corrected minor typos"], ["v3", "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 04:22:06 GMT  (6586kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4729v3", "NAACL-HLT 2015 camera ready"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["subhashini venugopalan", "huijuan xu", "jeff donahue", "marcus rohrbach", "raymond j mooney", "kate saenko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.4729"}
