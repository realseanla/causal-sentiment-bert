{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-May-2017", "title": "Supervised Learning of Universal Sentence Representations from Natural Language Inference Data", "abstract": "Many modern NLP systems rely on word embeddings, previously trained in an unsupervised manner on large corpora, as base features. Efforts to obtain embeddings for larger chunks of text, such as sentences, have however not been so successful. Several attempts at learning unsupervised representations of sentences have not reached satisfactory enough performance to be widely adopted. In this paper, we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference dataset can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks. Much like how computer vision uses ImageNet to obtain features, which can then be transferred to other tasks, our work tends to indicate the suitability of natural language inference for transfer learning to other NLP tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 18:54:39 GMT  (542kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364v1", "11 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 9 May 2017 13:16:21 GMT  (542kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364v2", "11 pages, 8 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:15:01 GMT  (542kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364v3", "11 pages, 8 figures"], ["v4", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 09:50:36 GMT  (740kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364v4", "Accepted to EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexis conneau", "douwe kiela", "holger schwenk", "lo\u00efc barrault", "antoine bordes"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02364"}
