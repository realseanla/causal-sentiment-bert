Fingerspelled sequences are both challenging and important to recognize, as they are used for many content words such as proper nouns and technical terms. Previous work has shown that it is possible to achieve almost 90% accuracies on fingerspelling recognition in a signer-dependent setting. However, the more realistic signer-independent setting presents challenges due to significant variations among signers, coupled with the dearth of available training data. We investigate this problem with approaches inspired by automatic speech recognition. We start with the best-performing approaches from prior work, based on tandem models and segmental conditional random fields (SCRFs), with features based on deep neural network (DNN) classifiers of letters and phonological features. Using DNN adaptation, we find that it is possible to bridge a large part of the gap between signer-dependent and signer-independent performance. Using only about 115 transcribed words for adaptation from the target signer, we obtain letter accuracies of up to 82.7% with frame-level adaptation labels and 69.7% with only word labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 03:30:34 GMT  (148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04278v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["taehwan kim", "weiran wang", "hao tang", "karen livescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04278"}
