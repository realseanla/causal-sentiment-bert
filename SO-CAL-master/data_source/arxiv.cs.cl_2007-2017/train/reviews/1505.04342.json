Due to the increasing popularity of Twitter, its perceived potential for exerting social influence has led to the rise of a diverse community of automatons, commonly referred to as bots. These inorganic and semi-organic Twitter entities can range from the benevolent (e.g., weather-update bots, help-wanted-alert bots) to the malevolent (e.g., spamming messages, advertisements, or radical opinions). Existing detection algorithms typically leverage meta-data (time between tweets, number of followers, etc.) to identify robotic accounts. Here, we present a powerful classification scheme that exclusively uses the natural language text from organic users to provide a criterion for identifying accounts posting automated messages. Since the classifier operates on text alone, it is flexible and may be applied to any textual data beyond the Twitter-sphere.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 May 2015 01:22:00 GMT  (603kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04342v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 19 May 2015 13:32:43 GMT  (603kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04342v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 16:14:38 GMT  (603kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04342v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 23:02:05 GMT  (5696kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04342v4", null], ["v5", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 07:42:59 GMT  (8619kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04342v5", null], ["v6", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 13:44:56 GMT  (8619kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04342v6", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["eric m clark", "jake ryland williams", "chris a jones", "richard a galbraith", "christopher m danforth", "peter sheridan dodds"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04342"}
