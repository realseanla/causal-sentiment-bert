But understanding exactly which tasks this parse-based method is appropriate for remains an open question. In this paper we benchmark recursive neural models against sequential recurrent neural models, which are structured solely on word sequences. We investigate 5 tasks: sentiment classification on (1) sentences and (2) syntactic phrases; (3) question answering; (4) discourse parsing; (5) semantic relations (e.g., component-whole between nouns); We find that recurrent models have equal or superior performance to recursive models on all tasks except one: semantic relations between nominals. Our analysis suggests that tasks relying on the scope of negation (like sentiment) are well-handled by sequential models. Recursive models help only with tasks that require representing long-distance relations between words. Our results offer insights on the design of neural architectures for representation learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 21:39:31 GMT  (578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00185v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 18:16:50 GMT  (584kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00185v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 17:14:49 GMT  (585kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00185v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 22:07:45 GMT  (679kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00185v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 18 Aug 2015 05:59:18 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00185v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["jiwei li", "thang luong", "dan jurafsky", "eduard h hovy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.00185"}
