In this paper, we describe a recurrent neural network (RNN) model that jointly performs intent detection, slot filling, and language modeling. The neural network model keeps updating the intent estimation as word in the transcribed utterance arrives and uses it as contextual features in the joint model. Evaluation of the language model and online SLU model is made on the ATIS benchmarking data set. On language modeling task, our joint model achieves 11.8% relative reduction on perplexity comparing to the independent training language model. On SLU tasks, our joint model outperforms the independent task training model by 22.3% on intent detection error rate, with slight degradation on slot filling F1 score. The joint model also shows advantageous performance in the realistic ASR settings with noisy speech input.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 09:45:51 GMT  (181kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01462v1", "Accepted at SIGDIAL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at SIGDIAL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bing liu", "ian lane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01462"}
