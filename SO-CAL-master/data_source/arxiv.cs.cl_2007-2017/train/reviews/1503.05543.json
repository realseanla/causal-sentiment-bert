By developing a general framework for discussing a class of segmentation objectives, we study the effectiveness of greedy versus exact optimization approaches and suggest a new iterative refinement technique for improving the performance of greedy strategies. We compare our results to known benchmarks, using known metrics. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for an untrained method with our Content Vector Segmentation (CVS) on the Choi test set. Finally, we apply the segmentation procedure to an in-the-wild dataset consisting of text extracted from scholarly articles in the arXiv.org database.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 19:44:06 GMT  (913kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05543v1", "10 pages, 4 figures.
