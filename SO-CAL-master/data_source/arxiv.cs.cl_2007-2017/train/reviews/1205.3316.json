To this work, we have constructed a corpus of six hours of speech recordings with a number of nine speakers. we find in the robustness to noise a grounds for the choice of the HMM approach [2]. the results achieved are encouraging since our corpus is made by only nine speakers, but they are always reasons that open the door for other improvement works.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 May 2012 10:34:05 GMT  (342kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3316v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["naim terbeh", "mounir zrigui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.3316"}
