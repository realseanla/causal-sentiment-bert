While existing work trades off one aspect for another, this paper simultaneously makes progress on both fronts through a new task: answering complex questions on semi-structured tables using question-answer pairs as supervision. The central challenge arises from two compounding factors: the broader domain results in an open-ended set of relations, and the deeper compositionality results in a combinatorial explosion in the space of logical forms. We propose a logical-form driven parsing algorithm guided by strong typing constraints and show that it obtains significant improvements over natural baselines. For evaluation, we created a new dataset of 22,033 complex questions on Wikipedia tables, which is made publicly available.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Aug 2015 02:53:01 GMT  (271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00305v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["panupong pasupat", "percy liang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.00305"}
