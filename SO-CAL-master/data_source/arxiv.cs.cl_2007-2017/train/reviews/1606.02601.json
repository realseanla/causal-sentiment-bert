Our model splits individual words into segments, and weights each segment according to its ability to predict context words. Our morphological analysis is comparable to dedicated morphological analyzers at the task of morpheme boundary recovery, and also performs better than word-based embedding models at the task of syntactic analogy answering. Finally, we show that incorporating morphology explicitly into character-level models help them produce embeddings for unseen words which correlate better with human judgments.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 15:24:22 GMT  (386kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02601v1", "Submission for first Representation Learning for NLP workshop at ACL2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submission for first Representation Learning for NLP workshop at ACL2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kris cao", "marek rei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02601"}
