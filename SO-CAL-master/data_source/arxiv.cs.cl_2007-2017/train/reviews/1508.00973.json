{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Aug-2015", "title": "Progressive EM for Latent Tree Models and Hierarchical Topic Detection", "abstract": "Hierarchical latent tree analysis (HLTA) is recently proposed as a new method for topic detection. It differs fundamentally from the LDA-based methods in terms of topic definition, topic-document relationship, and learning method. It has been shown to discover significantly more coherent topics and better topic hierarchies. However, HLTA relies on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation and hence is not efficient enough to deal with large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method to drastically speed up HLTA using a technique inspired by recent advances in the moments method. Empirical experiments show that our method greatly improves the efficiency of HLTA. It is as efficient as the state-of-the-art LDA-based method for hierarchical topic detection and finds substantially better topics and topic hierarchies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Aug 2015 05:00:32 GMT  (565kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00973v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.IR stat.ML", "authors": ["peixian chen", "nevin l zhang", "leonard k m poon", "zhourong chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.00973"}
