We propose an alphabet as markers in the phonetic subspace, aiming for a resolution sufficient to support recognition of all spoken languages. The prosodic subspace is made up of directly measurable physical variables. With the proposed alphabet, traditional diphthongs naturally generalize to a broader class of language-neutral phonotactic constraints, indicating a correlation structure similar to that of the traditional sonority-based syllable. We define a stochastic structure on the phone strings based on this diphthongal constraint, and show how a specific spoken language can be defined as a specific set of probability distributions of this stochastic structure. Furthermore, phonological variations within a spoken language can be modeled as varying probability distributions restricted to the phonetic subspace, conditioned on different values in the prosodic subspace.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 17:48:01 GMT  (472kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2593v1", "6 pages, 10 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 10 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["elaine tsiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2593"}
