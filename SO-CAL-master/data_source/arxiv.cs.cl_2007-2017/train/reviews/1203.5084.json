Question answering (QA) systems often perform information retrieval at an initial stage. Information retrieval (IR) performance, provided by engines such as Lucene, places a bound on overall system performance. For example, no answer bearing documents are retrieved at low ranks for almost 40% of questions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 19:19:02 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5084v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["leon derczynski", "jun wang", "robert gaizauskas", "mark a greenwood"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.5084"}
