Identified concepts belonging to Arabic WordNet synsets are extracted from documents and queries, and those having a single sense are expanded. The expanded query is then used by the IRS to retrieve the relevant documents searched. Our experiments are based primarily on a medium size corpus of arabic text. The results obtained shown us that there are a global improvement in the performance of the arabic IRS.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 12:24:55 GMT  (285kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2499v1", "6 pages,2 figures,7 tables"], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 22:05:37 GMT  (285kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2499v2", "6 pages,2 figures,7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages,2 figures,7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["mohammed alaeddine abderrahim", "mohammed el amine abderrahim", "mohammed amine chikh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2499"}
