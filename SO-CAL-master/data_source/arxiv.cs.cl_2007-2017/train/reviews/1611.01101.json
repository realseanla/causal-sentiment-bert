Our classifier participated in the CogALex-V Shared Task, showing a solid performance on the first subtask, but a poor performance on the second subtask. The low scores reported on the second subtask suggest that distributional measures are not sufficient to discriminate between multiple semantic relations at once.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 17:41:47 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01101v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["emmanuele chersoni", "giulia rambelli", "enrico santus"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01101"}
