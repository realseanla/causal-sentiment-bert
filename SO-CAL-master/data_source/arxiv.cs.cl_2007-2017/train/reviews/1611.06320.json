That some words were used only in the Tang poetry and some only in the Song poetry could lead to interesting research in linguistics. That the most frequent colors are different in the Tang and Song poetry provides a trace of the changing social circumstances in the dynasties. Results of the current work link to research topics of lexicography, semantics, and social transitions. We discuss our findings and present our algorithms for efficient comparisons among the poems, which are crucial for completing billion times of comparisons within acceptable time.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 07:14:59 GMT  (549kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06320v1", "9 pages, 3 figures, Workshop on Language Technology Resources and Tools for Digital Humanities (LT4DH), 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)"], ["v2", "Sun, 29 Oct 2017 09:49:19 GMT  (617kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06320v2", "9 pages, 3 figures, Workshop on Language Technology Resources and Tools for Digital Humanities (LT4DH), 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 3 figures, Workshop on Language Technology Resources and Tools for Digital Humanities (LT4DH), 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics (COLING)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chao-lin liu", "kuo-feng luo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06320"}
