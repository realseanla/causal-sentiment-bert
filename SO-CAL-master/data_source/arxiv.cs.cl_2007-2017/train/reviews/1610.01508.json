{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Oct-2016", "title": "VoxML: A Visualization Modeling Language", "abstract": "We present the specification for a modeling language, VoxML, which encodes semantic knowledge of real-world objects represented as three-dimensional models, and of events and attributes related to and enacted over these objects. VoxML is intended to overcome the limitations of existing 3D visual markup languages by allowing for the encoding of a broad range of semantic knowledge that can be exploited by a variety of systems and platforms, leading to multimodal simulations of real-world scenarios using conceptual objects that represent their semantic values.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 16:27:48 GMT  (2904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01508v1", "8 pages, 9 figures, proceedings of LREC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 9 figures, proceedings of LREC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["james pustejovsky", "nikhil krishnaswamy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01508"}
