Currently, submitted messages to the dialogue systems are considered as isolated sentences. Thus, missing context information impede the disambiguation of homographs words in ambiguous sentences. Our approach solves this disambiguation problem by using concepts over existing ontologies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 10:50:31 GMT  (635kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01886v1", "17 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables in International journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables in International journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["diego moussallem", "ricardo choren"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.01886"}
