This paper aims at generating plausible natural language sentences, whose attributes are dynamically controlled by learning disentangled latent representations with designated semantics. We propose a new neural generative model which combines variational auto-encoders and holistic attribute discriminators for effective imposition of semantic structures. With differentiable approximation to discrete text samples, explicit constraints on independent attribute controls, and efficient collaborative learning of generator and discriminators, our model learns highly interpretable representations from even only word annotations, and produces realistic sentences with desired attributes. Quantitative evaluation validates the accuracy of sentence and attribute generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 21:23:47 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00955v1", "updated discussions and references"], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 21:15:43 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00955v2", "ICML 2017 camera-ready + more discussions"]], "COMMENTS": "updated discussions and references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL stat.ML", "authors": ["zhiting hu", "zichao yang", "xiaodan liang", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "eric p xing"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.00955"}
