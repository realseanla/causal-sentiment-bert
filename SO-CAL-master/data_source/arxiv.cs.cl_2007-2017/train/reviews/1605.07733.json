It presents a model of the speech data stream and how it works. The result of these studies and presented veins architectural model shows that research needs to be focused on acoustic-phonetic modeling in order to improve the quality of children's speech recognition and the sustainability of the systems to noise and changes in transmission environment. Another important aspect is the development of more accurate algorithms for modeling of spontaneous child speech.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 04:57:42 GMT  (403kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07733v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, in proc. of conference FMNS 2009, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, in proc. of conference FMNS 2009, Blagoevgrad, Bulgaria", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["radoslava kraleva", "velin kralev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07733"}
