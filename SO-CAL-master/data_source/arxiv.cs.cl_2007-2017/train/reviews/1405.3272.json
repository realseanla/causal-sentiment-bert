This can be orders of magnitude faster than ordinary PSI at the cost of some \"fuzziness\" in the matching, which may nonetheless be tolerable or even desirable. This is demonstrated in the case where the sets consist of English words processed with WordNet.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 May 2014 19:38:58 GMT  (117kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3272v1", "20 pages, 6 figures, plus source code"], ["v2", "Wed, 21 May 2014 02:51:41 GMT  (117kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3272v2", "20 pages, 6 figures, plus source code"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 6 figures, plus source code", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.CL", "authors": ["nicholas kersting"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3272"}
