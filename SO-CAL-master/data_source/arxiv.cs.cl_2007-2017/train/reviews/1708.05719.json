We present work on annotation projection and treebank translation that gave good results for all three target languages in the test set. In particular, Slovak seems to work well with information coming from the Czech treebank, which is in line with related work. The attachment scores for cross-lingual models even surpass the fully supervised models trained on the target language treebank. Croatian is the most difficult language in the test set and the improvements over the baseline are rather modest. Norwegian works best with information coming from Swedish whereas Danish contributes surprisingly little.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 18:00:05 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05719v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["j\\\"org tiedemann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05719"}
