In the human being, speech being a natural mode of communication has potential to being a fast and convenient mode of interaction with computer. Speech recognition will play an important role in taking technology to them. It is the need of this era to access the information within seconds. This paper describes the design and development of speaker independent and English command interpreted system for computers. HMM model is used to represent the phoneme like speech commands. Experiments have been done on real world data and system has been trained in normal condition for real world subject.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 May 2013 06:25:18 GMT  (73kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0625v1", "6 pages, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CL", "authors": ["kamlesh sharma", "dr t v prasad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.0625"}
