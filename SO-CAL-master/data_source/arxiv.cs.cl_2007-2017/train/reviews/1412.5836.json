To this end, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly optimizes a distributional objective on raw text and a relational objective on WordNet. Preliminary results on knowledge base completion, analogy tests, and parsing show that word representations trained on both objectives can give improvements in some cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 12:30:55 GMT  (171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5836v1", "Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR2015 (short version of the paper).
