Inspired by the findings from the Cmabrigde Uinervtisy effect, we propose a word recognition model based on a semi-character level recursive neural network (scRNN). In our experiments, we demonstrate that scRNN has significantly more robust performance in word spelling correction (i.e. word recognition) compared to existing spelling checkers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model is cognitively plausible by replicating a psycholinguistics experiment about human reading difficulty using our model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Aug 2016 13:28:46 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02214v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 07:56:39 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02214v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["keisuke sakaguchi", "kevin duh", "matt post", "benjamin van durme"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.02214"}
