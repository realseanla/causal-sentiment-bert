Sentiment analysis for such online platform can be used to predict political elections, evaluates economic indicators and so on. However, GIF sentiment analysis is quite challenging, not only because it hinges on spatio-temporal visual contentabstraction, but also for the relationship between such abstraction and final sentiment remains unknown.In this paper, we dedicated to find out such relationship.We proposed a SentiPairSequence basedspatiotemporal visual sentiment ontology, which forms the midlevel representations for GIFsentiment. The establishment process of SentiPair contains two steps. First, we construct the Synset Forest to define the semantic tree structure of visual sentiment label elements. Then, through theSynset Forest, we organically select and combine sentiment label elements to form a mid-level visual sentiment representation. Our experiments indicate that SentiPair outperforms other competing mid-level attributes. Using SentiPair, our analysis frameworkcan achieve satisfying prediction accuracy (72.6%). We also opened ourdataset (GSO-2015) to the research community. GSO-2015 contains more than 6,000 manually annotated GIFs out of more than 40,000 candidates. Each is labeled with both sentiment and SentiPair Sequence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 06:31:57 GMT  (4450kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00765v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["zheng cai", "donglin cao", "rongrong ji"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00765"}
