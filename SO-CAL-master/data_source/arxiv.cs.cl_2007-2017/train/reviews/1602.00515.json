The increase is so high that professionals from the various fields are no more able to cope with this amount of publications. Text mining tools can offer tools to help them and one of the tools that can aid information retrieval and information extraction is semantic text annotation. In this report we present Marvin, a text annotator written in Java, which can be used as a command line tool and as a Java library. Marvin is able to annotate text using multiple sources, including WordNet, MetaMap, DBPedia and thesauri represented as SKOS.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 13:27:34 GMT  (217kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00515v1", "9 pages, 4 figures, keywords: Semantic annotation, text normalization, semantic web, linked data, information management, text mining, information extraction, data curation"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 11:31:17 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00515v2", "9 pages, 4 figures, keywords: Semantic annotation, text normalization, semantic web, linked data, information management, text mining, information extraction, data curation"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures, keywords: Semantic annotation, text normalization, semantic web, linked data, information management, text mining, information extraction, data curation", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["nikola milosevic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00515"}
