The approach is primarily based on a combination of word embeddings and parserbased features, and employs unidirectional incremental computation of compositional embeddings for multiword expressions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 Apr 2016 14:07:34 GMT  (330kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04873v1", "7 pages, 1 figure, International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure, International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["andreas scherbakov", "ekaterina vylomova", "fei liu", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04873"}
