We developed several UBM and DNN i-Vector based speaker recognition systems with different data sets and feature representations. Given that the emphasis of the NIST SRE 2016 is on language mismatch between training and enrollment/test data, so-called domain mismatch, in our system development we focused on: (1) using unlabeled in-domain data for centralizing data to alleviate the domain mismatch problem, (2) finding the best data set for training LDA/PLDA, (3) using newly proposed dimension reduction technique incorporating unlabeled in-domain data before PLDA training, (4) unsupervised speaker clustering of unlabeled data and using them alone or with previous SREs for PLDA training, (5) score calibration using only unlabeled data and combination of unlabeled and development (Dev) data as separate experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 21:05:05 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07651v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chunlei zhang", "fahimeh bahmaninezhad", "shivesh ranjan", "chengzhu yu", "navid shokouhi", "john h l hansen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07651"}
