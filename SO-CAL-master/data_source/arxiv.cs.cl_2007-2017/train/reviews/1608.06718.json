In this respect, recent works have shown the key advantage of exploiting textual definitions in various Natural Language Processing applications. However, to date there are no reliable large-scale corpora of sense-annotated textual definitions available to the research community. In this paper we present a large-scale high-quality corpus of disambiguated glosses in multiple languages, comprising sense annotations of both concepts and named entities from a unified sense inventory. Our approach for the construction and disambiguation of the corpus builds upon the structure of a large multilingual semantic network and a state-of-the-art disambiguation system; first, we gather complementary information of equivalent definitions across different languages to provide context for disambiguation, and then we combine it with a semantic similarity-based refinement. As a result we obtain a multilingual corpus of textual definitions featuring over 38 million definitions in 263 languages, and we make it freely available at", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 05:30:45 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06718v1", "Accepted in LREC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in LREC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jos\\'e camacho collados", "claudio delli bovi", "alessandro raganato", "roberto navigli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06718"}
