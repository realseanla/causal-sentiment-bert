Nevertheless, high-quality parallel corpora are scarce resources for specific language pairs and domains. For a source-to-target language pair with a small parallel corpus, we introduce the pivot language to \"bridge\" source language and target language under the existence of large source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target parallel corpora. We propose three kinds of connection terms to jointly train source-to-pivot and pivot-to-target translation models in order to enhance the interaction between two sets of model parameters. Experiments on German-French and Spanish-French translation tasks with English as the pivot language show that our joint training approach improves the translation quality significantly than independent training on source-to-pivot, pivot-to-target and source-to-target directions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:44:54 GMT  (188kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04928v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 04:13:38 GMT  (264kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04928v2", "fix experiments and revise the paper"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yong cheng", "yang liu", "qian yang", "maosong sun", "wei xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04928"}
