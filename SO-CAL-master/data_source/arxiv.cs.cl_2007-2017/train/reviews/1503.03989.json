Morphology studies the word structure and formation of word of a language. In current scenario of NLP research, morphological analysis techniques have become more popular day by day. For processing any language, morphology of the word should be first analyzed. Assamese language contains very complex morphological structure. In our work we have used Apertium based Finite-State-Transducers for developing morphological analyzer for Assamese Language with some limited domain and we get 72.7% accuracy", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 09:03:21 GMT  (464kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03989v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mirzanur rahman", "shikhar kumar sarma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03989"}
