In this study we develop techniques for extracting parallel data for one particular dialect of Arabic (Iraqi Arabic) from out-of-domain corpora in different dialects of Arabic or in Modern Standard Arabic. We compare two different data selection strategies (cross-entropy based and submodular selection) and demonstrate that a very small but highly targeted amount of found data can improve the performance of a baseline machine translation system. We furthermore report on preliminary experiments on using automatically translated speech data as additional training data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Sep 2015 07:54:17 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01938v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["katrin kirchhoff", "bing zhao", "wen wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01938"}
