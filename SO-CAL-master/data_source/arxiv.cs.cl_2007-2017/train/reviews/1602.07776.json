We explain efficient inference procedures that allow application to both parsing and language modeling. Experiments show that they provide better parsing in English than any single previously published supervised generative model and better language modeling than state-of-the-art sequential RNNs in English and Chinese.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 02:42:58 GMT  (166kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07776v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 23:28:08 GMT  (170kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07776v2", "11 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 14:22:02 GMT  (222kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07776v3", "Proceedings of NAACL 2016 (contains corrigendum)"], ["v4", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 04:47:45 GMT  (395kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07776v4", "Proceedings of NAACL 2016 (contains corrigendum)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["chris dyer", "adhiguna kuncoro", "miguel ballesteros", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.07776"}
