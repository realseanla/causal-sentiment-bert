Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient is used as one of the prominent feature extraction techniques in ASR. Usually, the set of all 12 MFCC coefficients is used as the feature vector in the classification step. But the question is whether the same or improved classification accuracy can be achieved by using a subset of 12 MFCC as feature vector. In this paper, Fisher's ratio technique is used for selecting a subset of 12 MFCC coefficients that contribute more in discriminating a pattern. The selected coefficients are used in classification with Hidden Markov Model algorithm. The classification accuracies that we get by using 12 coefficients and by using the selected coefficients are compared.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 May 2015 04:50:27 GMT  (225kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03239v1", "in International Journal on Cybernetics &amp; Informatics (IJCI) Vol. 4, No. 2, April 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in International Journal on Cybernetics &amp; Informatics (IJCI) Vol. 4, No. 2, April 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sarika hegde", "k k achary", "surendra shetty"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03239"}
