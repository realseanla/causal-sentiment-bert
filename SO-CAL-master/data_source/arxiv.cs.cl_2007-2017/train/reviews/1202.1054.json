Our goal is to learn verb subcategorizations for Quechua, an under-resourced morphologically rich language, from an unannotated corpus. We compare results from applying this approach to an unannotated Arabic corpus with those achieved by processing the same text in treebank form. The original plan was to use only a morphological analyzer and an unannotated corpus, but experiments suggest that this approach by itself will not be effective for learning the combinatorial potential of Arabic verbs in general. The lower bound on resources for acquiring this information is somewhat higher, apparently requiring a a part-of-speech tagger and chunker for most languages, and a morphological disambiguater for Arabic.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2012 06:33:03 GMT  (21kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1054v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alex rudnick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.1054"}
