The empirical evaluation was done using fully implemented translation systems embedded into the MapReduce programming model. Two machine translation paradigms were studied: shallow transfer Rule Based Machine Translation and Statistical Machine Translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 14:27:03 GMT  (1402kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02944v1", "20 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DC", "authors": ["jernej vi\\v{c}i\\v{c}", "rej brodnik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02944"}
