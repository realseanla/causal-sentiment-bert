{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Apr-2017", "title": "Improving Semantic Composition with Offset Inference", "abstract": "Count-based distributional semantic models suffer from sparsity due to unobserved but plausible co-occurrences in any text collection. This problem is amplified for models like Anchored Packed Trees (APTs), that take the grammatical type of a co-occurrence into account. We therefore introduce a novel form of distributional inference that exploits the rich type structure in APTs and infers missing data by the same mechanism that is used for semantic composition.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 19:47:30 GMT  (2001kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06692v1", "to appear at ACL 2017 (short papers)"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear at ACL 2017 (short papers)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thomas kober", "julie weeds", "jeremy reffin", "david j weir"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06692"}
