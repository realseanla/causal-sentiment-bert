We test our models on existing benchmarks for emotion detection and show that employing only information that is derived completely automatically, thus without relying on any handcrafted lexicon as it's usually done, we can achieve competitive results. The results also show that there is large room for improvement, especially by gearing the collection of Facebook pages, with a view to the target domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 15:49:31 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02988v1", "Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Modeling of People's Opinions, Personality, and Emotions in Social Media (PEOPLES 2016), held in conjunction with COLING 2016, Osaka, Japan"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the Workshop on Computational Modeling of People's Opinions, Personality, and Emotions in Social Media (PEOPLES 2016), held in conjunction with COLING 2016, Osaka, Japan", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chris pool", "malvina nissim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02988"}
