Also we use inductive reasoning beside our approach to make it outperform. Then, we prepare a case study by applying our approach on sample data and illustrate the soundness of our proposed approach. Moreover in our point of view current LOD cloud is not a suitable base for our proposal in all informational domains. Therefore we figure out some directions based on prior works to enrich datasets of Linked Data by using web mining. The result of such enrichment can be reused for further relation extraction and ontology enrichment from unstructured free text documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Aug 2013 14:30:55 GMT  (786kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0701v1", "9 pages, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["meisam booshehri", "abbas malekpour", "peter luksch", "kamran zamanifar", "shahdad shariatmadari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0701"}
