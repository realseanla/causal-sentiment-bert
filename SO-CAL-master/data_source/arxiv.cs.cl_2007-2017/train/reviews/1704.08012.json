We present a neural language model that incorporates document context in the form of a topic model-like architecture, thus providing a succinct representation of the broader document context outside of the current sentence. Experiments over a range of datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms a pure sentence-based model in terms of language model perplexity, and leads to topics that are potentially more coherent than those produced by a standard LDA topic model. Our model also has the ability to generate related sentences for a topic, providing another way to interpret topics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 08:33:14 GMT  (237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08012v1", "11 pages, Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017) (to appear)"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 May 2017 07:05:44 GMT  (237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08012v2", "11 pages, Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017) (to appear)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017) (to appear)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jey han lau", "timothy baldwin", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08012"}
