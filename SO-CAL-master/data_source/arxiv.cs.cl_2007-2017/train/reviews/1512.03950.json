The tool that we have developed for the task is based on Trigram Hidden Markov Model that utilizes information like gazetteer list, POS tag and some other word level features to enhance the observation probabilities of the known tokens as well as unknown tokens. We submitted runs for English only. A statistical HMM (Hidden Markov Models) based model has been used to implement our system. The system has been trained and tested on the datasets released for FIRE 2015 task: Entity Extraction from Social Media Text - Indian Languages (ESM-IL). Our system is the best performer for English language and it obtains precision, recall and F-measures of 61.96, 39.46 and 48.21 respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Dec 2015 18:57:11 GMT  (315kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03950v1", "FIRE 2015 Task:Entity Extraction from Social Media Text - Indian Languages (ESM-IL) - See more at:this http URLarXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1405.7397"]], "COMMENTS": "FIRE 2015 Task:Entity Extraction from Social Media Text - Indian Languages (ESM-IL) - See more at:this http URLarXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1405.7397", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kamal sarkar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.03950"}
