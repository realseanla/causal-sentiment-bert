The employed technique is unsupervised latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). In addition, it is proposed, to use LDA in conjunction with recently developed method of unsupervised keyword extraction. Such an approach improves the interpretability of the automatically obtained topics and allows for better computational performance. The described analysis illustrates a potential of the method in detecting recurring themes and discovering temporal trends in lodged contract appeals. These results may be in future applied to improve information retrieval from repositories of legal texts or as auxiliary material for legal analyses carried out by human experts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 22:00:52 GMT  (96kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5212v1", "\"Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, JURIX 2014: The Twenty-Seventh Annual Conference\", series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Volume 271, edited by Rinke Hoekstra, IOSPress, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "\"Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, JURIX 2014: The Twenty-Seventh Annual Conference\", series Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications, Volume 271, edited by Rinke Hoekstra, IOSPress, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["micha{\\l} {\\l}opuszy\\'nski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5212"}
