In this paper, we address the issue of generating responses that are coherent to a pre-specified agent profile. We design a model consisting of three modules: a profile detector to decide whether a post should be responded using the profile and which key should be addressed, a bidirectional decoder to generate responses forward and backward starting from a selected profile value, and a position detector that predicts a word position from which decoding should start given a selected profile value. We show that general conversation data from social media can be used to generate profile-coherent responses. Manual and automatic evaluation shows that our model can deliver more coherent, natural, and diversified responses.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 08:13:21 GMT  (329kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02861v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 06:17:45 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02861v2", "an error on author information"], ["v3", "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 07:40:57 GMT  (330kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02861v3", "an error on author information"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["qiao qian", "minlie huang", "haizhou zhao", "jingfang xu", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02861"}
