{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Oct-2016", "title": "Nonsymbolic Text Representation", "abstract": "We introduce the first generic text representation model that is completely nonsymbolic, i.e., it does not require the availability of a segmentation or tokenization method that attempts to identify words or other symbolic units in text. This applies to training the parameters of the model on a training corpus as well as to applying it when computing the representation of a new text. We show that our model performs better than prior work on an information extraction and a text denoising task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 10:30:13 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00479v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 11:51:10 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00479v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 1 May 2017 14:30:00 GMT  (48kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00479v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hinrich schuetze", "heike adel", "ehsaneddin asgari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00479"}
