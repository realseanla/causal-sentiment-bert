Our joint Bayesian model consists of individual models for each language plus additional latent variables that capture alignments between roles across languages. Because it is a generative Bayesian model, we can do evaluations in a variety of scenarios just by varying the inference procedure, without changing the model, thereby comparing the scenarios directly. We compare using only monolingual data, using a parallel corpus, using a parallel corpus with annotations in the other language, and using small amounts of annotation in the target language. We find that the biggest impact of adding a parallel corpus to training is actually the increase in mono-lingual data, with the alignments to another language resulting in small improvements, even with labeled data for the other language.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:03:53 GMT  (413kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01514v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nikhil garg", "james henderson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01514"}
