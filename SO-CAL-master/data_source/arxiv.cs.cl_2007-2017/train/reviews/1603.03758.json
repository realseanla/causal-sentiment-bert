Domain-general coreference resolution algorithms perform poorly on biomedical documents, because the cues they rely on such as gender are largely absent in this domain, and because they do not encode domain-specific knowledge such as the number and type of participants required in chemical reactions. Moreover, it is difficult to directly encode this knowledge into most coreference resolution algorithms because they are not rule-based. Our rule-based architecture uses sequentially applied hand-designed \"sieves\", with the output of each sieve informing and constraining subsequent sieves. This architecture provides a 3.2% increase in throughput to our Reach event extraction system with precision parallel to that of the stricter system that relies solely on syntactic patterns for extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 20:48:49 GMT  (201kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03758v1", "This paper will appear in LREC 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 18:32:35 GMT  (201kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03758v2", "This paper appears in LREC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper will appear in LREC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dane bell", "gus hahn-powell", "marco a valenzuela-esc\\'arcega", "mihai surdeanu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03758"}
