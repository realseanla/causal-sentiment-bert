The results are presented online and chapters in the Hebrew Bible containing parallel passages can be inspected synoptically. Differences between parallel passages are highlighted. In a similar way the MT of Isaiah is presented synoptically with 1QIsaa. We also investigate how one can investigate the degree of similarity between parallel passages with the help of a case study of 2 Kings 19-25 and its parallels in Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 17:11:51 GMT  (259kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01541v1", "15 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["martijn naaijer", "dirk roorda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01541"}
