However, this potential has remained largely untapped due to slow progress primarily caused by strict data access policies for researchers. In this paper, we discuss the concern for privacy and the measures it entails. We also suggest sources of less sensitive data. Finally, we draw attention to biases that can compromise the validity of empirical research and lead to socially harmful applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 15:12:10 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10090v1", "First Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing (EACL'17)"]], "COMMENTS": "First Workshop on Ethics in Natural Language Processing (EACL'17)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["simon \\v{s}uster", "st\\'ephan tulkens", "walter daelemans"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10090"}
