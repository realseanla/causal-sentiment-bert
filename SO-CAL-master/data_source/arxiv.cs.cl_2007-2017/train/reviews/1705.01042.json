Our task is different from general and traditional entity linking because we are working in a limited domain, namely, people entities, and we are including pronouns as entities, whereas in the past, pronouns were never considered as entities in entity linking. We have built 2 models, both outperforms our baseline model significantly. The purpose of our project is to build a model that could be use to generate cleaner data for future entity linking tasks. Our contribution include a clean data set consisting of 50Wikipedia people pages, and 2 entity linking models, specifically tuned for this domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 16:06:03 GMT  (2037kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01042v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["weiqian yan", "kanchan khurad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01042"}
