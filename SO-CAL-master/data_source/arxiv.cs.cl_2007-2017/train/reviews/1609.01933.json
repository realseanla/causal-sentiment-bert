In this work, the goal is to predict the score of food reviews on a scale of 1 to 5 with two recurrent neural networks that are carefully tuned. As for baseline, we train a simple RNN for classification. Then we extend the baseline to GRU. In addition, we present two different methods to deal with highly skewed data, which is a common problem for reviews. Models are evaluated using accuracies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 10:59:58 GMT  (1036kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01933v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hua feng", "ruixi lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01933"}
