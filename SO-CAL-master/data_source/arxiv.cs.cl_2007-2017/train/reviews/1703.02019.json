But from the perspective of a computer, we need means to automatically deduce the stance of the tweeter, given just the tweet text. In this paper, we present our results of performing stance detection on twitter data using a supervised approach. We begin by extracting bag-of-words to perform classification using TIMBL, then try and optimize the features to improve stance detection accuracy, followed by extending the dataset with two sets of lexicons - arguing, and MPQA subjectivity; next we explore the MALT parser and construct features using its dependency triples, finally we perform analysis using Scikit-learn Random Forest implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 18:44:49 GMT  (543kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02019v1", "8 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gourav g shenoy", "erika h dsouza", "sandra k\\\"ubler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02019"}
