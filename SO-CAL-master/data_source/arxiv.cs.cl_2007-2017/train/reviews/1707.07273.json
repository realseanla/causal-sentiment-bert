While previous embeddings have shown limitations on prototypical hypernyms, HyperVec represents an unsupervised measure where embeddings are learned in a specific order and capture the hypernym$-$hyponym distributional hierarchy. Moreover, our model is able to generalize over unseen hypernymy pairs, when using only small sets of training data, and by mapping to other languages. Results on benchmark datasets show that HyperVec outperforms both state$-$of$-$the$-$art unsupervised measures and embedding models on hypernymy detection and directionality, and on predicting graded lexical entailment.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Jul 2017 09:55:48 GMT  (50kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07273v1", "11 pages, accepted as long paper at EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, accepted as long paper at EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kim anh nguyen", "maximilian k\\\"oper", "sabine schulte im walde", "ngoc thang vu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07273"}
