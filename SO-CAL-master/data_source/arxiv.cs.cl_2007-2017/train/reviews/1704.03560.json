ConceptNet is an open, multilingual knowledge graph that focuses on general knowledge that relates the meanings of words and phrases. Our submission to SemEval was an update of previous work that builds high-quality, multilingual word embeddings from a combination of ConceptNet and distributional semantics. Our system took first place in both subtasks. It ranked first in 4 out of 5 of the separate languages, and also ranked first in all 10 of the cross-lingual language pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 22:44:35 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03560v1", "5 pages, accepted to the SemEval workshop at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, accepted to the SemEval workshop at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["robert speer", "joanna lowry-duda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03560"}
