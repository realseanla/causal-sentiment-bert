Discretization of such inputs is done to capture saliences, represented as symbolic information, which often presents structure and recurrence. As these sequences are used to reason over complex scenarios, a more compact representation would aid exactness of technical cognitive reasoning capabilities, which are today constrained by computational complexity issues and fallback to representational heuristics or human intervention. Such problems need to be addressed to ensure timely and meaningful human-robot interaction. Our work is towards understanding the variability of learning informativeness when training on subsets of a given input dataset. This is in view of reducing the training size while retaining the majority of the symbolic learning potential. We prove the concept on human-written texts, and conjecture this work will reduce training data size of sequential instructions, while preserving semantic relations, when gathering information from large remote sources.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 15:21:00 GMT  (129kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04104v1", "The 8th International Workshop on Human-Friendly Robotics (HFR 2015), Munich, Germany"]], "COMMENTS": "The 8th International Workshop on Human-Friendly Robotics (HFR 2015), Munich, Germany", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.RO", "authors": ["simon kaltenbacher", "nicholas h kirk", "dongheui lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04104"}
