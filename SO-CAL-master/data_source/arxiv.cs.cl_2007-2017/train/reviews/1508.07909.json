Previous work addresses this problem through back-off dictionaries. In this paper, we introduce a simpler and more effective approach, enabling the translation of rare and unknown words by encoding them as sequences of subword units, based on the intuition that various word classes are translatable via smaller units than words, for instance names (via character copying or transliteration), compounds (via compositional translation), and cognates and loanwords (via phonological and morphological transformations). We discuss the suitability of different word segmentation techniques, including simple character n-gram models and a segmentation based on the byte pair encoding compression algorithm, and empirically show that subword models improve over a back-off dictionary baseline for the WMT 15 translation tasks English-German and English-Russian by 0.8 and 1.5 BLEU, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 16:37:31 GMT  (209kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 15:41:25 GMT  (122kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909v2", "new results with improved baseline; more references in related work; cuts to fit conference proceedings"], ["v3", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 14:56:06 GMT  (125kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 15:01:02 GMT  (125kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909v4", "accepted at ACL 2016"], ["v5", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 14:45:08 GMT  (197kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07909v5", "accepted at ACL 2016; new in this version: figure 3"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rico sennrich", "barry haddow", "alexandra birch"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.07909"}
