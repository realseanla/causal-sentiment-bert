A pair of source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector representations in a low-dimensional latent semantic space, where their translation score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new space. The projection is performed by a multi-layer neural network whose weights are learned on parallel training data. The learning is aimed to directly optimize the quality of end-to-end machine translation results. Experimental evaluation has been performed on two Europarl translation tasks, English-French and German-English. The results show that the new semantic-based phrase translation model significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation sys-tem, leading to a gain of 0.7-1.0 BLEU points.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 04:58:59 GMT  (521kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0482v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jianfeng gao", "xiaodong he", "wen-tau yih", "li deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.0482"}
