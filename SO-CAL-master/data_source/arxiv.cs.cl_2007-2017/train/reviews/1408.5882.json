We first show that a simple CNN with little hyperparameter tuning and static vectors achieves excellent results on multiple benchmarks. Learning task-specific vectors through fine-tuning offers further gains in performance. We additionally propose a simple modification to the architecture to allow for the use of both task-specific and static word vectors. The CNN models discussed herein improve upon the state-of-the-art on 4 out of 7 tasks, which include sentiment analysis and question classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Aug 2014 19:48:04 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882v1", "To appear in EMNLP 2014"], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Sep 2014 03:09:02 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882v2", "To appear in EMNLP 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in EMNLP 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["yoon kim"], "accepted": true, "id": "1408.5882"}
