{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Mar-2016", "title": "A Fast Unified Model for Parsing and Sentence Understanding", "abstract": "Tree-structured neural networks exploit valuable syntactic parse information as they interpret the meanings of sentences. However, they suffer from two key technical problems that make them slow and unwieldy for large-scale NLP tasks: they can only operate on parsed sentences and they do not directly support batched computation. We address these issues by introducing the Stack-augmented Parser-Interpreter Neural Network (SPINN), which combines parsing and interpretation within a single tree-sequence hybrid model by integrating tree-structured sentence interpretation into the linear sequential structure of a shift-reduce parser. Our model supports batched computation for a speedup of up to 25x over other tree-structured models, and its integrated parser allows it to operate on unparsed data with little loss of accuracy. We evaluate it on the Stanford NLI entailment task and show that it significantly outperforms other sentence-encoding models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 00:22:20 GMT  (203kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06021v1", "Manuscript under review"], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 23:19:08 GMT  (352kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06021v2", "To appear at ACL 2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 18:36:15 GMT  (349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06021v3", "To appear at ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Manuscript under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["samuel r bowman", "jon gauthier", "abhinav rastogi", "raghav gupta", "christopher d manning", "christopher potts"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06021"}
