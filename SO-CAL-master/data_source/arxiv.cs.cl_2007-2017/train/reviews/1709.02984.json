{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Sep-2017", "title": "Sentiment Polarity Detection for Software Development", "abstract": "The role of sentiment analysis is increasingly emerging to study software developers' emotions by mining crowd-generated content within social software engineering tools. However, off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports. Here, we present Senti4SD, a classifier specifically trained to support sentiment analysis in developers' communication channels. Senti4SD is trained and validated using a gold standard of Stack Overflow questions, answers, and comments manually annotated for sentiment polarity. It exploits a suite of both lexicon- and keyword-based features, as well as semantic features based on word embedding. With respect to a mainstream off-the-shelf tool, which we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative. To encourage replications, we release a lab package including the classifier, the word embedding space, and the gold standard with annotation guidelines.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 17:28:10 GMT  (2157kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02984v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 14:37:55 GMT  (2157kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02984v2", "Cite as: Calefato, F., Lanubile, F., Maiorano, F., Novielli N.
