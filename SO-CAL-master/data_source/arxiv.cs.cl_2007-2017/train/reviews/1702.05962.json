Experiments show that our model generates more diverse outputs than baseline models, and also generates more consistently acceptable output than sampling from a deterministic encoder-decoder model.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 13:36:23 GMT  (375kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05962v1", "Accepted at EACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at EACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kris cao", "stephen clark"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05962"}
