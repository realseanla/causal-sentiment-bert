Although the choice of context (which often takes the form of a sliding window) has a direct influence on the resulting embeddings, the exact role of this model component is still not fully understood. This paper presents a systematic analysis of context windows based on a set of four distinct hyper-parameters. We train continuous Skip-Gram models on two English-language corpora for various combinations of these hyper-parameters, and evaluate them on both lexical similarity and analogy tasks. Notable experimental results are the positive impact of cross-sentential contexts and the surprisingly good performance of right-context windows.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 15:41:34 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05781v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pierre lison", "rey kutuzov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05781"}
