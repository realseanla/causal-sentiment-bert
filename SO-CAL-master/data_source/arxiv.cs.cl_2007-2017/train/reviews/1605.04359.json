The models learned for tagging entities cannot be expected to perform well when deployed on the web. This is owing to the severe mismatch in the distributions of such entities on the web and in the relatively diminutive training data. In this report, we build up the case for maximum mean discrepancy for estimation of occurrence statistics of entities on the web, taking a review of named entity disambiguation techniques and related concepts along the way.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 May 2016 01:13:48 GMT  (288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04359v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aman madaan", "sunita sarawagi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04359"}
