However, facts about an agent can also be seen as a set of accomplished tasks by the agent. This paper proposes a new approach to KR: the notion of task logical KR based on Computability Logic. This notion allows the user to represent both accomplished tasks and accomplishable tasks by the agent. This notion allows us to build sophisticated KRs about many interesting agents, which have not been supported by previous logical languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Jun 2013 04:42:02 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2268v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1305.2004"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1305.2004", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["keehang kwon", "mi-young park"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2268"}
