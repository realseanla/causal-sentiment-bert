We explore the application of neural translation models to the APE problem and achieve good results by treating different models as components in a log-linear model, allowing for multiple inputs (the MT-output and the source) that are decoded to the same target language (post-edited translations). A simple string-matching penalty integrated within the log-linear model can be used to control for higher faithfulness with regard to the to-be-corrected machine translation input. Our submission outperforms the uncorrected baseline on the unseen test set by -3.2% TER and +5.5% BLEU.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 15:15:05 GMT  (25kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04800v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 13:15:50 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04800v2", "Submission to the WMT 2016 shared task on Automatic Post-Editing"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marcin junczys-dowmunt", "roman grundkiewicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04800"}
