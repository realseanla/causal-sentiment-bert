We observe that the evidence-conclusion discourse relations, also known as arguments, often appear in product reviews, and we hypothesise that some argument-based features, e.g. the percentage of argumentative sentences, the evidences-conclusions ratios, are good indicators of helpful reviews. To validate this hypothesis, we manually annotate arguments in 110 hotel reviews, and investigate the effectiveness of several combinations of argument-based features. Experiments suggest that, when being used together with the argument-based features, the state-of-the-art baseline features can enjoy a performance boost (in terms of F1) of 11.01\\% in average.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Jul 2017 10:51:30 GMT  (195kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07279v1", "6 pages, EMNLP2017"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, EMNLP2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["haijing liu", "yang gao", "pin lv", "mengxue li", "shiqiang geng", "minglan li", "hao wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07279"}
