We train several models, where each uses a different subset of these properties to compose its representations. By evaluating the models on semantic and morphological measures, we reveal some useful insights on the relationship between semantics and morphology.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 17:07:40 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01938v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["oded avraham", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01938"}
