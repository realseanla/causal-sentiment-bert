Each question can acquire the answer from a single fact of form (subject, predicate, object) in Freebase. This task, simple question answering (SimpleQA), can be addressed via a two-step pipeline: entity linking and fact selection. In fact selection, we match the subject entity in fact with the entity mention in question by a character-level convolutional neural network (char-CNN), and match the predicate in fact with the question by a word-level CNN (word-CNN). This work makes two main contributions. (i) A simple and effective entity linker over Freebase is proposed. Our entity linker outperforms the state-of-the-art entity linker of SimpleQA task. (ii) A novel attentive maxpooling is stacked over word-CNN, so that the predicate representation can be matched with the predicate-focused question representation more effectively. Experiments show that our system sets new state-of-the-art in this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 16:54:51 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03391v1", "10 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 14:32:13 GMT  (259kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03391v2", "Accepted as an oral long paper by COLING'2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenpeng yin", "mo yu", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou", "hinrich sch\\\"utze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03391"}
