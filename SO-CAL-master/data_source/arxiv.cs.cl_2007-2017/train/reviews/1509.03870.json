In this paper, we will introduce the USFD SLT system for IWSLT. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is achieved by two multi-pass deep neural network systems with adaptation and rescoring techniques. Machine translation (MT) is achieved by a phrase-based system. The USFD primary system incorporates state-of-the-art ASR and MT techniques and gives a BLEU score of 23.45 and 14.75 on the English-to-French and English-to-German speech-to-text translation task with the IWSLT 2014 data. The USFD contrastive systems explore the integration of ASR and MT by using a quality estimation system to rescore the ASR outputs, optimising towards better translation. This gives a further 0.54 and 0.26 BLEU improvement respectively on the IWSLT 2012 and 2014 evaluation data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 16:58:41 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03870v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["raymond w m ng", "mortaza doulaty", "rama doddipatla", "wilker aziz", "kashif shah", "oscar saz", "madina hasan", "ghada alharbi", "lucia specia", "thomas hain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03870"}
