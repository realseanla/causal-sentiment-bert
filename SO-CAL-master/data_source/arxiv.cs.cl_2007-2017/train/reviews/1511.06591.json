We show that micro-ontologies and multi-word units allow integration of the rich and polysemous multi-domain background knowledge into CNL thus providing interpretation for the content words. The proposed approach is demonstrated by extending the Attempto Controlled English (ACE) with polysemous and procedural constructs resulting in a more natural CNL named PAO covering narrative multi-domain texts.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 13:41:31 GMT  (484kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06591v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["normunds gruzitis", "guntis barzdins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06591"}
