Stemming is a common strategy to this end. Among many approaches for stemming, statistical stemming has shown to be effective in a few number of languages, particularly those highly inflected ones. Common statistical approaches heavily relies on string similarity in terms of prefix and suffix matching. In this paper we propose a method that is able to find any popular affix in any position of a word; specifically finding infixes is a required task in Persian, Arabic, and Malay particularly in irregular formations and is a future challenge in informal texts. The proposed method aims at finding a number of transformation rules for expanding a word with its inflectional/derivation formations. Our experimental results on CLEF 2008 and CLEF 2009 English-Persian CLIR tasks indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms all the baselines in terms of MAP.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 12:25:26 GMT  (1026kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07852v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 21:37:19 GMT  (1019kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07852v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["javid dadashkarimi", "hossein nasr esfahani", "heshaam faili", "azadeh shakery"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07852"}
