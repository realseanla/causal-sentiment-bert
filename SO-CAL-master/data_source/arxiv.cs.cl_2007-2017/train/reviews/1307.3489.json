An essential first step in understanding these sources is the ability to identify the part of speech in each sentence. Arabic is a morphologically rich language, wich presents a challenge for part of speech tagging. In this paper, our goal is to propose, improve and implement a part of speech tagger based on a genetic alorithm. The accuracy obtained with this method is comparable to that of other probabilistic approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 10:21:01 GMT  (227kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3489v1", "12 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["bilel ben ali", "fethi jarray"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3489"}
