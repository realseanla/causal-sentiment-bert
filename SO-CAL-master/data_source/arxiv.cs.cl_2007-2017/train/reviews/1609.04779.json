Style is characterized using a hybrid word and part-of-speech tag n-gram language model, while topic is represented using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Experiments with several Reddit forums show that style is a better indicator of community identity than topic, even for communities organized around specific topics. Further, there is a positive correlation between the community reception to a contribution and the style similarity to that community, but not so for topic similarity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 19:07:17 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04779v1", "EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["trang tran", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.04779"}
