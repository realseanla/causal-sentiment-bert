The latter is the main task, which can exploit the previous two for achieving better results. Our DNN is trained jointly on all the three cQA tasks and learns to encode questions and comments into a single vector representation shared across the multiple tasks. The results on the official challenge test set show that our approach produces higher accuracy and faster convergence rates than the individual neural networks. Additionally, our method, which does not use any manual feature engineering, approaches the state of the art established with methods that make heavy use of it.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 10:24:55 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03706v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniele bonadiman", "antonio uva", "alessandro moschitti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03706"}
