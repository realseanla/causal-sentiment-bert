The architecture defines ranks from discourse structure through utterances, phrasal structures, word structures to speech sounds. Each rank has its own specific kind of prosodic-phonetic interpretation and semantic-pragmatic interpretation. Common to models of all these subdomains are models based on regular languages, and processors with finite working memory.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Sep 2016 16:29:20 GMT  (1684kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05511v1", "41 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 14:07:26 GMT  (1554kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05511v2", "76 pages (double spaced), approx 42 standard print pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 13:14:19 GMT  (1536kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05511v3", "34 pages"], ["v4", "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 23:00:53 GMT  (1975kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05511v4", "45 pages, 10 figures.
