But when it comes to online business, this task becomes even more difficult. Online retailers try everything possible to gain the trust of the customer. One of the solutions is to provide an area for existing users to leave their comments. This service can effectively develop the trust of the customer however normally the customer comments about the product in their native language using Roman script. If there are hundreds of comments this makes difficulty even for the native customers to make a buying decision. This research proposes a system which extracts the comments posted in Roman Urdu, translate them, find their polarity and then gives us the rating of the product. This rating will help the native and non-native customers to make buying decision efficiently from the comments posted in Roman Urdu.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 08:04:32 GMT  (415kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01386v1", "8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, Computer Science &amp; Engineering: An International Journal (CSEIJ)"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables, Computer Science &amp; Engineering: An International Journal (CSEIJ)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["misbah daud", "rafiullah khan", "mohibullah", "aitazaz daud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.01386"}
