Both machine learning and knowledge-base approaches lie at the foundation of contemporary named entities extraction systems. However, the progress in deploying these approaches on web-scale has been been hampered by the computational cost of NLP over massive text corpora. We present SpeedRead (SR), a named entity recognition pipeline that runs at least 10 times faster than Stanford NLP pipeline. This pipeline consists of a high performance Penn Treebank- compliant tokenizer, close to state-of-art part-of-speech (POS) tagger and knowledge-based named entity recognizer.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Jan 2013 04:01:25 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2857v1", "Long paper at COLING 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "Long paper at COLING 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rami al-rfou'", "steven skiena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2857"}
