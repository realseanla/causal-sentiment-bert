It is a challenging task to develop a qualitative parser for morphological rich and agglutinative languages. Syntactic analysis is used to understand the grammatical structure of a natural language sentence. It outputs all the grammatical information of each word and its constituent. Also issues related to it help us to understand the language in a more detailed way. This literature survey is groundwork to understand the different parser development for Indian languages and various approaches that are used to develop such tools and techniques. This paper provides a survey of research papers from well known journals and conferences.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 07:04:18 GMT  (924kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07005v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["monika t makwana", "deepak c vegda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07005"}
