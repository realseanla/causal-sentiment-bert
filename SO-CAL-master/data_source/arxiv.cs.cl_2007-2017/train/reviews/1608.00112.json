We simply compute the distance between the machine attentions and the \"true\" alignments, and minimize this cost in the training procedure. Our experiments on large-scale Chinese-to-English task show that our model improves both translation and alignment qualities significantly over the large-vocabulary neural machine translation system, and even beats a state-of-the-art traditional syntax-based system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jul 2016 12:39:19 GMT  (2108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00112v1", "6 pages.
