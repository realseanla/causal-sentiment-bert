Averaging the embeddings of words in a sentence has proven to be a surprisingly successful and efficient way of obtaining sentence embeddings. However, word embeddings trained with the methods currently available are not optimized for the task of sentence representation, and, thus, likely to be suboptimal. Siamese CBOW handles this problem by training word embeddings directly for the purpose of being averaged. The underlying neural network learns word embeddings by predicting, from a sentence representation, its surrounding sentences. We show the robustness of the Siamese CBOW model by evaluating it on 20 datasets stemming from a wide variety of sources.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 04:47:43 GMT  (955kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04640v1", "Accepted as full paper at ACL 2016, Berlin. 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as full paper at ACL 2016, Berlin. 11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tom kenter", "alexey borisov", "maarten de rijke"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04640"}
