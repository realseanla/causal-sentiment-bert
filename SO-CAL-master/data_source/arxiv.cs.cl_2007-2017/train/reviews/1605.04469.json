Specifically, we consider scenarios in which annotators explicitly mark sentences (or snippets) that support their overall document categorization, i.e., they provide rationales. Our model uses such supervision via a hierarchical approach in which each document is represented by a linear combination of the vector representations of its constituent sentences. We propose a sentence-level convolutional model that estimates the probability that a given sentence is a rationale, and we then scale the contribution of each sentence to the aggregate document representation in proportion to these estimates. Experiments on five classification datasets that have document labels and associated rationales demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Moreover, our model naturally provides explanations for its predictions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 May 2016 21:30:57 GMT  (149kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04469v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 21 May 2016 01:05:59 GMT  (150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04469v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 16:35:57 GMT  (131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04469v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ye zhang", "iain james marshall", "byron c wallace"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.04469"}
