We propose a framework for parsing and language modeling which marries a generative model with a discriminative recognition model in an encoder-decoder setting. We provide interpretations of the framework based on expectation maximization and variational inference, and show that it enables parsing and language modeling within a single implementation. On the English Penn Treen-bank, our framework obtains competitive performance on constituency parsing while matching the state-of-the-art single-model language modeling score.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 17:02:45 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00415v1", "ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Aug 2017 13:39:14 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00415v2", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jianpeng cheng 0001", "adam lopez", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.00415"}
