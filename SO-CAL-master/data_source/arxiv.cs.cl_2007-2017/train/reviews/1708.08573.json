However, there has been limited research on methods for linking story structures to narrative descriptions of scenes and story events. In this paper we present an automatic method for converting from Scheherazade's story intention graph, a semantic representation, to the input required by the Personage NLG engine. Using 36 Aesop Fables distributed in DramaBank, a collection of story encodings, we train translation rules on one story and then test these rules by generating text for the remaining 35. The results are measured in terms of the string similarity metrics Levenshtein Distance and BLEU score. The results show that we can generate the 35 stories with correct content: the test set stories on average are close to the output of the Scheherazade realizer, which was customized to this semantic representation. We provide some examples of story variations generated by personage. In future work, we will experiment with measuring the quality of the same stories generated in different voices, and with techniques for making storytelling interactive.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 02:05:56 GMT  (1285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08573v1", "International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["elena rishes", "stephanie m lukin", "david k elson", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08573"}
