This paper proposes a SVM and template based approach to Tibetan person knowledge extraction. Through constructing the training corpus, we build the templates based the shallow parsing analysis of Tibetan syntactic, semantic features and verbs. Using the training corpus, we design a hierarchical SVM classifier to realize the entity knowledge extraction. Finally, experimental results prove the method has greater improvement in Tibetan person knowledge extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 08:56:58 GMT  (3175kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02843v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yuan sun", "zhen zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02843"}
