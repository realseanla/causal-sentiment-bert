Our systems are based on an attentional encoder-decoder, using BPE subword segmentation for open-vocabulary translation with a fixed vocabulary. We experimented with using automatic back-translations of the monolingual News corpus as additional training data, pervasive dropout, and target-bidirectional models. All reported methods give substantial improvements, and we see improvements of 4.3--11.2 BLEU over our baseline systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 10:06:28 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02891v1", "WMT16 shared task system description"], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 23:02:24 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02891v2", "WMT16 shared task system description - final version with human evaluation results"]], "COMMENTS": "WMT16 shared task system description", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rico sennrich", "barry haddow", "alexandra birch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02891"}
