The first step towards processing Sanskrit text involves the handling of Sanskrit compound words that are an integral part of Sanskrit texts. This firstly necessitates the processing of euphonic conjunctions or sandhis, which are points in words or between words, at which adjacent letters coalesce and transform. The ancient Sanskrit grammarian Panini's codification of the Sanskrit grammar is the accepted authority in the subject. His famed sutras or aphorisms, numbering approximately four thousand, tersely, precisely and comprehensively codify the rules of the grammar, including all the rules pertaining to sandhis. This work presents a fresh new approach to processing sandhis in terms of a computational schema. This new computational model is based on Panini's complex codification of the rules of grammar. The model has simple beginnings and is yet powerful, comprehensive and computationally lean.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2009 19:33:21 GMT  (288kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.0894v1", "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, IJCSI Volume 5, pp43-51, October 2009"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, IJCSI Volume 5, pp43-51, October 2009", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["n rama", "meenakshi lakshmanan"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.0894"}
