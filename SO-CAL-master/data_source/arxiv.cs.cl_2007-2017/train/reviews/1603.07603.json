This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on simple linear algebra between words. Since many different methods have been proposed for learning document representations, it is natural to ask whether there is also linear structure in these learned representations to allow similar reasoning at document level. To answer this question, we design a new document analogy task for testing the semantic regularities in document representations, and conduct empirical evaluations over several state-of-the-art document representation models. The results reveal that neural embedding based document representations work better on this analogy task than conventional methods, and we provide some preliminary explanations over these observations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:45:20 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07603v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["fei sun", "jiafeng guo", "yanyan lan", "jun xu", "xueqi cheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07603"}
