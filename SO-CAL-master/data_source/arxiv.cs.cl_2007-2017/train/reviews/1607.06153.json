We perform a systematic comparison of alternative compositional architectures and propose a framework for error detection based on bidirectional LSTMs. Experiments on the CoNLL-14 shared task dataset show the model is able to outperform other participants on detecting errors in learner writing. Finally, the model is integrated with a publicly deployed self-assessment system, leading to performance comparable to human annotators.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jul 2016 23:26:33 GMT  (111kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06153v1", "Proceedings of ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["marek rei", "helen yannakoudakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.06153"}
