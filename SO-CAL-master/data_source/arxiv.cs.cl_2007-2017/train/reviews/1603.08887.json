Our model selects textual units to include in the summary based on a rich set of sparse features whose weights are learned on a large corpus. We allow for the deletion of content within a sentence when that deletion is licensed by compression rules; in our framework, these are implemented as dependencies between subsentential units of text. Anaphoricity constraints then improve cross-sentence coherence by guaranteeing that, for each pronoun included in the summary, the pronoun's antecedent is included as well or the pronoun is rewritten as a full mention. When trained end-to-end, our final system outperforms prior work on both ROUGE as well as on human judgments of linguistic quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 18:58:42 GMT  (839kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08887v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 05:39:10 GMT  (859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08887v2", "ACL 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["greg durrett", "taylor berg-kirkpatrick", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.08887"}
