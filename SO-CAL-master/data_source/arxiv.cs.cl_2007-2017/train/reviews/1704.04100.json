However, discourse segmenters only exist for a few languages and domains. Typically they only detect intra-sentential segment boundaries, assuming gold standard sentence and token segmentation, and relying on high-quality syntactic parses and rich heuristics that are not generally available across languages and domains. In this paper, we propose statistical discourse segmenters for five languages and three domains that do not rely on gold pre-annotations. We also consider the problem of learning discourse segmenters when no labeled data is available for a language. Our fully supervised system obtains 89.5% F1 for English newswire, with slight drops in performance on other domains, and we report supervised and unsupervised (cross-lingual) results for five languages in total.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 12:54:30 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04100v1", "To appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:03:10 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04100v2", "To appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chlo\u00e9 braud", "oph\u00e9lie lacroix", "anders s\u00f8gaard"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.04100"}
