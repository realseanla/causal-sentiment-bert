There is a great demand for argumentation corpora for customer reviews. However, due to the controversial nature of the argumentation annotation task, there exist very few large-scale argumentation corpora for customer reviews. In this work, we novelly use the crowdsourcing technique to collect argumentation annotations in Chinese hotel reviews. As the first Chinese argumentation dataset, our corpus includes 4814 argument component annotations and 411 argument relation annotations, and its annotations qualities are comparable to some widely used argumentation corpora in other languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 03:43:35 GMT  (285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02077v1", "6 pages,3 figures,This article has been submitted to \"The 2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC2017)\""]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages,3 figures,This article has been submitted to \"The 2017 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC2017)\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mengxue li", "shiqiang geng", "yang gao", "haijing liu", "hao wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02077"}
