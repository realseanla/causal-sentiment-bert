Recent work on bilingual lexicon induction suggests that it is possible to learn cross-lingual representations of words based on similarities between images associated with these words. However, that work focused on the translation of selected nouns only. In our work, we investigate whether the meaning of other parts-of-speech, in particular adjectives and verbs, can be learned in the same way. We also experiment with combining the representations learned from visual data with embeddings learned from textual data. Our experiments across five language pairs indicate that previous work does not scale to the problem of learning cross-lingual representations beyond simple nouns.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 13:28:40 GMT  (8723kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05914v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mareike hartmann", "anders soegaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05914"}
