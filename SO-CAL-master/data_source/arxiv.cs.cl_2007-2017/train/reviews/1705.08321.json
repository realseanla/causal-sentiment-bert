At the same time, specifics of the domain's terminology complicates the task of relevant publications retrieval. In the current research, we investigate influence of terms' variability and ambiguity on a paper's likelihood of being retrieved. We obtained statistics that demonstrate significance of the issue and its challenges, followed by presenting the sci.AI platform, which allows precise terms labeling as a resolution.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 17:04:42 GMT  (743kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08321v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["roman gurinovich", "alexander pashuk", "yuriy petrovskiy", "alex dmitrievskij", "oleg kuryan", "alexei scerbacov", "antonia tiggre", "elena moroz", "yuri nikolsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08321"}
