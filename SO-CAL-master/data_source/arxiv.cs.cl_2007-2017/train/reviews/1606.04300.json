In this paper, we propose a novel neural framework which thoroughly eliminates context windows and can utilize complete segmentation history. Our model employs a gated combination neural network over characters to produce distributed representations of word candidates, which are then given to a long short-term memory (LSTM) language scoring model. Experiments on the benchmark datasets show that without the help of feature engineering as most existing approaches, our models achieve competitive or better performances with previous state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 10:52:21 GMT  (703kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04300v1", "ACL2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 08:06:10 GMT  (897kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04300v2", "ACL2016"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["deng cai", "hai zhao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04300"}
