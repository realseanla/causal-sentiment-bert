Therefore, we call it a hybrid tracker. The machine learning in our tracker is realized by a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. To our knowledge, our hybrid tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result for the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset when the system uses only live SLU as its input.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:44:01 GMT  (109kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03710v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 08:38:14 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03710v2", "Accepted to Machine Learning for SLU &amp; Interaction NIPS 2015 Workshop.
