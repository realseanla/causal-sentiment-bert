Distant supervision is one such technique which tries to automatically generate training examples based on an existing KB such as Freebase. This paper is a survey of some of the techniques in distant supervision which primarily rely on Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 13:19:38 GMT  (233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03751v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["gagan madan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03751"}
