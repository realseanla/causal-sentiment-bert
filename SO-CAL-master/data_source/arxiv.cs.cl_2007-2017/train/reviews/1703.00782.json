A popular approach for dependency parsing is structured perceptron. Still, graph-based dependency parsing has the time complexity of $O(n^3)$, and it suffers from slow training. To deal with this problem, we propose a parallel algorithm called parallel perceptron. The parallel algorithm can make full use of a multi-core computer which saves a lot of training time. Based on experiments we observe that dependency parsing with parallel perceptron can achieve 8-fold faster training speed than traditional structured perceptron methods when using 10 threads, and with no loss at all in accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 13:49:23 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00782v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xu sun", "shuming ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00782"}
