Posters provide a coherent and efficient way to convey core ideas from scientific papers. Generating a good scientific poster, however, is a complex and time consuming cognitive task, since such posters need to be readable, informative, and visually aesthetic. In this paper, for the first time, we study the challenging problem of learning to generate posters from scientific papers. To this end, a data-driven framework, that utilizes graphical models, is proposed. Specifically, given content to display, the key elements of a good poster, including panel layout and attributes of each panel, are learned and inferred from data. Then, given inferred layout and attributes, composition of graphical elements within each panel is synthesized. To learn and validate our model, we collect and make public a Poster-Paper dataset, which consists of scientific papers and corresponding posters with exhaustively labelled panels and attributes. Qualitative and quantitative results indicate the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 11:18:04 GMT  (2323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01219v1", "in Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'16), Phoenix, AZ, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "in Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'16), Phoenix, AZ, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC cs.MM stat.ML", "authors": ["yuting qiang", "yanwei fu", "yanwen guo", "zhi-hua zhou", "leonid sigal"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.01219"}
