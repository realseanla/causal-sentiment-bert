In this work, we extend a previous work founded on the study of topological features of mesoscopic networks. Here, the geometrical properties of visualized networks are quantified in terms of several image analysis techniques and used as subsidies for authorship attribution. It was found that the visual features account for performance similar to that achieved by using topological measurements. In addition, the combination of these two types of features improved the performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 03:12:22 GMT  (4002kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07265v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["henrique f de arruda", "vanessa q marinho", "thales s lima", "diego r amancio", "luciano da f costa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07265"}
