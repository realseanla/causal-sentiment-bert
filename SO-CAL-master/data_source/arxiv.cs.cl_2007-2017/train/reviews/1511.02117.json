SKYSET utilizes a quintuple set of standardized categories, which differs from traditional approaches that typically use triples. The SKYSET System defines the categories required to form a standard template for representing information that is portable across different domains. It provides a standardized framework that enables sentences from written instructions to be translated into sets of category typed entities on a table or database. The SKYSET entities contain conceptual units or phrases that represent information from the original source documentation. SKYSET enables information concatenation where multiple documents from different domains can be translated and combined into a single common filterable and searchable table of entities.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 15:36:54 GMT  (752kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02117v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kerry fultz", "seth filip"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02117"}
