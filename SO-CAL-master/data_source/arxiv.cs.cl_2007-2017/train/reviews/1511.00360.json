However, automatic prosody prediction from text for Chinese speech synthesis is still a great challenge and the traditional conditional random fields (CRF) based method always heavily relies on feature engineering. In this paper, we propose to use neural networks to predict prosodic boundary labels directly from Chinese characters without any feature engineering. Experimental results show that stacking feed-forward and bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) recurrent network layers achieves superior performance over the CRF-based method. The embedding features learned from raw text further enhance the performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 02:34:12 GMT  (657kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00360v1", "5 pages, 4 figures, ASRU 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 4 figures, ASRU 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["chuang ding", "lei xie", "jie yan", "weini zhang", "yang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00360"}
