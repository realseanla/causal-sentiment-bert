One of the motivations of our study is to make a three way performance comparison, such as, a) SMT and RBMT b) English to Malayalam SMT and Malayalam to English SMT c) English to Malayalam RBMT and Malayalam to English RBMT. We describe the development of English to Malayalam and Malayalam to English baseline phrase based SMT system and the evaluation of its performance compared against the RBMT system. Based on our study the observations are: a) SMT systems outperform RBMT systems, b) In the case of SMT, English - Malayalam systems perform better than that of Malayalam - English systems, c) In the case RBMT, Malayalam to English systems are performing better than English to Malayalam systems. Based on our evaluations and detailed error analysis, we describe the requirements of incorporating morphological processing into the SMT to improve the accuracy of translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 10:09:46 GMT  (841kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08217v1", "This paper contains 10 pages with 4 figures and 10 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper contains 10 pages with 4 figures and 10 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sreelekha s", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08217"}
