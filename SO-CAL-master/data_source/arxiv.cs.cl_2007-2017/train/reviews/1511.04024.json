Such a representational mapping can be found in a wide spectrum of real-world applications including image/video retrieval, object recognition, action/behavior recognition, and event understand and prediction. To that end, we introduce a simplified training objective for learning multimodal embeddings using the skip-gram architecture by introducing convolutional 'pseudowords:' embeddings composed of the additive combination of distributed word representations and image features from convolutional neural networks projected into the multimodal space. We present some preliminary results of the representational properties of these embeddings on various word similarity benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 19:32:08 GMT  (125kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04024v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 29 Nov 2015 19:09:38 GMT  (203kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04024v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["zachary seymour", "yingming li", "zhongfei zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04024"}
