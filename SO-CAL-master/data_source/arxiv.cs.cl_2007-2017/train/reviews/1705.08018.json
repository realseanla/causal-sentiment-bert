In spite of these advances, building a real-time speech recogniser faces several problems such as low recognition accuracy, domain constraint, and out-of-vocabulary words. The low recognition accuracy problem is addressed by improving the acoustic model, language model, decoder and by rescoring the N-best list at the output of the decoder. We are considering the N-best list rescoring approach to improve the recognition accuracy. Most of the methods in the literature use the grammatical, lexical, syntactic and semantic connection between the words in a recognised sentence as a feature to rescore. In this paper, we have tried to see the semantic relatedness between the words in a sentence to rescore the N-best list. Semantic relatedness is computed using TransE~\\cite{bordes2013translating}, a method for low dimensional embedding of a triple in a knowledge graph. The novelty of the paper is the application of semantic web to automatic speech recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 21:53:05 GMT  (724kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08018v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ashwini jaya kumar", "camilo morales", "maria-esther vidal", "christoph schmidt", "s\\\"oren auer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08018"}
