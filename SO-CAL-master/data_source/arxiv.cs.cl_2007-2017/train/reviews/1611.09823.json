Most research has focused on learning from fixed training sets of labeled data rather than interacting with a dialogue partner in an online fashion. In this paper we explore this direction in a reinforcement learning setting where the bot improves its question-answering ability from feedback a teacher gives following its generated responses. We build a simulator that tests various aspects of such learning in a synthetic environment, and introduce models that work in this regime. Finally, real experiments with Mechanical Turk validate the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 20:16:44 GMT  (360kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09823v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Dec 2016 00:22:53 GMT  (347kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09823v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:12:38 GMT  (349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09823v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["jiwei li", "alexander h miller", "sumit chopra", "marc'aurelio ranzato", "jason weston"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.09823"}
