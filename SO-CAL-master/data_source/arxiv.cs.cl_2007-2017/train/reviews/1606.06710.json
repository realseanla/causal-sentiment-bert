We show that QVEC-CCA scores are an effective proxy for a range of extrinsic semantic and syntactic tasks. We also show that the proposed evaluation obtains higher and more consistent correlations with downstream tasks, compared to existing approaches to intrinsic evaluation of word vectors that are based on word similarity.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 19:12:01 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06710v1", "RepEval 2016, 5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "RepEval 2016, 5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yulia tsvetkov", "manaal faruqui", "chris dyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06710"}
