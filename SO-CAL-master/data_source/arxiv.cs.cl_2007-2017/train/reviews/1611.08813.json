Supervised corpora for the preposition-sense disambiguation task are small, suggesting a semi-supervised approach to the task. We show that signals from unannotated multilingual data can be used to improve supervised preposition-sense disambiguation. Our approach pre-trains an LSTM encoder for predicting the translation of a preposition, and then incorporates the pre-trained encoder as a component in a supervised classification system, and fine-tunes it for the task. The multilingual signals consistently improve results on two preposition-sense datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 09:53:36 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08813v1", "12 pages; COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages; COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hila gonen", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08813"}
