In this paper, we generalize Key-Value Memory Networks to a multimodal setting, introducing a novel key-addressing mechanism to deal with sequence-to-sequence models. The advantages of the framework are demonstrated on the task of video captioning, i.e generating natural language descriptions for videos. Conditioning on the previous time-step attention distributions for the key-value memory slots, we introduce a temporal structure in the memory addressing schema. The proposed model naturally decomposes the problem of video captioning into vision and language segments, dealing with them as key-value pairs. More specifically, we learn a semantic embedding (v) corresponding to each frame (k) in the video, thereby creating (k, v) memory slots. This allows us to exploit the temporal dependencies at multiple hierarchies (in the recurrent key-addressing; and in the language decoder). Exploiting this flexibility of the framework, we additionally capture spatial dependencies while mapping from the visual to semantic embedding. Extensive experiments on the Youtube2Text dataset demonstrate usefulness of recurrent key-addressing, while achieving competitive scores on BLEU@4, METEOR metrics against state-of-the-art models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 10:07:54 GMT  (1454kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06492v1", "Under review at CVPR 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 14:01:20 GMT  (1455kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06492v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "Under review at CVPR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["arnav kumar jain", "abhinav agarwalla", "kumar krishna agrawal", "pabitra mitra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06492"}
