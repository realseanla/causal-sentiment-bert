We experiment with predicting a wide range of 62 demographic attributes for neighbourhoods of London. We use the text from QA platform of Yahoo! Answers and compare our results to the ones obtained from Twitter microblogs. Outcomes show that the correlation between the predicted demographic attributes using text from Yahoo! Answers discussions and the observed demographic attributes can reach an average Pearson correlation coefficient of \\r{ho} = 0.54, slightly higher than the predictions obtained using Twitter data. Our qualitative analysis indicates that there is semantic relatedness between the highest correlated terms extracted from both datasets and their relative demographic attributes. Furthermore, the correlations highlight the different natures of the information contained in Yahoo! Answers and Twitter. While the former seems to offer a more encyclopedic content, the latter provides information related to the current sociocultural aspects or phenomena.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 12:53:19 GMT  (2610kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04653v1", "Submitted to ICWSM2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICWSM2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["marzieh saeidi", "alessandro venerandi", "licia capra", "sebastian riedel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04653"}
