The set-up is similar to the well-known analogies task, but expanded with a time dimension. To this end, we apply incremental updating of the models with new training texts, including incremental vocabulary expansion, coupled with learned transformation matrices that let us map between members of the relation. The proposed approach is evaluated on the task of predicting insurgent armed groups based on geographical locations. The gold standard data for the time span 1994--2010 is extracted from the UCDP Armed Conflicts dataset. The results show that the method is feasible and outperforms the baselines, but also that important work still remains to be done.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 23:02:11 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08660v1", "to appear in EMNLP 2017 proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear in EMNLP 2017 proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["andrey kutuzov", "erik velldal", "lilja \u00f8vrelid"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.08660"}
