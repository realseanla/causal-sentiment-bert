We compare our method to baseline weighting schemes and find that it outperforms them on multiple benchmarks. The method is robust and works well on both snippets and longer documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 14:50:59 GMT  (12kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3518v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 17:18:54 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3518v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["yoon kim", "owen zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3518"}
