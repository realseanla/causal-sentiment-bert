Text normalization is a set of methods with a task to write non-standard words, like numbers, dates, times, abbreviations, acronyms and the most common symbols, in their full expanded form are presented. The whole taxonomy for classification of non-standard words in Croatian language together with rule-based normalization methods combined with a lookup dictionary are proposed. Achieved token rate for normalization of Croatian texts is 95%, where 80% of expanded words are in correct morphological form.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 17:57:00 GMT  (78kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08167v1", "8 pages in Text, Speech and Dialogue extension to Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence LNAI6836.
