Traditionally, word embeddings are learned on a general corpus, like Wikipedia. In this work we try to personalize the word embeddings learning, by achieving the learning on the user's profile. The word embeddings are then in the same context than the user interests. Our proposal is evaluated on the CLEF Social Book Search 2016 collection. The results obtained show that some efforts should be made in the way to apply Word Embedding in the context of Personalized Information Retrieval.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:53:29 GMT  (406kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06991v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["nawal ould-amer", "philippe mulhem", "mathias gery"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06991"}
