In experiments with a task of predicting popularity of comments in Reddit discussions, the proposed model outperforms a node-independent architecture for different sets of input features. Analyses show a benefit to the model over the full course of the discussion, improving detection in both early and late stages. Further, the use of language cues with the bidirectional tree state updates helps with identifying controversial comments.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 03:27:54 GMT  (2174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02080v1", "Submitted to TACL"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to TACL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vicky zayats", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02080"}
