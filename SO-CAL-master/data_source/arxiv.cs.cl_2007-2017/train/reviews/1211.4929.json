Our method consists of two major steps. First, we identify five frequently occurring variable-length syntactic patterns and use them to extract candidate segments. Then we use the output of a joint generative sentiment topic model to filter out the non-informative segments. We verify the proposed method with quantitative and qualitative experiments. In a quantitative study, our approach outperforms previous methods in producing informative segments and summaries that capture aspects of products and services as expressed in the user-generated pros and cons lists. Our user study with ninety users resonates with this result: individual segments extracted and filtered by our method are rated as more useful by users compared to previous approaches by users.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Nov 2012 03:59:06 GMT  (266kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4929v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["trung v nguyen", "alice h oh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.4929"}
