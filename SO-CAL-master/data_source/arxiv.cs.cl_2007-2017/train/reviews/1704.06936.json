Our model achieves the state-of-the-art results on English and Japanese CCG parsing.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 15:16:53 GMT  (833kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06936v1", "long paper (11 pages) accepted to ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "long paper (11 pages) accepted to ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["masashi yoshikawa", "hiroshi noji", "yuji matsumoto"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06936"}
