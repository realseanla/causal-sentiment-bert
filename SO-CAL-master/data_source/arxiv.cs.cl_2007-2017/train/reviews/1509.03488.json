Our extensive evaluation of the semantic classification is based on a linking to three other lexical resources at the word sense level: to the German wordnet GermaNet and to the English resources VerbNet and FrameNet. This way, we are able to perform a reproducible semantic characterization of the inferred German classes. We also perform a corpus-based evaluation revealing that the frequencies of the classes in corpora of different genres are significantly different. We will make the resulting bilingual resource of German-English semantically categorized verb classes publicly available.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 13:05:15 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03488v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 10:37:48 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03488v2", "Proceedings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["judith eckle-kohler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.03488"}
