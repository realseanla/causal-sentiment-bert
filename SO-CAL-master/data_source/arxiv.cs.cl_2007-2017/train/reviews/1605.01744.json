Stopping short of the extensive and expensive process of accumulating a large enough dataset to completely retrain parsers for patent claims, a method of adapting existing natural language processing software towards patent claims via forced part of speech tag correction is proposed. An Amazon Mechanical Turk collection campaign organized to generate a public corpus to train such an improved claim parsing system is discussed, identifying lessons learned during the campaign that can be of use in future NLP dataset collection campaigns with AMT. Experiments utilizing this corpus and other patent claim sets measure the parsing performance improvement garnered via the claim parsing system. Finally, the utility of the improved claim parsing system within other patent processing applications is demonstrated via experiments showing improved automated patent subject classification when the new claim parsing system is utilized to generate the features.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 May 2016 20:11:57 GMT  (1291kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01744v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mengke hu", "david cinciruk", "john maclaren walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01744"}
