However, some facts are never fully mentioned, and no IE method has perfect recall. Thus, it is beneficial to also tap contents about the cardinalities of these relations, for example, how many awards someone has won. We introduce this novel problem of extracting cardinalities and discusses the specific challenges that set it apart from standard IE. We present a distant supervision method using conditional random fields. A preliminary evaluation results in precision between 3% and 55%, depending on the difficulty of relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:28:06 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04455v1", "5 pages, ACL 2017 (short paper)"], ["v2", "Sat, 27 May 2017 00:55:36 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04455v2", "5 pages, ACL 2017 (short paper)"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, ACL 2017 (short paper)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["paramita mirza", "simon razniewski", "fariz darari", "gerhard weikum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.04455"}
