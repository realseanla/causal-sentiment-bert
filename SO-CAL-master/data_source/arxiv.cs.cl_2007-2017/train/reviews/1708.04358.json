Evaluated over Twitter data, the proposed model outperforms conventional regression-based geolocation and provides a better estimate of uncertainty. We also show the effectiveness of the representation for predicting words from location in lexical dialectology, and evaluate it using the DARE dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 23:52:02 GMT  (3072kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04358v1", "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2017) September 2017, Copenhagen, Denmark"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2017) September 2017, Copenhagen, Denmark", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["afshin rahimi", "timothy baldwin", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.04358"}
