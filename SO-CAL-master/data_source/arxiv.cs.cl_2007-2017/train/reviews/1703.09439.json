The model, which is trained in a weakly supervised fashion, measures the similarity between customer questions and agent answers using a dual encoder network, a Siamese-like neural network architecture. Answer templates are extracted from embeddings derived from past agent answers, without turn-by-turn annotations. Responses to customer inquiries are generated by selecting the best template from the final set of templates. We show that, in a closed domain like customer service, the selected templates cover $&gt;$70\\% of past customer inquiries. Furthermore, the relevance of the model-selected templates is significantly higher than templates selected by a standard tf-idf baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 07:47:27 GMT  (142kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09439v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["yichao lu", "phillip keung", "shaonan zhang", "jason sun", "vikas bhardwaj"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09439"}
