Transliteration basically aims to preserve the phonological structure of words. Proper transliteration of name entities plays a very significant role in improving the quality of machine translation. In this paper we are doing machine transliteration for English-Punjabi language pair using rule based approach. We have constructed some rules for syllabification. Syllabification is the process to extract or separate the syllable from the words. In this we are calculating the probabilities for name entities (Proper names and location). For those words which do not come under the category of name entities, separate probabilities are being calculated by using relative frequency through a statistical machine translation toolkit known as MOSES. Using these probabilities we are transliterating our input text from English to Punjabi.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 15:54:43 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4300v1", "International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 2, No.2, April 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 2, No.2, April 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["deepti bhalla", "nisheeth joshi", "iti mathur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.4300"}
