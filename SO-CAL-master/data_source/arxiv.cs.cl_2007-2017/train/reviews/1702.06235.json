We train a recurrent neural network sequence-to-sequence model with attention to select facts and generate textual summaries. Our model incorporates a novel secondary objective that helps ensure it generates sentences that contain the input facts. The model achieves a BLEU score of 41, improving significantly upon the vanilla sequence-to-sequence model and scoring roughly twice that of a simple template baseline. Human preference evaluation suggests the model is nearly as good as the Wikipedia reference. Manual analysis explores content selection, suggesting the model can trade the ability to infer knowledge against the risk of hallucinating incorrect information.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 01:30:59 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06235v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["andrew chisholm", "will radford", "ben hachey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06235"}
