We participated in the Arabic-&gt;English and English-&gt;Arabic tracks. We built both Phrase-based and Neural machine translation models, in an effort to probe whether the newly emerged NMT framework surpasses the traditional phrase-based systems in Arabic-English language pairs. We trained a very strong phrase-based system including, a big language model, the Operation Sequence Model, Neural Network Joint Model and Class-based models along with different domain adaptation techniques such as MML filtering, mixture modeling and using fine tuning over NNJM model. However, a Neural MT system, trained by stacking data from different genres through fine-tuning, and applying ensemble over 8 models, beat our very strong phrase-based system by a significant 2 BLEU points margin in Arabic-&gt;English direction. We did not obtain similar gains in the other direction but were still able to outperform the phrase-based system. We also applied system combination on phrase-based and NMT outputs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Jan 2017 14:18:54 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03924v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nadir durrani", "fahim dalvi", "hassan sajjad", "stephan vogel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.03924"}
