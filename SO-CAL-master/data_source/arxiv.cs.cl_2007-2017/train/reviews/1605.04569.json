{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-May-2016", "title": "Syntactically Guided Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "We investigate the use of hierarchical phrase-based SMT lattices in end-to-end neural machine translation (NMT). Weight pushing transforms the Hiero scores for complete translation hypotheses, with the full translation grammar score and full n-gram language model score, into posteriors compatible with NMT predictive probabilities. With a slightly modified NMT beam-search decoder we find gains over both Hiero and NMT decoding alone, with practical advantages in extending NMT to very large input and output vocabularies.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 May 2016 15:53:02 GMT  (152kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04569v1", "ACL 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 19 May 2016 08:52:37 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04569v2", "ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["felix stahlberg", "eva hasler", "aurelien waite", "bill byrne"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.04569"}
