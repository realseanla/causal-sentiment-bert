In this report, I describe a novel rule-based architecture, built on top of a pre-existing system, which is able to normalise temporal expressions detected in English texts. Gold standard temporally-annotated resources are limited in size and this makes research difficult. The proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art systems with respect to TempEval-2 Shared Task (value attribute) and achieves substantially better results with respect to the pre-existing system on top of which it has been developed. I will also introduce a new free corpus consisting of 2822 unique annotated temporal expressions. Both the corpus and the system are freely available on-line.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 Jun 2012 09:32:07 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2010v1", "7 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["michele filannino"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.2010"}
