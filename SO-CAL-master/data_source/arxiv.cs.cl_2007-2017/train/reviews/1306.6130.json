These competencies are based on the Common European Framework for (English) Language Learning. This data can be available for everyone involved with a given student's progress (e.g. educators, parents, supervisors and the students themselves). A given student's record of past accomplishments can also be meshed with those of his classmates. Not only are a student's competencies easily seen and tracked, educators can view competencies of a group of students that were achieved prior to enrollment in the class. This should make curriculum decision making easier and more efficient for educators.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 05:02:26 GMT  (398kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6130v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["robert bishop jr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.6130"}
