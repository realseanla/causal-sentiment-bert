This task is closely related to word-sense disambiguation (WSD), where the supervised word-expert approach has prevailed. In this work we present the results of the word-expert approach to NED, where one classifier is built for each target entity mention string. The resources necessary to build the system, a dictionary and a set of training instances, have been automatically derived from Wikipedia. We provide empirical evidence of the value of this approach, as well as a study of the differences between WSD and NED, including ambiguity and synonymy statistics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 17:16:02 GMT  (776kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04767v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["angel x chang", "valentin i spitkovsky", "christopher d manning", "eneko agirre"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04767"}
