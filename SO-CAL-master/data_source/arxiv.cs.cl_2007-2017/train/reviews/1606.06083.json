For efficient product classification we require a suitable representation for a document (the textual description of a product) feature vector and efficient and fast algorithms for prediction. To address the above challenges, we propose a new distributional semantics representation for document vector formation. We also develop a new two-level ensemble approach utilizing (with respect to the taxonomy tree) a path-wise, node-wise and depth-wise classifiers for error reduction in the final product classification. Our experiments show the effectiveness of the distributional representation and the ensemble approach on data sets from a leading e-commerce platform and achieve better results on various evaluation metrics compared to earlier approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 12:26:21 GMT  (2011kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06083v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Jul 2016 10:38:52 GMT  (2026kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06083v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["vivek gupta", "harish karnick", "ashendra bansal", "pradhuman jhala"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06083"}
