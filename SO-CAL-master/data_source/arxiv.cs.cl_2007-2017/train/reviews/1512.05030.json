Such lexicons are not available for all languages and even when available, their coverage can be limited. We present a graph-based semi-supervised learning method that uses the morphological, syntactic and semantic relations between words to automatically construct wide coverage lexicons from small seed sets. Our method is language-independent, and we show that we can expand a 1000 word seed lexicon to more than 100 times its size with high quality for 11 languages. In addition, the automatically created lexicons provide features that improve performance in two downstream tasks: morphological tagging and dependency parsing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 02:27:14 GMT  (129kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 19:02:56 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v2", "in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) 2016"], ["v3", "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 04:28:46 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05030v3", "Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL) 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui", "ryan mcdonald", "radu soricut"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.05030"}
