{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Oct-2015", "title": "Analyzer and generator for Pali", "abstract": "This work describes a system that performs morphological analysis and generation of Pali words. The system works with regular inflectional paradigms and a lexical database. The generator is used to build a collection of inflected and derived words, which in turn is used by the analyzer. Generating and storing morphological forms along with the corresponding morphological information allows for efficient and simple look up by the analyzer. Indeed, by looking up a word and extracting the attached morphological information, the analyzer does not have to compute this information. As we must, however, assume the lexical database to be incomplete, the system can also work without the dictionary component, using a rule-based approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 13:33:46 GMT  (1185kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01570v1", "Bachelor Thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "Bachelor Thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["david alfter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.01570"}
