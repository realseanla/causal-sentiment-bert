Given a text in the KB, we train our proposed model to predict entities that are relevant to the text. Our model is designed to be generic with the ability to address various NLP tasks with ease. We train the model using a large corpus of texts and their entity annotations extracted from Wikipedia. We evaluated the model on three important NLP tasks (i.e., sentence textual similarity, entity linking, and factoid question answering) involving both unsupervised and supervised settings. As a result, we achieved state-of-the-art results on all three of these tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 May 2017 15:11:30 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02494v1", "Accepted at TACL"], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 16:59:08 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02494v2", "Accepted at TACL"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at TACL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["ikuya yamada", "hiroyuki shindo", "hideaki takeda", "yoshiyasu takefuji"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02494"}
