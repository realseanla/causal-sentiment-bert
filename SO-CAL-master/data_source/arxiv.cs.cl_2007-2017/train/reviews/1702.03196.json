{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Feb-2017", "title": "Universal Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "Universal Dependencies (UD) provides a cross-linguistically uniform syntactic representation, with the aim of advancing multilingual applications of parsing and natural language understanding. Reddy et al. (2016) recently developed a semantic interface for (English) Stanford Dependencies, based on the lambda calculus. In this work, we introduce UDepLambda, a similar semantic interface for UD, which allows mapping natural language to logical forms in an almost language-independent framework. We evaluate our approach on semantic parsing for the task of question answering against Freebase. To facilitate multilingual evaluation, we provide German and Spanish translations of the WebQuestions and GraphQuestions datasets. Results show that UDepLambda outperforms strong baselines across languages and datasets. For English, it achieves the strongest result to date on GraphQuestions, with competitive results on WebQuestions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 14:57:26 GMT  (622kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03196v1", "15 pages with supplementary"], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 16:31:42 GMT  (622kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03196v2", "15 pages with supplementary, removed ugly boxes around urls"], ["v3", "Sun, 20 Aug 2017 20:43:17 GMT  (624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03196v3", "16 pages with supplementary, EMNLP 2017"], ["v4", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 23:59:14 GMT  (633kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03196v4", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages with supplementary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["siva reddy", "oscar t\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "slav petrov", "mark steedman", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.03196"}
