First, we build a weighted graph of synonyms extracted from commonly available resources, such as Wiktionary. Second, we apply word sense induction to deal with ambiguous words. Finally, we cluster the disambiguated version of the ambiguous input graph into synsets. Our meta-clustering approach lets us use an efficient hard clustering algorithm to perform a fuzzy clustering of the graph. Despite its simplicity, our approach shows excellent results, outperforming five competitive state-of-the-art methods in terms of F-score on three gold standard datasets for English and Russian derived from large-scale manually constructed lexical resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 11:49:08 GMT  (281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07157v1", "12 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, accepted to ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables, accepted to ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dmitry ustalov", "alexander panchenko", "chris biemann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07157"}
