In other words, to assign a meaningful number to her language portfolio. Intuition says that someone who speaks fluently Spanish and Portuguese is linguistically less proficient compared to someone who speaks fluently Spanish and Chinese since it takes more effort for a native Spanish speaker to learn Chinese than Portuguese. As the number of languages grows and their proficiency levels vary, it gets even more complicated to assign a score to a language portfolio. In this article we propose such a measure (\"linguistic quotient\" - LQ) that can account for these effects.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Mar 2015 16:41:05 GMT  (223kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06151v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["maxim litvak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06151"}
