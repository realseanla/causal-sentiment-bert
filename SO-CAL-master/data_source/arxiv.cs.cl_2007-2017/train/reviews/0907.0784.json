{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jul-2009", "title": "Cross-Task Knowledge-Constrained Self Training", "abstract": "We present an algorithmic framework for learning multiple related tasks. Our framework exploits a form of prior knowledge that relates the output spaces of these tasks. We present PAC learning results that analyze the conditions under which such learning is possible. We present results on learning a shallow parser and named-entity recognition system that exploits our framework, showing consistent improvements over baseline methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jul 2009 18:42:01 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.0784v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["hal daum\u00e9 iii"], "accepted": true, "id": "0907.0784"}
