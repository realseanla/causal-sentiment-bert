Existing research tends to solve such sub-tasks separately, but ignore the close relation between them. In this paper, we present a joint framework incorporating logical relation between sub-tasks to improve the performance of argumentation structure generation. We design an objective function to combine the predictions from individual models for each sub-task and solve the problem with some constraints constructed from background knowledge. We evaluate our proposed model on two public corpora and the experiment results show that our model can outperform the baseline that uses a separate model significantly for each sub-task. Our model also shows advantages on component-related sub-tasks compared to a state-of-the-art joint model based on the evidence graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 09:32:08 GMT  (806kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05343v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhongyu wei", "chen li", "yang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.05343"}
