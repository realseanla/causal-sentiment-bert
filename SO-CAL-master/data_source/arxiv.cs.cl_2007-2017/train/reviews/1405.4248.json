This method, called \"Formal Semantics,\" has been initiated by the American linguist Richard M. Montague in the 1970's. It uses mathematical tools such as formal languages and grammars, first-order logic, type theory and $\\lambda$-calculus. Our goal is to have the reader discover both Montagovian formal semantics and the mathematical tools that he used in his method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 May 2014 17:17:19 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4248v1", "14 pages, in French.
