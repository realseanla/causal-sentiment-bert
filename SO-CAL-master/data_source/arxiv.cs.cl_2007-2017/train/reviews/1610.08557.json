In this paper, we employ knowledge-based approaches that also exploit recent advances in neural word/concept embeddings to improve over the state-of-the-art in biomedical WSD using the MSH WSD dataset as the test set. Our methods involve distant supervision - we do not use any hand-labeled examples for WSD to build our prediction models; however, we employ an existing well known named entity recognition and concept mapping program, MetaMap, to obtain our concept vectors. Over the MSH WSD dataset, our linear time (in terms of numbers of senses and words in the test instance) method achieves an accuracy of 92.24% which is an absolute 3% improvement over the best known results obtained via unsupervised or knowledge-based means. A more expensive approach that we developed relies on a nearest neighbor framework and achieves an accuracy of 94.34%. Employing dense vector representations learned from unlabeled free text has been shown to benefit many language processing tasks recently and our efforts show that biomedical WSD is no exception to this trend. For a complex and rapidly evolving domain such as biomedicine, building labeled datasets for larger sets of ambiguous terms may be impractical. Here we demonstrate that distant supervision that leverages recent advances in representation learning can rival supervised approaches in biomedical WSD.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:49:15 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08557v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Dec 2016 00:57:16 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08557v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 20:38:45 GMT  (156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08557v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 28 Jun 2017 02:13:13 GMT  (206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08557v4", "8 pages"], ["v5", "Sat, 30 Sep 2017 01:01:50 GMT  (260kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08557v5", "8 pages, accepted to appear in proceedings of IEEE BIBE 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["a k m sabbir", "antonio jimeno yepes", "ramakanth kavuluru"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08557"}
