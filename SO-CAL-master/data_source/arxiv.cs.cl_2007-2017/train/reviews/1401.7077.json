Entropy, symbol diversity and symbol frequency profiles were compared for these four groups. We also built a scale sensitive to the quality of writing and evaluated its relationship with the Flesch's readability index for English and the Szigriszt's perspicuity index for Spanish. Results suggest a correlation between entropy and word diversity with quality of writing. Text genre also influences the resulting entropy and diversity of the text. Results suggest the plausibility of automated quality assessment of texts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 03:48:01 GMT  (5140kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7077v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 20:11:28 GMT  (5139kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7077v2", "Submitted for publication. 17 pages. 6 figures, 4 tables, 4 appendixes"], ["v3", "Sat, 24 Jan 2015 03:38:02 GMT  (5825kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7077v3", "Submitted for publication. 29 pages. 8 figures, 4 tables, 4 appendixes"], ["v4", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 15:49:55 GMT  (5894kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7077v4", "Submitted for publication. 29 pages. 8 figures, 4 tables, 4 appendixes"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gerardo febres", "klaus jaffe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.7077"}
