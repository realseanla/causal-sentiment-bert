{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-May-2017", "title": "TriviaQA: A Large Scale Distantly Supervised Challenge Dataset for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "We present TriviaQA, a challenging reading comprehension dataset containing over 650K question-answer-evidence triples. TriviaQA includes 95K question-answer pairs authored by trivia enthusiasts and independently gathered evidence documents, six per question on average, that provide high quality distant supervision for answering the questions. We show that, in comparison to other recently introduced large-scale datasets, TriviaQA (1) has relatively complex, compositional questions, (2) has considerable syntactic and lexical variability between questions and corresponding answer-evidence sentences, and (3) requires more cross sentence reasoning to find answers. We also present two baseline algorithms: a feature-based classifier and a state-of-the-art neural network, that performs well on SQuAD reading comprehension. Neither approach comes close to human performance (23% and 40% vs. 80%), suggesting that TriviaQA is a challenging testbed that is worth significant future study.\\footnote{Data and code available at --", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 21:35:07 GMT  (1148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551v1", "Accepted at ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 13 May 2017 21:12:37 GMT  (1149kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03551v2", "Added references, fixed typos, minor baseline update"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mandar joshi", "eunsol choi", "daniel s weld", "luke zettlemoyer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.03551"}
