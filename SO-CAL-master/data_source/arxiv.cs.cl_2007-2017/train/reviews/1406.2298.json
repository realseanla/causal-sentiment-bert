Such behaviours are typically made available as long traces of system actions which would benefit from a natural language explanation of the trace and especially in the context of business logic level specifications. In this paper we present a natural language generation model which can be used to explain such traces. A key idea is that the explanation language is a CNL that is, formally speaking, regular language susceptible transformations that can be expressed with finite state machinery. At the same time it admits various forms of abstraction and simplification which contribute to the naturalness of explanations that are communicated to the user.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 19:51:10 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2298v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL", "authors": ["gordon j pace", "michael rosner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2298"}
