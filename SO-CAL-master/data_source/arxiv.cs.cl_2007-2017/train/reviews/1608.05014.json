While path-based and distributional information sources are considered complementary, the strong results the latter showed on recent datasets suggested that the former's contribution might have become obsolete. We follow the recent success of an integrated neural method for hypernymy detection (Shwartz et al., 2016) and extend it to recognize multiple relations. We demonstrate that these two information sources are indeed complementary, and analyze the contributions of each source.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 16:27:49 GMT  (144kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05014v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 09:46:36 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05014v2", "4 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 15:27:21 GMT  (149kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05014v3", "5 pages, accepted to the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex-V), in COLING 2016"], ["v4", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 08:57:39 GMT  (151kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05014v4", "5 pages, accepted to the 5th Workshop on Cognitive Aspects of the Lexicon (CogALex-V), in COLING 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vered shwartz", "ido dagan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05014"}
