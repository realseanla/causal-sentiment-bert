The submitted system is a fusion of nine sub-systems based on i-vectors extracted from different types of features. Given the i-vectors, several classifiers are adopted for the language detection task including support vector machines (SVM), multi-class logistic regression (MCLR), Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 06:02:51 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01929v1", "Technical report for NIST LRE 2015 Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report for NIST LRE 2015 Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kong aik lee", "ville hautam\\\"aki", "anthony larcher", "wei rao", "hanwu sun", "trung hieu nguyen", "guangsen wang", "aleksandr sizov", "ivan kukanov", "amir poorjam", "trung ngo trong", "xiong xiao", "cheng-lin xu", "hai-hua xu", "bin ma", "haizhou li", "sylvain meignier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01929"}
