We model the problem of inflection generation as a character sequence to sequence learning problem and present a variant of the neural encoder-decoder model for solving it. Our model is language independent and can be trained in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. We evaluate our system on seven datasets of morphologically rich languages and achieve either better or comparable results to existing state-of-the-art models of inflection generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 20:48:26 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06110v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 17:23:32 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06110v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 01:02:01 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06110v3", "Proceedings of NAACL 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui", "yulia tsvetkov", "graham neubig", "chris dyer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.06110"}
