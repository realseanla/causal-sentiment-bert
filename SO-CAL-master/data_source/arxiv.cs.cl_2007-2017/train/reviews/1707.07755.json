We use Stack-LSTMs to represent our parser state and make decisions greedily. In our experiments, we show that our parser achieves very competitive scores on English using only AMR training data. Adding additional information, such as POS tags and dependency trees, improves the results further.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jul 2017 21:33:21 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07755v1", "EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 15:47:32 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07755v2", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["miguel ballesteros", "yaser al-onaizan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07755"}
