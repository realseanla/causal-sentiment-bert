{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Aug-2016", "title": "Aligning Packed Dependency Trees: a theory of composition for distributional semantics", "abstract": "We present a new framework for compositional distributional semantics in which the distributional contexts of lexemes are expressed in terms of anchored packed dependency trees. We show that these structures have the potential to capture the full sentential contexts of a lexeme and provide a uniform basis for the composition of distributional knowledge in a way that captures both mutual disambiguation and generalization.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 12:44:05 GMT  (294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07115v1", "To appear in Special issue of Computational Linguistics - Formal Distributional Semantics"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Special issue of Computational Linguistics - Formal Distributional Semantics", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["david weir", "julie weeds", "jeremy reffin", "thomas kober"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07115"}
