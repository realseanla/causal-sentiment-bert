Requirements tracing usually consists of document parsing, candidate link generation and evaluation and traceability analysis. This paper demonstrates the applicability of Statistical Term Extraction metrics to generate candidate links. It is applied and validated using two data sets and four types of filters two for each data set, 0.2 and 0.25 for MODIS, 0 and 0.05 for CM1. This method generates requirements traceability matrices between textual requirements artifacts (such as high-level requirements traced to low-level requirements). The proposed method includes ten word frequency metrics divided into three main groups for calculating the frequency of terms. The results show that the proposed method gives better result when compared with the traditional TF-IDF method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 19:21:04 GMT  (749kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08789v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["najla al-saati", "raghda abdul-jaleel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08789"}
