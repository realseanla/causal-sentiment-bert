SLs are visual, complete, standalone languages which are just as expressive as oral languages. Signs in SL usually correspond to sequences of highly specific body postures interleaved with movements, which make reference to real world objects, characters or situations. Here we propose a formal representation of SL signs, that will help us with the analysis of automatically-collected hand tracking data from French Sign Language (FSL) video corpora. We further show how such a representation could help us with the design of computer aided SL verification tools, which in turn would bring us closer to the development of an automatic recognition system for these languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Mar 2014 11:47:37 GMT  (6302kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6636v1", "6 pages, Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), August, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 2: Short Papers), August, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["arturo curiel", "christophe collet 0002"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.6636"}
