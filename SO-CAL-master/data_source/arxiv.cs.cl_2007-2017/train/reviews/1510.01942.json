A distinguishing feature is that most development work can be performed directly by domain experts. We motivate the need for platforms of this type and discuss three specific cases: medical speech translation, speech-to-sign-language translation and voice questionnaires. We briefly describe initial experiences in developing practical systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 13:47:12 GMT  (264kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01942v1", "12 pages, 1 figure, to appear in Proc.
