{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-May-2016", "title": "Query Expansion with Locally-Trained Word Embeddings", "abstract": "Continuous space word embeddings have received a great deal of attention in the natural language processing and machine learning communities for their ability to model term similarity and other relationships. We study the use of term relatedness in the context of query expansion for information retrieval. We demonstrate that word embeddings such as word2vec and GloVe, when trained globally, underperform corpus and query specific embeddings for retrieval tasks. These results suggest that other tasks benefiting from global embeddings may also benefit from local embeddings.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 14:09:00 GMT  (424kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07891v1", "ACL 2016, to appear"], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 00:46:06 GMT  (441kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07891v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2016, to appear", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["fernando diaz 0001", "bhaskar mitra", "nick craswell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07891"}
