Almost all previous methods use fixed context window sizes as input features. However, it is obvious that different tags usually rely on different context window sizes. These motivate us to build a supertagger with a dynamic window approach, which can be treated as an attention mechanism on the local contexts. Applying dropout on the dynamic filters can be seen as drop on words directly, which is superior to the regular dropout on word embeddings. We use this approach to demonstrate the state-of-the-art CCG supertagging performance on the standard test set.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 01:47:50 GMT  (783kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02749v1", "8 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["huijia wu", "jiajun zhang", "chengqing zong"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.02749"}
