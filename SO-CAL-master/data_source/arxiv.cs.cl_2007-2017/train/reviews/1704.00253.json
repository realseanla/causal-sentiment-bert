In this study, we construct NMT systems using only synthetic parallel data. As an effective alternative to real parallel data, we also present a new type of synthetic parallel corpus. The proposed pseudo parallel data are distinct from previous approaches in that real and synthetic sentences are mixed on both sides of sentence pairs. Experiments on Czech-German and French-German translations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed pseudo parallel corpus that guarantees not only both balanced and competitive performance for bidirectional translation but also substantial improvement with the aid of a real parallel corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Apr 2017 05:54:14 GMT  (236kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00253v1", "10 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 02:58:02 GMT  (231kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00253v2", "added small-scale experiments"], ["v3", "Mon, 15 May 2017 09:23:21 GMT  (232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00253v3", "added small-scale experiments and reorganized experimental results"], ["v4", "Sun, 17 Sep 2017 01:58:39 GMT  (269kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00253v4", null]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jaehong park", "jongyoon song", "sungroh yoon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00253"}
