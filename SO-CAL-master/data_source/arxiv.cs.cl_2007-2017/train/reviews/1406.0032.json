{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-May-2014", "title": "Comparing and Combining Sentiment Analysis Methods", "abstract": "Several messages express opinions about events, products, and services, political views or even their author's emotional state and mood. Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the repercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products and services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication in Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of comparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at filling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are in tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement. We also present a free Web service called iFeel, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing results across different sentiment methods for a given text.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 May 2014 22:47:49 GMT  (966kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0032v1", "Proceedings of the first ACM conference on Online social networks (2013) 27-38"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the first ACM conference on Online social networks (2013) 27-38", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pollyanna gon\\c{c}alves", "matheus ara\\'ujo", "fabr\\'icio benevenuto", "meeyoung cha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.0032"}
