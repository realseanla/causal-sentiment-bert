In this task we have considered a set of language independent features for all the languages. Only for English a language specific feature, i.e. capitalization, has been added. Next the use of gazetteer is explored for Bengali, Hindi and English. The gazetteers are built from Wikipedia and other sources. Test results show that the system achieves the highest F measure of 88% for English and the lowest F measure of 69% for both Tamil and Telugu. Note that for the least performing two languages no gazetteer was used. NER in Bengali and Hindi finds accuracy (F measure) of 87% and 79%, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 07:11:30 GMT  (95kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8008v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["arjun das", "utpal garain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8008"}
