Given a set of related documents, we automatically find these relationships by clustering segments with similar content (topics). In this context, we study how different weighting mechanisms influence the discovery of word communities that relate to the different topics found in the documents. Finally, we test different mapping functions to assign topic segments to word communities, determining which topic segments are considered equivalent.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 19:41:56 GMT  (659kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04081v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["pedro mota", "maxine eskenazi", "luisa coheur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04081"}
