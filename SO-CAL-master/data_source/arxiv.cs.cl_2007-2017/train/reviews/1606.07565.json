Deep neural networks (DNN) are capable of learning ideal representations of data during the training process, removing the need for independently extracting features. However, the structures of these DNNs are often tailored to perform on specific datasets. In addition, IR tasks deal with text at varying levels of granularity from single factoids to documents containing thousands of words. In this paper, we examine the role of the granularity on the performance of common state of the art DNN structures in IR.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 04:40:48 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07565v1", "4 pages, Neu-IR'16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval, July 21, 2016, Pisa, Italy"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, Neu-IR'16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval, July 21, 2016, Pisa, Italy", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["daniel cohen", "qingyao ai", "w bruce croft"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07565"}
