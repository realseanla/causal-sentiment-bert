Randall Munroe's Thing Explainer uses only the 1'000 most often used words of the English language together with drawn pictures to explain complicated things such as nuclear reactors, jet engines, the solar system, and dishwashers. This restricted language is a very interesting new case for the CNL community. I describe here its place in the context of existing approaches on Controlled Natural Languages, and I provide a first analysis from a scientific perspective, covering the word production rules and word distributions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 May 2016 07:48:40 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02457v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tobias kuhn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02457"}
