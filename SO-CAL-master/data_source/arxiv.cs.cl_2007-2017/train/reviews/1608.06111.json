Our parser is based on a transition system for dependency parsing, and allows to incrementally parse the sentence into an AMR graph, if all other components that are needed by the parser (such as the part-of-speech tagger and the dependency parser) are incremental as well. We show that our parser has an advantage over state-of-the-art AMR parsers on several metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 10:30:18 GMT  (37kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06111v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 08:13:13 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06111v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 14:04:16 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06111v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 17:20:14 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06111v4", "EACL 2017"], ["v5", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 14:18:14 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06111v5", "EACL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco damonte", "shay b cohen", "giorgio satta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06111"}
