In this paper we apply the popular word embedding methods and deep neural networks to leverage financial news to predict stock price movements in the market. Experimental results have shown that our proposed methods are simple but very effective, which can significantly improve the stock prediction accuracy on a standard financial database over the baseline system using only the historical price information.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 01:43:11 GMT  (155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07220v1", "5 pages, 2 figures, technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures, technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["yangtuo peng", "hui jiang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.07220"}
