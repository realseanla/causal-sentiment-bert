The model is a relatively simple neural network with one recurrent layer, and displays biases in learning that mimic observed biases in human learning. Single-feature patterns are learned faster than two-feature patterns, and vowel or consonant-only patterns are learned faster than patterns involving vowels and consonants, mimicking the results of laboratory learning experiments. In non-recurrent models, capturing these biases requires the use of alpha features or some other representation of repeated features, but with a recurrent neural network, these elaborations are not necessary.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 18:19:35 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07324v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amanda doucette"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07324"}
