As real-world events and emergencies unfold, Twitter is abuzz with hundreds of thousands of stories about the events. Some of these stories are harmless, while others could potentially be life-saving or sources of malicious rumors. Thus, it is critically important to be able to efficiently track stories that spread on Twitter during these events. In this paper, we present a novel semi-automatic tool that enables users to efficiently identify and track stories about real-world events on Twitter. We ran a user study with 25 participants, demonstrating that compared to more conventional methods, our tool can increase the speed and the accuracy with which users can track stories about real-world events.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 May 2016 12:33:24 GMT  (107kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05134v1", "ICWSM'16, May 17-20, Cologne, Germany.
