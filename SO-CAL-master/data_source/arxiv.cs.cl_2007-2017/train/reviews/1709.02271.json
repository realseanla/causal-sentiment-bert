We present a novel method to embed discourse features in a Convolutional Neural Network text classifier, which achieves a state-of-the-art result by a substantial margin. We empirically investigate several featurization methods to understand the conditions under which discourse features contribute non-trivial performance gains, and analyze discourse embeddings.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 14:22:50 GMT  (787kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02271v1", "Accepted at IJCNLP 2017 as a conference paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at IJCNLP 2017 as a conference paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["su wang", "elisa ferracane", "raymond j mooney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02271"}
