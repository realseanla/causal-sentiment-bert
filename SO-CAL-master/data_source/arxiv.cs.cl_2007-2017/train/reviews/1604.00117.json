The key to scalability is reducing the amount of training data needed to learn a model for a new task. The proposed multi-task model delivers better performance with less data by leveraging patterns that it learns from the other tasks. The approach supports an open vocabulary, which allows the models to generalize to unseen words, which is particularly important when very little training data is used. A newly collected crowd-sourced data set, covering four different domains, is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the domain adaptation and open vocabulary techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 03:24:32 GMT  (138kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00117v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 10 Aug 2016 02:53:00 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00117v2", "Interspeech 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aaron jaech", "larry heck", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00117"}
