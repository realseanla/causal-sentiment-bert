The families are separated purely on the basis of forbidden patterns in latent encoding, eliminating the need to differentiate the families of non-crossing graphs in inference algorithms: one algorithm works for all when the search space can be controlled in parser input.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 14:37:22 GMT  (73kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03357v1", "11 pages.
