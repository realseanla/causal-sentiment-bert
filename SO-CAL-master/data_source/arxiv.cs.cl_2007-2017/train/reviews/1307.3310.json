Transliteration is one such module that we design while designing a translation system. Transliteration means mapping of source language text into the target language. Simple mapping decreases the efficiency of overall translation system. We propose the use of stemming and part-of-speech tagging for transliteration. The effectiveness of translation can be improved if we use part-of-speech tagging and stemming assisted transliteration.We have shown that much of the content in Gujarati gets transliterated while being processed for translation to Hindi language.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Jul 2013 03:05:29 GMT  (335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3310v1", "6 pages; June 2013, url-this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages; June 2013, url-this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["juhi ameta", "nisheeth joshi", "iti mathur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3310"}
