We focus on one particular personal trait, gender, and study how it is manifested in original texts and in translations. We show that gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals, but this signal is obfuscated in human and machine translation. We then propose simple domain-adaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the translation outcome, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating more personalized machine translation systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 07:39:40 GMT  (146kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05461v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 12 Jan 2017 11:43:05 GMT  (137kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05461v2", "EACL 2017, 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ella rabinovich", "shachar mirkin", "raj nath patel", "lucia specia", "shuly wintner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05461"}
