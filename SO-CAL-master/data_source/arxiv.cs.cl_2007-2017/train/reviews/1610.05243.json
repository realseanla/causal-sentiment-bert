While most sentences are more accurate and fluent than translations by statistical machine translation (SMT)-based systems, in some cases, the NMT system produces translations that have a completely different meaning. This is especially the case when rare words occur.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 18:14:24 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05243v1", "9 pages.
