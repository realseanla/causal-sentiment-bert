In this paper, we introduce a novel unsupervised model that jointly describes the textual and visual features needed to distinguish compositors. Applied to images of Shakespeare's First Folio, our model predicts attributions that agree with the manual judgements of bibliographers with an accuracy of 87%, even on text that is the output of OCR.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 19:26:36 GMT  (596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07875v1", "Short paper (6 pages) accepted at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Short paper (6 pages) accepted at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["maria ryskina", "hannah alpert-abrams", "dan garrette", "taylor berg-kirkpatrick"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07875"}
