We use a rich formal model of events and their participants to generate simulations that satisfy the minimal constraints entailed by the associated utterance, relying on semantic knowledge of physical objects and motion events. This paper outlines technical considerations and discusses implementing the aforementioned semantic models into such a system.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 15:40:08 GMT  (818kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00602v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nikhil krishnaswamy", "james pustejovsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00602"}
