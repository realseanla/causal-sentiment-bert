Computers with this kind of ability are gradually becoming a reality, through the evolution of speech recognition technologies. Speech is being an important mode of interaction with computers. In this paper Feature extraction is implemented using well-known Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC).Pattern matching is done using Dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 May 2013 08:47:47 GMT  (62kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2959v1", "Pages: 05 Figures : 01 Tables : 03 Proceedings of the International Conference ICAET 2010, Chennai, India. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.2847"]], "COMMENTS": "Pages: 05 Figures : 01 Tables : 03 Proceedings of the International Conference ICAET 2010, Chennai, India. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.2847", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["neema mishra", "urmila shrawankar", "v m thakare"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2959"}
