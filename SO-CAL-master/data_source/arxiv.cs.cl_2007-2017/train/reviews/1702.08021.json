This paper describes a novel approach for detecting stance in Twitter. We define a set of features in order to consider the context surrounding a target of interest with the final aim of training a model for predicting the stance towards the mentioned targets. In particular, we are interested in investigating political debates in social media. For this reason we evaluated our approach focusing on two targets of the SemEval-2016 Task6 on Detecting stance in tweets, which are related to the political campaign for the 2016 U.S. presidential elections: Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump. For the sake of comparison with the state of the art, we evaluated our model against the dataset released in the SemEval-2016 Task 6 shared task competition. Our results outperform the best ones obtained by participating teams, and show that information about enemies and friends of politicians help in detecting stance towards them.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Feb 2017 11:22:41 GMT  (64kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08021v1", "To appear in MICAI 2016 LNAI Proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in MICAI 2016 LNAI Proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mirko lai", "delia iraz\\'u hern\\'andez far\\'ias", "viviana patti", "paolo rosso"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08021"}
