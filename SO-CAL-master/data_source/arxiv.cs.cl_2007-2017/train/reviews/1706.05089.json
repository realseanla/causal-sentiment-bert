However, the assessment of the users for its core technical development has been highly limited, therefore, it is unclear if the community is thoroughly aware of the status-quo of the growing infrastructure. In addition, CLARIN does not seem to be fully materialised marketing and business plans and strategies despite its strong technical assets. This article analyses the web traffic of the Virtual Language Observatory, one of the main web applications of CLARIN and a symbol of pan-European re-search cooperation, to evaluate the users and performance of the service in a transparent and scientific way. It is envisaged that the paper can raise awareness of the pressing issues on objective and transparent operation of the infrastructure though Open Evaluation, and the synergy between marketing and technical development. It also investigates the \"science of web analytics\" in an attempt to document the research process for the purpose of reusability and reproducibility, thus to find universal lessons for the use of a web analytics, rather than to merely produce a statistical report of a particular website which loses its value outside its context.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 13:00:08 GMT  (2004kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05089v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL", "authors": ["go sugimoto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.05089"}
