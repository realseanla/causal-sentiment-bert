On one hand, we analyze their co-voting patterns and, on the other, their retweeting behavior. We make use of two diverse datasets in the analysis. The first one is the roll-call vote dataset, where cohesion is regarded as the tendency to co-vote within a group, and a coalition is formed when the members of several groups exhibit a high degree of co-voting agreement on a subject. The second dataset comes from Twitter; it captures the retweeting (i.e., endorsing) behavior of the MEPs and implies cohesion (retweets within the same group) and coalitions (retweets between groups) from a completely different perspective.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 10:10:14 GMT  (457kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04917v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 09:47:42 GMT  (531kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04917v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["darko cherepnalkoski", "reas karpf", "igor mozetic", "miha grcar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04917"}
