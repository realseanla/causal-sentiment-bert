Almost all previous work on this task focuses on learning generative models. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised dependency parsing model based on the CRF autoencoder. The encoder part of our model is discriminative and globally normalized which allows us to use rich features as well as universal linguistic priors. We propose an exact algorithm for parsing as well as a tractable learning algorithm. We evaluated the performance of our model on eight multilingual treebanks and found that our model achieved comparable performance with state-of-the-art approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 06:45:31 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.01018v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jiong cai", "yong jiang", "kewei tu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.01018"}
