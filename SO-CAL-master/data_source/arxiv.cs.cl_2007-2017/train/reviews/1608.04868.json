Recommending automatically generated music playlists (e.g. personalised playlists) introduces the problem of generating descriptions. In this paper, we propose a method for generating music playlist descriptions, which is called as music captioning. In the proposed method, audio content analysis and natural language processing are adopted to utilise the information of each track.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 06:24:46 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04868v1", "2 pages, ISMIR 2016 Late-breaking/session extended abstract"], ["v2", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 05:23:51 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04868v2", "2 pages, ISMIR 2016 Late-breaking/session extended abstract"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages, ISMIR 2016 Late-breaking/session extended abstract", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["keunwoo choi", "george fazekas", "brian mcfee", "kyunghyun cho", "mark sandler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04868"}
