{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Jun-2016", "title": "Incremental Parsing with Minimal Features Using Bi-Directional LSTM", "abstract": "Recently, neural network approaches for parsing have largely automated the combination of individual features, but still rely on (often a larger number of) atomic features created from human linguistic intuition, and potentially omitting important global context. To further reduce feature engineering to the bare minimum, we use bi-directional LSTM sentence representations to model a parser state with only three sentence positions, which automatically identifies important aspects of the entire sentence. This model achieves state-of-the-art results among greedy dependency parsers for English. We also introduce a novel transition system for constituency parsing which does not require binarization, and together with the above architecture, achieves state-of-the-art results among greedy parsers for both English and Chinese.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 03:20:59 GMT  (54kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06406v1", "Pre-print of paper appearing in ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Pre-print of paper appearing in ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["james cross", "liang huang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.06406"}
