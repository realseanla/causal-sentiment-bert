In clinical domain one major application of sequence labeling involves extraction of medical entities such as medication, indication, and side-effects from Electronic Health Record narratives. Sequence labeling in this domain, presents its own set of challenges and objectives. In this work we experimented with various CRF based structured learning models with Recurrent Neural Networks. We extend the previously studied LSTM-CRF models with explicit modeling of pairwise potentials. We also propose an approximate version of skip-chain CRF inference with RNN potentials. We use these methodologies for structured prediction in order to improve the exact phrase detection of various medical entities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 20:54:22 GMT  (304kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00612v1", "To appear in the proceedings of EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the proceedings of EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["abhyuday jagannatha", "hong yu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.00612"}
