The probabilities of these words, which are often important name entities, are generally under-estimated by the language model (LM) due to their limited occurrences in the training data. Recently, we proposed a word-pair approach to deal with the problem, which borrows information of frequent words to enhance the probabilities of low-frequency words. This paper presents an extension to the word-pair method by involving multiple `predicting words' to produce better estimation for low-frequency words. We also employ this approach to deal with out-of-language words in the task of multi-lingual speech recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 12:31:43 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04940v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xi ma", "xiaoxi wang", "dong wang", "zhiyong zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04940"}
