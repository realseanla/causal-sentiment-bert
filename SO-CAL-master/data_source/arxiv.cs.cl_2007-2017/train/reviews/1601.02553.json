A deep neural network is used to predict the acoustic environment in which the system in being used. The discriminative embedding generated at the bottleneck layer of this network is then concatenated with traditional acoustic features as input to a deep neural network acoustic model. Using simulated acoustic environments we show that the proposed approach significantly improves speech recognition accuracy in noisy and highly reverberant environments, outperforming multi-condition training and multi-task learning for this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 18:38:18 GMT  (1757kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02553v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 22:45:08 GMT  (5813kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02553v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["suyoun kim", "bhiksha raj", "ian lane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02553"}
