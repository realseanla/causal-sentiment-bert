While the growing importance of typological information in supporting multilingual tasks has been recognised, no systematic survey of existing typological resources and their use in NLP has been published. This paper provides such a survey as well as discussion which we hope will both inform and inspire future work in the area.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 14:11:55 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03349v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["helen o'horan", "yevgeni berzak", "ivan vuli\\'c", "roi reichart", "anna korhonen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03349"}
