We show that qwn-ppv outperforms other automatically generated lexicons for the four extrinsic evaluations presented here. It also shows very competitive and robust results with respect to manually annotated ones. Results suggest that no single lexicon is best for every task and dataset and that the intrinsic evaluation of polarity lexicons is not a good performance indicator on a Sentiment Analysis task. The qwn-ppv method allows to easily create quality polarity lexicons whenever no domain-based annotated corpora are available for a given language.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 17:14:29 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01711v1", "8 pages plus 2 pages of references"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages plus 2 pages of references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["i\\~naki san vicente", "rodrigo agerri", "german rigau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01711"}
