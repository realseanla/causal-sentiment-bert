Our system employs an attention-based recurrent neural network model that optimizes the sentence similarity. In this paper, we describe our participation in the multilingual STS task which measures similarity across English, Spanish, and Arabic.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 03:15:22 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05465v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenli zhuang", "ernie chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05465"}
