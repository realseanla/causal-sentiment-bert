Unlike conventional maximum likelihood estimation, minimum risk training is capable of optimizing model parameters directly with respect to evaluation metrics. Experiments on Chinese-English and English-French translation show that our approach achieves significant improvements over maximum likelihood estimation on a state-of-the-art neural machine translation system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 12:42:00 GMT  (8kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02433v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 14:20:36 GMT  (8kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02433v2", "Some typos corrected; the case-sensitiveness of BLEU scores are given"], ["v3", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 00:07:05 GMT  (103kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02433v3", "Accepted for publication in Proceedings of ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shiqi shen", "yong cheng", "zhongjun he", "wei he", "hua wu", "maosong sun", "yang liu 0005"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.02433"}
