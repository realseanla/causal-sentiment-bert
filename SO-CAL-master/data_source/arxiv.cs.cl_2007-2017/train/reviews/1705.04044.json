Our best model is the combination of bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Conditional Random Field (CRF), using pre-trained word embeddings as input, which achieves an F1 score of 88.59% on a standard test set. Our system is able to achieve a comparable performance to the first-rank system of the VLSP campaign without using any syntactic or hand-crafted features. We also give an extensive empirical study on using common deep learning models for Vietnamese NER, at both word and character level.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 May 2017 07:31:39 GMT  (148kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04044v1", "6 pages, submitted to PACLING 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 16:49:03 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04044v2", "14 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables, accepted to PACLING 2017"], ["v3", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 00:04:32 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04044v3", "14 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables, accepted to PACLING 2017, fix CRF formular"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, submitted to PACLING 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thai-hoang pham", "phuong le-hong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04044"}
