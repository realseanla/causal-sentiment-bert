Indeed, Bentley et al. themselves under-emphasise the potential richness of the latter, within-distribution effects.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 12:12:11 GMT  (138kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6880v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["m t keane & a gerow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.6880"}
