ACD aims at detecting and classifying different argument components in natural language texts. Historical annotations (HAs) are important features the human annotators consider when they manually perform the ACD task. However, HAs are largely ignored by existing automatic ACD techniques. Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be an effective method for using HAs in some natural language processing tasks. In this work, we propose a RL-based ACD technique, and evaluate its performance on two well-annotated corpora. Results suggest that, in terms of classification accuracy, HAs-augmented RL outperforms plain RL by at most 17.85%, and outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised learning algorithm by at most 11.94%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 02:18:38 GMT  (329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06239v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yang gao", "hao wang", "chen zhang", "wei wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06239"}
