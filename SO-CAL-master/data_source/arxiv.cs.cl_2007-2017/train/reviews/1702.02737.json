There have been various studies worked on recommendation problem. However, most of the studies beyond one aspect user generated- content such as user ratings, user feedback and so on to state user preferences. There is a prob- lem in one aspect mining is lacking for stating user preferences. As a demonstration, in collaborative filter recommendation, we try to figure out the preference trend of crowded users, then use that trend to predict current user preference. Therefore, there is a gap between real user preferences and the trend of the crowded people. Additionally, user preferences can be addressed from mining user reviews since user often comment about various aspects of products. To solve this problem, we mainly focus on mining product aspects and user aspects inside user reviews to directly state user preferences. We also take into account Social Network Analysis for cold-start item problem. With cold-start user problem, collaborative filter algorithm is employed in our work. The framework is general enough to be applied to different recommendation domains. Theoretically, our method would achieve a significant enhancement.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 08:03:16 GMT  (191kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02737v1", "The 2nd Workshop on Future Researches of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, pp. 21-24, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "The 2nd Workshop on Future Researches of Computer Science and Engineering, Kyungpook National University, pp. 21-24, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["xuan-son vu", "seong-bae park"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02737"}
