For getting good representations, it is important to take into account different senses of a word. In this paper, we propose a mixture model for learning multi-sense word embeddings. Our model generalizes the previous works in that it allows to induce different weights of different senses of a word. The experimental results show that our model outperforms previous models on standard evaluation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 23:07:06 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05111v1", "*SEM 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "*SEM 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dai quoc nguyen", "dat quoc nguyen", "ashutosh modi", "stefan thater", "manfred pinkal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.05111"}
