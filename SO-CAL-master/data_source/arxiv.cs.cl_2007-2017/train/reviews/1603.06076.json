Distributional methods, whose supervised variants are the current best performers, and path-based methods who receive less research attention. We suggest an improved path-based algorithm, in which the dependency paths are encoded using a recurrent neural network, and achieve results comparable to distributional methods. We then extend the approach to integrate both path-based and distributional signals, significantly improving the state-of-the-art on this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 10:09:53 GMT  (250kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06076v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 May 2016 16:07:40 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06076v2", "ACL 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 10:09:43 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06076v3", "ACL 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["vered shwartz", "yoav goldberg", "ido dagan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06076"}
