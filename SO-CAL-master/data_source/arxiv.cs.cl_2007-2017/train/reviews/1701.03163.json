{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Jan-2017", "title": "Parsing Universal Dependencies without training", "abstract": "We propose UDP, the first training-free parser for Universal Dependencies (UD). Our algorithm is based on PageRank and a small set of head attachment rules. It features two-step decoding to guarantee that function words are attached as leaf nodes. The parser requires no training, and it is competitive with a delexicalized transfer system. UDP offers a linguistically sound unsupervised alternative to cross-lingual parsing for UD, which can be used as a baseline for such systems. The parser has very few parameters and is distinctly robust to domain change across languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 20:56:29 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03163v1", "EACL 2017, 8+2 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "EACL 2017, 8+2 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["h\\'ector mart\\'inez alonso", "\\v{z}eljko agi\\'c", "barbara plank", "anders s{\\o}gaard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.03163"}
