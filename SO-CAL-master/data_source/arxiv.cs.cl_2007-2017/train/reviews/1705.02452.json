The present paper describes the model of pronunciation lexicon of Hindi developed to automatically generate the output forms of Hindi at two levels, the &lt;phoneme&gt; and the &lt;PS&gt; (PS, in short for Prosodic Structure). The latter level involves both syllable-division and stress placement. The paper describes the tool developed for generating the two-level outputs of lexica in Hindi.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 May 2017 06:35:58 GMT  (521kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02452v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pramod pandey", "somnath roy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02452"}
