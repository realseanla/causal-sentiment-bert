In our view, while urban legends represent a form of \"sticky\" deceptive text, they are marked by a tension between the credible and incredible. They should be credible like a news article and incredible like a fairy tale to go viral. In particular we will focus on the idea that urban legends should mimic the details of news (who, where, when) to be credible, while they should be emotional and readable like a fairy tale to be catchy and memorable. Using NLP tools we will provide a quantitative analysis of these prototypical characteristics. We also lay out some machine learning experiments showing that it is possible to recognize an urban legend using just these simple features.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 17:33:28 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06081v1", "Preprint of paper in Journal of Information Processing and Management Volume 52, Issue 1, January 2016, Pages 163-172"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint of paper in Journal of Information Processing and Management Volume 52, Issue 1, January 2016, Pages 163-172", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["marco guerini", "carlo strapparava"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06081"}
