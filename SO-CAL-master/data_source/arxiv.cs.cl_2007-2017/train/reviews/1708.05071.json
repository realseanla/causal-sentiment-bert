Compared to a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short-Term-Memory (CNN-LSTM), our proposed 3D CNNs simultaneously extract short-term and long-term spectral features with a moderate number of parameters. We evaluated our proposed and other state-of-the-art methods in a speaker-independent manner using aggregated corpora that give a large and diverse set of speakers. We found that 1) shallow temporal and moderately deep spectral kernels of a homogeneous architecture are optimal for the task; and 2) our 3D CNNs are more effective for spectro-temporal feature learning compared to other methods. Finally, we visualised the feature space obtained with our proposed method using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (T-SNE) and could observe distinct clusters of emotions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:32:06 GMT  (456kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05071v1", "ACII, 2017, San Antonio"]], "COMMENTS": "ACII, 2017, San Antonio", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["jaebok kim", "khiet p truong", "gwenn englebienne", "vanessa evers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05071"}
