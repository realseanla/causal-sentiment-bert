We propose a method for multi-domain dialogue policy learning---termed NDQN, and apply it to an information-seeking spoken dialogue system in the domains of restaurants and hotels. Experimental results comparing DQN (baseline) versus NDQN (proposed) using simulations report that our proposed method exhibits better scalability and is promising for optimising the behaviour of multi-domain dialogue systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 07:53:22 GMT  (705kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08675v1", "NIPS Workshop on Deep Reinforcement Learning, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS Workshop on Deep Reinforcement Learning, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["heriberto cuay\\'ahuitl", "seunghak yu", "ashley williamson", "jacob carse"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08675"}
