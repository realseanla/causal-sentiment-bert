In MT, the widely used approach is to apply word based language model (LM) which considers the constituent units of a sentence as words. In speech recognition (SR), some phrase based LM have been proposed. However, those LMs are not necessarily suitable or optimal for reordering. We propose two phrase based LMs which considers the constituent units of a sentence as phrases. Experiments show that our phrase based LMs outperform the word based LM with the respect of perplexity and n-best list re-ranking.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 15:48:28 GMT  (790kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05203v1", "supplementary material ofthis http URL"], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 11:40:46 GMT  (790kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05203v2", "supplementary material ofthis http URLThis version is identical to the thesis of Geliang Chen"], ["v3", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 07:55:39 GMT  (790kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05203v3", "supplementary material ofthis http URLThis version is identical to the Bachelor thesis of Geliang Chen archived on the 20th June 2013 in Peking University.
