The objective of this study was to quantitatively measure the extent at which speech recognition methods can distinguish between similar sounding vowels. In particular, the phonemes /\\textipa{@}/, /{\\ae}/, /\\textipa{A}:/ and /\\textipa{2}/ were analysed. 748 sound files from the corpus were used and subjected to Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to compute their formants, and to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) algorithm, to compute the cepstral coefficients. A Decision Tree Classifier was used to build a predictive model that learnt the patterns of the two first formants measured in the data set, as well as the patterns of the 13 cepstral coefficients. An accuracy of 70\\% was achieved using formants for the mentioned phonemes. For the MFCC analysis an accuracy of 52 \\% was achieved and an accuracy of 71\\% when /\\textipa{@}/ was ignored. The results obtained show that the studied algorithms are far from mimicking the ability of distinguishing subtle differences in sounds like human hearing does.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:31:03 GMT  (824kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07071v1", "11 pages, pre-print version"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, pre-print version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SD", "authors": ["keith y patarroyo", "vladimir vargas-calder\\'on"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07071"}
