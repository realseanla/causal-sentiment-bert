To design a system that is capable of emulating human-like interactions, a conversational layer that can serve as a fabric for chat-like interaction with the agent is needed. In this paper, we introduce a model that employs Information Retrieval by utilizing convolutional deep structured semantic neural network-based features in the ranker to present human-like responses in ongoing conversation with a user. In conversations, accounting for context is critical to the retrieval model; we show that our context-sensitive approach using a Convolutional Deep Structured Semantic Model (cDSSM) with character trigrams significantly outperforms several conventional baselines in terms of the relevance of responses retrieved.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 19:55:24 GMT  (574kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07056v1", "5 pages, Neu-IR'16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval, July 21, 2016, Pisa, Italy"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, Neu-IR'16 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval, July 21, 2016, Pisa, Italy", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["abhay prakash", "chris brockett", "puneet agrawal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07056"}
