In this paper we extend these methods by embedding a measure of semantic similarity based on a human curated taxonomy into a second--order vector representation. This results in a measure of semantic relatedness that combines both the contextual information available in a corpus--based vector space representation with the semantic knowledge found in a biomedical ontology. Our results show that embedding semantic semantic similarity into a second order co--occurrence matrix improves correlation with human judgments for both similarity and relatedness.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 11:44:17 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00559v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 27 May 2017 00:23:06 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00559v2", "10 pages, Appears in the Proceedings of the 16th Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing (BioNLP-2017), August 2017, Vancouver, BC"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bridget t mcinnes", "ted pedersen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00559"}
