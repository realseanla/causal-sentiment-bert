{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Nov-2015", "title": "Spoken Language Translation for Polish", "abstract": "Spoken language translation (SLT) is becoming more important in the increasingly globalized world, both from a social and economic point of view. It is one of the major challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT), driving intense research activities in these areas. While past research in SLT, due to technology limitations, dealt mostly with speech recorded under controlled conditions, today's major challenge is the translation of spoken language as it can be found in real life. Considered application scenarios range from portable translators for tourists, lectures and presentations translation, to broadcast news and shows with live captioning. We would like to present PJIIT's experiences in the SLT gained from the Eu-Bridge 7th framework project and the U-Star consortium activities for the Polish/English language pair. Presented research concentrates on ASR adaptation for Polish (state-of-the-art acoustic models: DBN-BLSTM training, Kaldi: LDA+MLLT+SAT+MMI), language modeling for ASR &amp; MT (text normalization, RNN-based LMs, n-gram model domain interpolation) and statistical translation techniques (hierarchical models, factored translation models, automatic casing and punctuation, comparable and bilingual corpora preparation). While results for the well-defined domains (phrases for travelers, parliament speeches, medical documentation, movie subtitling) are very encouraging, less defined domains (presentation, lectures) still form a challenge. Our progress in the IWSLT TED task (MT only) will be presented, as well as current progress in the Polish ASR.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 16:28:16 GMT  (635kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07788v1", "Marasek K., Wo{\\l}k K., Korzinek D., Brocki {\\L}., Spoken Language Translation for Polish, Proceedings of Forum Acuscticum 2014, Krak\\'ow. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.08909"]], "COMMENTS": "Marasek K., Wo{\\l}k K., Korzinek D., Brocki {\\L}., Spoken Language Translation for Polish, Proceedings of Forum Acuscticum 2014, Krak\\'ow. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.08909", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["krzysztof marasek", "{\\l}ukasz brocki", "danijel korzinek", "krzysztof wo{\\l}k", "ryszard gubrynowicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07788"}
