Our strongest sequence-to-sequence model improves over our strongest phrase-based statistical machine translation model, with access to the same data, by 6 M2 (0.5 GLEU) points. Additionally, in the data environment of the standard CoNLL-2014 setup, we demonstrate that modeling (and tuning against) diffs yields similar or better M2 scores with simpler models and/or significantly less data than previous sequence-to-sequence approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 22:50:55 GMT  (33kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09067v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["allen schmaltz", "yoon kim", "alexander m rush", "stuart m shieber"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.09067"}
