We propose a state of the art technique to extract information from texts and provide different representations, giving first a static overview of the domain and then a dynamic representation of its main evolutions. We show that this strategy provides a practical solution to some recent theories in social sciences that are facing a lack of methods and tools to automatically extract information from natural language texts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 01:34:22 GMT  (1834kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4211v1", "Technical paper describing the Lattice submission to the 2014 PoliInformatics Unshared task"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical paper describing the Lattice submission to the 2014 PoliInformatics Unshared task", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["pierre bourreau", "thierry poibeau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4211"}
