This paper deals with sentence-level sentiment classification. Though a variety of neural network models have been proposed very recently, however, previous models either depend on expensive phrase-level annotation, whose performance drops substantially when trained with only sentence-level annotation; or do not fully employ linguistic resources (e.g., sentiment lexicons, negation words, intensity words), thus not being able to produce linguistically coherent representations. In this paper, we propose simple models trained with sentence-level annotation, but also attempt to generating linguistically coherent representations by employing regularizers that model the linguistic role of sentiment lexicons, negation words, and intensity words. Results show that our models are effective to capture the sentiment shifting effect of sentiment, negation, and intensity words, while still obtain competitive results without sacrificing the models' simplicity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Nov 2016 03:55:10 GMT  (741kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03949v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 18:29:58 GMT  (825kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03949v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["qiao qian", "minlie huang", "jinhao lei", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.03949"}
