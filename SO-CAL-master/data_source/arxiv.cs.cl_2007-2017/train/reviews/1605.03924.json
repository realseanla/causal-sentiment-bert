The framework allows to compute meaningful semantic relatedness between entities and categories.~Compared with the previous state of the art, our framework can handle both single-word concepts and multiple-word concepts with superior performance in concept categorization and semantic relatedness.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 18:45:18 GMT  (1676kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03924v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 May 2016 01:04:25 GMT  (1676kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03924v2", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yuezhang li", "ronghuo zheng", "tian tian", "zhiting hu", "rahul iyer", "katia sycara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.03924"}
