In order to train parsers on other languages, we propose a method based on annotation projection, which involves exploiting annotations in a source language and a parallel corpus of the source language and a target language. Using English as the source language, we show promising results for Italian, Spanish, German and Chinese as target languages. Besides evaluating the target parsers on non-gold datasets, we further propose an evaluation method that exploits the English gold annotations and does not require access to gold annotations for the target languages. This is achieved by inverting the projection process: a new English parser is learned from the target language parser and evaluated on the existing English gold standard.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 20:41:27 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04539v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco damonte", "shay b cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04539"}
