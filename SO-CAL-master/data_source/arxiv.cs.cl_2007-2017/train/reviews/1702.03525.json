Much of the previous work was further constrained to considering linguistic prior on the source side. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model, called NMT+RG, that learns to parse and translate by combining the recurrent neural network grammar into the attention-based neural machine translation. Our approach encourages the neural machine translation model to incorporate linguistic prior during training, and lets it translate on its own afterward. Extensive experiments with four language pairs show the effectiveness of the proposed NMT+RG.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Feb 2017 13:19:03 GMT  (135kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03525v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 16:52:03 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03525v2", "Accepted as a short paper at the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["akiko eriguchi", "yoshimasa tsuruoka", "kyunghyun cho"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.03525"}
