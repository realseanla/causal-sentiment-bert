We propose and evaluate an approach that substantially shrinks the stream of tweets in real-time, and consists of two steps: (i) sub-event detection, which determines if something new has occurred, and (ii) tweet selection, which picks a representative tweet to describe each sub-event. We compare the summaries generated in three languages for all the soccer games in \"Copa America 2011\" to reference live reports offered by Yahoo! Sports journalists. We show that simple text analysis methods which do not involve external knowledge lead to summaries that cover 84% of the sub-events on average, and 100% of key types of sub-events (such as goals in soccer). Our approach should be straightforwardly applicable to other kinds of scheduled events such as other sports, award ceremonies, keynote talks, TV shows, etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Apr 2012 08:58:39 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3731v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["arkaitz zubiaga", "damiano spina", "enrique amig\\'o", "julio gonzalo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3731"}
