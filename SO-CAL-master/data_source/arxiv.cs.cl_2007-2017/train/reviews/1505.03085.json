In our ob-servation on Indonesian social media, for cer-tain topics, people tend to criticize something using sarcasm. Here, we proposed two additional features to detect sarcasm after a common sentiment analysis is conducted. The features are the negativity information and the number of interjection words. We also employed translated SentiWordNet in the sentiment classification. All the classifications were conducted with machine learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the additional features are quite effective in the sarcasm detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 May 2015 16:45:52 GMT  (419kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03085v1", "4 pages; 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages; 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["edwin lunando", "ayu purwarianti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03085"}
