Unlike these language pairs, however, in the majority of scenarios, there is a lack of high quality parallel corpora. In this work, we focus on applying neural machine translation to challenging/low-resource languages such as Chinese and Turkish. In particular, we investigate how to leverage abundant monolingual data for these low-resource translation tasks. Without the use of external alignment tools, we obtained up to a $1.96$ BLEU score improvement with our proposed method compared to the previous best result in Turkish-to-English translation on the IWLST 2014 dataset. On Chinese-to-English translation by using the OpenMT 2015 dataset, we were able to obtain up to a $1.59$ BLEU score improvement over phrase-based and hierarchical phrase-based baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 23:50:04 GMT  (146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03535v1", "9 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 14:05:31 GMT  (159kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03535v2", "9 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["caglar gulcehre", "orhan firat", "kelvin xu", "kyunghyun cho", "loic barrault", "huei-chi lin", "fethi bougares", "holger schwenk", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03535"}
