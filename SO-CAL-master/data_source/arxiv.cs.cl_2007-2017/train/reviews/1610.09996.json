DCR is able to predict answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily focused on predicting single tokens or entities. DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer. Experimental results show that DCR achieves state-of-the-art exact match and F1 scores on the SQuAD dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 16:14:08 GMT  (1507kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09996v1", "Submitted to AAAI"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 17:55:32 GMT  (1507kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09996v2", "Submitted to AAAI"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to AAAI", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yang yu", "wei zhang", "kazi hasan", "mo yu", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09996"}
