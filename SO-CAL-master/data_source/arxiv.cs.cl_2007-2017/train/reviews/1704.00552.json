{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Apr-2017", "title": "A Transition-Based Directed Acyclic Graph Parser for UCCA", "abstract": "We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex semantic units. To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is not supported by any existing parser. Our transition-based parser, which uses a novel transition set and features based on bidirectional LSTMs, has value not just for UCCA parsing: its ability to handle more general graph structures can inform the development of parsers for other semantic DAG structures, and in languages that frequently use discontinuous structures.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 12:40:54 GMT  (43kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00552v1", "16 pages; Accepted as long paper at ACL2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 10:51:51 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00552v2", "16 pages; Accepted as long paper at ACL2017"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages; Accepted as long paper at ACL2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["daniel hershcovich", "omri abend", "ari rappoport"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.00552"}
