In this work, we study the task of identifying products being bought and sold in online cybercrime forums, which exhibits particularly challenging cross-domain effects. We formulate a task that represents a hybrid of slot-filling information extraction and named entity recognition and annotate data from four different forums. Each of these forums constitutes its own \"fine-grained domain\" in that the forums cover different market sectors with different properties, even though all forums are in the broad domain of cybercrime. We characterize these domain differences in the context of a learning-based system: supervised models see decreased accuracy when applied to new forums, and standard techniques for semi-supervised learning and domain adaptation have limited effectiveness on this data, which suggests the need to improve these techniques. We release a dataset of 1,938 annotated posts from across the four forums.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 08:18:12 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09609v1", "To appear at EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["greg durrett", "jonathan k kummerfeld", "taylor berg-kirkpatrick", "rebecca s portnoff", "sadia afroz", "damon mccoy", "kirill levchenko", "vern paxson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.09609"}
