Arabizi is used to present both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) or Arabic dialects. It is commonly used in informal settings such as social networking sites and is often with mixed with English. In this paper we address the problems of: identifying Arabizi in text and converting it to Arabic characters. We used word and sequence-level features to identify Arabizi that is mixed with English. We achieved an identification accuracy of 98.5%. As for conversion, we used transliteration mining with language modeling to generate equivalent Arabic text. We achieved 88.7% conversion accuracy, with roughly a third of errors being spelling and morphological variants of the forms in ground truth.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 08:46:11 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6755v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["kareem darwish"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.6755"}
