Previous work mainly focus on word segmentation for plain Chinese text, in order to develop a Chinese social media processing tool, we need to take the main features of social media into account, whose grammatical structure is not rigorous, and the tendency of using colloquial and Internet terms makes the existing Chinese-processing tools inefficient to obtain good performance on social media.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 24 Oct 2015 02:24:54 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07099v1", "5 pages, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yao yushi", "huang zheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07099"}
