We evaluate our parser on multiple datasets from varied domains and show an absolute improvement of 2% to 6% over the state-of-the-art. Additionally we show that using the most frequent concept gives us a baseline that is stronger than the state-of-the-art for concept prediction. We plan to release our parser for public use.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 18:34:16 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07586v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sudha rao", "yogarshi vyas", "hal daume iii", "philip resnik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07586"}
