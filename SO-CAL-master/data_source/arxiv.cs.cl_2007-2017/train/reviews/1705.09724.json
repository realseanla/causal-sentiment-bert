Collection of labeled conversational audio however, is prohibitively expensive, laborious and error-prone. Furthermore, academic corpora like Fisher English (2004) or Switchboard (1992) are inadequate to train models with sufficient accuracy in the unbounded space of conversational speech. These corpora are also timeworn due to dated acoustic telephony features and the rapid advancement of colloquial vocabulary and idiomatic speech over the last decades. Utilizing the colossal scale of our unlabeled telephony dataset, we propose a technique to construct a modern, high quality conversational speech training corpus on the order of hundreds of millions of utterances (or tens of thousands of hours) for both acoustic and language model training. We describe the data collection, selection and training, evaluating the results of our updated speech recognition system on a test corpus of 7K manually transcribed utterances. We show relative word error rate (WER) reductions of {35%, 19%} on {agent, caller} utterances over our seed model and 5% absolute WER improvements over IBM Watson STT on this conversational speech task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 21:10:15 GMT  (1403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09724v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shane walker", "morten pedersen", "iroro orife", "jason flaks"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09724"}
