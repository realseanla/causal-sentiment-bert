Conventional para- phrase generation methods either leverage hand-written rules and thesauri-based alignments, or use statistical machine learning principles. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore deep learning models for paraphrase generation. Our primary contribution is a stacked residual LSTM network, where we add residual connections between LSTM layers. This allows for efficient training of deep LSTMs. We evaluate our model and other state-of-the-art deep learning models on three different datasets: PPDB, WikiAnswers and MSCOCO. Evaluation results demonstrate that our model outperforms sequence to sequence, attention-based and bi- directional LSTM models on BLEU, METEOR, TER and an embedding-based sentence similarity metric.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 21:01:00 GMT  (1197kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03098v1", "COLING 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 15:02:02 GMT  (1192kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03098v2", "COLING 2016"], ["v3", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 00:37:33 GMT  (1198kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03098v3", "COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aaditya prakash", "sadid a hasan", "kathy lee", "vivek datla", "ashequl qadir", "joey liu", "oladimeji farri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03098"}
