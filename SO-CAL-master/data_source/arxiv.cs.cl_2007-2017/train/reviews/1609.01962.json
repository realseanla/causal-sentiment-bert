Interestingly, one can mine multiple reactions expressed by social media users in those situations, exploring their stance towards rumours, ultimately enabling the flagging of highly disputed rumours as being potentially false. In this work, we set out to develop an automated, supervised classifier that uses multi-task learning to classify the stance expressed in each individual tweet in a rumourous conversation as either supporting, denying or questioning the rumour. Using a classifier based on Gaussian Processes, and exploring its effectiveness on two datasets with very different characteristics and varying distributions of stances, we show that our approach consistently outperforms competitive baseline classifiers. Our classifier is especially effective in estimating the distribution of different types of stance associated with a given rumour, which we set forth as a desired characteristic for a rumour-tracking system that will warn both ordinary users of Twitter and professional news practitioners when a rumour is being rebutted.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 12:33:02 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01962v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["michal lukasik", "kalina bontcheva", "trevor cohn", "arkaitz zubiaga", "maria liakata", "rob procter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01962"}
