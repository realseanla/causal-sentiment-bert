Single N gram tokenization technique works well, however, it often generates stems that start with intermediate characters, rather than initial ones. We present a novel technique that takes the concept of N grams one step ahead and compare our method with an established algorithm in the field Porter's Stemmer. Porters Stemmer is language dependent, and performance of our proposed method is not inferior to it.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 15:32:56 GMT  (401kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4824v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:05:36 GMT  (391kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4824v2", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["b p pande", "pawan tamta", "h s dhami"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4824"}
