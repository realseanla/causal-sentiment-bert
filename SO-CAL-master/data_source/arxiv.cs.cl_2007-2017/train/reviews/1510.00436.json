First, we acknowledge error in failing to acknowledge Liu (2008)'s previous work on corpora of 20 languages with similar aims. A correction will appear in PNAS. Nevertheless, we argue that our work provides novel, strong evidence for dependency length minimization as a universal quantitative property of languages, beyond this previous work, because it provides baselines which focus on word order preferences. Second, we argue that our choices of baselines were appropriate because they control for alternative theories.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 22:09:34 GMT  (213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00436v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["richard futrell", "kyle mahowald", "edward gibson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.00436"}
