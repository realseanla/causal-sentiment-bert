It (i) combines diverse versions of pretrained word embeddings and (ii) extracts features of multigranular phrases with variable-size convolution filters. We also show that pretraining MVCNN is critical for good performance. MVCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four tasks: on small-scale binary, small-scale multi-class and largescale Twitter sentiment prediction and on subjectivity classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 00:25:02 GMT  (516kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04513v1", "in Proceeding of CoNLL2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in Proceeding of CoNLL2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenpeng yin", "hinrich sch\\\"utze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04513"}
