We first present the Residual CCA (R-CCA) method, that complements the standard CCA method by representing, for each modality, the difference between the original signal and the signal projected to the shared, max correlation, space. We then show that constructing visual and textual representations and then post-processing them through composition of common modeling motifs such as PCA, CCA, R-CCA and linear interpolation (a.k.a sequential modeling) yields high quality models. On five standard semantic benchmarks our sequential models outperform recent multimodal representation learning alternatives, including ones that rely on joint representation learning. For two of these benchmarks our R-CCA method is part of the Best configuration our algorithm yields.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 08:11:28 GMT  (49kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08810v1", "6 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 09:59:50 GMT  (50kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08810v2", "6 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hagar loeub", "roi reichart"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08810"}
