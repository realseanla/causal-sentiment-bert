The proposed approach enables a single neural translation model to translate between multiple languages, with a number of parameters that grows only linearly with the number of languages. This is made possible by having a single attention mechanism that is shared across all language pairs. We train the proposed multi-way, multilingual model on ten language pairs from WMT'15 simultaneously and observe clear performance improvements over models trained on only one language pair. In particular, we observe that the proposed model significantly improves the translation quality of low-resource language pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 04:00:50 GMT  (77kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01073v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL stat.ML", "authors": ["orhan firat", "kyunghyun cho", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.01073"}
