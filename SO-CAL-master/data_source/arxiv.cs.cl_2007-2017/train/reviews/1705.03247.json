Prosody phenomena are explored in the domain of higher phonological constituents such as word, phonological phrase and intonational phrase. The study of prosody at the word level is called word prosody and above word level is called sentence prosody. Word Prosody describes stress pattern by comparing the prosodic features of its constituent syllables. Sentence Prosody involves the study on phrasing pattern and intonatonal pattern of a language. The aim of this study is to summarize the existing works on Hindi prosody carried out in different domain of language and speech processing. The review is presented in a systematic fashion so that it could be a useful resource for one who wants to build on the existing works.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 09:35:22 GMT  (121kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03247v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["somnath roy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03247"}
