Performance has further been improved by leveraging unlabeled data, often in the form of a language model. In this work, we present the Cold Fusion method, which leverages a pre-trained language model during training, and show its effectiveness on the speech recognition task. We show that Seq2Seq models with Cold Fusion are able to better utilize language information enjoying i) faster convergence and better generalization, and ii) almost complete transfer to a new domain while using less than 10% of the labeled training data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 21:28:07 GMT  (146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06426v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["anuroop sriram", "heewoo jun", "sanjeev satheesh", "adam coates"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06426"}
