However, most of this research also underlined the importance of benchmark datasets, and the difficulty of constructing these for a variety of language-specific tasks. Still, many of the datasets used in these tasks could prove to be fruitful linguistic resources, allowing for unique observations into language use and variability. In this paper we demonstrate the performance of multiple types of embeddings, created with both count and prediction-based architectures on a variety of corpora, in two language-specific tasks: relation evaluation, and dialect identification. For the latter, we compare unsupervised methods with a traditional, hand-crafted dictionary. With this research, we provide the embeddings themselves, the relation evaluation task benchmark for use in further research, and demonstrate how the benchmarked embeddings prove a useful unsupervised linguistic resource, effectively used in a downstream task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 12:48:35 GMT  (167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00225v1", "in LREC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "in LREC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["st\\'ephan tulkens", "chris emmery", "walter daelemans"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00225"}
