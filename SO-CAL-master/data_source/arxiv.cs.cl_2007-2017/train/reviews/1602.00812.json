{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Feb-2016", "title": "The Grail theorem prover: Type theory for syntax and semantics", "abstract": "As the name suggests, type-logical grammars are a grammar formalism based on logic and type theory. From the prespective of grammar design, type-logical grammars develop the syntactic and semantic aspects of linguistic phenomena hand-in-hand, letting the desired semantics of an expression inform the syntactic type and vice versa. Prototypical examples of the successful application of type-logical grammars to the syntax-semantics interface include coordination, quantifier scope and extraction.This chapter describes the Grail theorem prover, a series of tools for designing and testing grammars in various modern type-logical grammars which functions as a tool . All tools described in this chapter are freely available.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 07:35:02 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00812v1", "Modern Perspectives in Type Theoretical Semantics, Springer, 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 26 Aug 2016 07:04:29 GMT  (82kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00812v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "Modern Perspectives in Type Theoretical Semantics, Springer, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["richard moot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00812"}
