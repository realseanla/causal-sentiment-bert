Our test domain is the history and philosophy of scientific work on animal mind and cognition. We demonstrate an application of our methods to the problem of identifying and extracting arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform resource discovery in this domain, using methods that can be generalized to other interdisciplinary research questions. Through a novel approach of drill-down topic modeling, we are able to reduce a collection of 1,315 fulltext volumes to 6 focal volumes that did not appear in the first ten search results in the HathiTrust digital library. This ultimately supports a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structures to augment the kind of \"close reading\" that leads to novel interpretations at the heart of scholarly work in the humanities, drilling down from massive quantities of text to very specific passages. This multi-level view advances understanding of the intellectual and societal contexts in which writings are interpreted.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 17:36:19 GMT  (476kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01090v1", "23 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 00:22:59 GMT  (1053kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01090v2", "revised, 29 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jaimie murdock", "colin allen", "katy b\\\"orner", "robert light", "simon mcalister", "andrew ravenscroft", "robert rose", "doori rose", "jun otsuka", "david bourget", "john lawrence", "chris reed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01090"}
