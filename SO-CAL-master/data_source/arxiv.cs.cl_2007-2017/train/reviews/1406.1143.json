This is accomplished with a MapReduce implementation of minhash to identify clusters of sentences with high Jaccard similarity. We show that these clusters can be categorized into six different types, two of which are particularly interesting: identical sentences quantify the extent to which content in Wikipedia is copied and pasted, and near-duplicate sentences that state contradictory facts point to quality issues in Wikipedia.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 18:59:00 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1143v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.DL cs.SI", "authors": ["sarah weissman", "samet ayhan", "joshua bradley", "jimmy lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1143"}
