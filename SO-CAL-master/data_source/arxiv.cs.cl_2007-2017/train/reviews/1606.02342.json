Our results show that contrary to the common belief that the number of latent states for each nonterminal in an L-PCFG can be decided in isolation with spectral methods, parsing results significantly improve if the number of latent states for each nonterminal is globally optimized, while taking into account interactions between the different nonterminals. In addition, we contribute an empirical analysis of spectral algorithms on eight morphologically rich languages: Basque, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Korean, Polish and Swedish. Our results show that our estimation consistently performs better or close to coarse-to-fine expectation-maximization techniques for these languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 21:58:41 GMT  (51kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02342v1", "11 pages, ACL 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 08:34:12 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02342v2", "11 pages, ACL 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 13:10:41 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02342v3", "11 pages, ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shashi narayan", "shay b cohen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02342"}
