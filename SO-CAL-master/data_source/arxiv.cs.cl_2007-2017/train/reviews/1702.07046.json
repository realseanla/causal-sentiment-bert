In this work we describe how to automatically generate rich feature sets from simple units called featlets, requiring less engineering. Using information gain to guide the generation process, we train models which rival the state of the art on two standard Semantic Role Labeling datasets with almost no task or linguistic insight.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 23:39:03 GMT  (45kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07046v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["travis wolfe", "mark dredze", "benjamin van durme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07046"}
