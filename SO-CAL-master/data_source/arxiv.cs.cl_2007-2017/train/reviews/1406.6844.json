An important component of GF is its Resource Grammar Library (RGL) that encapsulates the low-level linguistic knowledge about morphology and syntax of currently more than 20 languages facilitating rapid development of multilingual applications. In the ideal case, porting a GF application grammar to a new language would only require introducing the domain lexicon - translation equivalents that are interlinked via common abstract terms. While it is possible for a highly restricted CNL, developing and porting a less restricted CNL requires above average linguistic knowledge about the particular language, and above average GF experience. Specifying a lexicon is mostly straightforward in the case of nouns (incl. multi-word units), however, verbs are the most complex category (in terms of both inflectional paradigms and argument structure), and adding them to a GF application grammar is not a straightforward task. In this paper we are focusing on verbs, investigating the possibility of creating a multilingual FrameNet-based GF library. We propose an extension to the current RGL, allowing GF application developers to define clauses on the semantic level, thus leaving the language-specific syntactic mapping to this extension. We demonstrate our approach by reengineering the MOLTO Phrasebook application grammar.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 11:14:44 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6844v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["normunds gruzitis", "peteris paikens", "guntis barzdins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6844"}
