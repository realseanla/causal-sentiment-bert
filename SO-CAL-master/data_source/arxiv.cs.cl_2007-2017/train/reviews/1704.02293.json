Two algorithms come from the state of the art, a Simulated Annealing Algorithm (SAA) and a Genetic Algorithm (GA) as well as two algorithms that we first adapt from WSD that are state of the art probabilistic search algorithms, namely a Cuckoo search algorithm (CSA) and a Bat Search algorithm (BS). As WSD requires to evaluate exponentially many word sense combinations (with branching factors of up to 6 or more), probabilistic algorithms allow to find approximate solution in a tractable time by sampling the search space. We find that CSA, GA and SA all eventually converge to similar results (0.98 F1 score), but CSA gets there faster (in fewer scorer calls) and reaches up to 0.95 F1 before SA in fewer scorer calls. In BA a strict convergence criterion prevents it from reaching above 0.89 F1.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 17:04:51 GMT  (1725kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02293v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lo\\\"ic vial", "andon tchechmedjiev", "didier schwab"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02293"}
