An alternative is the recurrent neural tensor network (RNTN), which increases capacity by employing distinct hidden layer weights for each vocabulary word. The disadvantage of RNTNs is that memory usage scales linearly with vocabulary size, which can reach millions for word-level language models. In this paper, we introduce restricted recurrent neural tensor networks (r-RNTN) which reserve distinct hidden layer weights for frequent vocabulary words while sharing a single set of weights for infrequent words. Perplexity evaluations using the Penn Treebank corpus show that r-RNTNs improve language model performance over standard RNNs using only a small fraction of the parameters of unrestricted RNTNs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 19:17:58 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00774v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 02:59:14 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00774v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexandre salle", "aline villavicencio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00774"}
