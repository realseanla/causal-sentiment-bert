Reference strings are scored for quality by human raters on a scale of [-1, +1] to weight multi-reference BLEU. In tasks involving generation of conversational responses, deltaBLEU correlates reasonably with human judgments and outperforms sentence-level and IBM BLEU in terms of both Spearman's who and Kendall's tau.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 05:24:53 GMT  (54kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06863v1", "To appear at ACL 2015, 6 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 01:09:50 GMT  (54kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06863v2", "6 pages, to appear at ACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at ACL 2015, 6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michel galley", "chris brockett", "alessandro sordoni", "yangfeng ji", "michael auli", "chris quirk", "margaret mitchell", "jianfeng gao", "bill dolan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.06863"}
