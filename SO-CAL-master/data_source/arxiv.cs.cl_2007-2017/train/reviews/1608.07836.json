As soon as we apply our technologies to the real world, performance drops. The reason for this problem is obvious: NLP models are trained on samples from a limited set of canonical varieties that are considered standard, most prominently English newswire. However, there are many dimensions, e.g., socio-demographics, language, genre, sentence type, etc. on which texts can differ from the standard. The solution is not obvious: we cannot control for all factors, and it is not clear how to best go beyond the current practice of training on homogeneous data from a single domain and language.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 17:51:41 GMT  (241kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07836v1", "KONVENS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "KONVENS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["barbara plank"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07836"}
