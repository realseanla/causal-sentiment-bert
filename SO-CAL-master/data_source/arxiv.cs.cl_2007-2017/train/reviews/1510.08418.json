Unfortunately, dependence on ILP may make the compressor prohibitively slow, and thus approximation techniques have been proposed which are often complex and offer a moderate gain in speed. As an alternative solution, we introduce a novel compression algorithm which generates k-best compressions relying on local deletion decisions. Our algorithm is two orders of magnitude faster than a recent ILP-based method while producing better compressions. Moreover, an extensive evaluation demonstrates that the quality of compressions does not degrade much as we move from single best to top-five results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 19:04:30 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08418v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["katja filippova", "enrique alfonseca"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08418"}
