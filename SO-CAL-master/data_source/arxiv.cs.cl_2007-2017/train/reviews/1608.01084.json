Exploiting Dependency Word Pairs for Reordering in Statistical Machine Translation", "abstract": "Reordering poses a major challenge in machine translation (MT) between two languages with significant differences in word order. In this paper, we present a novel reordering approach utilizing sparse features based on dependency word pairs. Each instance of these features captures whether two words, which are related by a dependency link in the source sentence dependency parse tree, follow the same order or are swapped in the translation output. Experiments on Chinese-to-English translation show a statistically significant improvement of 1.21 BLEU point using our approach, compared to a state-of-the-art statistical MT system that incorporates prior reordering approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 06:24:01 GMT  (2718kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.01084v1", "7 pages, 1 figures, Proceedings of AAAI-16"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figures, Proceedings of AAAI-16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["christian hadiwinoto", "yang liu", "hwee tou ng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.01084"}
