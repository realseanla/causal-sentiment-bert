{"conference": "HLT-NAACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Jan-2016", "title": "Learning to Compose Neural Networks for Question Answering", "abstract": "We describe a question answering model that applies to both images and structured knowledge bases. The model uses natural language strings to automatically assemble neural networks from a collection of composable modules. Parameters for these modules are learned jointly with network-assembly parameters via reinforcement learning, with only (world, question, answer) triples as supervision. Our approach, which we term a dynamic neural model network, achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets in both visual and structured domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 21:21:59 GMT  (4810kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01705v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 18:20:37 GMT  (5947kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01705v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 01:44:25 GMT  (7152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01705v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 23:25:51 GMT  (7293kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01705v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["jacob andreas", "marcus rohrbach", "trevor darrell", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.01705"}
