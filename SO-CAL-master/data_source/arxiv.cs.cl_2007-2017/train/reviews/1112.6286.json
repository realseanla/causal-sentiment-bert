The techniques are discussed in the various theoretical contexts of (i) linguistics (e.g., Latent Semantic Analysis), (ii) sociocybernetics and social systems theory (e.g., the communication of meaning), and (iii) communication studies (e.g., framing and agenda-setting). We distinguish between the communication of information in the network space (social network analysis) and the communication of meaning in the vector space. The vector space can be considered a generated as an architecture by the network of relations in the network space; words are then not only related, but also positioned. These positions are expected rather than observed and therefore one can communicate meaning. Knowledge can be generated when these meanings can recursively be communicated and therefore also further codified.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 11:47:05 GMT  (1585kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6286v1", "Forthcoming in: Manuel Mora, Ovsei Gelman, Annette Steenkamp, and Maresh S.
