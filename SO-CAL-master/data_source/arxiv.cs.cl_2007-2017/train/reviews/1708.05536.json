However impressive, the evaluation of neurally generated text has so far remained rather informal and anecdotal. Here, we present an attempt at the systematic assessment of one aspect of the quality of neurally generated text. We focus on a specific aspect of neural language generation: its ability to reproduce authorial writing styles. Using established models for authorship attribution, we empirically assess the stylistic qualities of neurally generated text. In comparison to conventional language models, neural models generate fuzzier text that is relatively harder to attribute correctly. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that neurally generated text offers more valuable perspectives for the augmentation of training data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 08:43:52 GMT  (192kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05536v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["e manjavacas", "j de gussem", "w daelemans", "m kestemont"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05536"}
