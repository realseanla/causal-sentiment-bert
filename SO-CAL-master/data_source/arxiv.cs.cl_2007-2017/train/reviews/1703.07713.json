In some scenarios, however, researchers can only obtain text, and do not have access to raw audio signals. Moreover, with the increasing need of deep semantic processing, text-based dialogue understanding is attracting more attention in the community. These raise the problem of text-based speaker change detection. In this paper, we formulate the task as a matching problem of utterances before and after a certain decision point; we propose a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) with static sentence-level attention. Our model comprises three main components: a sentence encoder with a long short term memory (LSTM)-based RNN, a context encoder with another LSTM-RNN, and a static sentence-level attention mechanism, which allows rich information interaction. Experimental results show that neural networks consistently achieve better performance than feature-based approaches, and that our attention-based model significantly outperforms non-attention neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:42:28 GMT  (948kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07713v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhao meng", "lili mou", "zhi jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07713"}
