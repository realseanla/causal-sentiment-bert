Our model is based on synchronous tree substitution grammar, a formalism that allows local distortion of the tree topology and can thus naturally capture structural mismatches. We describe an algorithm for decoding in this framework and show how the model can be trained discriminatively within a large margin framework. Experimental results on sentence compression bring significant improvements over a state-of-the-art model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:19:15 GMT  (376kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5693v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["trevor anthony cohn", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5693"}
