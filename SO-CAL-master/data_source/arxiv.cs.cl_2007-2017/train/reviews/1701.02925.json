Our Question analysis uses several techniques to analyze any question given in natural language: a Stanford POS Tagger &amp; parser for Arabic language, a named entity recognizer, tokenizer,Stop-word removal, Question expansion, Question classification and Question focus extraction components. We employ numerous detection rules and trained classifier using features from this analysis to detect important elements of the question, including: 1) the portion of the question that is a referring to the answer (the focus); 2) different terms in the question that identify what type of entity is being asked for (the lexical answer types); 3) Question expansion ; 4) a process of classifying the question into one or more of several and different types; and We describe how these elements are identified and evaluate the effect of accurate detection on our question-answering system using the Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR) accuracy measure.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 11:12:24 GMT  (379kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02925v1", "10 pages, 3 figures, published article in IJNLC"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 3 figures, published article in IJNLC", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["waheeb ahmed", "dr anto p babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02925"}
