However their modelling formulation is overly simplistic, and omits several key inductive biases built into traditional models. In this paper we extend the attentional neural translation model to include structural biases from word based alignment models, including positional bias, Markov conditioning, fertility and agreement over translation directions. We show improvements over a baseline attentional model and standard phrase-based model over several language pairs, evaluating on difficult languages in a low resource setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 06:03:17 GMT  (1408kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01085v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["trevor cohn", "cong duy vu hoang", "ekaterina vymolova", "kaisheng yao", "chris dyer", "gholamreza haffari"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.01085"}
