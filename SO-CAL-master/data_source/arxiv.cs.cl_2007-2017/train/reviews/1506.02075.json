This paper studies the impact of multitask and transfer learning for simple question answering; a setting for which the reasoning required to answer is quite easy, as long as one can retrieve the correct evidence given a question, which can be difficult in large-scale conditions. To this end, we introduce a new dataset of 100k questions that we use in conjunction with existing benchmarks. We conduct our study within the framework of Memory Networks (Weston et al., 2015) because this perspective allows us to eventually scale up to more complex reasoning, and show that Memory Networks can be successfully trained to achieve excellent performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 21:48:39 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02075v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["antoine bordes", "nicolas usunier", "sumit chopra", "jason weston"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02075"}
