However, it has mostly focused on generating short and repetitive answers, mostly single words, which fall short of rich linguistic capabilities of humans. We introduce Full-Sentence Visual Question Answering (FSVQA) dataset, consisting of nearly 1 million pairs of questions and full-sentence answers for images, built by applying a number of rule-based natural language processing techniques to original VQA dataset and captions in the MS COCO dataset. This poses many additional complexities to conventional VQA task, and we provide a baseline for approaching and evaluating the task, on top of which we invite the research community to build further improvements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 18:12:04 GMT  (6458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06657v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL", "authors": ["andrew shin", "yoshitaka ushiku", "tatsuya harada"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06657"}
