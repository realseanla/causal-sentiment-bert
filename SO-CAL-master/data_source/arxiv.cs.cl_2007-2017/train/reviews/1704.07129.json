{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Apr-2017", "title": "An Analysis of Action Recognition Datasets for Language and Vision Tasks", "abstract": "A large amount of recent research has focused on tasks that combine language and vision, resulting in a proliferation of datasets and methods. One such task is action recognition, whose applications include image annotation, scene under- standing and image retrieval. In this survey, we categorize the existing ap- proaches based on how they conceptualize this problem and provide a detailed review of existing datasets, highlighting their di- versity as well as advantages and disad- vantages. We focus on recently devel- oped datasets which link visual informa- tion with linguistic resources and provide a fine-grained syntactic and semantic anal- ysis of actions in images.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 10:38:23 GMT  (332kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07129v1", "To appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, 8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of ACL 2017, 8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["spandana gella", "frank keller"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07129"}
