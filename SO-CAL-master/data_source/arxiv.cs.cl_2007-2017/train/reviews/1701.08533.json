The aligned labels for examples are obtained using IBM Model. We adapt a baseline semi-supervised CRF by defining new feature set and altering the label propagation algorithm. Our results demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves the performance of the supervised model by utilizing the knowledge gained from the graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 10:28:49 GMT  (411kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08533v1", "Workshop of The Australasian Language Technology Association"]], "COMMENTS": "Workshop of The Australasian Language Technology Association", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mohammad aliannejadi", "masoud kiaeeha", "shahram khadivi", "saeed shiry ghidary"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08533"}
