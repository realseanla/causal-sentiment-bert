This distinctive use of emoji removes textual context, and leads to a varying translation quality. In this paper, we use statistical word alignment and part-of-speech tagging to explore how people use emoji. Despite these simple methods, we observed differences in token and part-of-speech distributions. Experiments also suggest that semantics are preserved in the translation, and repetition is more common in emoji.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 12:51:22 GMT  (254kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02027v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["will radford", "andrew chisholm", "ben hachey", "bo han"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02027"}
