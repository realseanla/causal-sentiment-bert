In this paper, we propose to exploit structural regularities in language in different domains, and train semantic parsers over multiple knowledge-bases (KBs), while sharing information across datasets. We find that we can substantially improve parsing accuracy by training a single sequence-to-sequence model over multiple KBs, when providing an encoding of the domain at decoding time. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Overnight dataset (containing eight domains), improves performance over a single KB baseline from 75.6% to 79.6%, while obtaining a 7x reduction in the number of model parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 11:22:15 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01569v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 08:34:47 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01569v2", "Accepted to ACL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jonathan herzig", "jonathan berant"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.01569"}
