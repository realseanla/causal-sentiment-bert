Political footprints are vector space models (VSMs) applied to political discourse. Each of their vectors represents a word, and is produced by training the English lexicon on large text corpora. This paper presents a simple implementation of political footprints, some heuristics on how to use them, and their application to four cases: the U.N. Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, and two U.S. presidential elections. The reader will be offered a number of reasons to believe that political footprints produce meaningful results, along with some suggestions on how to improve their implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 21:29:08 GMT  (993kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06353v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["christophe bruchansky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06353"}
