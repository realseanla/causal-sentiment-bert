Our approach is motivated by the observation that complex syntactic structures and related phenomena, such as nested subordinations and nominal predicates, are not handled well by existing models. Our model treats such instances as sub-sequences of lexicalized dependency paths and learns suitable embedding representations. We experimentally demonstrate that such embeddings can improve results over previous state-of-the-art semantic role labelers, and showcase qualitative improvements obtained by our method.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 15:54:48 GMT  (38kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07515v1", "Accepted at ACL 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 09:08:51 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07515v2", "Camera-ready ACL paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["michael roth", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07515"}
