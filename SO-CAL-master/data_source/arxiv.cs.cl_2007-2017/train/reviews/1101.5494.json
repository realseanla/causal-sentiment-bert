In this paper we present an approach for Arabic morphological analysis. This approach is based on Arabic morphological automaton (AMAUT). The proposed technique uses a morphological database realized using XMODEL language. Arabic morphology represents a special type of morphological systems because it is based on the concept of scheme to represent Arabic words. We use this concept to develop the Arabic morphological automata. The proposed approach has development standardization aspect. It can be exploited by NLP applications such as syntactic and semantic analysis, information retrieval, machine translation and orthographical correction. The proposed approach is compared with Xerox Arabic Analyzer and Smrz Arabic Analyzer.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 09:58:39 GMT  (705kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5494v1", "18 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mourad gridach", "noureddine chenfour"], "accepted": false, "id": "1101.5494"}
