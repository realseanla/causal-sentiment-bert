We apply our methods to construct Wordnets in French and Russian, languages which both lack good manual constructions.1 These are evaluated on two new 600-word test sets for word-to-synset matching and found to improve greatly upon synset recall, outperforming the best automated Wordnets in F-score. Our methods require very few linguistic resources, thus being applicable for Wordnet construction in low-resources languages, and may further be applied to sense clustering and other Wordnet improvements.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 17:50:02 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00217v1", "17 pages, 3 figures, In Submission"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 3 figures, In Submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["mikhail khodak", "rej risteski", "christiane fellbaum", "sanjeev arora"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00217"}
