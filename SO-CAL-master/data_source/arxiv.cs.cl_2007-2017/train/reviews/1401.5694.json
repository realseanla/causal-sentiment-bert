We propose a general framework that is based on annotation projection, phrased as a graph optimization problem. It is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to reduce the human effort involved in creating role-semantic resources. Within this framework, we present projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic information. We provide an experimental evaluation on an English-German parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing high-precision German semantic role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated English data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:40:37 GMT  (327kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5694v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sebastian pado", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5694"}
