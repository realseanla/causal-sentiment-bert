(to undress* an apple). SLAM calculates a conventional solution for these productions. To carry on it, SLAM has to intersect the paradigmatic axis of the metaphorical verb ?d\\'eshabiller*?, where ?peler? (?to peel?) comes closer, with a syntagmatic axis that comes from a corpus where ?peler une pomme? (to peel an apple) is semantically and syntactically regular. We test this model on DicoSyn, which is a ?small world? network of synonyms, to compute the paradigmatic axis and on Frantext.20, a French corpus, to compute the syntagmatic axis. Further, we evaluate the model with a sample of an experimental corpus of the database of Flexsem", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2010 16:27:36 GMT  (1236kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.4820v1", "30 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yann desalle", "bruno gaume", "karine duvignau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.4820"}
