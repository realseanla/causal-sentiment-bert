With our representation learning models, the entity search query, named entity and description can be represented as low-dimensional vectors. Our goal is to develop a simple but effective model that can make the distributed representations of query related entities similar to the query in the vector space. Hence, we propose three kinds of learning strategies, and the difference between them mainly lies in how to deal with the relationship between an entity and its description. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each learning strategy and validate our methods on public datasets which contain four kinds of named entities, i.e., movies, TV shows, restaurants and celebrities. The experimental results indicate that our proposed methods can adapt to different types of entity search queries, and outperform the current state-of-the-art methods based on keyword matching and vanilla word2vec models. Besides, the proposed methods can be trained fast and be easily extended to other similar tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 06:33:33 GMT  (1954kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09091v1", "submitted to WWW2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 02:19:01 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09091v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author because the proposed model need to be re-evaluate"], ["v3", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 13:57:23 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09091v3", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author because the proposed model need to be re-evaluate"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to WWW2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shijia e", "yang xiang", "mohan zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09091"}
