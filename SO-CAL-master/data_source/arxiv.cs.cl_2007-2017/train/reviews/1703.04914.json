The task aims to assign a relevance score for each pair of entities and their types in a knowledge base in order to enhance the ranking results in entity retrieval tasks. We propose an approach wherein the outputs of multiple neural network classifiers are combined using a supervised machine learning model. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in one out of three measures, and performs competitively in the other two measures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 04:00:27 GMT  (44kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04914v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 13:58:02 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04914v2", "WSDM Cup 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["ikuya yamada", "motoki sato", "hiroyuki shindo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.04914"}
