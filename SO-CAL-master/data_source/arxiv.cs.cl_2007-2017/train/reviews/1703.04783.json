Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture solves the dynamic time alignment problem, allowing joint end-to-end training of the acoustic and language modeling components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end framework to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech benchmarks (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system outperformed the attention-based baseline with input from a conventional adaptive beamformer.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Mar 2017 22:28:51 GMT  (2107kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04783v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["tsubasa ochiai", "shinji watanabe", "takaaki hori", "john r hershey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.04783"}
