We constructed a large-scale Chinese language dataset, and the result shows that character-level convolutional neural network works better on Chinese corpus than its corresponding pinyin format dataset. This is the first time that character-level convolutional neural network applied to text classification problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 12:24:27 GMT  (1953kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04358v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 14:41:23 GMT  (1953kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04358v2", "MSc Thesis, 44 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["weijie huang", "jun wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04358"}
