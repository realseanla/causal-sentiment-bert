{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Apr-2017", "title": "Taxonomy Induction using Hypernym Subsequences", "abstract": "We propose a novel, semi-supervised approach towards domain taxonomy induction from an input vocabulary of seed terms. Unlike most previous approaches, which typically extract direct hypernym edges for terms, our approach utilizes a novel probabilistic framework to extract hypernym subsequences. Taxonomy induction from extracted subsequences is cast as an instance of the minimum-cost flow problem on a carefully designed directed graph. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art taxonomy induction approaches across four languages. Furthermore, we show that our approach is robust to the presence of noise in the input vocabulary.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 10:49:53 GMT  (432kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07626v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 5 May 2017 17:03:17 GMT  (432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07626v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 26 May 2017 14:42:59 GMT  (2114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07626v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 20:34:26 GMT  (2657kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07626v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["amit gupta", "r\\'emi lebret", "hamza harkous", "karl aberer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07626"}
