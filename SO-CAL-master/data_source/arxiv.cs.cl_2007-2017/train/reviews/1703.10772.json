These strategies are not constrained by in-domain annotations, rather they leverage pre-existing monolingual annotated resources for training. We show that these methods can produce significantly better results as compared to an informed baseline. Besides, we also present a data set of 450 Hindi and English code-mixed tweets of Hindi multilingual speakers for evaluation. The data set is manually annotated with Universal Dependencies.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 07:10:30 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10772v1", "5 pages, EACL 2017 short paper"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, EACL 2017 short paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["irshad ahmad bhat", "riyaz ahmad bhat", "manish shrivastava", "dipti misra sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10772"}
