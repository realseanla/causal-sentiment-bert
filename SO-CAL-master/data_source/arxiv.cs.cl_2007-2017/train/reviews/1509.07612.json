This paper provides a new perspective on Twitter Sentiment Analysis by highlighting the necessity of explicitly incorporating uncertainty. Moreover, a dataset of high quality to evaluate solutions for this new problem is introduced and made publicly available.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 07:55:26 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07612v1", "3 pages, 1 figure, accepted at GSCL '15"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 1 figure, accepted at GSCL '15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["nils haldenwang", "oliver vornberger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.07612"}
