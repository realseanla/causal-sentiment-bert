While most successful neural approaches to this problem rely on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), training RNNs over long documents can be prohibitively slow. We present a novel framework for question answering that can efficiently scale to longer documents while maintaining or even improving performance. Our approach combines a coarse, inexpensive model for selecting one or more relevant sentences and a more expensive RNN that produces the answer from those sentences. A central challenge is the lack of intermediate supervision for the coarse model, which we address using reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on a challenging subset of the WIKIREADING dataset(Hewlett et al., 2016) and on a newly-gathered dataset, while reducing the number of sequential RNN steps by 88% against a standard sequence to sequence model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Nov 2016 20:24:40 GMT  (1598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01839v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 07:42:34 GMT  (856kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01839v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["eunsol choi", "daniel hewlett", "alexandre lacoste", "illia polosukhin", "jakob uszkoreit", "jonathan berant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01839"}
