The work aims to analyze whether and where we can identify the boundary between semantics and pragmatics in the software used by analyzed systems. examining how the linguistic disciplines are fundamental in their progress. Is it possible to assume that the tools of social intelligence have a pragmatic approach to the questions of the user, or it is just a use of a very rich vocabulary, with the use of semantic tools?", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 10:40:59 GMT  (233kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0087v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.HC", "authors": ["fabrizio m a lolli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.0087"}
