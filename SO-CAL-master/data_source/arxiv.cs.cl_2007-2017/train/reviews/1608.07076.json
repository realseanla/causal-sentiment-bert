The generator is based on recurrent neural networks and the sequence-to-sequence approach. It is fully trainable from data which include preceding context along with responses to be generated. We show that the context-aware generator yields significant improvements over the baseline in both automatic metrics and a human pairwise preference test.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 10:43:56 GMT  (125kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07076v1", "Accepted as a short paper for SIGDIAL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a short paper for SIGDIAL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ond\\v{r}ej du\\v{s}ek", "filip jur\\v{c}\\'i\\v{c}ek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07076"}
