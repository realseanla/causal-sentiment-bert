However, learning and classifying tonal patterns has been a challenging task for automatic speech recognition and for models of tonal representation, as tonal contours are characterized by significant variation. This paper provides a classification model of Cypriot Greek questions and statements. We evaluate two state-of-the-art network architectures: a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a convolutional network (ConvNet). The ConvNet outperforms the LSTM in the classification task and exhibited an excellent performance with 95% classification accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 08:28:39 GMT  (828kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03952v1", "4 pages, 3 figures, Experimental linguistics 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 12:49:57 GMT  (828kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03952v2", "4 pages, 3 figures, Experimental linguistics 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 3 figures, Experimental linguistics 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jean-philippe bernardy", "charalambos themistocleous"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03952"}
