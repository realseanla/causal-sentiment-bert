Part of the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comes from the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphological system. Function tagging is a pre-processing step to show grammatical relations of Myanmar sentences. In the task of function tagging, which tags the function of Myanmar sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunking information, we use Naive Bayesian theory to disambiguate the possible function tags of a word. We apply context free grammar (CFG) to find out the grammatical relations of the function tags. We also create a functional annotated tagged corpus for Myanmar and propose the grammar rules for Myanmar sentences. Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with simple sentences and complex sentences.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Mar 2012 03:06:29 GMT  (537kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1685v1", "16 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, AIAA-2011 (India). arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:0912.1820by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, AIAA-2011 (India). arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:0912.1820by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["win win thant", "tin myat htwe", "ni lar thein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.1685"}
