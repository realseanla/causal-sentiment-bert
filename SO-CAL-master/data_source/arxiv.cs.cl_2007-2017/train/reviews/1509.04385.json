The aim of this work is to develop a novel model for NERC, based on Multinomial Na\\\"ive Bayes (MNB) Classifier. The Methodology adopted in this paper is based on feature extraction of training corpus, by using term frequency, inverse document frequency and fitting them to a tf-idf-vectorizer. The paper discusses the various issues in developing the proposed model. The details of implementation and performance evaluation are discussed. The experiments are conducted on a training corpus of size 95,170 tokens and test corpus of 5,000 tokens. It is observed that the model works with Precision, Recall and F1-measure of 83%, 79% and 81% respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Sep 2015 06:07:16 GMT  (637kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04385v1", "14 pages, 3 figures, International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 4, No.4, August 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 3 figures, International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol. 4, No.4, August 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["s amarappa", "s v sathyanarayana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04385"}
