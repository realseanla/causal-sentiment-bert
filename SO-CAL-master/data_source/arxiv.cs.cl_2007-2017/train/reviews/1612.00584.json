An alternative method is to allocate a vector per sense instead a vector per word. However, the word representations estimated in the former way are not as easy to use as the latter one. Our previous work uses a probabilistic method to alleviate the overfitting, but it is not robust with small corpus. In this paper, we propose a new neural network to estimate distributed word representations using a lexicon and a corpus. We add a lexicon layer in continuous bag-of-words model, and a threshold node after the output of the lexicon layer. The threshold rejects the \"bad\" outputs of the lexicon layer that are less likely to be the same with their inputs. In this way, it alleviates the overfitting of the polysemous words. The proposed neural network can be trained using negative sampling, which maximizing the log probabilities of target words given the context words, by distinguishing the target words from random noises. We compare the proposed neural network with continuous bag-of-words model, the other works improving it, and the previous works estimating distributed word representations using both a lexicon and a corpus. The experimental results show that the proposed neural network is more efficient and balanced for both semantic tasks and syntactic tasks than the previous works, and robust to the size of the corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 07:45:40 GMT  (383kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00584v1", "7 pages, under review as a conference paper at IEEE IJCNN 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 12:36:26 GMT  (1977kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00584v2", "Accepted by IEEE IJCNN 2017.
