In the front-end, Multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF) is designed to achieve background noise reduction. Different from traditional MWF, optimized parameter for the tradeoff between noise reduction and target signal distortion is built according to the desired noise reduction level. In the back-end, several techniques are taken advantage to improve the noisy Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) performance including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) using medium vocabulary, Lattice rescoring with a big vocabulary language model finite state transducer, and ROVER scheme. Experimental results show the proposed system combining front-end and back-end is effective to improve the ASR performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 03:37:11 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06103v1", "5 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["xiaofei wang", "chao wu", "pengyuan zhang", "ziteng wang", "yong liu", "xu li", "qiang fu", "yonghong yan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06103"}
