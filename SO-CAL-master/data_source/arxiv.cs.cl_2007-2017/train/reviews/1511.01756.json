Two main patterns of frozen similes were considered: adjectival ground + simile marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. happy as a lark) and eventuality + simile marker + nominal vehicle (e.g. sleep like a top). All potential similes and their components were first extracted using a rule-based algorithm. Then, frozen similes were identified based on reference lists of existing similes and semantic distance between the tenor and the vehicle. The results obtained tend to confirm the fact that frozen similes are not used haphazardly in literary texts. In addition, contrary to how they are often presented, frozen similes often go beyond the ground or the eventuality and the vehicle to also include the tenor.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 14:20:01 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01756v1", "Europhras 2015: Computerised and corpus-based approaches to phraseology: monolingual and multilingual perspectivs, Jun 2015, Malaga, Spain. \\&amp;lt;The European Society of Phraseology\\&amp;gt"], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 07:35:38 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01756v2", "EUROPHRAS2015:COMPUTERISED AND CORPUS-BASED APPROACHES TO PHRASEOLOGY: MONOLINGUAL AND MULTILINGUAL PERSPECTIVES, Jun 2015, Malaga, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "Europhras 2015: Computerised and corpus-based approaches to phraseology: monolingual and multilingual perspectivs, Jun 2015, Malaga, Spain. \\&amp;lt;The European Society of Phraseology\\&amp;gt", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["suzanne mpouli", "jean-gabriel ganascia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01756"}
