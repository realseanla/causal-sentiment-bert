We hypothesise that term frequencies may yield useful information for scientometric analysis. In our work we ask if word features in combination with Bayesian analysis allow well-founded science mapping studies. This work goes back to the roots of Mosteller and Wallace's (1964) statistical text analysis using word frequency features and a Bayesian inference approach, tough with different goals. To answer our research question we (i) introduce a new data set on which the experiments are carried out, (ii) describe the Bayesian model employed for inference and (iii) present first results of the analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 May 2013 22:24:20 GMT  (810kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1343v1", "Accepted: 14th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, Vienna Austria 15-19th July 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted: 14th International Society of Scientometrics and Informetrics Conference, Vienna Austria 15-19th July 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["arnim bleier", "andreas strotmann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1343"}
