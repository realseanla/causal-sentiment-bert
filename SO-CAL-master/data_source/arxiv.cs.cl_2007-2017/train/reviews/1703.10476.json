A closer look reveals that this is due to the deficiencies in the generated word distribution, vocabulary size, and strong bias in the generators towards frequent captions. Furthermore, humans -- rightfully so -- generate multiple, diverse captions, due to the inherent ambiguity in the captioning task which is not considered in today's systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 13:54:51 GMT  (9553kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10476v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["rakshith shetty", "marcus rohrbach", "lisa anne hendricks", "mario fritz", "bernt schiele"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10476"}
