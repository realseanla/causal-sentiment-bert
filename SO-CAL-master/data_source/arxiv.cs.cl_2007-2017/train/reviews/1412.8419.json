In this paper, we present a simple model that is able to generate sentences given a sample image. Our model learns to embed image representations (generated from a previously trained Convolutional Neural Network) into a multimodal space that is common to the images and the phrases that are used to described them. The system is able to infer phrases from a given image sample. Based on the sentence descriptions, we propose a simple language model that is able to produce relevant descriptions for a given test image using the feature representation and the phrases inferred. We achieve promising first results on the recently released COCO dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 18:43:10 GMT  (1422kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8419v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 05:09:13 GMT  (742kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8419v2", "Under review as a workshop paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Sat, 11 Apr 2015 03:53:26 GMT  (1591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8419v3", "Accepted as a workshop paper at ICLR 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["remi lebret", "pedro o pinheiro", "ronan collobert"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.8419"}
