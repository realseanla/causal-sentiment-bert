We utilized recent advances in short text categorization using deep learning to create word-level and character-level models. The choice between word-level and character-level models in each particular case was informed through validation performance. Our final system is a combination of classifiers using word-level or character-level models. We also employed novel data augmentation techniques to expand and diversify our training dataset, thus making our system more robust. Our system achieved a macro-average precision, recall and F1-scores of 0.67, 0.61 and 0.635 respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 22:32:50 GMT  (442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05694v1", "SemEval 2016, San Diego, California.
