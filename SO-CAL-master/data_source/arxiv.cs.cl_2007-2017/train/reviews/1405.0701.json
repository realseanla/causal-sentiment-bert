We show that this can be leveraged so as to improve named entity recognition (NER) by using unsupervised word clusters from secondary languages as features in state-of-the-art discriminative NER systems. We observe significant increases in performance, finding that person and location identification is particularly improved, and that phylogenetically close languages provide more valuable features than more distant languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 May 2014 14:23:53 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0701v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["manaal faruqui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0701"}
