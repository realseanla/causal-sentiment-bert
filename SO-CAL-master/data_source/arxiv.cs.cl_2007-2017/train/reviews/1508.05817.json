By modeling a notion of euphony and analyzing four datasets comprising persuasive and non-persuasive sentences in different domains (political speeches, movie quotes, slogans and tweets), we explore the impact of sounds on different forms of persuasiveness. We conduct a series of analyses and prediction experiments within and across datasets. Our results highlight the positive role of phonetic devices on persuasion.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 14:15:39 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05817v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["marco guerini", "g\u00f6zde \u00f6zbal", "carlo strapparava"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.05817"}
