For low-resource language pairs this is not the case, resulting in poor translation quality. Inspired by work in computer vision, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that targets low-frequency words by generating new sentence pairs containing rare words in new, synthetically created contexts. Experimental results on simulated low-resource settings show that our method improves translation quality by up to 2.9 BLEU points over the baseline and up to 3.2 BLEU over back-translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 08:12:15 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00440v1", "5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marzieh fadaee", "arianna bisazza", "christof monz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00440"}
