Theory of Mind is critical to effective communication and to teams demonstrating higher collective performance. To effectively leverage the progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to make our lives more productive, it is important for humans and AI to work well together in a team. Traditionally, there has been much emphasis on research to make AI more accurate, and (to a lesser extent) on having it better understand human intentions, tendencies, beliefs, and contexts. The latter involves making AI more human-like and having it develop a theory of our minds.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 17:58:07 GMT  (9090kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00717v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 17:55:50 GMT  (7458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00717v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["arjun chandrasekaran", "deshraj yadav", "prithvijit chattopadhyay", "viraj prabhu", "devi parikh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00717"}
