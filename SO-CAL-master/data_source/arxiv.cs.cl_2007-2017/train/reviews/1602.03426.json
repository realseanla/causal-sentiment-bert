With diverse approaches, datasets and analyses that have been reported, there is an essential need to have a collective understanding of the research in this area. In this survey of automatic sarcasm detection, we describe datasets, approaches (both supervised and rule-based), and trends in sarcasm detection research. We also present a research matrix that summarizes past work, and list pointers to future work.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 16:02:46 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03426v1", "11 pages.
