{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Jun-2015", "title": "Learning language through pictures", "abstract": "We propose Imaginet, a model of learning visually grounded representations of language from coupled textual and visual input. The model consists of two Gated Recurrent Unit networks with shared word embeddings, and uses a multi-task objective by receiving a textual description of a scene and trying to concurrently predict its visual representation and the next word in the sentence. Like humans, it acquires meaning representations for individual words from descriptions of visual scenes. Moreover, it learns to effectively use sequential structure in semantic interpretation of multi-word phrases.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 14:45:49 GMT  (3719kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03694v1", "To appear at ACL 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 18:56:57 GMT  (3721kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03694v2", "To appear at ACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at ACL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["grzegorz chrupala", "\u00e1kos k\u00e1d\u00e1r", "afra alishahi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.03694"}
