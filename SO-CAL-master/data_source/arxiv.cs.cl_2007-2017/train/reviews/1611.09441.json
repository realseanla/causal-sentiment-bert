Knowing people's opinion is crucial for several purposes starting from gathering knowledge about customer base, e-governance, campaigning and many more. In this report, we aim to develop a system to detect the sentiment from tweets. We employ several linguistic features along with some other external sources of information to detect the sentiment of a tweet. We show that augmenting the 140 character-long tweet with information harvested from external urls shared in the tweet as well as Social Media features enhances the sentiment prediction accuracy significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 00:22:13 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09441v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["lahari poddar", "kishaloy halder", "xianyan jia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09441"}
