In this paper we show that the strong learning capability of neural MT models does not make linguistic features redundant; they can be easily incorporated to provide further improvements in performance. We generalize the embedding layer of the encoder in the attentional encoder--decoder architecture to support the inclusion of arbitrary features, in addition to the baseline word feature. We add morphological features, part-of-speech tags, and syntactic dependency labels as input features to English&lt;-&gt;German neural machine translation systems. In experiments on WMT16 training and test sets, we find that linguistic input features improve model quality according to three metrics: perplexity, BLEU and CHRF3.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 10:12:36 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02892v1", "accepted to WMT16"], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 23:11:51 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02892v2", "WMT16 final version; new EN-RO results"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to WMT16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rico sennrich", "barry haddow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02892"}
