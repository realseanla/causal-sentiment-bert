It is a non-interference strategy that the exponential moving average model is not broadcasted to distributed workers to update their local models after model synchronization in the training process, and it is implemented as the final model of the training system. Fully-connected feed-forward neural networks (DNNs) and deep unidirectional Long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are successfully trained with proposed method for large vocabulary continuous speech recognition on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin. The character error rate (CER) of Mandarin speech recognition further degrades than state-of-the-art approaches of parallel training.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 03:14:28 GMT  (119kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01024v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xu tian", "jun zhang", "zejun ma", "yi he", "juan wei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01024"}
