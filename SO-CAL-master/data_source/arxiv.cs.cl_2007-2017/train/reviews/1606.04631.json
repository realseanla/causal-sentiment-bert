However, most existing approaches either ignore temporal information among video frames or just employ local contextual temporal knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel video captioning framework, termed as \\emph{Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory} (BiLSTM), which deeply captures bidirectional global temporal structure in video. Specifically, we first devise a joint visual modelling approach to encode video data by combining a forward LSTM pass, a backward LSTM pass, together with visual features from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Then, we inject the derived video representation into the subsequent language model for initialization. The benefits are in two folds: 1) comprehensively preserving sequential and visual information; and 2) adaptively learning dense visual features and sparse semantic representations for videos and sentences, respectively. We verify the effectiveness of our proposed video captioning framework on a commonly-used benchmark, i.e., Microsoft Video Description (MSVD) corpus, and the experimental results demonstrate that the superiority of the proposed approach as compared to several state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 03:26:53 GMT  (225kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04631v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.CL", "authors": ["yi bin", "yang yang", "zi huang", "fumin shen", "xing xu", "heng tao shen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04631"}
