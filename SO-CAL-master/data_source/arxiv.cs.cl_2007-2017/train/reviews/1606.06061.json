This paper describes further optimizations of LSTM-RNN-based SPSS for deployment on mobile devices; weight quantization, multi-frame inference, and robust inference using an {\\epsilon}-contaminated Gaussian loss function. Experimental results in subjective listening tests show that these optimizations can make LSTM-RNN-based SPSS comparable to HMM-based SPSS in runtime speed while maintaining naturalness. Evaluations between LSTM-RNN- based SPSS and HMM-driven unit selection speech synthesis are also presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 10:54:51 GMT  (1198kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06061v1", "13 pages, 3 figures, Interspeech 2016 (accepted)"], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 15:11:30 GMT  (1199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06061v2", "13 pages, 3 figures, Interspeech 2016 (accepted)"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 3 figures, Interspeech 2016 (accepted)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["heiga zen", "yannis agiomyrgiannakis", "niels egberts", "fergus henderson", "przemys{\\l}aw szczepaniak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06061"}
