Translated speech data is potentially valuable for documenting endangered languages or for training speech translation systems. A first step towards making use of such data would be to automatically align spoken words with their translations. We present a model that combines Dyer et al.'s reparameterization of IBM Model 2 (fast-align) and k-means clustering using Dynamic Time Warping as a distance metric. The two components are trained jointly using expectation-maximization. In an extremely low-resource scenario, our model performs significantly better than both a neural model and a strong baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 19:50:59 GMT  (1353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08139v1", "accepted at EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted at EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["antonios anastasopoulos", "david chiang", "long duong"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.08139"}
