In this paper, we address one of its key sub-problems, referred to as short text conversation, in which given a message from human, the computer returns a reasonable response to the message. We leverage the vast amount of short conversation data available on social media to study the issue. We propose formalizing short text conversation as a search problem at the first step, and employing state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) techniques to carry out the task. We investigate the significance as well as the limitation of the IR approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the retrieval-based model can make the system behave rather \"intelligently\", when combined with a huge repository of conversation data from social media.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 12:04:15 GMT  (524kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6988v1", "21 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["zongcheng ji", "zhengdong lu", "hang li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6988"}
