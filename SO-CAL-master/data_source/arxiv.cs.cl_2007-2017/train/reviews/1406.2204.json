This exploratory research focussed on novices and experts in knowledge engineering during their attempts to learn a controlled natural language (CNL) known as OWL Simplified English and use it to build a small knowledge base. Participants' behaviours during the task were observed through eye-tracking and screen recordings. This was an attempt at a more ambitious user study than in previous research because we used a naturally occurring text as the source of domain knowledge, and left them without guidance on which information to select, or how to encode it. We have identified a number of skills (competencies) required for this difficult task and key problems that authors face.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 14:54:22 GMT  (544kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2204v1", "CNL 2014 : Fourth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language"]], "COMMENTS": "CNL 2014 : Fourth Workshop on Controlled Natural Language", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sandra williams", "richard power", "allan third"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2204"}
