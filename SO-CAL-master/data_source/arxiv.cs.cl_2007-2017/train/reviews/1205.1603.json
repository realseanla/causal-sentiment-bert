Part of the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comes from the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphological system. Function tagging is a pre-processing step for parsing. In the task of function tagging, we use the functional annotated corpus and tag Myanmar sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunking information. We propose Myanmar grammar rules and apply context free grammar (CFG) to find out the parse tree of function tagged Myanmar sentences. Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with parsing of simple sentences and three types of complex sentences.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 May 2012 07:01:40 GMT  (683kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1603v1", "18 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1203.1685, and witharXiv:0912.1820by other authors without attribution"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 8 figures, 10 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1203.1685, and witharXiv:0912.1820by other authors without attribution", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["win win thant", "tin myat htwe", "ni lar thein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.1603"}
