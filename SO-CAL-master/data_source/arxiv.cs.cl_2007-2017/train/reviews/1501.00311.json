We present an open-source QA framework QANUS which researchers can leverage on to build new QA systems easily and rapidly. The framework implements much of the code that will otherwise have been repeated across different QA systems. To demonstrate the utility and practicality of the framework, we further present a fully functioning factoid QA system QA-SYS built on top of QANUS.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jan 2015 20:51:25 GMT  (1158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00311v1", "6 pages, 3 figures, demo paper describing QANUS"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 figures, demo paper describing QANUS", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["jun-ping ng", "min-yen kan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00311"}
