Monolingual data plays an important role in boosting fluency for phrase-based statistical machine translation, and we investigate the use of monolingual data for neural machine translation (NMT). In contrast to previous work, which integrates a separately trained RNN language model into an NMT architecture, we note that encoder-decoder NMT architectures already have the capacity to learn the same information as a language model, and we explore strategies to include monolingual training data in the training process. Through our use of monolingual data, we obtain substantial improvements on the WMT 15 (+2.8--3.4 BLEU) task for English-&gt;German, and for the low-resourced IWSLT 14 task Turkish-&gt;English (+2.1--3.4 BLEU), obtaining new state-of-the-art results. We also show that fine-tuning on in-domain monolingual and parallel data gives substantial improvements for the IWSLT 15 task for English-&gt;German.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 17:58:37 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06709v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 14:52:55 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06709v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 19:54:58 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06709v3", "fixed tokenization inconsistency in de-&gt;en evaluation"], ["v4", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 15:09:54 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06709v4", "accepted to ACL 2016; new section on effect of back-translation quality"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rico sennrich", "barry haddow", "alexandra birch"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06709"}
