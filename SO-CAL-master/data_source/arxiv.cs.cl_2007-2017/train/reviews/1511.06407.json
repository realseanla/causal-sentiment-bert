Signal processing techniques such as beamforming are widely used to extract a speech signal of interest from background noise. These techniques, however, are highly dependent on prior spatial information about the microphones and the environment in which the system is being used. In this work, we present a neural attention network that directly combines multi-channel audio to generate phonetic states without requiring any prior knowledge of the microphone layout or any explicit signal preprocessing for speech enhancement. We embed an attention mechanism within a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based acoustic model to automatically tune its attention to a more reliable input source. Unlike traditional multi-channel preprocessing, our system can be optimized towards the desired output in one step. Although attention-based models have recently achieved impressive results on sequence-to-sequence learning, however, no attention mechanisms have been applied to learn multiple inputs which may be asynchronous and non-stationary. We evaluate our neural attention model on a subset of the CHiME-3 challenge task, and we show that the model achieves comparable performance to beamforming using a purely data-driven method.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:56:53 GMT  (253kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06407v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 22:16:54 GMT  (259kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06407v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL", "authors": ["suyoun kim", "ian lane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06407"}
