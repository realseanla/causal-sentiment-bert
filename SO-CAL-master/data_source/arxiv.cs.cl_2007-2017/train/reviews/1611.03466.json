In this paper, we generalize earlier work by considering a constrained stochastic context free grammar (CSCFG) for modeling patterns confined to a roadmap. The constrained grammar facilitates modeling specific directions and road names in a roadmap. We present a novel particle filtering algorithm that exploits the CSCFG model for estimating the target's patterns. This meta-level algorithm operates in conjunction with a base-level tracking algorithm. Extensive numerical results using simulated ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar measurements show substantial improvement in target tracking accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 20:13:36 GMT  (1010kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03466v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sijia gao", "vikram krishnamurthy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03466"}
