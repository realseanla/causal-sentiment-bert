Despite this important domain dependence in word semantics, existing word representation learning methods are bound to a single domain. Given a pair of \\emph{source}-\\emph{target} domains, we propose an unsupervised method for learning domain-specific word representations that accurately capture the domain-specific aspects of word semantics. First, we select a subset of frequent words that occur in both domains as \\emph{pivots}. Next, we optimize an objective function that enforces two constraints: (a) for both source and target domain documents, pivots that appear in a document must accurately predict the co-occurring non-pivots, and (b) word representations learnt for pivots must be similar in the two domains. Moreover, we propose a method to perform domain adaptation using the learnt word representations. Our proposed method significantly outperforms competitive baselines including the state-of-the-art domain-insensitive word representations, and reports best sentiment classification accuracies for all domain-pairs in a benchmark dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 May 2015 04:02:56 GMT  (280kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07184v1", "53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conferences on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing"]], "COMMENTS": "53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 7th International Joint Conferences on Natural Language Processing of the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["danushka bollegala", "takanori maehara", "ken-ichi kawarabayashi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.07184"}
