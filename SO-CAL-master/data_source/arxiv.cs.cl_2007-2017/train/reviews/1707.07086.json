{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Jul-2017", "title": "Identifying civilians killed by police with distantly supervised entity-event extraction", "abstract": "We propose a new, socially-impactful task for natural language processing: from a news corpus, extract names of persons who have been killed by police. We present a newly collected police fatality corpus, which we release publicly, and present a model to solve this problem that uses EM-based distant supervision with logistic regression and convolutional neural network classifiers. Our model outperforms two off-the-shelf event extractor systems, and it can suggest candidate victim names in some cases faster than one of the major manually-collected police fatality databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 01:47:36 GMT  (459kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["katherine a keith", "abram handler", "michael pinkham", "cara magliozzi", "joshua mcduffie", "brendan o'connor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07086"}
