This knowledge is encoded in computational grammars, lexicons and domain models. Another approach which avoids the need for collecting and analyzing massive knowledge, is the Example Based approach, which is the topic of this paper. We show through the paper that using Example Based in its native form is not suitable for translating into Arabic. Therefore a modification to the basic approach is presented to improve the accuracy of the translation process. The basic idea of the new approach is to improve the technique by which template-based approaches select the appropriate templates.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 23:56:08 GMT  (679kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1241v1", "Eleventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications, 2003"]], "COMMENTS": "Eleventh International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications, 2003", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["t el-shishtawy", "a el-sammak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1241"}
