But what longstanding weaknesses does it resolve, and which remain? We address these questions with a challenge set approach to translation evaluation and error analysis. A challenge set consists of a small set of sentences, each hand-designed to probe a system's capacity to bridge a particular structural divergence between languages. To exemplify this approach, we present an English-French challenge set, and use it to analyze phrase-based and neural systems. The resulting analysis provides not only a more fine-grained picture of the strengths of neural systems, but also insight into which linguistic phenomena remain out of reach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 19:34:38 GMT  (43kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07431v1", "26 pages, including appendix"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 May 2017 16:28:52 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07431v2", "27 pages, including appendix.
