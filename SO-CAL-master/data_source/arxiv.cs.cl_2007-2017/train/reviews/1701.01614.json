We also propose an algorithm that enumerates all of the oracle summaries for a set of reference summaries to exploit F-measures that evaluate which system summaries contain how many sentences that are extracted as an oracle summary. Our experimental results obtained from Document Understanding Conference (DUC) corpora demonstrated the following: (1) room still exists to improve the performance of extractive summarization; (2) the F-measures derived from the enumerated oracle summaries have significantly stronger correlations with human judgment than those derived from single oracle summaries.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Jan 2017 12:28:15 GMT  (120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01614v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tsutomu hirao", "masaaki nishino", "jun suzuki", "masaaki nagata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.01614"}
