Word embeddings show promise as a diachronic tool, but have not been carefully evaluated. We develop a robust methodology for quantifying semantic change by evaluating word embeddings (PPMI, SVD, word2vec) against known historical changes. We then use this methodology to reveal statistical laws of semantic evolution. Using six historical corpora spanning four languages and two centuries, we propose two quantitative laws of semantic change: (i) the law of conformity---the rate of semantic change scales with an inverse power-law of word frequency; (ii) the law of innovation---independent of frequency, words that are more polysemous have higher rates of semantic change.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 03:54:18 GMT  (379kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09096v1", "Accepted for publication at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016 (this http URL) under working-title \"Diachronic word embeddings reveal laws of semantic change\""], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 20:24:30 GMT  (629kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09096v2", "Accepted for publication at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016 (this http URL)"], ["v3", "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 09:36:39 GMT  (441kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09096v3", "Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016 (this http URL)"], ["v4", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 23:35:05 GMT  (441kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09096v4", "Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), 2016 (this http URL) under working-title \"Diachronic word embeddings reveal laws of semantic change\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["william l hamilton", "jure leskovec", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.09096"}
