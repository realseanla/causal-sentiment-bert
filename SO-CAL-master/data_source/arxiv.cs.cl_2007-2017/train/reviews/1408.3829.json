Web is used in every field. Most of the people use web for a common purpose like online shopping, chatting etc. During an online shopping large number of reviews/opinions are given by the users that reflect whether the product is good or bad. These reviews need to be explored, analyse and organized for better decision making. Opinion Mining is a natural language processing task that deals with finding orientation of opinion in a piece of text with respect to a topic. In this paper a document based opinion mining system is proposed that classify the documents as positive, negative and neutral. Negation is also handled in the proposed system. Experimental results using reviews of movies show the effectiveness of the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 Aug 2014 14:56:36 GMT  (961kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3829v1", "International Journal on Information Theory (IJIT), Vol.3, No.3, July 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal on Information Theory (IJIT), Vol.3, No.3, July 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL", "authors": ["richa sharma", "shweta nigam", "rekha jain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.3829"}
