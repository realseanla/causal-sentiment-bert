This paper extracted directional protein-protein interaction from the biological text, using the SVM-based method. Experiments were evaluated on the LLL05 corpus with good results. The results show that dependency features are import for the protein-protein interaction extraction and features related to the interaction word are effective for the interaction direction judgment. At last, we analyzed the effects of different features and planed for the next step.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 07:41:07 GMT  (408kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1953v1", "6 pages, 6 tables, 1 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 12:25:47 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1953v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to its lack of academic value"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 6 tables, 1 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CE", "authors": ["peilei liu", "ting wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1953"}
