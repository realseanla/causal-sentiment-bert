The process of textual entailment is guided by hypotheses, which are extracted from a domain ontology. Textual entailment checks if the truth of the hypothesis follows from a given text. We enact textual entailment to compare students answer to a model answer obtained from ontology. We validated the solution against various essays written by students in the chemistry domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 13:21:02 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02669v1", "16th Int.
