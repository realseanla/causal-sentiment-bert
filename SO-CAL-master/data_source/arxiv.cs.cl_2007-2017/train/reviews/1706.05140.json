Extrinsic evaluation of topic models tends to focus exclusively on topic-level evaluation, e.g. by assessing the coherence of topics. We demonstrate that there can be large discrepancies between topic- and document-level model quality, and that basing model evaluation on topic-level analysis can be highly misleading. We propose a method for automatically predicting topic model quality based on analysis of document-level topic allocations, and provide empirical evidence for its robustness.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 03:53:38 GMT  (271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05140v1", "10 pages; accepted for the Twenty First Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages; accepted for the Twenty First Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["shraey bhatia", "jey han lau", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.05140"}
