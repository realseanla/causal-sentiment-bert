This paper addresses the problem of predicting community endorsement in online discussions, leveraging both the participant response structure and the text of the comment. The different types of features are integrated in a neural network that uses a novel architecture to learn latent modes of discussion structure that perform as well as deep neural networks but are more interpretable. In addition, the latent modes can be used to weight text features thereby improving prediction accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 23:37:43 GMT  (1573kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04808v1", "10 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 09:46:24 GMT  (1574kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04808v2", "10 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["hao fang", "hao cheng", "mari ostendorf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04808"}
