We design a novel objective to combine the representation learning process and the k-means clustering process together, and optimize the objective with both labeled data and unlabeled data iteratively until convergence through three steps: (1) assign each short text to its nearest centroid based on its representation from the current neural networks; (2) re-estimate the cluster centroids based on cluster assignments from step (1); (3) update neural networks according to the objective by keeping centroids and cluster assignments fixed. Experimental results on four datasets show that our method works significantly better than several other text clustering methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 14:55:26 GMT  (689kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06797v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 19:52:33 GMT  (689kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06797v2", "In Proceedings of CoNLL 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zhiguo wang", "haitao mi", "abraham ittycheriah"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06797"}
