First, this proposed approach performs the Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using Bigram approximation. As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous word at a particular text instance is derived. In the next stage, only those dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact sense of the ambiguous word. In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary. The proposed approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences. Not only that, we have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 11:29:10 GMT  (224kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06601v1", "13 pages in International Journal of Instrumentation and Control Systems (IJICS) Vol.3, No.4, October 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages in International Journal of Instrumentation and Control Systems (IJICS) Vol.3, No.4, October 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alok ranjan pal", "anupam munshi", "diganta saha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06601"}
