After the normalization process, $n$-grams of characters and n-grams of POS tags are obtained to extract all the possible stylistic information encoded in the documents (emoticons, character flooding, capital letters, references to other users, hyperlinks, hashtags, etc.). Experiments with SVM showed up to 90% of performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 16:26:54 GMT  (146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06467v1", "8 pages, 6 figures, Conference paper"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 6 figures, Conference paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["carlos-emiliano gonz\\'alez-gallardo", "juan-manuel torres-moreno", "azucena montes rend\\'on", "gerardo sierra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06467"}
