We illustrate this general approach with an application to dialogue where we integrate a neural chat model, good at conversational aspects, with a neural question-answering model, good at retrieving precise information from a knowledge-base, and show how the integration combines the strengths of the independent components. We hope that this focused contribution will attract attention on the benefits of using such mixtures of experts in NLP.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 May 2016 17:00:44 GMT  (502kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01652v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["phong le", "marc dymetman", "jean-michel renders"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01652"}
