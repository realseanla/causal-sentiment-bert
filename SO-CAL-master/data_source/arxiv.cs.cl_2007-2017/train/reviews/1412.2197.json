{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Dec-2014", "title": "Practice in Synonym Extraction at Large Scale", "abstract": "Synonym extraction is an important task in natural language processing and often used as a submodule in query expansion, question answering and other applications. Automatic synonym extractor is highly preferred for large scale applications. Previous studies in synonym extraction are most limited to datasets in small scales. In this paper, we build a large dataset with 3.5 million synonym/non-synonym pairs to capture the challenges in real world scenarios. To overcome these challenges in large scale in synonym extraction, we proposed (1) a new cost function to accommodate the unbalanced learning problem, and (2) a feature learning based deep neural network to model the complicated relationships in synonym pairs. We compare several different approaches based on SVMs and neural networks, and find out our feature learning based neural network outperforms the methods with hand-assigned features. Specifically, the best performance of our model surpluses the SVM baseline with a significant 97\\% relative improvement.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Dec 2014 04:40:18 GMT  (294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2197v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 16:49:44 GMT  (294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2197v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 19:55:17 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2197v3", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author since the experimental results are not good enough"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["liangliang cao", "chang wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2197"}
