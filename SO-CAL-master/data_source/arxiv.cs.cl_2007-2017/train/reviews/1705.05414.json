In this work, we seek to address this problem by proposing a new neural dialogue agent that is able to effectively sustain grounded, multi-domain discourse through a novel key-value retrieval mechanism. The model is end-to-end differentiable and does not need to explicitly model dialogue state or belief trackers. We also release a new dataset of 3,031 dialogues that are grounded through underlying knowledge bases and span three distinct tasks in the in-car personal assistant space: calendar scheduling, weather information retrieval, and point-of-interest navigation. Our architecture is simultaneously trained on data from all domains and significantly outperforms a competitive rule-based system and other existing neural dialogue architectures on the provided domains according to both automatic and human evaluation metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 19:11:12 GMT  (963kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05414v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 00:45:59 GMT  (965kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05414v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mihail eric", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05414"}
