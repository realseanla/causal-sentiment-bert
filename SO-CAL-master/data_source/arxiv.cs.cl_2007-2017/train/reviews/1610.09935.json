Questions of this kind have ample applications, for instance, to educate users about or to evaluate their knowledge in a specific domain. To solve the problem, we propose an end-to-end approach. The approach first selects a named entity from the knowledge graph as an answer. It then generates a structured triple-pattern query, which yields the answer as its sole result. If a multiple-choice question is desired, the approach selects alternative answer options. Finally, our approach uses a template-based method to verbalize the structured query and yield a natural language question. A key challenge is estimating how difficult the generated question is to human users. To do this, we make use of historical data from the Jeopardy! quiz show and a semantically annotated Web-scale document collection, engineer suitable features, and train a logistic regression classifier to predict question difficulty. Experiments demonstrate the viability of our overall approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 14:27:07 GMT  (440kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09935v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 05:39:25 GMT  (382kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09935v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dominic seyler", "mohamed yahya", "klaus berberich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09935"}
