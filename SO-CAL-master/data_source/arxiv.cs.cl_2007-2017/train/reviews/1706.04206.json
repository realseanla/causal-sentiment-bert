In contrast to prior work that relies on manually created rules, we report experiment with several supervised machine learning techniques to classify sentences as to whether they express conditions and actions. We show the limitations and possible extensions of this work on text mining of medical guidelines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 18:02:27 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04206v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 18:35:26 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04206v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["hossein hematialam", "wlodek zadrozny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04206"}
