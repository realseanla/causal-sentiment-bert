We cast the task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem where we jointly train two systems, a generative model to produce response sequences, and a discriminator---analagous to the human evaluator in the Turing test--- to distinguish between the human-generated dialogues and the machine-generated ones. The outputs from the discriminator are then used as rewards for the generative model, pushing the system to generate dialogues that mostly resemble human dialogues.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 18:32:27 GMT  (4857kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 01:42:13 GMT  (4851kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 14:02:56 GMT  (4842kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 08:36:59 GMT  (4842kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547v4", null], ["v5", "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 01:44:39 GMT  (259kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06547v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jiwei li", "will monroe", "tianlin shi", "s\u00e9bastien jean", "alan ritter", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.06547"}
