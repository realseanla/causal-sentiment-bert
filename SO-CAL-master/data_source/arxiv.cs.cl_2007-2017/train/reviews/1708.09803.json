The method is based on the transfer method of Zoph et al., but whereas their method ignores any source vocabulary overlap, ours exploits it. First, we split words using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) to increase vocabulary overlap. Then, we train a model on the first language pair and transfer its parameters, including its source word embeddings, to another model and continue training on the second language pair. Our experiments show that while BPE and transfer learning perform inconsistently on their own, together they improve translation quality by up to 1.8 BLEU.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:34:38 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09803v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Sep 2017 17:04:20 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09803v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["toan q nguyen", "david chiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09803"}
