This study is made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation metric: METEOR. This metric enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological similarity) between an automatic and a reference translation. Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of WMT 2014. We show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional information. The augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our Github page.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 07:18:42 GMT  (240kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01291v1", "accepted to COLING 2016 conference"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to COLING 2016 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["christophe servan", "alexandre berard", "zied elloumi", "herv\\'e blanchon", "laurent besacier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01291"}
