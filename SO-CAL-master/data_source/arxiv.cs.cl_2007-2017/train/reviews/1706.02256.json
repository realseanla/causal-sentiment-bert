With recent advances in representation learning this task becomes a tangible aim. A central property of abstract anaphora is that it establishes a relation between the anaphor embedded in the anaphoric sentence and its (typically non-nominal) antecedent. We propose an LSTM-based mention-ranking model that learns how abstract anaphors relate to their antecedents with a Siamese Net. We overcome the lack of training data by generating artificial anaphoric sentence-antecedent pairs. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art results on shell noun resolution. We also report first benchmark results on an abstract anaphora subset of the ARRAU corpus. This corpus presents a greater challenge due to a greater range of confounders. Our model is able to select syntactically plausible candidates and - if disregarding syntax - discriminates candidates using deeper features. Deeper inspection shows that the model is able to learn a relation between the anaphor in the anaphoric sentence and its antecedent.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 16:58:59 GMT  (730kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02256v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 12:12:04 GMT  (1034kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02256v2", "In Proceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP).
