Every one of them works well for a set of specific examples that they use to demonstrate validity of their approaches. As I show in this paper, however, they are not very generalisable and do not account for essentially the same problem that they remedy when it manifests in other examples. I propose another logical approach. I develoop logic that extends a recent, propositional gradual logic, and show that it can treat donkey anaphora generally. I also identify and address a problem around the modern convention on existential import. Furthermore, I show that Aristotle's syllogisms and conversion are realisable in this logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 16:43:37 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05570v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ryuta arisaka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.05570"}
