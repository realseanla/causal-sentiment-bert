Image similarity is computed by a convolutional neural network and incorporated into a target-side translation memory retrieval model where descriptions of most similar images are used to rerank translation outputs. Our approach does not depend on the availability of in-domain parallel data and achieves improvements of 1.4 BLEU over strong baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 13:42:04 GMT  (547kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03916v1", "in submission"], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 13:47:26 GMT  (461kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03916v2", "domain adaptation, VGG16 visual features"], ["v3", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 16:52:09 GMT  (464kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03916v3", "Final version, accepted at ACL 2016.
