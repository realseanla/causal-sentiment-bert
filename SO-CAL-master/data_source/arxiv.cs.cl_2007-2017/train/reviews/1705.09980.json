Using a seq2seq model, and some trivial preprocessing and postprocessing of AMRs, we obtain a baseline accuracy of 53.1 (F-score on AMR-triples). We examine four different approaches to improve this baseline result: (i) reordering AMR branches to match the word order of the input sentence increases performance to 58.3; (ii) adding part-of-speech tags (automatically produced) to the input shows improvement as well (57.2); (iii) So does the introduction of super characters (conflating frequent sequences of characters to a single character), reaching 57.4; (iv) adding silver-standard training data obtained by an off-the-shelf parser yields the biggest improvement, resulting in an F-score of 64.0. Combining all four techniques leads to an F-score of 69.0, which is state-of-the-art in AMR parsing. This is remarkable because of the relatively simplicity of the approach: the only explicit linguistic knowledge that we use are part-of-speech tags.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 May 2017 19:41:09 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09980v1", "In review for CLIN Journal"], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Oct 2017 08:30:33 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09980v2", "Camera ready for CLIN 2017 journal"]], "COMMENTS": "In review for CLIN Journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rik van noord", "johan bos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09980"}
