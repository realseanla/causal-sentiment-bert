This paper presents a novel memory-augmented NMT (M-NMT) architecture, which stores knowledge about how words (usually infrequently encountered ones) should be translated in a memory and then utilizes them to assist the neural model. We use this memory mechanism to combine the knowledge learned from a conventional statistical machine translation system and the rules learned by an NMT system, and also propose a solution for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words based on this framework. Our experiments on two Chinese-English translation tasks demonstrated that the M-NMT architecture outperformed the NMT baseline by $9.0$ and $2.7$ BLEU points on the two tasks, respectively. Additionally, we found this architecture resulted in a much more effective OOV treatment compared to competitive methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 06:47:23 GMT  (282kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02005v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yang feng", "shiyue zhang", "andi zhang", "dong wang", "andrew abel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.02005"}
