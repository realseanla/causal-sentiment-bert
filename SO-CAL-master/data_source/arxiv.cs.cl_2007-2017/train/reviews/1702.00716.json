This can lead to different points of views reflected in the articles, as well as complementary and inconsistent information. An analysis of how the information is propagated across the Wikipedia language editions can provide important insights in the article evolution along the temporal and cultural dimensions and support quality control. To facilitate such analysis, we present MultiWiki - a novel web-based user interface that provides an overview of the similarities and differences across the article pairs originating from different language editions on a timeline. MultiWiki enables users to observe the changes in the interlingual article similarity over time and to perform a detailed visual comparison of the article snapshots at a particular time point.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 15:41:46 GMT  (255kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00716v1", "Published in the SIGIR '16 Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in the SIGIR '16 Proceedings of the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["simon gottschalk", "elena demidova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00716"}
