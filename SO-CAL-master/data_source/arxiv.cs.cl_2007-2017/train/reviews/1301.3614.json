This paper investigates application area in bilingual NLP, specifically Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We focus on the perspectives that NPLM has potential to open the possibility to complement potentially `huge' monolingual resources into the `resource-constraint' bilingual resources. In order to facilitate the application to various tasks, we propose the joint space model of ngram-HMM language model. We show two experiments in SMT: system combination and word alignment.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 07:56:20 GMT  (280kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3614v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 20 Jan 2013 22:58:41 GMT  (56kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3614v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 02:42:35 GMT  (56kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3614v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tsuyoshi okita"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3614"}
