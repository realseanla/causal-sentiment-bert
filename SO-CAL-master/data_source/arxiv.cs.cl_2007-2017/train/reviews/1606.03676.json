Here we compare the performances of four systems on datasets covering 16 languages, two of these systems being feature-based (MEMMs and CRFs) and two of them being neural-based (bi-LSTMs). We show that, on average, all four approaches perform similarly and reach state-of-the-art results. Yet better performances are obtained with our feature-based models on lexically richer datasets (e.g. for morphologically rich languages), whereas neural-based results are higher on datasets with less lexical variability (e.g. for English). These conclusions hold in particular for the MEMM models relying on our system MElt, which benefited from newly designed features. This shows that, under certain conditions, feature-based approaches enriched with morphosyntactic lexicons are competitive with respect to neural methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Jun 2016 08:06:55 GMT  (723kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03676v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 08:41:46 GMT  (723kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03676v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["beno\\^it sagot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03676"}
