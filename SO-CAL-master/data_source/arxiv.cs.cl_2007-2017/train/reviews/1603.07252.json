In this work we propose a data-driven approach based on neural networks and continuous sentence features. We develop a general framework for single-document summarization composed of a hierarchical document encoder and an attention-based extractor. This architecture allows us to develop different classes of summarization models which can extract sentences or words. We train our models on large scale corpora containing hundreds of thousands of document-summary pairs. Experimental results on two summarization datasets demonstrate that our models obtain results comparable to the state of the art without any access to linguistic annotation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 16:05:46 GMT  (936kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07252v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 13:41:50 GMT  (936kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07252v2", "Published at ACL2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 03:16:03 GMT  (937kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07252v3", "ACL2016 conference paper with appendix"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jianpeng cheng 0001", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.07252"}
