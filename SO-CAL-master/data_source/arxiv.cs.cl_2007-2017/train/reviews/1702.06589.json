In this paper, we explore deep learning techniques for answering multi-step reasoning questions that operate on semi-structured tables. Challenges here arise from the level of logical compositionality expressed by questions, as well as the domain openness. Our approach is weakly supervised, trained on question-answer-table triples without requiring intermediate strong supervision. It performs two phases: first, machine understandable logical forms (programs) are generated from natural language questions following the work of [Pasupat and Liang, 2015]. Second, paraphrases of logical forms and questions are embedded in a jointly learned vector space using word and character convolutional neural networks. A neural scoring function is further used to rank and retrieve the most probable logical form (interpretation) of a question. Our best single model achieves 34.8% accuracy on the WikiTableQuestions dataset, while the best ensemble of our models pushes the state-of-the-art score on this task to 38.7%, thus slightly surpassing both the engineered feature scoring baseline, as well as the Neural Programmer model of [Neelakantan et al., 2016].", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 21:24:26 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06589v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["till haug", "octavian-eugen ganea", "paulina grnarova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06589"}
