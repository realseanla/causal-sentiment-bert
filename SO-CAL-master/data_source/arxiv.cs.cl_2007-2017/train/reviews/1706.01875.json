However, the online disinhibition effect resulting from the ability to use pseudonymous identities may manifest in the form of offensive speech, consequently making political discussions more aggressive and polarizing than they already are. Such environments may result in harassment and self-censorship from its targets. In this paper, we present preliminary results from a large-scale temporal measurement aimed at quantifying offensiveness in online political discussions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 21:29:23 GMT  (902kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01875v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 17:24:51 GMT  (808kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01875v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["rishab nithyanand", "brian schaffner", "phillipa gill"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01875"}
