It investigates the most popular document (\"tweet\") representation methods which feed sentiment evaluation mechanisms. In particular, we study the bag-of-words, n-grams and n-gram graphs approaches and for each of them we evaluate the performance of a lexicon-based and 7 learning-based classification algorithms (namely SVM, Na\\\"ive Bayesian Networks, Logistic Regression, Multilayer Perceptrons, Best-First Trees, Functional Trees and C4.5) as well as their combinations, using a set of 4451 manually annotated tweets. The results demonstrate the superiority of learning-based methods and in particular of n-gram graphs approaches for predicting the sentiment of tweets. They also show that the combinatory approach has impressive effects on n-grams, raising the confidence up to 83.15% on the 5-Grams, using majority vote and a balanced dataset (equal number of positive, negative and neutral tweets for training). In the n-gram graph cases the improvement was small to none, reaching 94.52% on the 4-gram graphs, using Orthodromic distance and a threshold of 0.001.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 May 2015 12:05:19 GMT  (471kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02973v1", "5 pages, 1 figure, 6th Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval 2014, Rome, Italy"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure, 6th Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval 2014, Rome, Italy", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["evangelos psomakelis", "konstantinos tserpes", "dimosthenis anagnostopoulos", "theodora varvarigou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02973"}
