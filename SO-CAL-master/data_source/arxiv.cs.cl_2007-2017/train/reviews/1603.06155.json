A speaker model encodes personas in distributed embeddings that capture individual characteristics such as background information and speaking style. A dyadic speaker-addressee model captures properties of interactions between two interlocutors. Our models yield qualitative performance improvements in both perplexity and BLEU scores over baseline sequence-to-sequence models, with similar gain in speaker consistency as measured by human judges.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 23:15:18 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06155v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 17:19:58 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06155v2", "Accepted for publication at ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jiwei li", "michel galley", "chris brockett", "georgios p spithourakis", "jianfeng gao", "william b dolan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06155"}
