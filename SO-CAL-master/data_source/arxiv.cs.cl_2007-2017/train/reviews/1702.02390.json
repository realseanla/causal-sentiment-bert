In contrast to the previously introduced VAE model for text where both the encoder and decoder are RNNs, we propose a novel hybrid architecture that blends fully feed-forward convolutional and deconvolutional components with a recurrent language model. Our architecture exhibits several attractive properties such as faster run time and convergence, ability to better handle long sequences and, more importantly, it helps to avoid some of the major difficulties posed by training VAE models on textual data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 12:11:41 GMT  (468kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02390v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stanislau semeniuta", "aliaksei severyn", "erhardt barth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.02390"}
