Partition functions and marginals for high-order dependency trees can be computed efficiently, by adapting our algorithms which extend the inside-outside algorithm to higher-order cases. To show the effectiveness of our algorithms, we perform experiments on three languages---English, Chinese and Czech, using maximum conditional likelihood estimation for model training and L-BFGS for parameter estimation. Our methods achieve competitive performance for English, and outperform all previously reported dependency parsers for Chinese and Czech.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Feb 2015 06:47:34 GMT  (2100kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04174v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xuezhe ma", "hai zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.04174"}
