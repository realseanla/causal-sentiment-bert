Natural language processing provides a framework to automatize the process. Here, a machine-based approach for the content analysis of mathematical texts is described. A prototype for key phrase extraction and classification of mathematical texts is presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Jun 2013 15:48:06 GMT  (596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6944v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR", "authors": ["ulf sch\\\"oneberg", "wolfram sperber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.6944"}
