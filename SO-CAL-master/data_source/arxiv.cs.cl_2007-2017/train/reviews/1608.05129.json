However, sentiment in social media is difficult to measure since user-generated content is usually short and informal. Although many traditional sentiment analysis methods have been proposed, identifying slang sentiment words remains untackled. One of the reasons is that slang sentiment words are not available in existing dictionaries or sentiment lexicons. To this end, we propose to build the first sentiment dictionary of slang words to aid sentiment analysis of social media content. It is laborious and time-consuming to collect and label the sentiment polarity of a comprehensive list of slang words. We present an approach to leverage web resources to construct an extensive Slang Sentiment word Dictionary (SlangSD) that is easy to maintain and extend. SlangSD is publicly available for research purposes. We empirically show the advantages of using SlangSD, the newly-built slang sentiment word dictionary for sentiment classification, and provide examples demonstrating its ease of use with an existing sentiment system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 23:32:57 GMT  (270kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05129v1", "15 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["liang wu", "fred morstatter", "huan liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05129"}
