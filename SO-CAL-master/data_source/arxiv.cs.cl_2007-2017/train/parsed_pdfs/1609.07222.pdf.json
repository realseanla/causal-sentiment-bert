      "text" : "Neural network based models have been shown to achieved impressive results on various NLP tasks rivaling or in some cases surpassing traditional models, such as text classification (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Socher et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015a), semantic matching (Hu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2016a), parser (Chen and Manning, 2014) and machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2014).\nUsually, due to the large number of parameters these neural models need a large-scale corpus. It is hard to train a deep neural model that generalizes well with size-limited data, while building the large scale resources for some NLP tasks is also a challenge. To overcome this problem, these models often involve an unsupervised pre-training phase. The final model is fine-tuned on specific task with respect\n∗ Corresponding author.\nto a supervised training criterion. However, most pre-training methods are based on unsupervised objectives (Collobert et al., 2011; Turian et al., 2010; Mikolov et al., 2013), which is effective to improve the final performance, but it does not directly optimize the desired task.\nMulti-task learning is an approach to learn multiple related tasks simultaneously to significantly improve performance relative to learning each task independently. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997), several neural network based models (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Liu et al., 2015b) are proposed for NLP tasks, which utilized multi-task learning to jointly learn several tasks with the aim of mutual benefit. The characteristic of these multi-task architectures is they share some lower layers to determine common features. After the shared layers, the remaining layers are split into multiple specific tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose two deep architectures of sharing information among several tasks in multitask learning framework. All the related tasks are integrated into a single system which is trained jointly. More specifically, inspired by Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) and memory network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), we equip taskspecific long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) with an external shared memory. The external memory has capability to store long term information and knowledge shared by several related tasks. Different with NTM, we use a deep fusion strategy to integrate the information from the external memory into taskspecific LSTM, in which a fusion gate controls the ar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n07 22\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Se\np 20\ninformation flowing flexibly and enables the model to selectively utilize the shared information.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our architectures on two groups of text classification tasks. Experimental results show that jointly learning of multiple related tasks can improve the performance of each task relative to learning them independently.\nOur contributions are of three-folds:\n• We proposed a generic multi-task framework, in which different tasks can share information by an external memory and communicate by a reading/writing mechanism. Two proposed models are complementary to prior multi-task neural networks.\n• Different with Neural Turing Machine and memory network, we introduce a deep fusion mechanism between internal and external memories, which helps the LSTM units keep them interacting closely without being conflated.\n• As a by-product, the fusion gate enables us to better understand how the external shared memory helps specific task."

      "text" : "Long short-term memory network (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) (Elman, 1990), and specifically addresses the issue of learning long-term dependencies. LSTM maintains an internal memory cell that updates and exposes its content only when deemed necessary.\nArchitecturally speaking, the memory state and output state are explicitly separated by activation gates (Wang and Cho, 2015). However, the limitation of LSTM is that it lacks a mechanism to index its memory while writing and reading (Danihelka et al., 2016).\nWhile there are numerous LSTM variants, here we use the LSTM architecture used by (Jozefowicz\net al., 2015), which is similar to the architecture of (Graves, 2013) but without peep-hole connections.\nWe define the LSTM units at each time step t to be a collection of vectors in Rd: an input gate it, a forget gate ft, an output gate ot, a memory cell ct and a hidden state ht. d is the number of the LSTM units. The elements of the gating vectors it, ft and ot are in [0, 1].\nThe LSTM is precisely specified as follows.\n c̃t ot it ft  =  tanh σ σ σ (Wp [ xtht−1 ] + bp ) , (1)\nct = c̃t it + ct−1 ft, (2) ht = ot tanh (ct) , (3)\nwhere xt ∈ Rm is the input at the current time step; W ∈ R4h×(d+m) and bp ∈ R4h are parameters of affine transformation; σ denotes the logistic sigmoid function and denotes elementwise multiplication.\nThe update of each LSTM unit can be written precisely as follows:\n(ht, ct) = LSTM(ht−1, ct−1,xt, θp). (4)\nHere, the function LSTM(·, ·, ·, ·) is a shorthand for Eq. (1-3), and θp represents all the parameters of LSTM."

      "heading" : "2.2 Memory Enhanced LSTM",
      "text" : "LSTM has an internal memory to keep useful information for specific task, some of which may be beneficial to other tasks. However, it is non-trivial to share information stored in internal memory.\nRecently, there are some works to augment LSTM with an external memory, such as neural Turing machine (Graves et al., 2014) and memory network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015), called memory enhanced LSTM (ME-LSTM). These models enhance the low-capacity internal memory to have a capability of modelling long pieces of text (Andrychowicz and Kurach, 2016).\nInspired by these models, we introduce an external memory to share information among several tasks. To better control shared information and understand how it is utilized from external memory, we propose a deep fusion strategy for ME-LSTM.\nAs shown in Figure 1, ME-LSTM consists the original LSTM and an external memory which is maintained by reading and writing operations. The LSTM not only interacts with the input and output information but accesses the external memory using selective read and write operations.\nThe external memory and corresponding operations will be discussed in detail below.\nExternal Memory The form of external memory is defined as a matrix M ∈ RK×M , where K is the number of memory segments, and M is the size of each segment. Besides, K and M are generally instance-independent and pre-defined as hyperparameters.\nAt each step t, LSTM emits output ht and three key vectors kt, et and at simultaneously. kt, et and at can be computed asktet\nat\n = tanhσ\ntanh  (Wmht + bm) (5) where Wm and bm are parameters of affine transformation.\nReading The read operation is to read information rt ∈ RM from memory Mt−1.\nrt = αtMt−1, (6)\nwhere rt denotes the reading vector and αt ∈ RK represents a distribution over the set of segments of memory Mt−1, which controls the amount of information to be read from and written to the memory.\nEach scalar αt,k in attention distribution αt can be obtained as:\nαt,k = softmax(g(Mt−1,k,kt−1)) (7)\nwhere Mt−1,k represents the k-th row memory vector, and kt−1 is a key vector emitted by LSTM.\nHere g(x,y) (x ∈ RM ,y ∈ RM ) is a align function for which we consider two different alternatives:\ng(x,y) =\n{ vT tanh(Wa[x;y])\ncosine(x, y) (8)\nwhere v ∈ RM is a parameter vector. In our current implementation, the similarity measure is cosine similarity.\nWriting The memory can be written by two operations: erase and add.\nMt = Mt−1(1− αteTt ) + αtaTt , (9)\nwhere et,at ∈ RM represent erase and add vectors respectively.\nTo facilitate the following statements, we re-write the writing equation as:\nMt = fwrite(Mt−1, αt,ht). (10)\nDeep Fusion between External and Internal Memories After we obtain the information from external memory, we need a strategy to comprehensively utilize information from both external and internal memory.\nTo better control signals flowing from external memory, inspired by (Wang and Cho, 2015), we propose a deep fusion strategy to keep internal and external memories interacting closely without being conflated.\nIn detail, the state ht of LSTM at step t depends on both the read vector rt from external memory, and internal memory ct, which is computed by\nht = ot tanh(ct + gt (Wfrt)), (11)\nwhere Wf is parameter matrix, and gt is a fusion gate to select information from external memory, which is computed by\ngt = σ(Wrrt + Wcct), (12)\nwhere Wr and Wc are parameter matrices. Finally, the update of external memory enhanced LSTM unit can be written precisely as\n(ht,Mt, ct) = ME-LSTM(ht−1,\nMt−1, ct−1,xt, θp, θq), (13)\nwhere θp represents all the parameters of LSTM internal structure and θq represents all the parameters to maintain the external memory.\nOverall, the external memory enables ME-LSTM to have larger capability to store more information, thereby increasing the ability of ME-LSTM. The read and write operations allow ME-LSTM to capture complex sentence patterns."

      "text" : "Most existing neural network methods are based on supervised training objectives on a single task (Collobert et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014). These methods often suffer from the limited amounts of training data. To deal with this problem, these models often involve an unsupervised pre-training phase. This unsupervised pre-training is effective to improve the final performance, but it does not directly optimize the desired task.\nMotivated by the success of multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997), we propose two deep architectures with shared external memory to leverage supervised data from many related tasks. Deep neural model is well suited for multi-task learning since the features learned from a task may be useful for other tasks. Figure 2 gives an illustration of our proposed architectures.\nARC-I: Global Shared Memory In ARC-I, the input is modelled by a task-specific LSTM and external shared memory. More formally, given an input text x, the task-specific output h(m)t of taskm at step t is defined as\n(h (m) t ,M (s) t , c (m) t ) = ME-LSTM(h (m) t−1,\nM (s) t−1, c (m) t−1,xt, θ (m) p , θ (s) q ), (14)\nwhere xt represents word embeddings of word xt; the superscript s represents the parameters are shared across different tasks; the superscript m represents that the parameters or variables are taskspecific for task m.\nHere all tasks share single global memory M(s), meaning that all tasks can read information from it and have the duty to write their shared or taskspecific information into the memory.\nM (s) t = fwrite(M (s) t−1, α (s) t ,h (m) t ) (15)\nAfter calculating the task-specific representation of text h(m)T for task m, we can predict the probability distribution over classes.\nARC-II: Local-Global Hybrid Memory In ARC-I, all tasks share a global memory, but can also record task-specific information besides shared information. To address this, we allocate each task a local task-specific external memory, which can further write shared information to a global memory for all tasks.\nMore generally, for task m, we assign each taskspecific LSTM with a local memory M(m), followed by a global memory M(s), which is shared across different tasks.\nThe read and write operations of the local and global memory are defined as\nr (m) t = α (m) t M (m) t , (16)\nM (m) t = fwrite(M (m) t−1, α (m) t ,h (m) t ), (17)\nr (s) t = α (s) t−1M (s) t−1, (18)\nM (s) t = fwrite(M (s) t−1, α (s) t , r (m) t ), (19)\nwhere the superscript s represents the parameters are shared across different tasks; the superscript m represents that the parameters or variables are taskspecific for task m.\nIn ARC-II, the local memories enhance the capacity of memorizing, while global memory enables the information flowing from different tasks to interact sufficiently."

With the help of multi-task learning, the performances of these four tasks are improved by 1.8% (ARC-I) and 2.9% (ARC-II) on average relative to LSTM. We can find that the architecture of local-global hybrid external memory has better performances. The reason is that the global memory in ARC-I could store some task-specific information besides shared information, which maybe noisy to other tasks. Moreover, both of our proposed models outperform MT-CNN and MT-DNN, which indicates the effectiveness of our proposed shared mechanism. To give an intuitive evaluation of these results, we also list the following state-of-the-art neural models. With the help of utilizing the shared information of several related tasks, our results outperform most of state-of-the-art models. Although Tree-LSTM outperforms our method on SST-1, it needs an external parser to get the sentence topological structure. It is worth noticing that our models are generic and compatible with the other LSTM based\nmodels. For example, we can easily extend our models to incorporate the Tree-LSTM model."

Additionally, both models are bidirectional for better visualization. To get more insights into how the shared external memory influences the specific task, we plot and observe the evolving activation of fusion gates through time, which controls signals flowing from a shared external memory to task-specific output, to understand the behaviour of neurons.\nFor the sentence “It is a cookie-cutter movie, a cut-and-paste job.”, which has a negative sentiment, while the standard LSTM gives a wrong prediction due to not understanding the informative words “cookie-cutter” and “cut-and-paste”.\nIn contrast, our model makes a correct prediction and the reason can be inferred from the activation of\nfusion gates. As shown in Figure 3-(c), we can see clearly the neurons are activated much when they take input as “cookie-cutter” and “cut-and-paste”, which indicates much information in shared memory has be passed into LSTM, therefore enabling the model to give a correct prediction.\nAnother case “If you were not nearly moved to tears by a couple of scenes , you ’ve got ice water in your veins”, a subjunctive clause introduced by “if ”, has a positive sentiment.\nAs shown in Figure 3-(b,d), vanilla LSTM failed to capture the implicit meaning behind the sentence, while our model is sensitive to the pattern “If ... were not ...” and has an accurate understanding of the sentence, which indicates the shared memory mechanism can not only enrich the meaning of certain words, but teach some information of sentence structure to specific task."

In most of these models, the lower layers are shared across all tasks, while top layers are task-specific.\nCollobert and Weston (2008) used a shared representation for input words and solved different traditional NLP tasks within one framework. However,\nonly one lookup table is shared, and the other lookup tables and layers are task-specific.\nLiu et al. (2015b) developed a multi-task DNN for learning representations across multiple tasks. Their multi-task DNN approach combines tasks of query classification and ranking for web search. But the input of the model is bag-of-word representation, which loses the information of word order.\nMore recently, several multi-task encoderdecoder networks were also proposed for neural machine translation (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Firat et al., 2016), which can make use of cross-lingual information.\nUnlike these works, in this paper we design two neural architectures with shared memory for multitask learning, which can store useful information across the tasks.

However, in previous works, most models are learned separately based on single-task supervised objectives, which often suffer from insufficient training data. In this paper, we propose two deep architectures which can be trained jointly on multiple related tasks. More specifically, we augment neural model with an external memory, which is shared by several tasks. Experiments on two groups of text classification tasks show that our proposed architectures can improve the performance of a task with the help of other related tasks.",
