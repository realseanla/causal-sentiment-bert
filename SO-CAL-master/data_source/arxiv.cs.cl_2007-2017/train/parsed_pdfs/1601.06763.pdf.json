      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Humans are skilled at making sense of novel combinations of concepts, so to create artificial languages for implementation in AI systems, we must model this ability. Standard approaches to combining concepts, e.g. fuzzy set theory, have been shown to be inadequate [11]. Concepts formed through the combination of properties frequently have ‘emergent attributes’ [3] which cannot be explicated by decomposing the label into its constituent parts. We have developed a model of concept combination within the label semantics framework as given in [8, 10]. The model is inspired by and reflects results in [3], in which membership in a compound concept can be rendered as the weighted sum of memberships in individual concepts, however, it can also account for emergent attributes, where e.g. importance in a conjunctive concept is greater than the importance of an attribute in the constituent concepts. We implement a simple version of this model in a multi-agent simulation of language users, and show that the agents converge to shared combination weights, allowing effective communication. These weights are determined by the distribution of objects in the agents’ conceptual space. This provides a theoretical grounding to the proposal seen in the literature [2, 3, 6, 16] that complex concepts can be characterised as weighted sums of attributes. Further, it relates the weights in the combined concept to the external world. In this paper, we firstly summarise the theoretical framework we use (section 2), and in section 3 give a brief account of our model of concept combination. In section 4, we implement a simple version of our model in a multi-agent simulation of a community of language users in order to examine whether an how such a community is able to converge to shared combination weights. We give simulation methods and results, and analyse the behaviour of the\n1 University of Bristol, England, email: martha.lewis@bristol.ac.uk, j.lawry@bristol.ac.uk\nagents.

      "heading" : "2 BACKGROUND",
      "text" : "We model concepts within the label semantics framework [7, 8], combined with prototype theory [12] and the conceptual spaces model of concepts [2]. Prototype theory offers an alternative to the classical theory of concepts, basing categorization on proximity to a prototype. This approach is based on experimental results where human subjects were found to view membership in a concept as a matter of degree, with some objects having higher membership than others [12]. Fuzzy set theory [15], in which an object x has a graded membership µL(x) in a concept L, was proposed as a formalism for prototype theory. However, numerous objections to its suitability have been made [4, 3, 5, 11, 13].\nConceptual spaces theory renders concepts as convex regions of a conceptual space - a geometrical structure with quality dimensions and a distance metric. Examples are: the RGB colour cube, pictured in figure 1; physical dimensions of height, breadth and depth; or the taste tetrahedron. Since concepts are convex regions of such spaces, the centroid of such a region can naturally be viewed as the prototype of the concept.\nLabel semantics proposes that agents use a set of labels LA = {L1, ..., Ln} to describe a conceptual space Ω with distance metric d(x, x′). Labels Li are associated with prototypes Pi ⊆ Ω and uncertain thresholds εi, drawn from probability distributions δεi . The threshold εi captures the notion that an element x ∈ Ω is sufficiently close to Pi to be labelled Li. The membership of an object x in a concept Li is quantified by µLi(x), given by\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n06 76\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nJa n\n20 16\nµLi(x) = P (d(x, Pi) ≤ εi) = ∫ ∞ d(x,Pi) δεi(εi)dεi\nLabels can then be described as Li =<Pi, d(x, x′), δεi >. We illustrate this idea in figure 2."

      "heading" : "3 A HIERARCHICAL MODEL OF CONCEPT COMPOSITION",
      "text" : "Experiments in the psychological literature propose that human concept combination can in many cases be modelled as a weighted sum of attributes such as ‘has feathers’, ‘has a beak’ (for the concept ‘Bird’) [3]. These attributes differ from quality dimensions in conceptual spaces: they tend to be binary, complex, and multidimensional in themselves. We therefore view each attribute as a label in a continuous conceptual space Ωi and combine these labels in a binary conceptual space {0, 1}n illustrated in figure 3. In this binary conceptual space, a conjunction of such labels α = ∧n i=1±Li maps to a binary vector ~yα taking value 1 for positive labels Li and 0 for negated labels ¬Li (figure 4).\nWe treat membership in α in the binary conceptual space within the label semantics framework. So α is described in the binary space by α̃ =<~yα, d(~y, ~y′), δ> as before, and µα(y) = ∫∞ d(y,yα)\nδε(ε)dε. Since the dimensions of the space are weighted, some are considered more important than others. The presence or absence of some attributes may be relaxed. For example, ‘Bird’ might be characterised by (among others) the attributes ‘has feathers’, ‘has wings’, ‘flies’.\nThe attributes ‘has wings’ and ‘has feathers’ should be given more importance than ‘flies’. This is because various species of birds do not fly, so this attribute may be relaxed whilst still allowing something to be categorised as a bird. The effect this has is to create elliptical regions of the conceptual space, as illustrated in figure 5.\nThe distance metric between two vectors ~y, ~y′ in the binary space {0, 1}n is written H~λ(~y, ~y\n′) and defined as a weighted city block metric.\nThen, under certain constraints, membership in the combined concept α = ∧n i=1±Li is equal to the weighted sum of membership in each of the Li. This is stated in the following theorem:\nTheorem 1 (Compound Concepts). Let Li be attributes described by membership functions µLi(xi) in conceptual spaces Ωi. Let α be a conjunction of such attributes (or their negation): α = ∧n i=1±Li. If we combine these labels in a binary space {0, 1}n with α̃ =< ~yα, H~λ, U(0, λT )> where λT = ∑n i=1 λi, then we may calculate the membership in α in the space Ω1 × ...× Ωn by:\nµα(~x) = n∑ i=1 λi λT µ±Li(xi)\nwhere ~x ∈ Ω1 × ...× Ωn, xi ∈ Ωi.\nWe may further combine such compound concepts θ, ϕ in a higher level binary space. Then, again under certain constraints, θ̃ • ϕ̃ can be expressed in the continuous space as a weighted sum of θ and ϕ.\nTheorem 2 (Conjunction of Compound Concepts). Let θ̃ • ϕ̃ =< {(1, 1)}, H~w, δ >, where θ and ϕ are compound concepts as de-\nscribed in theorem 1, so that θ is characterised by membership function µθ(~x) = ∑n i=1\nλθi λθT µ±Li(xi) for ~x ∈ Ω1 × ...×Ωn, xi ∈ Ωi, and ϕ is similarly characterised. Then\nµθ̃•ϕ̃(~x) = n∑ i=1 ( w1λϕT λθi + w2λθT λϕi wTλθT λϕT )µ±Li(~x)\nwhere ~x ∈ Ω1 × ...× Ωn, xi ∈ Ωi.\nThese results show that under the constraint ε ∼ U(0, λT ), combining labels in a weighted binary conceptual space leads naturally to the creation of compound concepts as weighted sums of individual labels, reflecting results in [3]. An important aspect of these results is that non-compositional phenomena are seen, such as emergent attributes. These are attributes that become more important in the conjunction of two concepts than in either of the constituent concepts. A specific example seen in [3] is that the attribute‘talks’ becomes more important in the conjunction ‘Birds that are Pets’ than in either ‘Birds’ or ‘Pets’. Relaxing the constraint ε ∼ U(0, λT ) allows us to account for phenomena such as emergent attributes and overextension of concepts. In the current paper, however, we concentrate on a simple weighted sum combination and examine the properties of this type of combination in multi-agent simulations."

      "text" : "Characterising concepts as a weighted sum of attributes is seen throughout the literature [2, 3, 6, 16]. However, this has been proposed in an ad hoc fashion, and many concepts do not adhere to this formulation. Further, no mechanism for determining the weights has been proposed. We have developed a hierarchical model of concept combination from which the characterisation of concepts as a weighted sum of attributes arises naturally, summarised in section 2. We have implemented a simple version of this model within the language game framework in which agents make assertions that consist of a weighted sum of two constituent concepts. We have shown that within a multi-agent simulation of a community of such language users agents can converge to shared weightings (section 4.2). The weights λi to which the community of agents converge are related to the distribution of elements xj in the conceptual space, the membership functions µLj (xj) used for the constituent concepts, and the reliability w of the agents. We have derived explicit expressions re-\nlating the mean of the final weights λi across all agents to the distribution of the xj , µLj (xj), and w. In a modified updating model that is more amenable to analysis, we have derived expressions for the variance of the λi in terms of xj , µLj (xj), w and also h, the rate at which agents adopt other agents’ concepts. When h is small, i.e. agents are slower to adopt others’ concepts, the variance of the λi is smaller, perhaps indicating that more robust concepts are formed. We have also derived expressions for the speed at which the resting distribution of the λi are approached, dependent on the value of h (section 4.3). The results from this model indicate how weightings in a weighted sum of concepts can be related to the elements encountered in a conceptual space.\nThis model is of course extremely simple, and numerous extensions are ongoing. The use of more complex labels Li is under investigation, with labels being extended to multiple dimensions. We are also developing the updating algorithm in order to combine more than two labels and to include noise in agents’ labels. In previous work [1, 9], the agents in the simulations have had varying reliability w, which could be incorporated into these simulations. Future work will also incorporate the theoretical aspects alluded to in section 2 that account for non-compositional properties such as emergent attributes."

The expected value and the variance of these weights across agents may be predicted from the distribution of elements in the conceptual space, as determined by the underlying environment, together with the rate at which agents adopt others’ concepts.
