      "text" : "Natural language provides an efficient way for untrained human to instruct a robot to perform collaborative tasks, e.g., navigation and manipulation. However, learning to interpret the meaning of natural language commands is a challenging task (Dukes 2014; Perera and Allen 2013; Chen and Mooney 2011), especially when the robot has little or no prior knowledge of the phrasal expressions in natural language. Due to high flexibility of natural language, it is non-trivial for a robot to cover all the phrasal expressions in natural language when its interpretation module is initially built.\nPopular crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk, provide a fast and cheap way to collect interactive data from participants in a wide range of different communities. Hence, simulating the human machine interaction process for information extraction on crowdsourcing platforms has attracted lots of research interests (Nguyen, Wallace, and Lease 2015; Hladká, Hana, and Luksová 2014; Goldberg, Wang, and Kraska 2013). To encourage the diversity of robotic commands, we simulate the interactive process between a robot and various untrained users on Amazon Mechanical Turk, and collect robotic commands during the process. We further apply a phrase-based machine translation model to mapping natural language command to a robotic language that can be understood by a robot.\nCopyright c© 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

      "text" : "To tackle the problem of translating natural language commands to language that can be understood by robots, we first define a robot language that consists of predefined key concepts in the robotic task domains. For example, in the navigation task domain, we define the following key concepts.\n• Action:= navigate • Object:= traffic barrel | building | car • Relation:= left | right | front | back Each robot language command can be deterministically constructed by a combination of key concepts in the task domains. See Figure 1 for an illustration. We then adapt a phrase-based machine translation model to translate robotic commands from natural language to the robot language. For the phrase-based machine translation model, the key component is the extracted phrase table that stores several lexical entries. For a particular input (source-language) sentence s = s1 · · · sn, each lexical entry is defined as a tuple (b, e, r), specifying that the span sb · · · se in the sourcelanguage sentence can be translated as the target-language string r. For each lexical entry p = (b, e, r), we estimate a score g(p) ∈ R that measures the likelihood of translating the span to the target language string by relative frequency under the translation model. For a given lexicon entry p, b(p), e(p), r(p) denote its three components respectively. A derivation y of a source-language sentence is defined as a finite sequence of phrases, p1, p2 · · · pL. For any derivation y, r(y) refers to the translation sentence constructed by concatenating the strings r(p1), r(p2), · · · r(pL). For a sourcelanguage sentence s, we denote Y(s) as a set of possible derivations of s.\nBased on the above notations, we aim to extract lexical entries from parallel textual corpus collected on crowdsourcing platforms, and seek the optimal derivation y∗ using beam search for the maximum derivation score f(y∗) among all possible derivations Y(s) under a phrase-based translation model.\nIn Equation 1, the score f(y) of a derivation y consists of three parts: (1) h(r(y)) is the log-probability of the target string r(y) under a smoothed trigram language model; (2) g(pk) is the score of pk under a translation model; (3) |e(pk)+1− b(pk+1)| is the distortion penalty for reordering\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n02 54\n9v 3\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nN ov\n2 01\n6\nword alignments between source and target languages.\nf(y) = whh(r(y)) + wg L∑ k=1 g(pk) + wd L−1∑ k=1 |e(pk) + 1− b(pk+1)|\n(1)\nwhere wh, wg and wd are the weights of the scores given by the language model, the translation model and the distortion penalty respectively. Hence the optimal derivation of a source-language sentence s can be obtained by argmaxy∈Y(s) f(y)."

      "text" : "By showing an image that depicts the behaviour of a robot, a turker is first asked to give a command in English (denoted as s) that clearly indicates the spatial information between objects in the environment for a robot. Next, the turker is shown some robotic concepts in several drop-down lists, and asked to select the correct robotic concepts that can be used to construct a robotic command (denoted as r) for the same image. Finally we simulate the scenario where the robot can actively ask for a paraphrase sentence (denoted as t) of the robotic command r in order to help it understand s. Totally we collect 88 tuples of (s, t, r) for navigation task and 120 tuples of (s, t, r) tuples for manipulation task."

      "text" : "To investigate the possibility of using paraphrase sentences to enhance the phrase-based machine translation, we first use Moses to extract parallel phrases between s and r. Then we use Moses to extract parallel phrases between t and r. Table 1 shows the total number of extracted lexical entries when we translate from s to r and from t to r. Comparing the second column with the third one in Table 1, we observe that more lexical entries are extracted from parallel sentences between t and r than those between s and r. This convinces our idea that turkers usually paraphrase natural language commands that are more semantically closed to the robot language commands after the robotic concepts are shown to them. Table 2 shows some lexical entries extracted from natural language commands t paired with robot language commands r. We observe that the extracted lexical entries capture the similarity between source-language phrases and target-language phrases, thus enabling many-toone mapping from syntactic variants in natural language to unique robotic concepts.\nBy optimizing the objective function in Equation 1, we generate the translated robot language sentence using the\nextracted lexical entries. In Table 3, we show two translation results of the examples used in Figure 1. In the first result, the machine translation model can successfully translate the natural language command to the correct robot language command. While in the second result, the translation is not completely correct because the natural language command contains the detail steps for the navigation task. Mapping detail descriptions to highly abstract robot concepts requires more sophisticated semantic reasoning over the natural language. We leave it as our future work."

      "text" : "In this paper, we simulate the human robot communication on Amazon Mechanical Turk and collect robotic commands for navigation and manipulation tasks using crowdsourcing. We further investigate the possibility of bridging the gap between natural language command and robot language command using paraphrasing. We will conduct our future work in several challenging aspects. First, lexical entries extracted from different but similar robotic tasks can be shared across tasks. Second, machine teaching by paraphrasing can be integrated with active learning techniques. Robots can perform reasoning over the confusing phrases and actively ask their human partners for paraphrasing."
