      "text" : "Computer languages are defined based on particular grammar, for example C, Pascal etc. Computer processing of natural languages has become an application area such as natural language processing, Machine translation etc.Natural languages are to be defined with the grammer.\nPanini defined Sanskrit grammar with 4000 rules long back in sixth century B.C. [4]. The rules of Panini’s Sanskrit grammar contain uncertainty. Computer processing of this grammar is very difficult unless uncertainty is eliminated. There are many logics available to deal with uncertainty like fuzzy logic, probabilistic logic etc.\nFuzzy logic and reasoning [7, 8, 13, 14] are discussed to deal with uncertainty in the rules of Panini’s Sanskrit grammar. The Paninian approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP) is reviewed and compared with the current computer-based understanding systems [6, 12, 15]. The Paninian-style generative rules and meta-rules could assist in further advances in NLP."

      "text" : "Zadeh[9] proposed Fuzzy logic to deal with Uncertain and Incomplete information. Here we discuss Fuzzy logic briefly and later we apply it for Panini’s Sanskrit Grammar [2,3].\nZadeh[9] has introduced Fuzzy set as a model to deal with imprecise, inconsistent and inexact information. Fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grade of membership.\nThe Fuzzy set A of X is characterized by its\nmembership function A = µA(x ) and ranging values in the unit interval [0, 1]\nµA(x ): X [0, 1], x Є X, where X is Universe of discourse. or A = µA(x 1)/x1 + µA(x 2)/x2 + … + µA(x n)/xn\nWhere “+” is union For instance, x is Tall is defined as Tall = µTall(x) [0, 1], where “Tall” is fuzzy set. Tall = 0.56/x1 + 0.6/x2 + 0.65/x3 + 0.67/x4 + 0.69/x5 The combination of Fuzzy sets are given as follows AΛB = min {µA(x), µB(x)}/x (disjunction) AVB = max {µA(x), µB(x)}/x (conjunction) A’ = 1 - µA(x)/x (negation) A  B= max {1 - µA(x), µB(x)}/x (implication) µA(x, y)= {µA(x) X µB(y)}/x,y = min{µA(x) X µB(y)}/x,y A o R = max {µA(x), µA(x, y)}/x where R(x, y) is Fuzzy relation and “o” is composition The propositions may contain quantifiers. Square operator is used for ‘very’, ‘most’ (concentration). The square root operator is used for ‘more or less’ (diffusion). For instance, µvery young(x) = µyoung(x)2 µnotvery young(x) = 1-µyoung(x)2 µmore or less young(x) = µyoung(x)1/2\nFuzzy reasoning[8] is a drawing conclusion from Fuzzy propositions using fuzzy inference rules. Some of the Fuzzy inference rules are given bellow R1: x is A R2: x is A x and y are B x or y is B _____________ ____________ y is AΛB y is AVB R3: x and y are A R4: x or y are A y and z are B y or z are B ______________ ____________ y and z are B x or z are B\nR5: x is A if x is A then y is B _______________ y is A o (AB)"

      "text" : "Grammars are defined to either programming languages or natural languages. Computer processing of natural languages and language translations is an application area in the computer field. Indian languages are having long history. Panini proposed grammar with 4000 rules for Sanskrit. These are categorized into different sets. One of them is Syadvada set. The Syadvada set contains seven possibilities they are given below. 1. May be, it is. (Syadasti) 2. May be, it is not (Sada nasti) 3. May be it is, and it is not at different times (Syad astinasti) 4. May be it is and it is not at the same time and is indescribable (Syad avaktavya) 5. May be it is, and yet indescribable (Syad asti avaktavya) 6. May be it is not, and also indescribable (Syad asti nasti avaktavya) 7. May be it is, and it is not and also indescribable ( Syad\nasti nasti avaktavya) The above rules contain uncertainty. The uncertainty has to be eliminated for further computer processing of the Sanskrit language. Fuzzy logic can be used to eliminate the uncertainty. The fuzzy logic is applied for the above rules to eliminate uncertainty and the rules are given below.\n1. May be, it is. ( Syadasti) µSyadasti(x) → [0,1]\n2. May be, it is not (Syad nasti) Syad nasti = 1 - µSyadasti(x) 3. May be it is, and it is not at different times (Syad asti-nasti)\nµSyadasti(x) Λ (1 - µSyadasti(x) o µdifferent times (x,y)) where “o” is composition and “y” is time variable\n4. May be it is and it is not at the same time and is indescribable (µSyadasti(x) Λ (1 - µSyadasti(x) o µdifferent times (x,t)) Λ µdifferent times (x)\nwhere “t” is constant. 5. May be it is and yet indescribable. (Syad asti\navaktavya) µSyadasti(x) Λ µdifferent times (x)1/2 where yet is diffusion\n6. May be it is not, and also indescribable (yad asti nasti avaktavya) (1- µSyadasti(x)) Λ µdifferent times (x)\n7. May be it is, and it is not and also indescribable (Syad asti nasti avaktavya) µSyadasti(x) Λ (1- µSyadasti(x) Λ µdifferent times (x)) This fuzzy represention of the sanskrit sentences shall be further used for fuzzy reasoning [7, 13, 14, 16].\nFor istance, consider two sentences\nMay be, it is. (Syadasti) May be it is, and it is not at different times (Syad astinasti) The inference will be given as using R1\n“it is not at different times “ with the fuzziness (Syadasti) Λ (Syad asti-nasti)"

The rules contain uncertainty information. The elimination of uncertainty information with Fuzzy logic is discussed. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy reasoning are discussed to deal with uncertainty information in Panini’s Sanskrit Grammar to make it convenient for further computer processing.
