For instance, a word cooccurrence model like n-grams or a bag-of-words model like TF-IDF.\nThe motivation of this research project is to identify and survey the techniques that use neural networks and study them in juxtaposition with the traditional text feature extraction models to show their differences in approach.\nFeature extraction of text can be used for a multitude of applications including - but not limited to - unsupervised semantic similarity detection, article classification and sentiment analysis.\nThe goal of this project is to document of the differences, advantages and drawbacks in the domain of feature extraction from text data using neural networks. It also sketches the evolution of such techniques over time.\nThis report could serve as a quick cheat-sheet for engineers looking to build a text classification or regression pipeline, as the discussion (Section 15) would serve to map a use-cases to feature extraction implementation specifics."

It is particularly obvious in the case when one wants to model the joint distribution between many discrete random variables (such as words in a sentence, or discrete attributes in a datamining task).\n• State-of-the art results are typically obtained using trigrams.\n• Language generation via substitution of semantically similar language constructs of existing sentences can be done via sharedparameter multi-layer neural networks.\n• The objective of this paper is to obtain realvalued vector sequences of words and learn a joint probability function for those sequences of words alongside the feature vector, and hence, jointly learn both the real-valued vector representation and the parameters of the probability distribution.\n• This probability function can be tuned in or-\nder to maximize log-likelihood of the training data, while penalizing the cost function, similar to the penalty term one used in Ridge regression.\n• This will ensure that semantically similar words end up with an almost equivalent feature vectors, called learned distributed feature vectors.\n• A challenge with modeling discrete variables like a sentence structure as opposed to a continuous value is that the continuous valued function can be assumed to have some form of locality, but the same assumption cannot be made in case of discrete functions.\n• N-gram models try to achieve a statistical modeling of languages by calculating the conditional probabilities of each possible word that can follow a set of n preceding words.\n• New sequences of words can be generated by effectively gluing together the popular combinations i.e. n-grams with very high frequency counts."

These representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words(Mikolov et al., 2013c). This is one of the seminal papers that led to the creation of Word2Vec, which is a state-of-the-art word embedding tool(Mikolov et al., 2013a).\nDescription: • A defining feature of neural network lan-\nguage models is their representation of words as high dimensional real-valued vectors.\n• In this model, words are converted via a learned lookup-table into real valued vectors which are used as the inputs to a neural network.\n• One of the main advantages of these models is that the distributed representation achieves a level of generalization that is not possible with classical n-gram language models.\n• The word representations in this paper are learned by a recurrent neural network language model.\n• The input vector w(t) represents input word at time t encoded using 1-of-N coding, and the output layer y(t) produces a probability distribution over words. The hidden layer s(t) maintains a representation of the sentence history. The input vector w(t) and the output vector y(t) have dimensionality of the vocabulary.\n• The values in the hidden and output layers are computed as follows:\ns(t) = f(Uw(t) +Ws(t− 1))\ny(t) = g(V s(t))\nwhere f(z) = 11+e−z and g(zm) = ezm∑ k ezk\n• One of the biggest features of having realvalued feature representations is the ability\nto compute the answer to an analogy question a : b; c : d where d is unknown. With continuous space word representations, this becomes as simple as calculating\ny = xb − xa + xc\ny is the best estimate of d that the model could compute.

By training a neural language model (NLM) and integrating RNN structures for complex words, they utilize contextual information to learn morphemic semantics and their compositional properties.\n• Discusses a problem that the Word2Vec syntactic relations like\nxapples − xapple ≈ xcars − xcar\nmight not hold true if the vector representation of a rare word is inaccurate to begin with.\n• morphoRNN operates at the morpheme level rather than the word level.

A couple of methods suggested to mitigate this is to use hierarchical versions of the softmax output activation units, or to refrain from per-\nforming normalization at the final layer altogether.\nDescription: • The ideas presented in this paper build on the\nprevious ideas presented by (Bengio et al., 2003).\n• The objective was to obtain high-quality word embeddings that capture the syntactic and semantic characteristics of words in a manner that allows algebraic operations to proxy the distances in vector space.\nman− woman = king − queen\nor tell − told = walk − walked\n• The training time here scales with the dimensionality of the learned feature vectors and not on the volume of training data.\n• The approach attempts to find a distributed vector representation of values as opposed to a continuous representation of values as computed by methods like LSA and LDA.\n• The models are trained using stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation.\n• The RNN models are touted to have an inherently better representation of sentence structure for complex patterns, without the need to specify context length.\n• To allow for the distributed training of the data, the framework DistBelief was used with multiple replicas of the model. Adagrad was utilized for asynchronous gradient descent.\n• Two distinct models were conceptualized for the training of the word vectors based on context, both of which are continuous and distributed representations of words. These are illustrated in Figure 3.\n– Continuous Bag-of-Words model: This model uses the context of a word i.e. the words that precede and follow it, to predict the current word.\n– Skip-gram model: This model uses the current word to predict the context it appeared in.\nThe experimental results show that the CBOW and skip-gram models consistently out-perform the then state-of-the-art models.

      "text" : "Goal: This paper builds upon the idea of the Word2Vec skip-gram model, and presents optimizations in terms of quality of the word embeddings as well as speed-ups while training. It also proposes an alternative to the hierarchical softmax final layer, called negative sampling(Mikolov et al., 2013b).\nDescription: • One of the optimizations suggested is to sub-\nsample the training set words to achieve a speed-up in model training.\n• Given a sequence of training words [w1, w2, w3, ..., wT ], the objective of the skip-gram model is to maximize the average log probability shown in Equation 3\n1\nT T∑ t=1 ∑ −c≤j≤c;j 6=0 logP (wt+j , wt) (3)\nwhere c is the window or context surrounding the current word being trained on.\n• As introduced by (Morin and Bengio, 2005), a computationally efficient approximation of the full softmax is the hierarchical softmax. The hierarchical softmax uses a binary tree representation of the output layer with the W words as its leaves and, for each node, explicitly represents the relative probabilities of its\nchild nodes. These define a random walk that assigns probabilities to words.\n• The authors use a binary Huffman tree, as it assigns short codes to the frequent words which results in fast training. It has been observed before that grouping words together by their frequency works well as a very simple speedup technique for the neural network based language models.\n• Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE), which is an alternative to hierarchical softmax, posits that a good model should be able to differentiate data from noise by means of logistic regression.\n• To counter the imbalance between the rare and frequent words, we used a simple subsampling approach: each word within the training set is discarded with probability computed by the below formula.\nP (wi) = 1− √ t\nf(wi)\nThis is similar to a dropout of neurons from the network, except that it is statistically more likely that frequent words are removed from the corpus by virtue of this method.\n• Discarding the frequently occurring words allows for a reduction in computational and memory cost.\n• The individual words can easily be coalesced into phrases using unigram and bigram frequency counts, as shown below.\nscore(wi, wj) = count(wiwj)− δ\ncount(wi) ∗ count(wj)\n• Another interesting property of learning these distributed representations is that the word and phrase representations learned by the skip-gram model exhibit a linear structure that makes it possible to perform precise analogical reasoning using simple vector arithmetic."

Methods like skip-gram may do better on analogy tasks, but they poorly utilize the statistics of the corpus since they train on separate local context windows instead of on global co-occurrence counts.\n• The relationship between any arbitrary words can be examined by studying the ratio of their co-occurrence probabilities with various probe words.\n• The authors suggest that the appropriate starting point for word vector learning should be with ratios of co-occurrence probabilities rather than the probabilities themselves.\n• We can express this co-occurrence relation as shown below\nF ((wi − wj)Twk) = Pik Pjk\nThis makes the feature matrix interchangeable with its transpose.\n• An additive shift is included in the logarithm,\nlog(Xik)⇒ log(1 +Xik)\nwhich maintains the sparsity of X while avoiding the divergences while computing the co-occurrences matrix.\n• The model obtained in the paper could be compared to a global skip-gram model as opposed to a fixed window-size skipgram model as proposed by (Mikolov et al., 2013a).\n• The performance seems to increase monotonically with an increase in training data."

      "heading" : "15 Discussion",
      "text" : "Following the literature survey, this section revisits the original research questions and provides a succinct summary that can be inferred from the experimental results and conclusions drawn from the original papers.\nRQ1 What are the relatively simple statistical techniques to extract features from text? Word count frequency models like n-gram and simple bag-of-words models such as TFIDF are still the easiest tools to obtain an numeric vector representation of text.\nRQ2 Is there any inherent benefit to using neural networks as opposed to the simple methods? The benefit of using neural nets primarily is their ability to identify obscure patterns, and remain flexible enough for a varied set of application areas from topic classification to syntax parse-tree generation.\nRQ3 What are the trade-offs that neural networks incur as opposed to the simple methods? The trade-offs are typically expressed in terms of computational cost and memory usage, although model complexity is a factor too, given that neural nets can be trained to learn arbitrarily complex generative models.\nRQ4 How do the different techniques compare to each other in terms of performance and accuracy? This question can only be answered subjectively as it varies from application to application. Typically, document similarity can be tackled with a simple statistical approach like TF-IDF. CNNs inherently model input data in a manner that iteratively reduces the dimensionality, making it a great fit for topic classification and document summarization. RNNs are great at modeling sequences of text, which make them apt for language syntax modeling. Amongst the frameworks, GloVe’s pre-trained word-embeddings perform better than vanilla Word2Vec, which is considered state-of-the-art.\nRQ5 In what use-cases do the trade-offs outweigh the benefits of neural networks? As explained for the previous question, for a simple information retrieval use case such as document ranking, models such as TFIDF, and word PMI (pointwise mutual information) are sufficient, and neural networks would be overkill in such use-cases."
