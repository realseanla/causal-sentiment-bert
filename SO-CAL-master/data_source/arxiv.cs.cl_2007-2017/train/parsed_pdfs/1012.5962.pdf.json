The annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The annotations are based on a set of general rules that makes the frequency of annotations not dramatically high (despite the chaotic orthography of English). This makes the reader easily associate annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after reading a few pages of _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^, and can take advantage from that\nknowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future. These features pave the way for multiple applications. _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ can be used as a tool for teachers and parents when English-speaking children learn English orthography or simply when they start reading. Annotated textbooks, tales, dictionaries and any other material can make English orthography less painful. _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ can also be very\nuseful for students of English as a foreign language, since pronunciation is terribly troublesome for them, because they need to learn the meaning, the spelling and the pronunciation for each word they learn, and the pronunciation does not improve at all by reading. This is so because we can only see the spelling and infer the meaning, but books do not provide the correct pronunciation for each word. In fact, incorrect pronunciation (we are not referring here to a bad accent or intonation) persists in people who has lived in an English-speaking country for decades, because the true pronunciation is never shown (unless the IPA transcription is looked up in a dictionary), just heard in different contexts and situations. Finally, _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ can also be very practical for any regular\nuser (native or not) of the English language, very especially when facing new (especially technical) words and they have doubts about their pronunciation. In this document we introduce the rules for annotations and its symbols. This document is not intended for a general audience, and the explanations are focussed to precisely understand how the annotation system works. It is obvious that if the system has to be explained to a final user, a shorter and simpler manual should be issued for that. In any case, for learning _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^, the best thing is to take a look at\nthe examples. There is a section in this document with some annotated texts. It is recommended to take a quick look at them before getting into details.

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "English is the lingua franca of the world. This means that it is used by many people from different countries and native languages. This also means that it is used with many different proficiency levels. A proper coordination between written and spoken English is only achieved by the few. The main reason for this is the deficient spelling system of the English language. We are not going to discuss on the many causes (the Great Vowel Shift, the lack of an Academy of the English Language acting as regulator, the nature of English as an amalgamation of words from many different languages). The issue is that it is a fact that English spelling is problematic. But it is also a fact that any spelling reform (shallow or deep) has been stubbornly doomed to failure.\nSpanning from several centuries ago, reforms can be distinguished into those which focus on spelling and those which focus on pronunciation. Many languages in the world based on the Roman alphabet produce one single pronunciation from a given spelling (Spanish, German, Italian, and French, are examples of this), but almost no language produce one single spelling given a pronunciation (Italian is perhaps the closest one to that goal among the major European languages). Additionally, there have been minor reform proposals (as those undertook by American English in the nineteenth century), major ones (Webster proposed to go further beyond) and drastic reforms. There are also several organisations for English spelling reform1.\nIf we take a look at some of the most recent proposals, we can get an idea of why they failed. For instance, Basic Roman Spelling [2] preserves the alphabet (“Luk thru dha senta av dha muun hwen it iz bluu” Ñ “look through the center of the moon when it is blue”), while it oversimplifies pronunciation, in order to supposedly give one-to-one correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. Similarly, Interspel [10] preserves the alphabet but it is closer to\n1 One of them is the spelling society: http://www.spellingsociety.org/aboutsss/position.php, which does not currently advocate any specific solution, but supports any study and progress on this issue.\nthe original English spelling: “English will luse its position as the wurld’s lingua franca, which it inherited for politicl and comercial reasns. The rest of the wurld has problems lerning two English languajes, the spoken and the written, when it shud be posibl to lern the one from the other”. The one-to-one correspondence is lost, but pronunciation can be better determined (but not unambiguously). The first feeling after reading this is that a lot of words should be corrected. We have devoted a lot of effort to learn the correct spelling of each word in order to mangle everything again. Other approaches try to avoid this confusion by using extended languages, such as John Malone’s Unifon [4], but going out from the Latin alphabet is a strong bet. Additionally, many of these reforms do not produce good pronunciations in some cases. For instance, most of them ignore or give a secondary role to stress, which is one of the main issues for a good pronunciation of English vowels, and to distinguish between many pairs (verb/noun), such as ‘a present’ and ‘to present’ (which are still different because of the vowel sounds), as well as ‘an imprint’ and ‘to imprint’ (which have exactly the same vowel pronunciation, only differing on the stress).\nThere are several problems about these proposals. They try to change the language spelling. This requires a broad consensus and an academy or working group to undertake them. Even in languages where minor changes have been made (e.g. Portuguese and German undertook minor reforms in the last decades), this has been difficult and has required almost a generation to settle. Any reform involves that old texts become obsolete and a lot of retraining is required, as well as reprinting textbooks, documents and almost every written thing. But even ignoring all these major problems, there are many others, such as the loss of word etymology. This loss of word origin is not a picky thing for linguists; most people would not care about ‘solid’ being spelled as ‘sollid’, even if it is not etymological, because it comes from Latin ‘solidus’. The problem is that any reform which would not preserve some basic etymology would make the learning of some words difficult to native speakers and especially foreigners (e.g. ‘fone’ is more difficult to recognise than ‘phone’, ‘Rusha’ than ‘Russia’, ‘Krischan’ than ‘Christian’, ‘memmeri’ than ‘memory’, ‘langwidge’ than ‘language’, ‘Arkeeopteriks’ than ‘Archaeopteryx’, ‘owshan’ than ‘ocean’). This would obscure the relation among words with the same root. For instance, ‘sine’ (for ‘sign’) would make its relation with ‘signal’ much less evident. In addition, thousands of homographs (‘to , ‘two’ and ‘too’; ‘male’ and ‘mail’; ‘eye’, ‘I’; ‘by’, ‘buy’ and ‘bye’; etc) would be created. Another problem would be the incorporation of new technical (e.g. biological and chemical) words. For instance, ‘Arkeeopteriks’ and ‘Akwa’ (for ‘Aqua’) would be very awkward. And, finally, one above all: we like the language as it is and we want to learn and work with one language, not with two languages (the old and the new). And finally, any spelling reform would have a dramatic impact in computational linguistics and thousands of computer applications which process English automatically, such as editors, spell checkers, searching engines, etc. All these reasons are much more important that the reluctance of users, the lack of consensus, the non-existence of an Academy of the English Language, or the Great Vowel Shift. English spelling reforms have\nnot succeeded simply because it is not true that everything would be beneficial once the transformation would be completed.\nSo, is there any way to systematically know how a word in English is pronounced without a spelling reform? Yes, of course. This is called the phonetic transcription of a word. For instance, we can look up any word in the dictionary and see its IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) transcription, where it says that ‘explanation’ is pronounced [ Ekspl@\"neIS@n]. Therefore, the English pronunciation problem seems to be solved2. However, when we learn the language or we read a book in English, we do not check the phonetics for every word. Computer technology makes it possible to add an extra line to each line of text with the IPA transcription. However, this would double book sizes and would make readers switch repeatedly from English to IPA and vice-versa, as having a book in two languages or with subtitles.\nInstead of that, our proposal is to keep English unaltered, but to annotate its pronunciation over the very word, not apart from it. We can, of course, find some precedents. For instance, many editions of the Webster’s Elementary Spellingbook (e.g. the 1836’s edition [9]) contained a set of diacriticals which helped to learn the pronunciation of each word. The words were not respelled. Instead, “marked letters” were used, as in ‘sȯn’ or ‘ḡet’. Some other dictionaries also used this philosophy until the mid XXth century, when respelling became more popular (and the pronunciation of ‘son’ was explained by respelling it like ‘sun’, and ‘pleasure’ was respelled as ‘plesher’). Of course, things changed dramatically when the IPA popularised, and even though the respelled pronunciation is still common in dictionaries (most especially in America), the idea of pronunciation without respelling (the “marked letters’) faded away. Apart from (or out of) English language textbooks and dictionaries, none of these systems have been used profusely, because the systems have not been designed to mark (or annotate) a whole text, but to clarify the pronunciation of some difficult words. In fact, it is still seen in some editions of the Bible, since most of their readers have difficulties on the pronunciation (and meaning) of words which are not frequent nowadays. There are also some children books which colour some letters to show their pronunciation, based on the ambitious (and once popular) respelling system known as the Initial Teaching Alphabet [3].\nHowever, these approaches (including the ones used in old dictionaries) were incomplete (not all possible sounds were covered) and unsystematic (not intended to be used for every word) in such a way that an entire document can be annotated. The reason-why is that these approaches had almost no by-default rules, and using them for a whole document would have rendered it full of annotations, at a ratio of many annotations per word (something similar to what is shown in Table 1 (left)). For instance, there were marks for words such as ‘cat’ and ‘cell’, even though they look pretty regular to any English speaker. Additionally, they were not considering a possible automation of the process, since these\n2 In fact, we could write IPA instead (the most drastic and accurate spelling reform one can imagine), and we would have a one-to-one correspondence between spelling and pronunciation.\ndiacritical systems were conceived before computers spread over. And, finally, they were created at a moment when English phonology was not so well studied as it is today, and were typically focussed on one single dialect of English.\nOur proposal is not just a modernisation of these early approaches to pronunciation without respelling. It is different in philosophy and basic principles. The basic idea is to develop a set of symbols (marks or annotations, whatever we want to call them), but also a set of rules, in such a way that we can annotate some words which do not follow the rules, but we keep the parts that are regular free from annotations. With this, we do have the pronunciation, we also have the original English word, and we also see the parts which have a regular pronunciation and which parts do not. The idea is to devise a transformation code, in such a way that using these rules and the annotations we can extract the right pronunciation from a word spelling. The only caveat is that, as we will see, even with a well-established set of annotations and rules, an English word can be annotated in several different ways to get the same pronunciation. The solution, as we will see, is to use the way which minimises the annotations (or some measure of the annotation cost).\nAs a result, _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ is:\n– A system of diacritical annotations which are placed around (above and below) the words to indicate its true pronunciation. So it follows the old motto “pronunciation without respelling”.\n– A set of rules which are designed to reduce the proportion of required annotations. This keeps the text as clear as possible but, very importantly, helps to understand the spelling rules in English. A reader can focus on the general rules since exceptions are just annotated. – While reading _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^, you are reading English. Annotations\ncan be ignored by a proficient reader.\n– Every new word which is learned when reading an annotated book comes with both its English spelling and its pronunciation. When a person reads in _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^, she can improve and learn both spelling and pronunci-\nation. Both things at the same time and in the same space.\n– No rule can depend on the meaning of the word, its position or its kind (plural/singular, word origin). For instance, annotations must be necessary different for homographs which are not homophones, as in ‘a present’ and ‘to present’, or ‘to read’ and ‘have read’.\n– Because of the previous item, the pronunciation (interpretation) process can of course be automated, so an annotated document can be pronounced automatically by a robotic or a computer system3.\n3 There are many voice synthesisers which have disambiguation tools so ‘I read now’ and ‘I read yesterday’ are well pronounced. However, these synthesisers fail in other more complex cases, so being amusing for some users but crossing some others (e.g. blind people). This would not happen for an annotated text since disambiguation would not be needed here. Apart from that, there are intonation issues in voice synthesisers we are not concerned here.\n– The annotation (coding) process can also be automated4, so electronic documents and books can be converted from plain (traditional) English into _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^, to be printed on paper or read over an e-book or a\ncomputer screen. – It tries to be compatible with most English dialects, while also allowing\ndifferent annotations in case a word is pronounced differently. – Diacritical symbols try to reuse many symbols which are common in other\nlanguages or even in English. Additionally, although we introduce diacritics which span over more than one symbol, there is always an equivalence to one-character annotations. This eases typographic issues when editing and printing annotated documents.\nRegarding the accents, the annotations must be able to distinguish between sounds which are different in at least one dialect. For instance, the derived pronunciations of ‘cot’ and ‘caught’ must be different, even though some speakers do not distinguish them. Other speakers may merge ‘caught’ and ‘court’, and similarly we may find homophones in some dialects which do not take place for others, such as in father/farther, formally/formerly, tune/toon, Lenin/Lennon, etc. Rhotic accents and their way to pronounce the vowels before an ‘r’ and the ‘r’ itself suffer from many mergers. Our system can distinguish between ‘merry’, ‘marry’, ‘Mary’, ‘fairy’ and ‘merely’, even though some speakers can pronounce ‘merry’, ‘Mary’ and ‘marry’ in the same way. It also distinguishes between ‘hurry’ and ‘furry’. This may give the impression that we favour Received Pronunciation (RP, the standard pronunciation for English in England) over General American (GA, the standard pronunciation for American English). However, this is just a consequence of RP having more phonemes than GA. In some other cases, the annotation must give preference for one dialect, and we have to decide whether we annotate ‘glance’ with the ‘a’ in ‘father’ or with the ‘a’ in ‘cat’.\nWe do not distinguish, however, between strong and weak forms for words such as ‘the’, ‘a’, ‘to’, ‘and’, ‘of’, etc. Even though, in some cases, the weak form is preferred (especially for ‘the’ and ‘a’), we assume every word is independent and we annotate it as if it were pronounced independently. Consequently, we annotate the word ‘you’ as _yo\n‰ u^ ([ju:]), even though it can be pronounced as [j@].\nNonetheless, our annotation system typically changes the default pronunciation of vowels depending on whether they are stressed or not. Consequently, our system is implicitly consistent with the strong and weak forms for many words. For some very common words such as the word ‘the’, we have incorporated a rule (by the way, a rule that any English speaker knows).\nOnce explained what our proposal is, it is still convenient to state what _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ is not:\n– A spelling reform. English spelling is left untouched. – A phonetic transcription. Most of the spelling is reused to make up the final\npicture. Many words do not require annotations.\n4 Disambiguation tools would be needed here, but note that a text have to be annotated once but then it can be read thousands of times.\n– A set of rules for computer applications. Even though an important factor for the success of this proposal is to provide computer programs which automatically annotate books and documents, this will be just a tool (an important one), but not the core of the project. _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ can\nbe used to teach and learn English pronunciation and spelling, without the computer annotator.\nWe have mentioned the advantages and applications of _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ in the abstract. Perhaps the most direct application is for non-native speakers, who struggle to learn the correct pronunciation of many words they have read many times but only occasionally or carelessly heard. In fact, native speakers have to suffer the terrible pronunciation of beginners, which are unable to coordinate their written English with their poor spoken English (or vice versa). A great proportion of members in international organisations, conferences, multinational companies, etc., come from non-English speaking countries. Even though they have a good proficiency of written English (in some cases better than many native speakers), their pronunciation is not only incorrect, but full of particularities from their own languages, which makes their cross understanding more difficult (even for the native speakers).\nFor native speakers, this may be useful as well. According to several studies (e.g. [6]), children take more time to read in English than those in other languages such as Spanish, German or Italian. Explicitly connecting spelling with pronunciations through a set of rules and symbols could be very useful for children5. Furthermore, even after years of school, (adult) native speakers still do have difficulties with foreign words and technical words, and some words are pronounced differently depending on their region or their social level. The spelling system in English does not put many constraints on how a word should be pronounced, given its spelling6. This has produced that many new, commercial, foreign and technical words have different pronunciations. For instance, words such as ‘Linux’, ‘Lego’ c©, ‘genre’, ‘evolution’, ‘Neanderthal’, ‘amino’ have several pronunciations.\nOne of the key issues in this proposal has been to find a compromise between rules and required annotations. Of course, rules have to be learned (or inferred from annotated text). Thus, in order to avoid this effort, we could just explain the meaning of each annotation and use them profusely (because there would be no rules at all to rely on in order to save up some annotations). This would imply that most words would require several annotations. In fact, every vowel and many consonants would require the annotation at every position. Alternatively, we could make an exhaustive set of rules in order to avoid as many annotations as possible. The problem of this approach is that we may finally make up a much\n5 Phonetic proposals to reading (which were very popular in the 1960s), such as the Initial Teaching Alphabet [3] were unsuccessful partly because the system should be abandoned and switched to ‘real’ English at some stage of the process. 6 In fact, it can be argued whether English spelling is something in between ideographic writing systems and phonetic writing system, with words in English being mere mnemonics.\ntoo complex set of rules. This would make the reading of an annotated text a difficult task, apart from the time which would be required to learn the rules.\nThe idea is to find a trade-off between the two extremes. We will develop a set of rules, as general as possible, many of which would be recognised by any English speaker, in such a way that they can be learned quickly. This short set of rules could reduce the number of annotations significantly, without causing ambiguities or confusions in the interpretation process.\nTable 1 shows the difference between an annotated text without rules (left) and an annotated text with rules (right). We have to say that it is not only a question of economy and clarity. The version with rules helps the reader assimilate the pronunciation and spelling rules of English, so helping to bridge the gap between written and spoken English.\nIt is important to distinguish between the process of reading (interpreting) an annotated word and the process of annotating (coding) a word, as well as identifying their inputs and outputs, as shown in Figure 1. Reading an annotated word can be done very easily and only requires a quick look at the rules and some practice with a few pages of text. Interpreting an annotated text takes the original English word and its annotations as inputs and produces its pronunciation. This process in unambiguous and has only one possible outcome. Conversely, coding a word is more cumbersome, because several annotations are possible. The good thing is that this task is not performed by the reader. Given an English word and a pronunciation, an annotator (a person or a computer program) has to choose between the possible annotations. In general, there are not many options, so given a word and its pronunciation, we can establish some criteria or set of scores in order to choose the best (or standard) annotation for the word. In fact, this process can be performed automatically by a computer program if we have access to the IPA transcriptions of all the English words appearing in a text.\nThis document is organised as follows. In section 2 we present the set of symbols we will use and their basic meaning. We also include some IPA notation and briefly explain how the annotation symbols look like and how they can be produced in LATEX (you can ignore the LATEX commands if you are not going to use LATEX as a text editor). In section 3 we present the rules to follow the annotation, i.e. the interpretation process. In section 4 we discuss the problem of annotating a document. Section 5 includes some annotated texts, which are very helpful to see how _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ works in practice. In section 6 we\nconclude the paper with a discussion about some preliminary statistics, whether the compromise between rules/annotations is correct, dialects, typography, the use of diacritical annotations, and, of course, future work. Appendices include alternative rules we finally did not implement, and some LATEX stuff."

We will use the symbols shown in table 2 (consonants and semiconsonants) and 3 (vowels and diphthongs). The only particular notation which differs from IPA is that we will use the notation [K] to represent either [ô] or [@(ô)]. This is useful to generally distinguishing between ‘flower’ and ‘flour’, since the first is [flaU@ô] in GA and [flaU@] in RP, while the second is [flaUô] in GA and [flaU@] in RP. With our notation, ‘flower’ is [flaU@ô] and ‘flour’ [flaUK]. We use [ô] to represent the special sound of the ‘r’ in English in contrast to other languages. In general, if we are only treating with English, we can use simply [r].\nUsing IPA, we can describe the pronunciation of a word as shown with the following example:\nexplanation Ñ [ Ekspl@\"neIS@n]\nSome words have different pronunciations depending on the accent. The previous table is not exactly phonetic but pseudophonetic (they try to generalise several English accents), and it is custom for many English dictionaries, which only need to include different pronunciations when they are not inferrable from the accent (e.g, the two different pronunciations for the word ‘either’).\nWe incorporate a slight modification in the way stress is coded in IPA. Instead of placing the stress at the beginning of each syllable, we place the stress at the first vowel in the syllable. This avoids the elicitation of where syllables start or end, an issue which is not strictly necessary for pronunciation, especially when the word is read at a normal pace. The following example shows this modification:\nexplanation Ñ [ Ekspl@n\"eIS@n] (instead of [ Ekspl@\"neIS@n]) Note that this does not mean that we have to split the word into ‘explan-ation’. It is just that we place the stress on the vowels, since each syllable has only one vowel group."

That can be the case with words that have more than one possible pronunciation (and the annotator does not want to choose among them).

      "text" : "The rules we present in this section will allow a reader to unambiguously determine the pronunciation of an annotated word. The basic idea is that the words (or parts of words) who have no annotations will be pronounced as the rule says. The words (or parts of words) with annotations will highlight an exception to the rules, and the annotation will clarify the irregular sound it corresponds to. For instance, the word ‘that’ requires no annotation. First, the digraph ‘th’ here is voiced, which follows a rule saying that it must be so when appearing before a vowel. Second, ‘a’ is in a plain position (followed by a consonant at the end of the word). Third, ‘t’ is regularly pronounced. Quite differently, the word ‘hous\nˆ e’\nrequires an annotation, because ‘h’, ‘ou’ and the final ‘e’ sound as the rules indicate, but the consonant ‘s’ must be annotated as voiceless since this case breaks the rule that an ‘s’ is voiced between vowels.\nThe rules must be applied in a given order. We arrange the process in 12 steps, as follows:\n1. Discard (crossed-out) letters. 2. Identify word segments by hyphens, apostrophes and separation annotations 3. Parse critical digraphs (‘ng’, ‘ng\n˚ ’, ‘gh’, gh ˇ , ‘wh’, ‘wr’, ‘qu’, ‘gu’.).\n4. Distinguish vowel and consonant groups. Handling semiconsonants 5. Distinguish vowel units in groups using digraphs (aa, ae, ai, ay, au, aw, ea,\nee, ei, ey, eu, ew, oa, oi, oy, oo, ou, ow). 6. Place the stresses for each vowel unit. 7. Categorise vowel ocurrences (stressed/unstressed, natural/plain and rhotic/non-\nrhotic). 8. Evaluate vowel units. 9. Distinguish consonant units in groups using digraphs (kn, pn, gn, cn, ph, ch,\nsh, ps, rh, pt, th, gg, ss). 10. Evaluate consonant units. 11. Recompose the words. 12. Postprocess the IPA result (elimination of repeated consonants and inclusion\nof schwa into final -#r).\nThe example in Figure 2 shows how an annotated sentence is converted into IPA following the previous process.\nNext, each step of the process is explained in one subsection each."

      "heading" : "3.3 Parse Critical Digraphs",
      "text" : "There are some consonant digraphs that deserve special rules at this early moment of the process, because they become silent or partly silent, or they involve a semiconsonant (and we need to distinguish between consonants and vowels the sooner the better). The rules are as follows and are applied in this order.\n1. ‘ng’, ‘ng ˚ ’. The digraph ‘ng’ becomes ‘n ˚ ’ when it is at the end of a segment, or\nbefore any consonant except ‘l’ and ‘r’. In other words, we have a softer [N] before any combination which makes impossible to articulate the ‘g’ sound. Examples: ‘sing’, ‘yo\n‰ ungster’, ‘Singh ‰ ’. In all the other positions, the digraph\n‘ng’ becomes ‘nj’ ([ndZ]) if it is followed by ‘e’, ‘i’ or ‘y’ (e.g., ginger, ãngel, spôngy) and ‘n\n˚ g ˚ ’ ([Ng]) in all the other cases (‘bingo’, ‘finger’, ‘Ėnglish’,\n‘single’, ‘angry’). Note how the words ‘singffier’, ‘bringffiing’ and ‘clingffiy’ are separated into two segments in order to get the proper sound. When ‘g’ is annotated as ‘g\n˚ ’, the digraph ‘ng ˚ ’ is always converted into ‘n ˚ g ˚ ’ ([Ng]) (e.g.\n‘ang ˚ er’). When ‘g’ after ‘n’ is annotated as ‘g„ ¯ ’ (i.e. ‘ng„ ¯ ’), it is always ([ndZ]) (e.g. ‘dunge„ ¯ on’), and when ‘g’ is annotated as ‘g„’, it is always pronounced [nZ] as in ‘l̂ıng„erie’. In these two cases (‘ng„ ¯ ’ and ‘ng„’) we do not need to\nperform any action at this moment of the process. 2. ‘gh’, |gh. The digraph ‘gh’ becomes silent everywhere. For instance, it be-\ncomes silent for words such as ‘high’, ‘higher’, ‘thou ‰ gh’, ‘th ˆ ought’, ‘highness’,\n‘neighbour’, while it does not for ‘tàough ˚ ’, ‘bigfffflhĲea‰ dėd’. At this moment of the\nprocess, we also apply the annotation |gh, which makes ‘gh’ convert into ‘e’, as in ‘ĲEdinbur|gh’. In other cases, where the digraph has been previously destroyed, there is no need to apply this rule, such as in ‘gh\n‰ õst’ or ‘Mâgh ‰ reb’.\nThe annotations gh ˚ , gh ˆ are processed later in the process.\n3. ‘wh’. The digraph ‘wh’ becomes ‘w ˚ ’ (that will be finally transcribed into\n([w] or [û] depending on the dialect) at the beginning of a segment or when it follows a consonant. Examples: ‘handwheel’, ‘when’, ‘afflwhile, wörthwhile, noffiwhēre, Ĳeve‰ ryffiwhēre, sôme‰ whēre, but not with ‘càowffiffhide’ (because it follows a vowel and also because it is annotated). When annotated as ‘wh ˚\n’, this is left for later steps of the process (and will be finally transcribed into ([û])). Of course we do not have to care when the digraph has been previously destroyed, as in ‘w\n‰ h̊o’ or ‘w ‰ hole’.\n4. ‘wr’. The digraph ‘wr’ becomes ‘r’ except when it comes after a vowel a,e,i,o,u. Examples: ‘write’, ‘wrong’, ‘shipffiffwreck’, ‘refffflwri\"\nte’ (because of the separation), ‘afflwry’ (because of the separation). It does not disappear in ‘Jewry’, ‘arrowroot’, dàowry.\n5. ‘qu’. The digraph ‘qu’ is always understood as ‘kw’ before a,e,i,o,u,y, and does not need any annotation for the ‘u’ to sound as a semiconsonant, as in ‘quǎlity’, ‘quo’, ‘quest’, ‘ẽqual’, ‘liquor’, ‘aqua’, ‘barbėqu\n\"\" e’ (better ‘barbėcu \"\" e’.\nIf the ‘u’ does not sound, it has to be crossed out (‘õpa \" qu ‰ e’, ‘crit̄ıqu ‰ e)’, ‘q ueu ‰ e’, ‘qu ‰ ēs ˆ ad̄ı \" lla’).\n6. ‘gu’. The digraphs ‘gu’ is always understood as ‘g ˚ w’ before a,o,u and as ‘g ˚ ’\nbefore e,i,y. For instance, the ‘u’ is converted into the semiconsonant sound ‘w’ in ‘guat’, ‘Gua\n\"\" tema \" la’, ‘guāno’, ‘Par ˚ aguâay’, ‘languȧge’. It is silent in\n‘guess’, ‘guest’, ‘bĲague \" tte’ ‘guĲınėa ‰ ’, ‘disgui \" se’, ‘guide’, ‘guilty’, ‘guita \" r’, ‘guy’ (which becomes ‘g ˚ y’), ‘Portúguẽse’, colle \" ague, ĲanalĲogue (note that the ‘u’ becomes silent at this stage of the process, while the ‘e’ will become silent by a rule we will explain below), vogue, tôngue, fat̄ı\n\" gue. The ‘u’ is kept as\na vowel when it is followed by a consonant or it is annotated, as in ‘gun’, ‘langu\n‰ ur’, ‘gūbernato \" rial’, ‘a \"\" mbĲı \" gũous’, ‘a \"\" mbĲı \" gũity’, ‘pengu—in’, ‘disti \" ngu—ish’,\n‘argũe’. The ‘u’ can also become silent before an ‘a’, but in this case, following the rules, it requires a cross-out annotation, such as in ‘gu\n‰ ard’, ‘gu ‰ a \"\" r ˚ ante \" e’.\n7. ‘ah’, ‘eh’, ‘ih’, ‘oh’, ‘uh’, ‘yh’, ‘wh’. These digraph make the ’h’ silent before a consonant. In other words, ‘h’ is silent between vowel and consonant. Examples: āh, ēh, oh, ooh, Ĳuh, hĲuh, Phara\n‰ oh, Phara ‰ ohs, Shāh, Yāhwēh (note\nthat ‘Yāh ‰ wēh’ would create the digraph ‘aw’), yĲeah, Sarah, Cõhn, Kāhn, John, Kūhn, Nāhcolite, Fāhd, Dāhl, Kõhl, būhl, Lẽhman, õhm, Bāhra \" in, Bohr, Rūhr.\nIt is interesting to remark (again) that the previous rules are applied in the order they appear. For instance, the word ‘biffffllingual’ is converted by the ‘ng’ rule into (bi-lin\n˚ g ˚ ual). The ‘gu’ rule finally converts it into (bi-lin ˚ g ˚ wal) There are more\ndigraph rules for vowels and consonants, but they will be seen when vowels and consonants are processed. We have placed some of them here, because it is very important to consider ‘w’ a semiconsonant and not a vowel in some situations, and the ‘ng’ rule must come before the ‘gu’. The ‘gh’ rule is given now to consider the introduced vowel |gh, and to make the natural sound for ‘i’ in ‘high’."

      "heading" : "3.4 Distinguish Vowel and Consonant Groups. Handling Semiconsonants",
      "text" : "After the previous process, we are closer to distinguish between vowels and consonants, but there are still some details about ‘y’, ‘w’ and other vowels becoming consonants (and viceversa) that we need to consider.\nIt is traditionally understood that:\n– Vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u.\n– Consonants in English are b, c, d, f , g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, x, z.\n– The letters w and y are considered vowels in some cases and (semi)consonants in other cases.\nApart from clarifying w and y, we find cases where u becomes a (semi)consonant in some special cases (apart from ‘qu’, ‘gua’, ‘guo’, ‘guu’ and eventually when annotated after other consonants), and some other annotations converting vowels into consonants and vice-versa.\nWe start analysing when w and y are vowels and when they are consonants. The rule is as follows. The letters w and y are vowels if they are before a consonant, at the end of the group, they are part of a vowel digraph (ay, ey, oy, aw, ew, ow), or they are affected by a vowel annotation. Examples: ‘cwm’, ‘lynx’, ‘my’, ‘cry’, ‘ray’, ‘dėla\n\" yed’, ‘boyffifffri‰ end’, ‘bu ‰ ying’, ‘flowing’, ‘èye’ are vowels, while\n‘yell’, ‘lawyer’, ‘when’ (remember that this arrives as ‘w ˚ en’ and not ‘w-hen’ at this moment of the process’), ‘will’, ‘k̄ıwı̄’, ‘bėfflware’ are consonants. Note that if w or y are crossed out, there is no need to decide, such as in ‘w\n‰ hole’. Also, y\nis considered a vowel if found after one or more consonants. For instance, y is a vowel in ‘bye’, ‘cyan’, ‘LĲıbyan’, ‘ByĲeloru\n\" ssi” an’, etc. This is not applied for w\n(‘twine’). We can combine y and w as in ‘Wỹo \" ming’, where we have that ‘w’ is a consonant and ‘y’ is a vowel.\nThere are several annotations that may convert a vowel into a consonant. If the letter ‘u’ is annotated as ‘u—’, it is transformed into a (semi)consonant ‘w’. Examples: the ‘u’ in ‘pengu—in’, su—āve, su—ẽde, pu—erto becomes the semiconsonant ‘w’ (remember we do not have to annotate Par\n˚ aguâay, but the ‘u’ also\nbecomes ‘w’), while the ‘u’ in ‘gun’, ‘gūrū’, ‘dual’, ‘fuel’, ‘duo’ is clearly a vowel. Note that we do not have to care about cases where the ‘u’ has been previously deleted, such as ‘gu\n‰ a \" rantee \"\" ’. Remember that the digraph ‘qu’ is always\nunderstood as ‘qw’ before a,e,i,o,u,y, and does not need any annotation, as in ‘quǎlity’, ‘quo’, ‘quest’, ‘queen’, ‘quas̃ı’, ‘ẽqual’, ‘liquor’, ‘aqua’, ‘colloquy’. But note that in ‘Qůrā\n\" n’, ‘Qǔm’ (a city), etc., it is considered a vowel. Some words\ntaken through Spanish or French may require annotations since the ‘u’ is silent, such as ‘Qu\n‰ echu—a’, ‘liqu ‰ e ‰ ũ \" r’ (or perhaps better ‘lĲıq u \" eu ‰ r’), ‘burle \" squ ‰ e’, ‘õpa \" qu ‰ e’,\n‘crit̄ıqu ‰ e)’, ‘qu ‰ ēs ˆ ad̄ı \" lla’ or a formal pronunciation of ‘Qu ‰ ebe \" c’. Some other strange spellings may also require this, such as ‘qu ‰ a ‰ ȳ’, ‘q ueu ‰ e’. As we have also seen, ‘gue’, ‘gui’ and ‘guy’ make the ‘u’ silent, while ‘gua’, ‘guo’ and ‘guu’ convert it into ‘w’, unless annotated, such as in ‘gu\n‰ a \" rantee \"\" ’ and ‘pengu—in’.\nThe groups ‘o’ and ‘ou’ in some words may become ‘w’ as well. This is also denoted by ‘—’. If the sound is completely replaced, as in ‘O\n‰ u—̄ıja’, ‘vo—ỹeu ‰ r’ (RP),\n‘ch ‰ o—̃ır’ we use ‘—’ just below the letter (or the group of letters, ‘Ou— ı̄ja’, although this may be confusing if we do not use the grouping: ‘Ou— ı̄ja’). If the vowel sound is preserved and the ‘w’ appears before the vowel, we denote that by—but it is placed between the previous letter and the vowel, as in ‘—̂one’, ‘äny—̂one’ or Q—̌antas. Note that we introduce the ‘w’ sound in our decomposition, so ‘—̂one’ becomes (w,ô,n,e).\nThe letters ‘i’ and ‘y’ can be transformed into or forced into a (semi)consonant ‘y’, by using the annotation ‘ ’. For instance, ‘ôn ion’, ‘bun ion’ (note that ‘n i’ is\nnow considered a complex consonant), H ‰ ierro (the Canary island), Ken ya (note that even it is a ‘y’ it would be considered a vowel if not annotated), CĲalifo \" rn ia,\ncan ion, mil ië \" u ‰ , mill ion. But note that ‘Rǒma \" nian’, ‘LĲıbya’, Ĩbe \" rian, sĲımian, etc., maintain the vowel (this also depends on the accent). The same symbol ‘ ’ can also\nbe used to annotate the introduction of the phoneme [j] between the letters where it must be placed. Examples: ‘fail ure’ (which is better annotated as failùre),\n‘las ˆ a \" g ‰ n a’ (the introduction of a new consonant makes the group complex).\nFinally, there is a bizarre u ˆ sound which becomes f, as in li ‰ Ĳeu ˆ tĲe \" nant. Some other vowels may become consonants in conjunction with other consonants if so annotated. For instance, di„\n¯ , de„ ¯ , ti” , ... as in sõldi„ ¯ er or noti”on.\nAfter the previous cases, it may seem difficult to tell between consonants and vowels. But it is not so if we summarise and put everything together. The following set of items clarify (and summarise) this:\n– Vowels in Annotated English are a, e, i, o, u and any group of characters\nwhich have an annotation above the letter (e.g., ã, àow, |gh). The letters w and y are vowels if they are before a consonant, at the end of the group or they are part of a vowel digraph (ay, ey, oy, aw, ew, ow). Also, y is considered a vowel if found after a consonant.\n– Consonants in Annotated English are b, c, d, f , g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, x, z and any (possibly empty) group of characters which have an annotation below the letter (e.g., f\nˇ , , ou— , u ˆ ). The letters w and y are considered\nconsonants when they are not considered vowels. The letter u is considered a consonant in the unannotated digraph ‘qu’, and in the unannotated groups ‘gua’, ‘guo’, ‘guu’.\nWe will use the notation @ for a vowel and # for a consonant (this is notation for this explanation, not part of the annotations).\nOnly after the previous rules, we are able to decompose each word segment into vowel and consonant groups.\nFor each segment, we have to distinguish its groups. We use the term vowel group for a series of consecutive vowels in a segment. Similarly, a consonant group is a series of consecutive consonants. Note that a vowel group is not necessarily a unit (a single vowel sound or a diphthong). For instance, ‘ie’ in ‘science’ is a vowel group with two units. Similarly, ‘d̊oing’ has a vowel group ‘̊oi’ which is composed of two units. Some other two-vowel groups can have one unit, such as ‘ow’ in ‘grow’. Note that groups cannot be made across consecutive segments. For instance, the groups in goffiing preclude o and i from being together.\nExamples: consĲe \" cútive (c,o,n,s,Ĳe \" ,c,ũ,t,i,v,e), science (sc,ie,nc,e), deb ‰ t (d,e,t),\nfāst ‰ en (f,ā,s,e,n), goffiing (g,o - i,ng), diphthˆ ong (d,i,phth ˆ ,o,n ˚ ), ‘cry’ (cr,y), ’boyffifffri‰ end’ (b,oy,fr,end), ‘bu\n‰ ying’ (b,yi,ng), ‘flowing’ (fl,owi,n ˚ ), ‘âeye’ (âeye), when (w ˚ ,e,n),\n‘k̄ıwı̄’ (k,̄ı,w,̄ı), ‘bėfflware’ (b,ė,w,a,r,e), ‘cyan’ (c,ya,n), ‘twine’ (tw,i,n,e), ‘Guātemā\" la’ (Gw,ā,t,e,m,ā,l,a), ’gūr ˚ ū’ (g,ū,r ˚ ,ū) , ‘gh ‰ õst’ (g-õ-st), ‘shipffiffwreck’ (sh,i,p,r,e,ck), ‘pengu—in’ (p,e,ngu—,i,n), ‘g ˚ u ‰ est’ (g ˚ ,e,st), ‘quǎlity’ (kw,ǎ,l,i,t,y), ‘liquor’ (l,i,kw,o,r), ‘Ou— ı̄ja’ / ‘O‰ u—̄ıja’ (Ou— ,̄ı,ja) / (u— ,̄ı,ja), ‘afflway’ (a,w,ay)."

      "heading" : "3.5 Distinguish Vowel Units",
      "text" : "The first thing to be done when a vowel group is to be pronounced is to determine the vowel digraphs (in case) in order to determine the vowel units. Vowel units are also useful to place the stress, since stress is always on vowel units (a syllabe has one and only one vowel unit).\nThe vowel pairs which are considered digraphs and those which are not are shown below:\n– Digraphs: aa, ae, ai, ay, au, aw, ea, ee, ei, ey, eu, ew, oa, oi, oy, oo, ou, ow. – Non-digraphs: ao, eo, oe, i@ (ia, ie, ii, iy, io, iu, iw), and u@ (ua, ue, ui,\nuy, uo, uu, uw).\nThere are no vowel trigraphs. A vowel group with only one vowel is a vowel unit. When two or more vowels are found together in a group, we form digraphs from left to right (so, ‘eei’ becomes (ee,i) and not (e, ei)). The parts which are not grouped by a digraph are left as single units. Note that any deleted vowel is not considered for digraphs, since they are deleted by a previous rule.\nFor instance, ‘bait’ applies the digraph and ‘ai’ is maintained as a unit (b,ai,t). The word ‘science’ becomes (sc,i,e,nc,e) because ‘ie’ is not a digraph. If a vowel in a group has an annotation, this breaks any possible digraph. For instance, ‘yĲeah’ breaks the possible ‘digraph’ ea and then becomes (y,Ĳe,a,h). If the second vowel has a stress annotation it also breaks the unit (õa\n\" s ˆ is ˆ ). When an anno-\ntation spans over two vowels, it means that these two vowels make a unit, as in ‘fıeld’ (f,ıe,ld). When a stress annotation is placed over the second letter of a vowel group, than the vowel group is split into two units (e.g., sūprai\n\" ngu—inal\n(s,ū,pr,a,i \" ,ngu—,i,n,a,l). A silent annotation between two vowels put them together (e.g., ‘vẽh ‰ icle’ (v,ẽ,i,cl,e) must annotate the first ‘e’ to avoid the interpretation (v,ei,cl,e). It is the same for the silent digraph ‘gh’, but luckily in words such as ‘higher’ we have the cluster ‘ie’ which is not a digraph (h,i,e,r). And, of course, separators break units (e.g. afflway)\nExamples: ‘goffiing’ (g,o - i,ng), ‘bu‰ ying’ (b,u ‰ y,i,ng), ‘flowing’ (fl,ow,i,ng), ‘see-\ning’ (s,ee,i,ng) ‘lion’ (l,i,o,n), ‘new’ (n,ew), ‘âeye’ (âey,e), ‘algae’ (a,l,g,ae), ‘mı̄a ‰ xo \" w’\n(m,̄ı,xo \" w), ‘Hallowe \" en’ (H,a,ll,ow,e \" e,n), ‘meào \" w’ (m,e,ào \" w), ‘sh̊oe’ (sh, o̊, e), ‘coch ‰ lėae’ (c,o,c,l,ė,ae), ‘aeo \" lian’ (ae,o \" ,l,i,a,n), Hafiw âa \" ıi (H,a,w,âa \" ı,i) (note how the cluster ‘aw’\nis broken), ‘ĲEdinbur|gh’ (ĲE,d,i,nb,u,r,|gh), ‘gluey’ (gl,u, ey), ‘gluier’ (gl, u, i, e, r).

      "heading" : "3.6 Place the Stresses for Each Vowel Unit",
      "text" : "Stress applies to vowel groups and ultimately to vowel units. Here we account to placing the stress over the vowel groups. There are stressed segments (which can be either primary or secondary) and unstressed segments. We follow a set of rules, in this order:\n1. If a word is not separated into segments, it is a primary-stressed segment (e.g., ‘hous\nˆ e’, ‘difference’, ‘ago \" ’).\n2. If a word is separated by a hyphen, only the first segment is considered primary-stressed and the second is unstressed (e.g., ‘yo-yo’)). 3. If a segment is separated by an apostrophe, only the first segment is considered primary-stressed and the second is unstressed (e.g., ‘it’s’). This rule can be broken if the apostrophe is annotated: o’fflclock. 4. The segment ‘the’ is special. It is considered unstressed if it is followed by another segment (word) starting with a consonant and stressed elsewhere.\nFrom these principles, more segments can be created by further separations due to annotations, which also have consequences on the stress.\n1. If we see the separator ‘fi’, the two new segments do not modify their stresses. Examples: parentfih|ood (only the first segment is stressed). 2. If we see the separator ‘ffi’, the first segment becomes primary-stressed and the second unstressed. Examples: goffiing, homeffiless. 3. If we see the separator ‘ffl’, the first segment becomes unstressed and the second primary-stressed. Examples: afflbound. 4. If we see the separator ‘ffiff’, the first segment becomes primary-stressed and the second secondary-unstressed. Examples: fatffiffhea‰\nd, northffiffbound, sideffiffcar. 5. If we see the separator ‘ffffl’, the first segment becomes secondary-stressed and\nthe second primary-unstressed. Examples: åltho \" u ‰ gh.\nThe two first separators may seem to have the same effect, but they are different. For instance, the following annotations are not equivalent: outfigoffiing and outffigoffiing (the first only gives primary stress to the first vowel group while the second gives primary stress to the two first vowel groups). In any case, the correct annotation for this word would be: outfffflgofiing (or better, o\"\" utgo \"fi ing).\nIt is interesting to see examples of unstressed segments: Ireffiland (land), goffiing (ing), ėnfflgage (ėn), Birmingffih‰ am (h ‰ am), It’s (’s), They’ve (’ve), The wind (The).\nNow we concentrate on placing the stress over the vowel units in each segment.\nUnless annotated otherwise, all primary stressed segments are assumed to have the primary stress on the first vowel unit and no other stressed unit. Unless annotated otherwise, all secondary stressed segments are assumed to have the secondary stress on the first vowel unit and no other stressed unit.\nFurther stressed units in each segment are indicated with the symbol ‘a \" ’ for primary stress and ‘a \"\" ’ for secondary stress under the first letter of the vowel group. The use of the symbol ‘st’ removes any other primary stress in the segment (only one primary stress per segment, unless all of them are annotated). For instance, ago\n\" we have that ‘a’ is unstressed while ‘o’ is stressed. The annotation\nfor the secondary stress ‘a \"\" ’ does not remove any primary stress we could have previously or any other annotated secondary stress. For instance, ‘complica \"\" te’ introduces a secondary stress for the ‘a’ but does not remove the primary stress for the ‘o’. That means that we do not need to annotate that like ‘co\n\" mplica \"\" te’.\nWe can have several secondary stresses, such as in ‘ėle \"\" ctrõĲence \" phalogra \"\" m’\nExamples of primary stressed vowel units are: plain (ai), assu \" me (u), differ-\nence (i), science (i), rėla \" tėd (a), ago \" (o), pol̄ı \" ceffiman (i), consĲe\" cútive (first ‘e’).\nExamples of secondary stressed units: claustropho \"\" bic (primary: o, secondary:\nau), kangaro \"\" o (primary: oo, secondary: a), softwa \"\" re (primary: o, secondary: a), tĲelepho \"\" ne (primary: e, secondary: o),\nWhen there are at least two syllables (vowel units) on the left of a primary stress, and there are no annotated secondary stresss, we assume a secondary stress two syllable (vowel units) on the left.\nExamples of inferred secondary stress unit: ‘par ˚ abĲo \" lic’ (primary: o, secondary:\nfirst a), undergo \" (primary: o, secondary: u), incredu \" lity (primary: u, secondary: first i), ‘inconsi \" stent’ (primary: second i, secondary: first i), ‘coėxi \" st’ (primary: i, secondary: o), reconstru \" ct (primary: u, secondary: e), Europẽ \" an (primary: second e, secondary: eu), servie \" tte (primary: secon e, secondary: first e). This is not applied if there are less than two syllables on the left (e.g. ago \" where a is not stressed, u \"\" nd̊o \" ). If we place the secondary stress elsewhere, the rule is broken: ‘ėle \"\" ctrĲolÿs ˆ is ˆ ’ (primary: o, secondary: second e), atte \"\" nde \" e (primary: second e, secondary: first e). Note that if we want to indicate two secondary stresses, the rule is broken and we need to mark everything, as in ‘u\n\"\" na \"\" mbĲı \" guous’.\nFinally, any vowel unit before a consonant group which contains the annotations ‘”’, ‘”\n¯ ’, ‘„’, or ‘„ ¯ ’ is assumed to have a primary stress, unless the primary stress\nis annotated elsewhere. If there are more than one consonant group with these annotation, the rule is only applied for the rightmost.\nExamples of inferred primary stress unit: ‘compressi” on’ (primary: e), ‘trĲansmissi” on’\n(primary: first i), ‘illusi„on’. Note that any primary stress at any other location breaks the rule: ‘mach” ı̄\n\" ne’, W ˇ i \" ttgens”tâeın.\nNote that the inferred primary stress and the inferred secondary stress can be combined.\nExamples of inferred primary stress unit and inferred secondary stress unit: ‘tĲelėvĲısi„on’ (primary: first i, secondary: first e), ‘informati”on’ (primary: a, secondary: first i), ‘dĲefinĲıti”on’ (primary: second i, secondary: first e), ‘declarati”on’ (primary: second a, secondary: e), prĲesentati”on (primary: a, secondary: first e), ‘communicati”on’ (primary: a, secondary: u), ‘pronunciati”on’ (primary: a, secondary: u), ‘init”iati”on’ (primary: a, secondary: second i), ‘variati”on’ (primary: second a, secondary: first a). Note how important it is in these two last examples to determine the number of vowel units since the units in one word are (i,n,i,t”,i,a,ti”,o,n’, so it is the second ‘i’ which is two syllables on the left from the stressed vowel unit ‘a’, and the units in the the other word are (v,a,r,i,a,ti”,o,n).\nNote that if the secondary stress rule is broken, the primary stress rule can be maintained: rĲe\n\"\" prėsentati”on (primary: a, secondary: first e), di \"\" fferĲent”iati”on\n(primary: a, secondary: first i), pu \"\" rificati”on.\nFinally, these rules can be applied with the simple separator ‘fi’, but not with the other separators affecting stress."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.7 Categorise Vowel Occurrences",
      "text" : "The good thing about this moment of the process is that we can analyse each vowel unit independently. The only contextual information we need to know is whether or not the vowel unit is stressed, whether it is at the end of a word segment, whether it is followed by an ‘r’ and whether it is followed by a simple or complex consonant group (note that we talk about groups and not units for consonants, since consonant groups have not been treated yet) and whether the vowel is followed or not by another vowel group.\nThese situations will allow us to categorise vowel occurrence under three dimensions: unstressed/stressed, natural/plain (only for stressed single vowels) and rhotic/non-rhotic.\nThe categorisation between unstressed and stressed vowel units just inherits the rules for stress processed before. Primary and secondary stressed units are considered stressed units. All the other units become unstressed. For instance, in ‘science’, we have a stressed unit ‘i’ and an unstressed unit ‘e’. Other examples where we show the stressed units: ‘nuclėar’ (u), ‘fıeld’ (ie), ‘sūprai\n\" ngu—inal’ (first\n‘u’ and first ‘i’), ‘vẽh ‰ icle’ (ẽ), ‘Hallowe \" en’ (first e and a), ‘claustropho \" bic’ (o, au), ‘ka \" ngaro \"\" o’ (oo, a), softwãre (o), tĲe \" lėpho \"\" ne (e, o).\nThe next issue is to distinguish between natural and plain occurrences. This only applies to stressed vowel units of one single vowel, i.e. (a, e, i/y, o, u/w), either annotated or not. In fact, this applies to positions, rather than to vowels. The rules are basically the same as those which are typically learned when spelling English, known as the “double-consonant rule”.\nThe first thing to do is to distinguish between single and complex consonant groups. Single consonants groups are b, c, d, f , g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, z (all single consonants except x) and the groups #l and #r (i.e., consonant + l/r). It is also single when y and w are consonants (e.g. ‘yoyo’, ‘k̄ıwı̄’). The annotated double ‘r’ (r\n˚ ), as in ‘phar ˚ ynx’ or ‘par ˚ abĲo \" lic’, is considered a complex consonant.\nNote that q is typically followed by a semiconsonantic u which makes it complex, as well as groups ‘gua’, ‘guo’, ‘guu’, but not ‘gue’, ‘gui’ unless the ‘u’ is annotated as ‘u—’. Some examples of single consonants are ‘pod‘ (p, d), ‘ale‘ (l), ‘hole‘ (h, l), ‘able’ (bl), ‘metre’ (m, tr), ‘mĲacro’ (m, cr), ‘micro’ (m, cr), Apr̈ıl (pr, l), ‘vogue’ (g), ’õpa\n\" qu ‰ e’ (p,q) (in both cases the u is silent). Note that this also applies\nwhen a consonant has been removed, as in ‘Mich ‰ ae ‰ l’ (ch ‰ ) (or ‘plĲumb ‰ er’, where we need to annotate to avoid the ‘plume’ sound), since consonant groups are formed after the application of ‘\n‰ ’. All the other consonant groups are considered\ncomplex (th as in ‘then’, ck as in ‘check’, st as in ‘lost’, qu as in ‘aqua’, phth as in ‘diphth\nˆ ong’). Some examples are ‘temple’ (mpl), ‘checking’ (ch, ck, ng),\ntrõphy (ph), graphic (ph), ‘bãthe’ (th), ‘lossy’ (ss), (‘ẽqual’) (qu, which is kw at this moment of the process). Note that gh is always considered complex when it is not silent ‘ro\n‰ ugh ˚ ’. When it is silent, it is not considered simple or double,\nbut has a very especial implication. As we will see, it automatically makes the previous vowel (if single) a natural vowel, so we consider ‘hi’, ‘high’, ‘night’ and ‘he ‰ ight’ equivalent. Consequently, we do not annotate ‘tighten’.\nOther annotations may affect the appraisal of simple or complex consonant groups. For instance, semiconsonants y and w are always reckoned as a consonant, so ‘n i’ in ‘bun ion’ is now considered a complex consonant). Similarly, ‘n\n’ in ‘las\nˆ a \" g ‰ n a’ is a complex group. The consonant groups which include di„ ¯ , de„ ¯ , ti” ,\netc., as in proce \" d„ ¯ ure or noti”on, are counted as the consonant letters they have inside. For instance, noti”on is single, while missi” on is complex.\nFrom the notion of single/complex consonant group, we can easily derive the notions of natural and plain position. A natural position of a stressed single vowel is given when: (1) it appears at the end of a word segment, (2) it is followed by another vowel unit, (3) it is followed by a single consonant group plus a vowel group, or (4) it is followed by a silent ‘gh’ at any position. Examples: so, me, my, high, night (note that ‘gh’ disappeared in previous steps of the process), toe, giant, poėt, micro, plate, phony, dinos\nˆ aur, able, idle, nuclėar, vague. All the other\nstressed positions are plain positions. Examples: saffron, little, twenty, aqua, temple, checking, graphic (ph), phar\n˚ ynx, to ‰ ugh ˚ er. Note that for non-stressed\nvowels, this does not apply, so we have to annotate ‘fortñıght’, ‘̃ıde \" ntity’, etc. In general, we will use the terms “natural” and “plain” vowels to refer to vowels in natural and plain positions respectively.\nFinally, (single or complex) vowel units can be rhotic or non-rhotic7. If the vowel is not followed by an ‘r’ then it is clearly non-rhotic, as in ‘fate’, ‘fat’ or ‘hungry’. Unstressed single vowels are considered non-rhotic (‘winner’, ‘ėra\n\" dicãte’, ‘s”ugar’, ‘lantern’, ‘player’), For the rest of combinations (stressed single vowels and stressed/unstressed complex vowel units), the rule is as follows: a vowel unit is rhotic if it is followed by a single (non-doubled) ‘r’ (in the segment) (‘fair’, ‘laird’, ‘fairy’, ’earffiring’, ‘card’, ‘far’, ‘norm’, ‘first’, ‘her’, ‘firffiry’, ‘praye‰\nr’, ‘mayo\n‰ r’, but not ‘player’) or double ‘rr’ not followed by a vowel (‘err’, ‘whirr’). It\nis non-rhotic elsewhere. Explicitly, it is non-rhotic when it is not followed by an ‘r’ (mail, now, glade, mode, pad, fitted), is followed by a double rr + consonant (carry, berry, lorry, hurry) or it is followed by ‘r\n˚ ’ (mir ˚ ȧcle).\nSince unstressed vowel units are always non-rhotic, there can be secondary stress annotations to force a vowel to become rhotic, as in ‘i\n\"\" rõ \" nic’, ‘u \"\" rba \" ne’,\n‘noffiwhēre’ even though these words are not typically transcribed in IPA with the secondary stress.\nNote that the pronunciation varies (and it becomes rhotic or not) for RP and GA. For instance, the (non-annotated) words ‘carry’, ‘berry’, ‘stirring’, ‘lorry’, ‘furry’, ‘hurry’) are only pronounced similarly for ‘berry’, ‘stirring’ and ‘furry’, with annotations ‘berry’, ‘stirfiring’ and ‘furfiry’. In some American accents, it also happens for ‘carry’. In other case, both the pronunciation and the annotation are different, as in ‘hurry’ (RP) and ‘hurfiry’ (GA), and ‘lorry’ (RP) and ‘lorfiry’. Other cases the same annotation is useful for both RP and GA, even though the pronunciation is different. For instance, laureate is annotated as ‘l|aur\n˚ ėate’, which\nin both RP and GA distinguishes from the sound of ‘for’. Table 9 summarises the\n7 Note that these terms are related but different to their application for dialects, as rhotic and non-rhotic accents.\npossible combinations (the annotations will be better understood in the following section)."

Non-annotated unstressed vowel units with only one vowel are pronounced as shown in Table 4. Note that the sound is independent of whether it is followed by an ‘r’, because non-annotated unstressed vowels are always non-rhotic. That means that ‘irĲıdium’ makes a [Ir-] sound for the first ‘i’ (not [3r-] or [I@r-]). This is handy in GA, since ‘menhir’ would make [-Ir], while we need to annotate it for RP as ‘menh̄ır’ to make [-I@r], which also works for GA. Note that we have to annotate ėlĲıẍır (or ėlĲıxı\n‰ r), and kaff̈ır to make the sound [-@r]. For s̊ou ‰ ven̄ı \"\" r, it\nalso requires an annotation because it is stressed (and then it is rhotic and it sounds [-I@r].\nSince 4 introduces some silent sounds for some vowels, it is only at this moment of the process that we know how many syllables a word has. It is just the number of vowel units which are not silent.\nFrom here we can define the sounds of stressed and/or annotated vowel units with only one vowel as Table 5 and Table 6 show8. The annotations apply to a single letter, but most of them can be extended to more than one letter with the following rule: if an annotated vowel is followed by a vowel which has been crossed out, then we can equivalently write the annotation spreading over both vowel. For instance:\nbrõo ‰ ch = br ooch, brēa ‰ k = break, blôo ‰ d = blxood\nMany of the combinations with one letter are not very frequently used, many others (especially those with two letters or in rhotic positions) are never used.

      "text" : "Now we address the sounds of vowel units with two vowels (for both stressed and unstressed).\n8 The appearance of the symbol ‘j’ in the pronunciation of the vowel ‘u’ depends on the previous consonant and on the English accent. This will be explained below.\nThe rule seen above that an annotation which spreads over two vowels is equivalent to the annotation of the first vowel and the deletion of the second vowel is very useful here. This is especially useful for diphthongs: âae, âay,àow, àeu, etc., and other digraphs |oo, which can be used to break the by-default rule.\nIn this way there is no need to determine the sounds of all the pairs with all the annotations. According to the previous rule, this was done in tables 5 and 6. It is only necessary to give the information that Table 7 provides9, which is the default sound of the English digraphs which make a unit. For completeness (this is not necessary), we include some examples of the rest of digraphs which do not make up a unit in Table 8.\nThe appearance of the symbol [j] in the combination eu/ew in Table 7 follows the same pattern as the pronunciation of natural ‘u’ in Table 5 and Table 6. While ‘fume’ and ‘few’ always perform the sound [ju:] in all accents, and ‘june’ and ‘jew’ always perform the sound [u:] in all the accents, there are differences with other phonemes. Our coding assumes [ju:] everywhere and will try to reduce that in the postprocess stage, depending on the accent which is desired.\nFinally, table 9 summarises the behaviour of several cases which are rhotic and non-rhotic, and their final pronunciation. We do not distinguish between North, sort, warm and force, tore, boar, port, but they do sound differently in Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and parts of the United States. Precisely, it is not a question of being rhotic or not, since all these dialects pronounce the ‘r’. The difference is more about openness. If we want to highlight the difference we could use the following annotation for the second group: fōrce, tōre, boar. We do not distinguish either between fern, fir and fur, even though they may sound (or used to sound) differently in Scotland and parts of Ireland. In any case, no annotation would be needed here, since the letter (e, i, u) can be used to guess the specific pronunciation in each case."

      "heading" : "3.9 Distinguish Consonant Units in Groups using Digraphs",
      "text" : "Once finished with vowels, we start with consonants now. Even though there are many more consonants, the process is much simpler. The first thing we have to do with consonants is to recognise the consonant units, which means to recognise the digraphs. Given a consonant group such as ‘phth\nˆ ’ in ‘diphthong’ we do not\nparse it from left to right, but we follow a priorised order of digraphs. If there is a silent annotation, this does not avoid the formation of a digraph. For instance, ‘sc ‰ h’ allows the formation of the digraph ‘sh’. Said this, we identify digraphs following this order:\n1. The digraphs ‘kn’, ‘pn’, ‘gn’, ‘cn’ become [n] at the beginning of a segment. Examples: ‘know’, ‘knee’, ‘gnaw’,‘gnome’, ‘pneumo\n\" nia’ ‘forefffflknĲow‰ lėdge’.

Some words may use a separator or annotation to indi-\ncate an alternative pronunciation: ‘jĲea ‰ lous ˆ h|ood’, ‘thres”hõld’\n5. The digraph ‘ps’ becomes [s] at the beginning of a segment.

The digraph ‘th’ becomes [D] before vowel (a,e,i,o,u,y) and [T] in any other position.

Examples with [T]: ‘three’, ‘mouth’, ‘birthday’.\nSome words may use a separator or annotation to indicate an alternative pronunciation: ‘th\nˆ ing’, ‘with ˇ ’, ‘Th ‰ Ĳomas’, ‘eighth ˚ ’, ‘ĲadĲultfffflh|ood’, ‘rhythˇm’ /\n‘rhyt hm’. 9.

      "text" : "Finally, the last step performs some small adjustments in some cases. First, we perform the elimination of repeated consonants. For instance, words such as ‘nutty’, ‘lorry’, ‘cure’, ‘scent’ produce [n2ttI], [l6ôôI], and [ssEnt]. Repeated consonants must be eliminated.\nSecond, the combination of some consonants can produce pairs which cannot be properly pronounced. The clearest case is the ending in -tre, as in ‘metre’, which produces Ñ [mi\n\" :tô], but should be [mi \" :t@ô], by introducing the schwa (an\nunstressed sound). Does this mean that ‘metre’ should be annotated as met re? Does this happen for other consonant combinations? Can we distinguish the right positions? (We do not have the problem for ‘central’ or ‘centring’).\nIf we first analyse the positions, the problem appears to be when ‘#r’ is not followed by a vowel. But consider the word ‘fibre-optics’. If we consider the two segments together and annotate it like this ‘fibre\n‰ optics’, then the pronunciation\nis not correct. So the rule is confirmed. The problem appears when ‘#r’ is not followed by a vowel inside the segment.\nRegarding the question of the combinations, it is very difficult (e.g. [tT] works, but [Tt] does not, while both [ts] works and [st] do, and of course [bd], [ft], etc.). We could analyse the approximately 400 combinations of pair of consonants to see whether they articulate well together, where many of them never happen. Instead, the idea is then to derive a very simple rule to cover the most frequent cases, and then annotate any possible exception. This is the philosophy taken for the process.\nWe distinguish two common situations:\n– [-l], [-m], [-n]. Examples: able, girl, little, rhyth ˇ m, auti \" sm, isn’t, rea ‰ lm, farm,\nfern. There is no need to insert a schwa, even though in some cases it seems that a schwa might be convenient (rhyth ˇ m Ñ rhyt hm , auti \" sm Ñ auti \"\nsm, isn’t Ñ i sn’t).\n– [-ô]. Examples: fibre, ogre, metre. We need to insert a schwa.\nSo the rule will be to introduce a schwa between a consonant + ‘r’/‘rs’ at the end of a segment, as in ‘metre’ or ‘metres’, which initially produces Ñ [mi\n\" :tr] but\nfinally it is converted into [mi \" :t@r]. Note that this does not conflict with words such as ‘g̊enrë’, because the ‘r’ is not at the endof the semgent. In some other\ncases where it is also necessary, we will annotate it. For instance: ‘i bn’ .\nThe opposite problem is whether we want to reduce idol, open, icon, tighten, fās ˆ t ‰ en, cottons, isn’t, etc. In this case, if the annotator wants to do it because in her accent ‘idol’ and ‘idle’ are the same, it is just enough to use the annotation ‰ for that (e.g. ı̃do\n‰ l, instead of idol).\nAs a summary, we will only automatically deal with the ‘r’ (which does not frequently happen with American spelling except for ‘acre’ and some other few words), and the rest will be left to the annotator (as in auti\n\" sm, or õpe ‰ n ).\nNow, we deal with different English varieties. The following conversions are performed for GA:\n[K] Ñ [ô] (e.g. ‘fire’, ‘beer’) [3:] Ñ [3] (e.g. ‘fur’)\n[6] Ñ [A] (e.g. ‘pot’, ‘bother’) [A:] Ñ [A] (e.g. ‘fāther’) (note that we annotate ‘fast’ and not ‘fāst’ for GA) [i:] Ñ [i] (e.g. ‘feed’) (not all phonologists advocate for this phoneme change) [O:] Ñ [O] (e.g. ‘feed’) (not all phonologists advocate for this phoneme change) [u:] Ñ [u] (e.g. ‘moon’) (not all phonologists advocate for this phoneme change) The following conversions are performed for RP:\n[ô] Ñ [ô] (e.g. ‘for’, if followed by a non-silent vowel, such as ‘for us’, ‘carry’ or ‘rat’)\n[ô] Ñ [] (e.g. ‘for’, if not followed by a non-silent vowel, such as ‘for them’, ‘forth’ or ‘furs’ [K] Ñ [@ô] (e.g. ‘dear’, if followed by a non-silent vowel, such as ‘dear Ann’, ‘firing’ or ‘dearest’)\n[K] Ñ [@] (e.g. ‘dear’, if not followed by a non-silent vowel, such as ‘dear John’ or ‘moors’)\n[oU] Ñ [@U] (e.g. ‘tone’) Other conversion rulesets can be established for other dialects (Australia, Scotland, etc.) Note that the process only deals with these mergers at the end of the process. This is useful to distinguish between ‘flower’ and ‘flour’, since the first is [flaU@ô] in GA and [flaU@] in RP, while the second is [flaUô] in GA and [flaU@] in RP.\nAnother issue is the pronunciation of the diphthong [(j)u:], which is sometimes performed as [ju:] and sometimes as [u:]. In tables 5, 6 and 7 we denoted by [(j)u:] the correspondence for ‘eu/ew’ and natural ‘u’. While ‘fume’ and ‘few’ always perform the sound [ju:] in all accents, and ‘june’ and ‘jew’ always perform the sound [u:] in all the accents, there are differences with other phonemes. In this final part of the process we eliminate the symbol (j) depending on the accent. For instance, if we choose RP, then it is only reduced in the following cases:\n[rju:] Ñ [ru:] [lju:] Ñ [lu:] [Sju:] Ñ [Su:]\n[tSju:] Ñ [tSu:] [Zju:] Ñ [Zu:]\n[dZju:] Ñ [dZu:] In case we want to force [u:] for a word we can use ū, e\n‰ ū, e ‰ w̄. In case we want\nto force [ju:] for a word we can use u, eu, ew. Finally, the elimination of repeated consonants is performed again. With all this, we have the IPA pronunciation for each word. Note that the IPA produced will not be exactly a standard IPA because of the placement of stress. We place stress on vowels, while IPA place stress at the start of syllables. Placing the stress with the IPA notation will not be performed, since we have not considered the notion of syllable, only vowel and consonant units."

Consequently, for any word a reader may have doubts about its pronunciation, the previous rules can be applied and the true pronunciation is obtained.\nAs discussed in the introduction, in order to read annotated English, someone (or something) must have annotated the text previously. As seen in Figure oreffig:inteannot, we require two inputs for the introduction: the English word and its pronunciation, in order to produce an output: the annotated word. We can distinguish two issues here. First, going from the English word + pronunciation to the annotated word can be easy in some cases, but cumbersome in others. In fact, the problem is like finding a transformation, using deletions, insertions and substitutions, that makes an alignment between the original English word and its pronunciation. The problem is easier than the general computational\nproblem since we only have three possible insertions (‘ ’, ‘—’, ‘ ’). For instance, the\nword ‘house’ and the pronunciation [haUs] easily suggest that we find a possible sound for ‘h’ which matches the IPA [h-], we also find a possible sound for ‘s’ (s\nˆ )\nwhich matches the IPA [-s], and we have that the digraph ‘ou’ can be converted into [-aU-]. Finally, a deletion of the ‘e’ makes the correspondence perfect. This gives us the correct annotation ‘hous\nˆ e ‰ ’. Following the rules seen in the previous\nsection, we can drop the last annotation and produce ‘hous ˆ e’.\nThe previous process is relatively simple for a human being if she has a good knowledge of the interpretation rules. A more difficult problem is how to make that automatically, i.e., by a computer program. This would require a coding of the rules, several transformation / alignment techniques and some off-the-shelf algorithms, such as dynamic programming. This is a solvable technical problem if we have the word and the pronunciation10. Given the small size of the words (each word is analysed independently), there are no relevant computational cost\n10 The pronunciation of every English word (including plurals and inflected verbs) can be obtained from several corpora and webpages.\nissues. The annotation process can be implemented in such a way that it annotates very fast on any personal computer. The only main concern to make this process automatic is the distinction of homographs which are not homophones (wind, live, use, read, lead, etc.). Some disambiguation techniques from computational linguistics would be required, which can resolve a high proportion of cases. The most difficult cases might be left for human supervision (perhaps one in each ten thousand words).\nIn this section we are not addressing the automation of the annotation process. We leave the analysis of the automation out of this paper. In this section, we discuss on a related problem we have to solve first before any manual or automated annotation process can begin. The problem is that, given an English word and a pronunciation, several alternative (and correct) annotations are possible. For instance, we can annotate ‘hea\n‰ d’, ‘he ‰ äd’ and ‘hĲea ‰ d’.\nAn option would be to allow all of them (all of them can be interpreted and give the same, correct, result) and choose them randomly or by a lexicographical order. However, having different options depending on the annotator would cause confusion, since the same word with the same pronunciation would look like differently depending on the occasion. Consequently, we need to settle a ‘standard’ choice, which gives preference for one annotation over the rest. This is also shown at the bottom of Figure 1."

      "heading" : "4.1 Annotation Preference Criteria for a Standard Annotation",
      "text" : "In order to define a standard to choose one annotation over the rest, we can consider the following kinds of criteria:\n– Economy. The fewer annotations a word has the better. So, we should prefer ‘hea\n‰ d’ over ‘he ‰ äd’ and ‘hĲea ‰ d’, and we should also prefer ‘hous ˆ e’ over ‘hous ˆ e ‰ ’. In fact, the rules in the previous section have been devised to avoid annotations when the (part of the) word follows the rule, so it would be stupid to include an annotatation which is not required. – Simplicity. Some annotations are simpler than others. For instance, ‘were ‰ ’ is\nsimpler than ‘wëre’. – Explicitness. Some annotations are more explicit than others. For instance,\n‘wëre’ is more explicit than ‘were ‰ ’.\n– Frequency. Some annotations rely on more frequent symbols than others. For instance, ‘hĲea\n‰ d’ is preferrable over ‘he ‰ äd’.\n– Etymology. Some annotations are more consistent with the etymology or word formation rules. For instance, ‘afflgo’ is preferrable over ‘agfflo’.\nThe problem is that the previous criteria are conflicting. For some words, applying one criterion implies going against some other criteria. There are two options here: (1) to devise a priority of criteria, (2) to give cost weights to each criteria, compute the costs and choose the annotation with the lowest cost. Note that the second option subsumes the first if we define high differences between the costs. In any case, both options are fine whenever they make a choice and allow for a standard to be defined.\nIn what follows we propose a cost weighting approach. We exclude etymology from the criteria, since this would require additional information and would make the process difficult to automate. In fact, we give high costs to separators, since we do not want to see things such as ‘agfflo’, ‘thirtffffleen’ or ‘microphffiffone’, because they are not etymological. So, the costs we propose are shown in Table 15.\nFor each annotation, we also reckon the position cost, which is an additional number we sums up the position number where all the annotations have taken place. This position is negative for deletions (‘a\n‰ ’) and positive for any other\nannotation. For instance, ‘ėxtre \" me’ has position cost 1 5 6, and ‘jĲea ‰ lous ˆ ’ has position cost 2 3 7 6. The position cost is only used to solve ties when applying the costs in Table 15. Generally, this means that with annotations with the same cost, we prefer the annotation to be leftmost unless it is a deletion, where we prefer it to be rightmost. For instance, ‘do\n‰ or’ has position cost 2,\nwhile ‘doo ‰ r’ has position cost 3 (hence ‘doo ‰ r’ is preferrable).\nWe apply the costs in tables 16, 17 and 18 for some alternative annotations in the examples shown 15."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusions",
      "text" : "This paper has presented _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^, a proposal of diacritical annotations which converts English into a language whose pronunciation can be unambiguously inferred from its spelling (plus annotations). The novel principle, which distinguishes this from any spelling reform, is that we set as an unbreakable principle that no single letter of English can be modified. Since English has virtually no diacritics (only in some loanwords, such as résumé, crème, piñata, etc., whose diacritics would be eliminated prior to the annotation process) we can use diacritics to annotate the pronunciation. _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ differs from a\nsimple pronunciation without respelling (partially existing in some old spelling books, dictionaries and specialised books) in the fact that we introduce a set of rules which incorporate most of the usual pronunciation rules in the English language. In this way we not only minimise the number of annotations, but they\n12 ‘poo ‰ r’ in RP.\nappear when the reader has the perception that the part of the word which is annotated is an exception to a rule.\nThe proposal includes a set of rules and many annotation symbols. Rules include how vowels, vowel digraphs, semiconsonants, consonants, and consonant digraphs must be pronounced. A set of about 20 annotation symbols has been necessary, especially because there are some characters in English (most especially vowels) which can have about 10 different sounds (without considering rhotic sounds). A first impression might be that the set of rules and the set of annotations are large and complex. We have to make some comments on this.\n– Rules: most rules we have introduced here (double-consonant rule to distinguish between plain and natural vowels, vowel digraphs, consonant pronunciation, final e, final ed, rhotic sounds, etc.) are just the same (or very similar) rules every speaker of English knows. This document just places everything together. For an average Ejnglish speaker, a short leaflet or schematic annotation table can be constructed as a mnemonic for beginners to the annotation system. – Symbols: we do not need to know all the symbols precisely in order to guess the right sound. For instance, if we see ‘wörd’, we can infer that it is not like ‘lord’, even ignoring what the sound of ‘ö’ is. In fact, when a new word is read, the doubt is typically between two possibilities: the regular and the irregular way. The annotation just sorts this out.\nGiven an annotated text, a reader can take advantage from annotations at several degrees. They can be ignored, and the text can be read as any other plain text. It can be used to distinguish regular cases from exceptions, or to place the stress in some words. Many annotations are intuitive or just obvious, such as the deletion symbol, as in ‘deb\n‰ t’, so even the first time an annotated text is used, there are\nsome basic understanding. More advanced (or interested) readers will soon make the small effort to take a look at the rules or to infer them by reading. In the end, if we have been able to infer thousands of pronunciation exceptions in the English language, we can also manage with a set of rules.\nHaving said this, there is of course an interesting discussion about the tradeoff between number of rules and percentage of annotations. One of the criteria we have followed is that the rules should be tuned to favour the most common words. That is the reason-why we have preferred a voiced ‘th’ and ‘s’ in some situations (instead of a voiceless one as the by-default case for every position). Even though we need two rules for ‘th’ and ‘s’, it saves many annotations in frequent words. In the appendix we discuss some other rules we did not finally include, because we thought (and think) that the set of rules must be simple and easy to learn by average people. Nonetheless, the exclusion or inclusion of rules can be done after a proper frequency analysis (this is what we have done to a greater or lesser degree for the introduction of our rules). In any case, the analysis of any old or new rule must take into account the frequency of words13, and very especially the most frequent words. According to [1], the first 25 most\n13 A very good resource is http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency lists\ncommon words make up about one-third of all printed material in English. The first 100 make up about one-half of all written material, and the first 300 make up about sixty-five percent of all written material in English.\nIn Table 19 and Table 20 we show some preliminary statistics (computed from the first five paragraphs for the entry ‘bed’ in wikipedia in different languages) where we see that the proportion of annotations is high. Nevertheless there are some European languages using the Roman alphabet with a higher annotation/diacritics ratio. This means two things. First, English spelling is not so irregular, provided a consistent set of rules is defined for it. Second, we should not obsess about reducing the annotation ratios by introducing many more rules, since the values are comparable to other languages which use diacritics and their speakers are relatively happy with them. Additionally, the annotation process will be automatic, so we should not care about writing in _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^.\nAnother criticism against _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ is that if we get used to it, then we will be unable to read in plain English. First of all, if we get used and feel comfortable with something, that means that it is useful, which is the main goal of this proposal. According to current computer technology, it should not\nbe a problem to annotate documents on demand. In any case, if one thinks that some people get a strong habit to _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ that it seems impossible\nto deal with plain English language again, we can take a look at the experience with other languages. For instance, in Spanish, a text without (or with wrong) diacritics can irritate many, but it is still well read and understood by all.\nOne of the issues we have not addressed in detail is how to annotate words which are pronounced differently in several dialects (some of them very common, such as ‘from’ , ‘of’, ‘real’). As we said in the introduction, the annotation for a text must choose one dialect. But it is important to be consistent. The entire document must be annotated with the same dialect and it should also be consistent with the spelling (e.g. it would be strange to see ‘fast tūmour’ or ‘fāst tumor’). Of course different annotations can be used in a novel or a conversation when people with different accents participate. In some cases, an annotation is valid for more dialects than a more specific one. For instance, ‘tıer’ is valid for both GA and RP, while ‘tĲıer’ is only valid for RP.\nTypography for _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ is of course a matter of taste. There are of course many other choices for the symbols. Our criterion has been to use frequent symbols that can be easily recognised, and to avoid symbols which can be confused with others. The distinction between upper annotations (vowels) and bottom annotations (consonants) is also the result of our criterion for clarity. It is important to highlight that any annotation covering two or more letters can be reduced to an annotation for one letter plus deletions. This makes typography much easier, since we can use single letter accents in text processors and editors, as well as in environments where we cannot play freely with the symbols as in LATEX (the text processor we have used to produce this document).\nFinally, even though _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ is not a spelling reform, it could be used as a basis for it, or at least for a spelling reform based to reduce the number of annotations (e.g. ‘are\n‰ ’ Ñ ‘ar’) or the most awkward ones (‘Mâgh\n‰ reb’Ñ MĲugreb), in such a way that the words that require the rarest annotation symbols could be modified first. Nonetheless, we will not pursue this idea further, since we are not convinced that a spelling reform is a good thing for the English language, as we have mentioned in the introduction.\nThe appendices include some ideas on rules we excluded, but also some ideas on the use of diacritical accents for homographs, as well as some notes on LATEX. Nonetheless we have plenty of work to be done before going back to these issues. Let us just enumerate some of the possible future work:\n– Construct an automatic interpreter (a reader) for _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^, tak-\ning an annotated text (using, e.g. a notation such as the LATEX commands used here or an XML approach) and converting it into an IPA representation.\n– Construct an automatic annotator. This is a more ambitious project, that would require dynamic programming techniques (to choose the most efficient annotation according to the costs) and also some disambiguation techniques. It also requires access to a corpus of IPA pronunciations for thousand of words (there are some which are freely accessible on-line).\n– Analysis of the rules by the reckoning of statistics for each rule (ratio of annotations using it or not using it). This task can be boosted if we have an annotator. An interesting approach for this analysis could be made by using the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle [8][7], where an MML coding would be used to transmit the pronunciation of an English text given its spelling. In other words, if sender and receiver share an English text and the receiver does not have any notion about English pronunciation, how can we devise a code such that we minimise the message including the pronunciation information? MML coding does not care about intuitive simplicity (only information efficiency) and it is very sensitive to the size of the documents (for infinite documents, everything would be embedded into rules) but it is an interesting idea as a principle. – Incorporate _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ in an English for foreigners programme, or\nin a pilot programme using material following the annotations. – Incorporate _Annota\n\" tėd Ėnglish^ in a spelling learning programme (e.g. for\nchildren), or in a pilot programme using material following the annotations.\nOnly after these tasks we will be able to evaluate the real usefulness and impact of this proposal."

We are against this option in principle, since the good thing about having annotations on common words is that they help learn the pronunciation of other, less frequent, words with the same annotation.\nFor instance, the five most common words according to [5] are: (the, of, to, and, a). If we eliminate annotations for the five of them, we have significant reduction in the annotation ratio, as we discussed in the conclusions.\nPerhaps we can treat differently those words which change from a strong from and a weak form. In fact, the first most common words have this property, as shown in Table 21. The use of a table such as this as a rule (keeping these five words without annotation) would reduce the ratio of annotations from 1/12 letters to 1/13 letters (approx)."

We have not included this (even it is well-known by speakers) because we want to stress the distinction between ‘loaves’ and ‘bridgės’, and ‘beatėd’ and ‘stuffed\nˆ ’.\nAnother issue could be to convert ‘ed’ into ’t’ when preceded by a voiceless consonant group (to avoid the annotation in ‘stuffed\nˆ ’). This would be consistent\nwith what we do with the ‘s’, where we do not need annotations for ‘loaves’ and ‘rats’ even though the ‘s’ are voiced and voiceless respectively.\nWe consider the combination we present here more consistent, but we understand that this is of course open for further discussion and analysis."

In fact, the vowels in natural position in technical or new words are rarely pronounced with the natural sound.\nAn interesting study would be to simplify the rule and consider all positions plain, except when stressed at the end of a segment. For instance, words such as ‘be’ and ‘go’ would be considered natural positions, but ‘plane’, ‘code’, etc., would be considered plain positions, so requiring an annotation. Although this looks contrary to the traditional English spelling and pronunciation rules, it is competitive in terms of annotations. For instance, Table 22 shows a text with the annotation system we have presented in this document on the left, and it shows the same text with the modification of the natural position rule on the right.\nWhile in the previous text the affected annotations are 11 against and 5 in favour, in other kinds of texts, the difference may be more balanced. A more complete study of frequencies should be done. If the statistical study gives a more balanced situation there would be reasons to modify the rule (the new rule is easier and an annotation symbol could be removed) and reasons to keep it as it is (the rules for natural and plain position match the implicit or explicit rules we use about the English language).\nA possible compromise would be to reconsider the situation of the groups #l and #r as single consonants. It is sometimes difficult to realise that words such as ‘pĲublici\n\"\" ze’ and ‘DĲeclarati”on of ˇ ’ require annotations to make the plain sound."

      "heading" : "A.4 The Pronunciation of ‘s’ after a Vowel",
      "text" : "The rule for ‘s’ understands this letter as one which oscillates between [s] and [z]. For the [z] sound we have ‘z’, and for the [s] sound we have ‘ce’, ‘ci’, ‘ss’. So ‘s’ is considered a transition consonant having both sounds depending on the context, including other words nearby (such as ‘This is bad’ or ‘This is terrible’). Our rules try to accommodate the voiced sound between vowels in common words (‘these’, ‘easy’, ‘cause’, ‘music’, etc) and also at the end of the word following a vowel or a voiced consonant (‘as’, ‘is’, and many plurals). It is also common in combinations ‘s’ + voiced group (‘Oslo’, ‘ãth\nˆ ėism’, etc.).\nHowever, these rules have many exceptions. For instance, it is typically voiceless after a vowel in these endings (-ous, -itis, -isis, -us, as well as very common words such as ‘this’ and ‘us’), many common words make it voiceless between vowels (‘hous\nˆ e’, ‘ceas ˆ e’, ‘bas ˆ is ˆ ’) and most technical words (‘par ˚ as ˆ i \"\" te’).\nA further sophistication would be to make it voiced between vowels (or at the end of the segment after a vowel) when the vowel before the ‘s’ has the stress. So it would work well for ‘these’, ‘easy’, ‘cause’, ‘music’, but also for endings such as ‘-ous’, ‘-itis’, partially ‘-isis’, -us. But we would require to fix the plurals (and they are not always after e, such as lamas, minis, gurus).\nSumming up, we are closer to consider ‘s’ voiceless for every situation than making the rule more complex."

For instance, ‘lorry’ would become ‘lĲorry’, and ‘syr\n˚ up’\nwould become ‘sĲyrup’. However, there are problems to distinguish between firing and pirate (the first is rhotic and the second is not). Annotating ‘p̃ırate’ and not ‘firing’ would be an obscure way to transmit the idea. So we finally decided to consider the r\n˚ . Another issue is to consider it equivalent to a double ‘rr’,\nwhich forces us to write ‘p̃ır ˚ ate’, but avoids the Ĳy in ‘syr ˚ up’, which is, by far,\nmore common.

The first can be easily eliminated since we have already introduced the annotations for ‘cellúlar’ and ‘failùre’, instead of ‘cell ̌ ular’ and ‘fail ure’. We could do similarly with the following: mill\nion Ñ millâıon. The reason why we have not implemented this is because we already have the symbol and the sound (e.g. torti\nlla), so it does not solve anything (it is merely an aesthetic thing). However, the same reason could be used to eliminate the diphthong annotation for ‘cellúlar’ and ‘failùre’.\nFor ‘—’, it is more difficult to eliminate this annotation completely, because we have words such as pengu—in and —̂one. The sound of —̂one is closer to the sound of fôie, but not identical. This suggests a possible switch, and to annotate òne (ò = [w2]) and fo\n‰ ı́e (́ı = [wA:]). Nonetheless, we think these combinations would\nbe more difficult to learn and are less intuitive (‘òne’ is simpler than ‘—̂one’, but it hides that we have the same sound as in ‘môney’, and also the strange consonantic sound ‘w’."

So we considered the introduction of a new symbol for diphthongs, as follows: Wide Diphthong. Single letter (\\dip{a}): Êa. Double letter (\\ddip{ae}): Áae. Before i, it goes like this: (\\dip{\\i}):Êı.\nExamples: backgrËound (better annotated as backffiffground), nËow, tËau, LËaos,\nfÁoie, FrËeud, frËau, Áeye, DĲalÁa \" i.\nTable 23 shows how it works.

There are other possible rules, such as that the primary stress is always on the second vowel unit from the right if the word ends with a ‘c’, such as ‘automatic’. But we should consider other suffixes such as ‘ical’, ‘isis’, etc.\nSeparators are a delicate thing. Separators affecting stress imply many things at the same time. They can be handy, but they can also be difficult to understand."

      "heading" : "A.13 Reduced Vowels",
      "text" : "Any sound can be unstressed using the appropriate annotation. For a single vowel, the most common unstressed sounds are [@] for a, e, o and u, [oU] for o, [i] for e (ė) and i, and [U]/[jU]/[j@] for u. Many of these sounds can be annotated.\nThe problem appears when the same letter may have different sounds depending on the reader’s speed or emphasis. For instance, emission and omission can sound differently for many dialects if pronounced carefully, but they become indistinct in some dialects if read quickly. There are different situations, depending on the speed and the dialect.\nlentil [i]/[@] omission [oU]/[@] beautiful [U]/[@] cellular [jU]/[j@] emission [i]/[@] ammunition [jU]/[j@] failure [j@] figure [j@]/[@] Mercury [jU]/[j@] Chocolate [i]/[@] tenure [j@]/[jU@r] telephone [i]/[@] futile [aI]/[@] fortune [@]\nIn some cases, this is related with the word being rhotic or not, and also to the cases in section A.14. At the bottom of table 3, we can see that even the IPA has some symbols for these situations ([j@], [8], [0], [1]), because they do not only oscillate but they can even be a different phoneme.\nA possibility would be to include symbols that could account for these variants, so annotating a word in such a way that it would be valid for different pronunciations of the word and even for different dialects. A proposal we considered is: Reduced. Single letter (\\red{a}): Ŕ̃ a. Double letter (\\rred{ae}): Ŕ̃ ae is not used.\nExamples: Ŕ̃ emi \" ssi”on, Ŕ̃omi \" ssi”on, currĲı \" c Ŕ̃ ulum, amm Ŕ̃ unĲı \" ti”on\nHowever, this is somehow against the philosophy of producing one pronunciation given an annotated word. Consequently, in cases where the difference is caused by speed, we choose the pronunciation when the word is read slowly and carefully. In cases where the difference is originated by dialect, we have to choose one of them.\nA.14 Unstressed di-gi/ji-ci/sci/ssi-si-sti-ti-xi-zi Followed by Vowel and du-ju-ssu-su-tu-xu-zu\nThere is an implicitly (or explicitly) well-known rule in English about the pronunciation of words such as passion, vision, nation, pressure, leisure, nature, etc. We have of course analysed a possible rule form them. Table 24 summarise the possibilities. Table 24 is restricted to unstressed combinations. For stressed cases, the sound is not altered, as in science, june (but sure and sugar). But in some dialects, dune sounds [dZ], tune sounds ([tS].\nIn the table we also show that some cases would be excluded by previous rules (denoted by *), and some cases have several pronunciations (denoted by +).\nWe also have cases where -ge-, -ce-, -te- sounds -ci-, -ti-, and we have positive cases such as dungeon, surgeon, ocean, crustacean, violaceous, but also negative cases such ossean, Piscean, Odysseus, and other cases just because -ea- is taken as a cluster.\nApart from all these exceptions and special cases (and the length of the table to describe all the combinations), we would need annotations to say that the effect does not take place. This means that we would require annotations for the normal t, for the normal d, for the normal x, for the normal z. This is the main reason why we did not adopted this. Because it could create cases where we would not be able to find an annotation to undo the rule (perhaps the separation symbols, but this would be very awkward, like in ‘gimnã\n\" sffǐium’ or mightffiiest.\nRelated to that we have to mention the endings -lure, -nion, -nious, -lia, -nia, etc. In some cases they require a sound [j] (as in failure, million and onion), and in other cases they do not."

      "heading" : "A.15 Diacritic Use of Annotations for Homographs (Homophone and Not-homophone)",
      "text" : "There is a possibility to annotate a word which would not require an annotation in order to distinguish it from its homograph. In the cases where the homographs are not homophone, it is clear that both words will have a different annotation (such as wind and wı̃nd, or w|ound and wàound). In the first case, we can get confused if we get used to annotated text and we eventually read non-annotated text. Any appearance of the word ‘wind’ will be assimilated with the first variant, even though in non-annotated English it could be both of them. We think this is slight problem since the reader must realise the context. The problem can be more serious if we just read some words (a slogan, a sign, etc.). If a few words have no annotations, it might be an annotated text, but this possibility is quite unlikely. So we will not care about this.\nAnother different situation is when two different words are homographs and homophones. In this case, the annotation would be the same. For instance, we have ‘run’ for the infinitive and for the past participle. Since none of them have an annotation, we could write ‘rĲun’ for the participle to distinguish it from the infinitive. This technique is used in other languages, such as Spanish, where it is called a ‘diacritical accent’. It is an interesting idea, but we will not develop it at this moment of the proposal.\nB Appendix. Some LATEX Stuff. Packages and Symbol\nConstruction\nThis appendix is intended to people who wants to use LATEX. As it is possible that some annotators would produce LATEX text which could be compiled into PDFs using LATEX, this may be useful to people who are not regular users of LATEX.\nThe good thing about using LATEX or any other command-based or markup language is that we can define commands or labels for several annotations and then modify their graphical representation. For instance the annotated word ‘showfir|oom’ is coded in LATEX as follows:\nshow\\se{}r\\oopq{oo}m\nThis can be easily converted into XML as:\nshow<se/>r<oopq>oo<oopq/>m\nAnd represented graphically with a proper style sheet.\nB.1 Packages used and new symbols we created\nThis section describes the packages we need in LATEX. Here they are:\n\\usepackage{amssymb} % many mathematical symbols \\usepackage{amsmath} % many mathematical symbols \\usepackage{yhmath} % \\widetriangle \\usepackage{tipa} % many \\usepackage{phonetic} % \\textipa and related symbols \\usepackage{extraipa} % \\subdoublevert \\usepackage{mathabx} % \\widecheck \\usepackage{stmaryrd} % \\Ydown \\usepackage{harpoon} % \\overleftharpdown, \\overleftharp \\usepackage{mathtools} % \\overbracket \\usepackage{accents} % fabrication of new accents (\\accentset, \\underaccent)\nWhen using multiple packages we may encounter incompatibilities because a package tries to redefine a command, which has been already defined. For instance, when using the LNCS documentclass, we may get a warning when loading package ‘amsmath’:\nUnable to redefine math accent \\vec\nThis can trigger further errors on other packages, such as in accents.sty, with something like “Argument of \\vec has and extra ”, because the right redefinition did not take place. One way of solving this is surrounding the ‘documentclass’ declaration as follows:\n\\let\\accentvec\\vec \\documentclass[fleqn]{llncs} \\let\\spvec\\vec \\let\\vec\\accentvec"

    "abstractText" : "This document presents _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^, a system of diacritical symbols which turns English pronunciation into a precise and unambiguous process. The annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The annotations are based on a set of general rules that makes the frequency of annotations not dramatically high (despite the chaotic orthography of English). This makes the reader easily associate annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after reading a few pages of _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^, and can take advantage from that knowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future. These features pave the way for multiple applications. _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ can be used as a tool for teachers and parents when English-speaking children learn English orthography or simply when they start reading. Annotated textbooks, tales, dictionaries and any other material can make English orthography less painful. _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ can also be very useful for students of English as a foreign language, since pronunciation is terribly troublesome for them, because they need to learn the meaning, the spelling and the pronunciation for each word they learn, and the pronunciation does not improve at all by reading. This is so because we can only see the spelling and infer the meaning, but books do not provide the correct pronunciation for each word. In fact, incorrect pronunciation (we are not referring here to a bad accent or intonation) persists in people who has lived in an English-speaking country for decades, because the true pronunciation is never shown (unless the IPA transcription is looked up in a dictionary), just heard in different contexts and situations. Finally, _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^ can also be very practical for any regular user (native or not) of the English language, very especially when facing new (especially technical) words and they have doubts about their pronunciation. In this document we introduce the rules for annotations and its symbols. This document is not intended for a general audience, and the explanations are focussed to precisely understand how the annotation system works. It is obvious that if the system has to be explained to a final user, a shorter and simpler manual should be issued for that. In any case, for learning _Annota \" tėd Ėnglish^, the best thing is to take a look at the examples. There is a section in this document with some annotated texts. It is recommended to take a quick look at them before getting into details.",
