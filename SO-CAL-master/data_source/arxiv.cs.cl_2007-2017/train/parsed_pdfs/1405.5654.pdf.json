      "text" : "For most of pairs of languages, the available parallel corpus is very limited. Even with many bilingual corpora, the language pair of English and French is also confined in specific areas, such as political speech. So when training corpus in a particular field for a machine translation system, it is hard to translate the text in different fields.\nIn order to solve this problem, we turned to a comparable non-parallel corpus. Comparable Corpus contains two corpora in different language that are not parallel in the strict sense, but they are related, and often convey the same information. Such as Xinhua News, CNN, the BBC, which often contain sentence pairs that can be used as the translations.\nNon-parallel corpus is also known as comparable corpus formed by the texts of two languages with some similarities. Such as: News belong to different sites on the same day and have the same theme both in Chinese and English. Non-parallel corpus often has texts in two languages which may be the relevant reports of the same event written by different writers using there native languages, so they are comparable. In the strict sense, non-parallel corpus is not parallel, but the messages that the two texts delivered is relevant, and the words in sentences may have different orders. For it is easy to obtain from the Internet, the non-parallel corpus has been used instead of the parallel corpus as the training corpus of machine translation. Dragos Stefan Munteanu,\net al (2005) studied how to align sentences of the non-parallel corpus for a machine translation system. They first obtain the candidate translations from the non-parallel corpus by the method of information retrieval, and then using the maximum entropy classifier to accurately determine whether a sentence pair is corresponding translations. The experimental results show that the data obtained can effectively improve the accuracy of statistical machine translation.\nBased on the assumption that the information provided by the non-parallel\ncorpus can improve the accuracy of machine translation, we propose a semi-supervised transductive learning framework. “Transductive” means we repeat to translate the source language in the non-parallel corpus, then according to the translation results, we select the corresponding translations from the target language and source language sentences together to form parallel sentences in order to improve the accuracy of statistical machine translation. This approach also allows the machine translation system to adapt to texts of a new areas."

      "text" : "Before applying bilingual corpus to machine translation, we has to determine the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or even phrases, single words of the source and target languages which are mutual translations. This process is known as the \"alignment\". In general, the unit for collecting corporal is the chapter, so the first step of processing bilingual corpora is to align sentence.\nIn the earlier researches of sentence alignment, we generally compare the length of sentences in two languages. The basic idea of this method is that the long sentence of the source language corresponds to the long sentences of the target language, and the short sentence of the source language corresponds to the short sentence of the target language. There are proportional relationships between the sentence length of two languages. Calculating the length of the sentence has two methods: measure the number of characters or the number of words. Both methods achieved good alignment results in the Canadian Hansards bilingual corpus of British and French. Peter F. Brown (1991) uses the word as the unit to calculate the length. He selected 90% sentences of the Canadian Hansards corpus that is easier to handle. The alignment accuracy rate achieved to 99.4%. William A. Gale (1993) used characters as the calculation unit of length. The alignment accuracy achieved to 98% on all the sentences of Canadian Hansards corpus. And for the 80% part of it which is easier to handle, the alignment accuracy achieved to 99.6%. But the alignment method based on the length is not suitable for all languages. For two languages (such as English and Chinese) in different linguistic families, the results are not satisfactory that the translations are likely to be missed (Liu Xin, 1995). Dekai Wu (1994) aligned Hong Kong Hansards Chinese-English bilingual corpus with this method. The accuracy rate is only 86.4%.\nAnother sentence alignment method is based on the vocabulary. Martin Kay, et\nal (1993) proposed that if the distribution of the two words is the same, then they are the corresponding unit. That is if a word occurs in the vast majority of a sentence, its\ncorresponding word must also appear in the corresponding sentence. They use American Articles as the corpus. After four iterations, 96% of the sentences will be aligned. Stanley F. Chen et al (1993) adopted the EM iterative algorithm. According to the word-to-word translation model, they use the dynamic programming method to determine the optimal alignment mode. With the emergence of bilingual dictionaries, bilingual dictionaries are used to directly align sentences. Yang Muyun(2002) accomplishes the bilingual sentence alignment method based on bilingual dictionaries in English and Chinese, and the accuracy rate achieves 93%. Takehito Utsuro (1994) combined bilingual dictionaries and statistical methods to build a bilingual alignment framework. In addition, Dekai Wu (1994) proposed a hybrid-aligned technology by combining vocabulary and length. He tested his system in the Hong Kong Hansards Chinese-English bilingual corpus, and the accuracy rate achieves 92.1%."

      "text" : "Machine Learning is the core of the artificial intelligence research, which usually refers to that through the induction and synthesis approach the computer simulates the human learning ability, constructs its models and algorithms to acquire new knowledge or skills from the known sample, and re-organizes existing learning structure so as to continuously improve their performance. Although the mechanism of human learning is not yet clear, by the induction of calculation model, the system can automatically make adaptive changes to complete the complex tasks which only human beings can complete originally.\nMachine learning includes the supervised learning and the unsupervised learning. In traditional supervised machine learning, the learning algorithm training the model on the labeled sample set given by the outside world, inductive parameters from the sample set, and label the unknown data set based on the knowledge learned (by Trevor Hastie, 2005). Most of the classification methods are supervised machine learning. However, in many applications, labeling the sample set often requires a lot of artificial and financial resources, and the process is tedious and consistency that the quality can not be guaranteed. Because the model overfits the training data, the traditional supervised learning methods are often unable to build classifiers to meet the actual demand. Different from the supervised learning, unsupervised learning methods do not need data with labels, and the number of classes to learn may not know in advance, such as clustering and the EM algorithm.\nSemi-supervised learning is a kind of area between supervised learning and supervised learning. It requires a small labeled training data set, and an unlabeled training data set. The labeling algorithm is as follows (Ian H. Witten, 2006):\n(1) use of labeled data to train a classifier; (2) the classifier is applied to unlabeled data, gives each element a category\naccording to the class probability;\n(3) adding the new annotation data to the training set; (4) use the new training set to train a new classifier; (5) iterate until convergence."

      "text" : "Unsupervised learning method was first applied to the word alignment. Chris\nCallison -Burch, et al (2004) use unsupervised learning on a sentence-aligned parallel texts to acquire a word alignment model, and also use the unsupervised method to train another model with a small artificial word-aligned corpus. They combine the two models as word alignment statistical data, reduce the alignment error rate and improve the performance of the machine translation system. Alexander Fraser, et al (2006) use a semi-supervised learning methods on the basis of IBM model 4: use the discriminant step to improve the quality of word alignment in a small corpus that are manually aligned, apply the estimated step and maximize step alternatively in a large-scale training corpus. This method improves the translation accuracy rate of the phrase-based statistical machine translation system.\nCo-training method is a weakly supervised learning method. Chris\nCallison-Burch (2002) introduces co-training to statistical machine translation. This approach requires a variety of source language aligned with the same target language sentence as a small amount of manually annotated initial data. They use the initial small-scale manually annotated data to obtain the large-scale annotated corpus by iteration. For source language sentence of each language, they use different translation models to obtain the target language candidates, and then select the best from the candidates as the final translation.\nNicola Ueffing (2007) proposes an transductive and adaptive training model for\nstatistical machine translation. They use a phrase-based machine translation system to translate the source language sentences, translations with a confidence score above the threshold are added to the training set. \"Transductive\" means repeatedly translating sentence in development set and test set, and using the generated translations to gradually increase the performance of statistical machine translation system. The model selection step discards bad translations, and enhances the quality of the phrase translation table. Their experiments show that using the selection can obtain better results than adding all the translations to the system."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised transductive learning method based on non-parallel corpus. Instead of using monolingual corpus of the source language (Nicola Ueffing, 2007), we use the non-parallel bilingual corpus that can be obtained free from the Internet. Transductive learning is a semi-supervised learning method. When lack of parallel corpus, we can expand parallel corpus gradually by iteration in order to improve the system performance. Transductive learning translates the monolingual corpus by the current model and selects the translations with higher score. The selected translations are combined with their source language sentences to form a sentence pair which are added to the training corpus. Then the expanded\ncorpus is used to train a new model to get better translations. After a dozen or even hundreds of iterations, the system performance will be gradually improved, and ultimately converge. In transductive learning, how to choose the translations with a higher accuracy rate is the key to success. Ueffing scores the translations by the priori probabilities of words and phrases and the target language model. This is a self-learning method. By discarding low-scoring translation, we can further improve the quality of the translation model.\n(1) Input: a sentence-aligned parallel training set L (2) Input: bilingual non-parallel corpus U (3) Input: number of iterations R , the value of the bestn  list\n(4) {}:1 T / / Additional bilingual training corpus\n(5) 0:i / / number of iterations (6) repeat\n(7) Training Steps: ),(: 1 )(  i i TLEstimate / / )(i for the system parameters\n(8) {}:iX / / the generated translation set of this iteration\n(9) for each source language sentence Us\n(10) Labeling Step: use )(i decoding s, compare with the corresponding target\nlanguage text of non-parallel corpus, and get N sentences with the best scores.\n(11)         N nnn i nnii ststXX 1 )( ))|(,,(: \n(12) end\n(13) Scoring Step: )(: ii XScoreS  / / give a score to each sentence in X\n(14) Selecting Steps: ),(: iii SXSelectT  / / select a subset of X including good\ntranslations.

Different form Nicola Ueffing (2007), we compare the translations of the model with the target language in non-parallel corpus, and select correct ones adding to the training corpus. The selection process is no longer dependent on the language model and the priori probability. Instead it uses the translations of the current model as a scoring scale to align source language sentences and target language sentences in non-parallel corpus of in order to obtain new parallel sentences. This approach can take full advantage of the translation results of the\ncurrent model. Moreover, the parallel sentences added the training corpus to come from the corpus itself, so the translations have the higher accuracy in favor of the system performance improvement. Transductive Learning on non-parallel corpus for the first time consider the sentence alignment and the translation system as a unified whole. Sentence alignment is based on translations produced by the translation model, and updating the translation model is based on results of sentence alignment. The specific algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1."

So the use of non-parallel\ncorpus has strict field restrictions.\nEven so, for constructing the parallel corpus is time-consuming and laborious,\nthe prospect of non-parallel corpus is still very impressive. Extracting parallel\nsentence pairs from non-parallel corpus can be used for machine translation systems\nresources acquisition as a new direction. At present, the demand for bilingual corpus\nis the growing, and the use of the bilingual corpus has spread to word segmentation,\nPOS tagging, parsing, information retrieval and text classification. Therefore, we\nshould make best use of the resources available online to obtain more parallel corpus.\nNon-parallel corpus is not readily available bilingual corpus. Researchers can use the\ncomputer automatic or semi-automatic method to turn the non-parallel corpus into a\nbilingual corpus. We believe that this approach is helpful to training data acquisition\nfor machine translation, and can reduce the workload and time for constructing the\nparallel corpus.\nReference\n[1] Dragos Stefan Munteanu and Daniel Marcu. 2005.

    "abstractText" : "Although the parallel corpus has an irreplaceable role in machine translation, its scale and coverage is still beyond the actual needs. Non-parallel corpus resources on the web have an inestimable potential value in machine translation and other natural language processing tasks. This article proposes a semi-supervised transductive learning method for expanding the training corpus in statistical machine translation system by extracting parallel sentences from the non-parallel corpus. This method only requires a small amount of labeled corpus and a large unlabeled corpus to build a high-performance classifier, especially for when there is short of labeled corpus. The experimental results show that by combining the non-parallel corpus alignment and the semi-supervised transductive learning method, we can more effectively use their respective strengths to improve the performance of machine translation system.",
