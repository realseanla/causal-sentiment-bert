      "text" : "A linking theory explains how verbs’ semantic arguments are mapped to their syntactic arguments (Fillmore, 1970; Zwicky, 1971; Jackendoff, 1972; Carter, 1976; Pinker, 1984, 1989; Grimshaw, 1990; Levin, 1993). For example, the verb hit has three semantic arguments—one for the HITTER, one for the HITTEE, and one for the hitting INSTRUMENT—and for each token of hit, a subset of those semantic arguments are mapped to its syntactic arguments—e.g. subject, direct object, or object of a preposition.\n(1) a. [John]HITTER hit [the fence]HITTEE. b. [The stick]INST hit [the fence]HITTEE.\n(2) a. #[The fence]HITTEE hit [John]HITTER. b. #[The fence]HITTEE hit [the stick]INST.\nThe main desideratum for selecting a linking theory is how well it explains linking regularities: which mappings do and do not occur. One example of a linking regularity is that HITTEE arguments cannot be mapped to subject, suggested by the fact that (1) and (2) cannot mean the same thing.\nThe task of constructing a linking theory that covers the entire lexicon is no small feat. One classic (though not the only) example of this difficulty concerns psych verbs, like fear and frighten (Lakoff, 1970; Postal, 1974; Perlmutter and Postal, 1984; Baker, 1988; Dowty, 1991; Pesetsky, 1995).\n(3) a. [Mary]FEARER feared [John]FEAREE. b. #[John]FEAREE feared [Mary]FEARER.\n(4) a. #[Mary]FEARER frightened [John]FEAREE. b. [John]FEAREE frightened [Mary]FEARER.\nPsych verbs raise issues for theories that disallow mapping FEARER to subject, since fear does that, as well as those that disallow mapping FEAREE to subject, since frighten does that.1\nLinking theory is intimately related to semantic role labeling (SRL) (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Marquez et al., 2008), which is a form of shallow semantic parsing. Where a linking theory maps from semantic arguments to syntactic arguments, an SRL system maps from syntactic arguments to semantic\n1See Hartshorne et al. 2015 for recent work on how children learn psych verbs’ linking regularities.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n02 54\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 8\nO ct\n2 01\narguments. Thus, SRL systems can be thought of as interpreting language, and linking theory implementations can be thought of as generating language.2 But while much work has focused on building widecoverage SRL systems, linking theory has not commanded similar attention.\nIn this paper, we introduce a framework for implementing linking theories—computational linking theory (CLT)—which substantially generalizes an idea first introduced by Grenager and Manning (2006). In CLT, the traditional linking theoretic notion of a mapping from the space of semantic arguments Sem to the space of syntactic arguments Syn is implemented as a classifier.\nThis classifier can take several forms based on the structure of Syn. For instance, following Lang and Lapata (2010), who build on Grenager and Manning 2006, Synmight be a set of syntactic positions, such as {subject, object, . . . }, in which case Sem might be a set of thematic roles, such as {AGENT, PATIENT, . . . }. Another possibility is that Syn is a set of syntactic position sequences such as {(subject, object), (subject, oblique), . . . }, in which case Sem might similarly be a set of thematic role sequences {(AGENT, PATIENT), (AGENT, INST), . . . }, and the classifier would involve structured prediction.\nIn the first part of this paper, we deploy CLT in conjunction with PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), VerbNet (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), SemLink (Loper et al., 2007), and Reisinger et al.’s (2015) recently released Semantic Proto-Roles version 1 (SPR1) dataset to evaluate the efficacy of various linking theories proposed in the theoretical literature. In the second part, we show that CLT can be useful not only for evaluation, but also for exploratory analysis, by developing a measurement model—the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model (SPROLIM)—for analyzing computational linking theories. And though our main aim is to compare and explore theoretical proposals using computational tools, we believe that those interested in semantic role induction (SRI) will find this measurement model useful for incorporating independent semantic annotations into SRI.\nWe focus on two cross-cutting types of linking theories that have been proposed in the theoretical\n2See Flanigan et al. 2016 for recent work on semanticsbased language generation with a looser coupling to the syntax.\nliterature: local v. global models and categorical v. featural models. The distinction between local and global models—which, as we discuss in §2, is analogous to the distinction between local and global SRL systems (cf. Toutanova et al., 2005, 2008a)— contacts a long-standing theoretical debate regarding whether semantic arguments are mapped to syntactic positions independently of other arguments (Baker, 1988) or whether there are dependencies among semantic arguments (Dowty, 1991). There is general consensus among theoreticians that this debate has been won in favor of localist theories—a consensus that we hope to break here.\nThe distinction between categorical and featural models contacts an independent debate as to whether semantic arguments, such as HITTER and HITTEE, fall into discrete semantic role categories, such as AGENT or PATIENT, or whether they are associated to a greater or lesser extent with fuzzy semantic role prototypes, such as PROTOAGENT and PROTOPATIENT (Dowty, 1991). Because the featural models have been far less developed in the theoretical literature—largely due to lack of good methodologies for understanding their behavior—our goal here will be to further develop measurement models for exploring featural theories.\nOur main findings are:\n1. Global models outperform local models (§4) 2. Categorical models outperform featural mod-\nels, particularly for oblique arguments (§4) 3. Dowty’s PROTOAGENT prototype is robustly\ndiscovered by our measurement model, but his PROTOPATIENT prototype appears to be a collection of multiple other prototype roles (§5)\nWe begin with a discussion of related work in the statistical machine translation and shallow semantic parsing literatures, and we give a brief introduction to linking theory (§2). We then describe the three datasets (PropBank, VerbNet, and SPR1) we build on to implement linking models (§3). Based on these data, we implement and test four linking models built from crossing the categorical-featural distinction with the local-global distinction, and we establish the unequivocal superiority of the global models (§4). These experiments reveal challenges faced by the featural model, which we investigate using our Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model (§5)."

Hajic et al., 2004). This problem has been particularly important in the area of statistical machine translation (SMT), where one needs to translate from morphologically poor languages like English to morphologically richer languages like Japanese and German (Koehn, 2005).\nSMT researchers have focused for the most part on using morphological and syntactic predictors. Suzuki and Toutanova (2006, 2007) construct models for predicting Japanese morphological case (which marks syntactic position in languages that have such cases) using intralanguage positional and alignment-based features, and Jeong et al. (2010) extend this line of work to Bulgarian, Czech, and Korean. Koehn and Hoang (2007), Avramidis and Koehn (2008), and Toutanova et al. (2008b) use richer phrase-based features to do the same task.\nOther approaches have incorporated semantic roles into SMT reranking components (Wu and Fung, 2009), similar to the reranking conducted in many SRL systems (cf. Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Pradhan et al., 2004, 2005b,a; Toutanova et al., 2005, 2008a, among others), but directly predicting syntactic position has not been explored in SMT (though see Minkov et al. 2007, who suggest using semantic role information in future work)."

Where a linking theory aims to map a verb’s semantic arguments to it syntactic arguments, an SRL system aims to map a verb’s syntactic arguments to its semantic arguments (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Litkowski, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Marquez et al., 2008).\nContinuing with examples (1) and (2) from Section 1, a linking theory would need to explain why (and when) HITTERs and INSTRUMENTs, but not HITTEEs, are mapped to subject position; in contrast, an SRL system would need to label the subject position with HITTER or INSTRUMENT (or some abstraction of those roles like A0 or A2) and the object with HITTEE (or some abstraction like A1).\nLocal v. global models Toutanova et al. (2005, 2008a) introduce a distinction between local and global (joint) SRL models. In a local SRL model, a labeling decision is made based on only the features of the argument being labeled, while in a global system, features of the other arguments can be taken into account. The analogous distinction for a linking theory is between local linking models, which predict an argument’s syntactic position based only on that argument’s semantic role, and global linking models, which predict an argument’s syntactic position based on its semantic role along with others’. In §4, we implement both local and global linking models for each representation of Sem we consider.\nSemantic role induction Semantic role annotation is expensive, time-consuming, and hard to scale. This has led to the development of unsupervised SRL systems for semantic role induction (SRI). Work in SRI has tended to focus on using syntactic features to cluster arguments into semantic roles. Swier and Stevenson (2004) introduce the first such system, which uses a bootstrapping procedure to first associate verb tokens with frames containing typed slots (drawn from VerbNet), then iteratively compute probabilities based on cooccurrence counts and fill unfilled slots based on these probabilities.\nGrenager and Manning (2006) introduce the idea of predicting syntactic position based on a latent semantic role representation learned from syntactic and selectional features. Lang and Lapata (2010) expand on Grenager and Manning 2006 by introducing the notion of a canonicalized linking. We discuss these ideas further in §5, incorporating both into our Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model (SPROLIM).\nSyntax-based clustering approaches which do not explicitly attempt to predict syntactic position have also been popular. Lang and Lapata (2011a, 2014) use graph clustering methods and Lang and Lapata (2011b) use a split-merge algorithm to cluster\narguments based on syntactic context. Titov and Klementiev (2011) use a non-parametric clustering method based on the Pitman-Yor Process, and Titov and Klementiev (2012) propose two nonparametric clustering models based on the Chinese Restaurant Process (CRP) and distance dependent CRP."

      "heading" : "2.3 Abstracting semantic roles",
      "text" : "To predict syntactic position, linking theories aim to take advantage of linking regularities. One way theories take advantage of linking regularities is to abstract over semantic arguments in such a way that the abstractions correlate with syntactic position. Two main types of abstraction have been proposed. On the one hand are categorical theories, which group semantic arguments into a finite set of semantic roles—e.g., HITTERs are AGENTs, HITTEEs are PATIENTs, etc.—and then (deterministically) map these categories onto syntactic positions—e.g., subject, direct object, etc. (Fillmore, 1970; Zwicky, 1971; Jackendoff, 1972; Carter, 1976, inter alia; see Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2005; Williams 2015 for a review). In a categorical theory, Sem is thus some set of discrete indices, such as the core NP argument roles assumed in PropBank—i.e., {A0,A1, . . .} (Palmer et al., 2005)—or VerbNet—i.e., {AGENT, PATIENT, . . .} (Kipper-Schuler, 2005).\nOn the other hand are featural theories, which assign each semantic argument a set of feature values based on predicate entailments imposed on that argument. For instance, HITTERs are instigators and are thus assigned [+INSTIGATES]; they need not be volitional and are thus assigned [-VOLITIONAL]; and they are not affected by the event and are thus assigned [-AFFECTED]; in contrast, HITTEEs are [- INSTIGATES], [-VOLITIONAL], and [+AFFECTED]. A featural theory maps from (vectors of) those feature values onto syntactic positions. Thus, in a featural theory, Sem is (or is related to) some set of vectors representing some priveleged set of P entailments—e.g., {0, 1}P , RP , etc.. A dataset that provides such a representation for verb-argument pairs in the Penn Treebank, which is also annotated for PropBank and (partially) for VerbNet roles, was recently made available by Reisinger et al. (2015).3\n3http://decomp.net"

      "heading" : "2.4 Role fragmentation",
      "text" : "Featural theories were initially proposed to remedy certain failings of the categorical theories. In particular, reasonably wide-coverage categorical theories require an ever-growing number of roles to capture linking regularities—a phenomenon that Dowty (1991) refers to as role fragmentation.\nIn the face of role fragmentation, categorical theories have two choices: (i) use a large number of roles or (ii) force the fragmented roles into classes that predict the syntax well but map onto many distinct (possibly non-cohesive) semantic notions. These same choices must be made when developing a resource. For instance, FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) makes the first choice; PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) makes the second; and VerbNet (KipperSchuler, 2005) splits the difference.\nFeatural theories remedy the role fragmentation found in categorical theories by positing a small number of properties that a verb might entail about each of its arguments. The properties that hold of a particular argument determine which position it gets mapped to. Different configurations of these properties correspond to a large space of roles. For example, P binary properties generate 2P potential roles. Dowty (1991) proposes the first (and, perhaps, most comprehensive) list of such properties as a part of specifying his proto-role linking theory (PRLT).\nIn PRLT, properties are grouped into two clusters: PROTOAGENT properties and PROTOPATIENT properties. These groupings are named this way for the fact that AGENTs in categorical theories, which tend to get mapped to subject position, tend to have PROTOAGENT properties and PATIENTs, which tend to get mapped to a non-subject position, tend to have PROTOPATIENT properties. With this idea in mind, Dowty proposed that semantic arguments\nwere linked to syntactic arguments by (i) counting the number of PROTOAGENT and PROTOPATIENT properties each argument has and (iia) mapping the argument with the most PROTOAGENT properties to subject or, (iib) if there is a tie for PROTOAGENT properties, mapping the argument with the least PROTOPATIENT properties to subject.\nAn important thing to note before moving on is that, unlike other linking theories, which are concerned with determining more general linking phenomena Dowty concerns himself only with determining which semantic argument is mapped to subject, though he does briefly suggest that his system might extend to selecting which argument is mapped to, e.g., object v. oblique position. We assess such an extension in the experiments described below."

Kako, 2006; Greene and Resnik, 2009; Hartshorne et al., 2013). Reisinger et al. constructed the questions to correspond to each of Dowty’s proto-role properties.

The most important of these filters for current purposes is one that retains only NP core arguments. This is useful here, since linking theories tend to only treat semantic arguments that surface as NPs. In spite of these filters, some non-NPs occur in SPR1.

This is problematic for the cross-validation we employ in §4. To remedy this, we collapse the indirect object label to the direct object label.

In both experiments, the PropBank- and SPR1-based models are fit to the full SPR1 dataset, and all three models are fit to the VerbNet-annotated subset.\nThe featural models—in particular, the global featural model—can be seen as a generalization of Dowty’s proto-role model. Like Dowty’s model, it groups properties based on how predictive they are of particular syntactic positions—e.g., PROTOAGENT properties are predictive of subject position. They are a generalization in two senses: (i) for Dowty, each role is weighted equally—one simply counts how many of each kind of property hold— while here, these properties can receive distinct weights (and are ordinal- rather than binary-valued); and (ii) instead of predicting only subject v. nonsubject; we attempt to also differentiate among nonsubjects—i.e., direct object v. obliques. another way of thinking about the featural models is that they,\nlike Dowty’s model, admit of role prototypes with piecewise linear boundaries in the property space.\nThe main findings in this section are that (i) the global models substantially improve upon the local models for both categorical and featural predictors and (ii) the featural models perform worse overall than the categorical models. The first finding argues against local linking theories like that proposed by Baker (1988). We hypothesize that the second finding has two sources: (i) the set of properties in SPR1, which are essentially just Dowty’s properties, is insufficient for capturing distinctions among nonsubject positions like direct object and oblique— likely because Dowty engineered his properties only to distinguish subjects from non-subjects; and (ii) because the models we use don’t capture multimodality in the kinds of property configurations that exist.

This suggests that, regardless of one’s representation of argument semantics, global models are to be preferred\narguments were high on average, most configurations are not possible—e.g., one never finds two subjects. These sorts of syntax-aware constraints can significantly cut down the space of configurations that need to be considered.\nover local models. It furthermore suggests that the current trend in theoretical linguistics to prefer local models likely needs to be reassessed.\nSecond, we find that the featural models do worse than the categorical models, particularly comparing the respective local models, but that this gap is closed to some extent when considering the respective global models. This change is particularly apparent for obliques, for which the local featural model’s performance is abysmal and the global featural model’s performance is middling, at least when validated on the full dataset.6 As such, in the remainder of this section, we focus in on understanding the behavior of the global models.\nBecause these models are fairly simple, it is straightforward to analyze how they make their predictions by looking at their parameters. Figure 3 shows a heatmap of the mean coefficients for each global model across the 10 outer CV folds.\nTurning first to the coefficients relating the syntactic positions to each other, we see that, across all models, each syntactic position disprefers occurring with a syntactic position of the same kind, and this dispreference is particularly strong for subjects. This makes sense in that we never find a sentence with two subjects, and duplicates of the other syntactic positions are relatively rare, only occurring in double object constructions or sentences with multiple prepositions. On the other hand, unlike syntactic positions attract, with strongest preference for sentences containing a non-subject to have a subject.7\nTurning next to the categorical roles, we see that the majority of roles either prefer subject position or are agnostic, but none disprefer it. In contrast, all disprefer object to some extent. This likely arises because each of these roles can occur in intransitives, which always place their single argument in subject position.8 This pattern also gives rise to\n6There is a substantial decrement in F1 for the obliques when comparing the global featural model on the full dataset and VerbNet subset. This seems to arise from higher confusion with subject. We address this in the error analysis.\n7This is likely due to the fact that English requires subjects; in a language that has no such requirement, we might expect a different pattern.\n8There are languages that show, e.g., distinct case-marking behavior for different intransitives (Perlmutter, 1978; Burzio, 1986; Levin and Hovav, 1995; Hale and Keyser, 2002, see also Stevenson and Merlo 1999a,b), and so we might again expect a\nan ordering on the roles with respect to which role will be mapped to subject position when others are present—e.g., A0 and AGENT will be mapped to subject before any other role. This is reminiscent of popular proposals from the theoretical literature regarding role hierarchies (see Levin and Rappaport Hovav 2005 for a review), and errors arise when that ordering is violated. For instance, because A2 does not disprefer objects as much as A1, (A1, A2) is mapped to (object, subject) by the model, when they should be mapped to (subject, oblique).\n(6) [Approximately 85% of the total]A1 consisted [of nonperforming commercial real estate assets]A2.\nThe featural model coefficients are slightly harder to interpret. We see that being likely to INSTIGATE,\ndifferent pattern in those languages.\none of Dowty’s PROTOAGENT properties, matters a lot for being mapped to subject position and not being mapped to object, but the rest of the relationships are quite weak and their relationship with subject position doesn’t match well with the predictions of a featural theory such as Dowty’s. For instance, CHANGE OF STATE is supposed to be a PROTOPATIENT property under his theory, but here it has its highest weight on subject. This appears to produce problems for many of the same sentences that the categorical models fail on—the featural model fails on 75% of the sentences the PropBank model fails on and 64% of the sentences the VerbNet model fails on—but it also produces problems for psych verbs and their kin—e.g., (7)—whose subjects are traditionally referred to as EXPERIENCERS.\n(7) The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks.\nThe likely reason for this is that, as for the categorical models, the featural model must capture the fact that subjects of intransitives can be arguments that might occur in subject position in the presence of a ‘better’ subject. This might be further worsened by the existence of distinct clusters of properties that the model has no way of capturing. But because this representation doesn’t provide a sense for which of the 618 different combinations are extant, it is hard to tell what kinds of role combinations there are and, thus, which fall into each category. We could obtain a rough estimate of this by taking some statistic over the arguments that are classified as subject, object, and oblique, but this would fail to capture categories with multimodality in the property space. If fully spelled out categorical theories are even a good approximation, one would expect such multimodality."

To make clear that l-thematic roles are abstract, we refer to them by the more transparent name argument types and denote the set of argument types for a verb v with Av.\nThe second component of SPROLIM is a representation of the relationship between the semantic proto-role that an argument has and (i) the likelihood that a property is applicable to that argument and, (ii) if applicable, how likely it is that the property holds of the argument. We call this second component the property model. The property model represents this relationship probabilistically—i.e., each semantic proto-role is associated with a distribution over property applicability and likelihood. Thus, the property model is comparable to other mixture models implementing a prototype theory, and it is why we call the generalized roles semantic proto-roles.\nThe third component is a representation of the relationship between (a) the semantic proto-role that an argument (type) has and the syntactic positions an instantiation of that argument occupies in a par-\nticular sentence—in our case, subject, object, and oblique—as well as (b) the other syntactic positions in that sentence (cf. the global model from §4). We call these instantiations argument tokens. Because this component determines how argument tokens are linked to syntactic positions, we refer to it as the linking model.9\nThe final component is a representation of the relationship between a predicate’s argument tokens (in a given sentence) and that predicate’s argument types. As noted by Lang and Lapata (2010), such a component is necessary to handle argument alternations like passivization (8), the double object alternation (9), and the causative-inchoative alternation (10). If we relied purely on, e.g., relative position to associate argument tokens with argument types, we would systematically make mistakes on such cases.\n(8) a. Eight Oakland players hit homers b. Homers were hit by eight Oakland players.\n(9) a. Some 46% give foreign cars higher quality ratings.\nb. Some 46% give higher quality ratings to foreign cars.\n(10) a. The earthquake shattered windows at SFO’s air-traffic control tower.\n9Unless specifically noted, this is what we mean by linking model. When referring to the entire model, we use SPROLIM.\nAlgorithm 1 Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model 1: for verb type v ∈ V do 2: for argument type i ∈ Av do 3: draw semantic protorole zvi ∼ Cat(θvi) 4: for verb token j ∈ Cv do 5: draw canonicalization k ∼ Cat(φv|Tvj |) 6: cvj ← element of symmetric group S|Tvj |,k 7: let r : |Tvj |-length tuple 8: for argument token t ∈ Tvj do 9: rt ← semantic protorole zvcvjt 10: for property p ∈ P do 11: draw avjt ∼ Bern(ηrvjtp) 12: if avjt = 1 then 13: draw lvjt ∼ Cat(Ordκ(µrtp)) 14: let ρ : |S |Tvj ||-length vector 15: for linking s′ ∈ S |Tvj | do 16: ρs′ ← ∏ t softmax ( ψrt + ∑ o 6=t δs′ts′o\n) 17: draw linking k ∼ Cat(ρ) 18: svj ← S |Tvj | k\nb. Windows at SFO’s air-traffic control tower shattered.\nFollowing Lang and Lapata, we refer to this component as the canonicalizer, and we refer to these final two components together as the mapping model, since they define how one maps from argument tokens to argument types (labeled with semantic proto-roles), and from semantic proto-roles to syntactic positions.\nIn the remainder of this section, we define the property and mapping models more formally then fit SPROLIM to our data. To guide the description, Algorithm 1 gives SPROLIM’s generative story, and Figure 4 shows the corresponding plate diagram.\nProperty model The property model relates each semantic role to (i) the likelihood that a property is applicable to an argument that has that role and, (ii) if applicable, how likely it is that the property holds of that argument.\nWe implement this model using a cumulative link logit hurdle model (see Agresti, 2014).10 In this model, each semantic role r ∈ R is associated with two |P|-length real-valued vectors: a real-valued vector µr, which corresponds to the likelihood of\n10Cumulative link logit models are standard in the analysis of ordinal judgments like those contained in SPR1.\neach property p ∈ P when an argument has role r, and ηk, which gives the probability that each property p is applicable to an argument that has role r. We first describe the cumulative link logit part of this model, which determines the probability of each likelihood rating, and then the hurdle part, which determines the probability that a particular property is applicable to a particular argument.\nIn the cumulative link logit portion of the model, a categorical probability mass function with support on the property likelihood ratings l ∈ {1, . . . , 5} is determined by the latent value µ and a nondecreasing real-valued cutpoint vector κ.\nP(l = j | µ,κ) = { 1− qj−1 if j = 5 qj − qj−1 otherwise\nwhere qj ≡ logit−1(κj+1 − µ) and q0 ≡ 0. This model is known as a cumulative link logit model, since q is a valid cumulative distribution function for a categorical random variable with support on {1, . . . , 5}. In Algorithm 1, we denote the parameters of this distribution with Ordκ(µ).\nIn the hurdle portion of the model, a Bernoulli probability mass function for applicability a ∈ {0, 1} is given by P(a | η) = ηa(1 − η)1−a. What makes this model a hurdle model is that the rating probability only kicks in if the rating crosses the applicability “hurdle.” The procedural way of thinking about this is that, first, a rater decides whether a property is applicable; if it is not, they stop; if it is, they generate a rating. The joint probability of l and a is then defined as\nP(l, a | µ, η,κ) = P(a | η)P(l | a, µ,κ) ∝ P(a | η)P(l | µ,κ)a\nThis has the effect that the value of µ is estimated from only (l, a)-pairs where a=1—i.e., where the property was applicable to the argument.\nMapping model The mapping model defines how to map from argument tokens to argument types (labeled with semantic proto-roles), and from semantic proto-roles to syntactic positions. There are two components of this model: (i) the canonicalizer, which maps from argument tokens to argument types, and (ii) the linking model, which maps from\nargument types (labeled with semantic proto-roles) to syntactic positions.\nWe implement the canonicalizer by assuming that, for each predicate (verb) v, there is some canonical ordering of its argument types and that for each sentence (clause) j ∈ Cv that v occurs in, there is some permutation of v’s argument tokens in that sentence that aligns them with their argument type in the canonical order. Denoting the set of argument tokens in sentence j with Tvj , the set of possible mappings is the symmetric group S|Tvj |. We place a categorical distribution with parameter φv on the elements of this group.\nWe implement the linking model using the same CRF described in §4, but replacing the factors for each property with a factor the the arguments semantic proto-role. Thus, in Figure 2, which gives the factor graph for this CRF, the factors linking the responses r = (a, l) directly to the syntactic position nodes s are replaced with factors linking the semantic roles z to those syntactic positions."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we fit SPROLIM to the SPR1 data and investigate the semantic protoroles it learns.\nModel fitting We use projected gradient descent with AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) to find an approximation to the maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for Θ, Φ, M, E, Ψ, ∆, and κ, with the variables Z and C integrated out of the likelihood.\nDetermining a number of protoroles The one free parameter that we must set prior to fitting SPROLIM is the number of semantic protoroles |R|. We are interested in the model’s behavior as |R| increases but we cannot investigate the results for all possible values here. To cut down on this set, we use a stopping criterion based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). We fit SPROLIM with increasing values of |R|, stopping when AIC is minimized. We find that the |R| that maximizes AIC is 6.\nResults Figure 5 shows the estimates of the property likelihood centroids L (top) and the role-syntax coefficients Ψ (bottom) for each value of |R| fit.11 Columns give the values for a single protorole.\n11The syntax-syntax coefficients show the same pattern seen among the corresponding coefficients represented in Figure 3.\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of this figure is that, at each value of |R|, we see a nearly identical protorole with strong positive values on exactly Dowty’s PROTOAGENT properties and negatively (or near zero) on his PROTOPATIENT properties. As such, we refer to this role, which is always the first column, as the PROTOAGENT role.\nThe rest of the roles are more varied. For |R| ∈ {2, 3}, the non-PROTOAGENT role loads negatively (or near zero) on all PROTOAGENT properties, and really, all other properties besides MANIPULATED BY ANOTHER. Comparing |R| = 2 and |R| = 3, it appears that, the non-PROTOAGENT role in |R| = 2 is split in two based on INSTIGATION and EXISTS AS PHYSICAL, where the protorole that disprefers INSTIGATION is more likely to be an object.\nMoving to |R| = 4, we see the addition of what looks to be a second PROTOAGENT role with fewer PROTOAGENT properties. Upon investigation of the protorole mixtures Θ for each argument, this appears to capture cases of nonsentient or abstract— but still relatively agentive—subjects, as in (11).\n(11) The antibody then kills the cell.\nThis same protorole appears in |R| = 5 with nearly all the PROTOAGENT properties, but dispreferring MAKES PHYSICAL CONTACT. It also appears in |R| = 6 without SENTIENT or EXISTS AS PHYSICAL, bolstering its status as capturing abstract entities—e.g., corporations."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we introduced a framework for computational linking theory (CLT) and deployed this framework for two distinct purposes: evaluation (§4) and exploration (§5). In §4, we evaluated four linking models based in theoretical proposals: local v. global linking models and categorical v. featural linking models. We found that global models outperform local models and categorical models outperform featural models. In §5, we developed the Semantic Proto-Role Linking Model in order to better understand how the property space employed in the featural models relates to the syntax. In investigating this model’s behavior, we noted that it finds a protorole strikingly similar to the one proposed by Dowty (1991), but that others of Dowty’s protoroles fall into multiple distinct prototypes."
