      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Computational detection of sarcasm has seen attention from the sentiment analysis community in the past few years (Joshi et al., 2016a). Sarcasm is an interesting problem for sentiment analysis because surface sentiment of words in a sarcastic text may be different from the implied sentiment. For example, ‘Being stranded in traffic is the best way to start a week’ is a sarcastic sentence because the surface sentiment of the word ‘best’ (positive) is different from the implied sentiment of the sentence (negative), considering remaining portions of the text.\nPast approaches for sarcasm detection report features related to sentiment (González-Ibánez et al., 2011), author’s historical context (Ra-\njadesingan et al., 2015), and conversational context (Joshi et al., 2016b). Error analysis presented in many of these works has served as a motivation for future work. Our paper is based on an error observed by Joshi et al. (2015): ‘Incongruity in numbers, resulting in sarcasm’. Consider the sentence in the title of this submission: ‘Having 2 hours to write a paper is fun1’. The number ‘2 hours’ is a crucial indicator of the sarcasm in this sentence. The sarcasm is based on the understanding that two hours may not be sufficient to write a paper. If the number of hours is changed to a higher value, the sarcasm in the sentence may not hold, given that the value is a sufficient duration to write a paper. This paper deals with detecting sarcasm in numerical portions of text, as in this example.\nWe first present a rule-based approach to detect sarcasm expressed due to numbers. Our approach compares numerical magnitudes with those seen in similar contexts in a training dataset. Since ‘similar context’ is key here, we consider two variants of our approach in order to match the context. Then we present Machine learning based approach and its variant that take different features as input for learning. Further we propose deep learning based approaches to numerical sarcasm detection on social media that does not require extensive manual feature engineering. Instead, we develop Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to capture local correlations of spatial or temporal structure. We also develop Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) network which is able to handle sequences of any length and capture longterm dependencies. We compare our approaches with four past works, and show an improvement.\n1This sentence is only an example. This paper was not written in 2 hours.\nar X\niv :1\n70 9.\n01 95\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nS ep\n2 01\n7\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported work that deals with sarcasm in numerical portions of text. We present our evaluation on a dataset of tweets.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We describe the related work in Section 2. Then, we motivate this work in Section 3, and describe various approaches to detect sarcasm in numerical portions of text in Section 4. The experiment setup is outlined in Section 5. Results of our experiments are given in Section 6, while Section 7 discusses the errors. Finally, the conclusion and future work is described in Section 8."

      "text" : "Sarcasm and irony detection has been extensively studied in linguistic, psychology and cognitive science (Gibbs, 1986; Utsumi, 2000). Computational detection of sarcasm has become a popular area of natural language processing research in recent years Joshi et al. (2016a). Tepperman et al. (2006) present sarcasm recognition in speech using spectral (average pitch, pitch slope, etc.), prosodic and contextual cues. Carvalho et al. (2009) use simple linguistic features like interjection, changed names, etc. for irony detection. Davidov et al. (2010) train a sarcasm classifier with syntactic and pattern-based features. González-Ibánez et al. (2011) states that sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. Liebrecht et al. (2013) showed that sarcasm is often signaled by hyperbole, using intensifiers and exclamations; in contrast, nonhyperbolic sarcastic messages often receive an explicit marker.\nRiloff et al. (2013) states that sarcasm is a contrast between a positive sentiment word and a negative situation. Buschmeier et al. (2014) provided the baseline for classification of ironic or sarcastic reviews. They analyzed the impact of different features for the classification task. The work by Joshi et al. (2015) shows how sarcasm arises because of implicit or explicit incongruity in the sentence. Bouazizi and Ohtsuki (2016) proposed a pattern-based approach to detect sarcasm on Twitter. They proposed four sets of features that cover the different types of sarcasm.\nAs deep learning techniques gain popularity, few deep learning based architectures for sarcasm detection have also appeared in literature. Ghosh and Veale (2016) provides a neural net-\nwork semantic model for sarcasm detection. Their model composed of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) followed by a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network and finally a Deep Neural Network(DNN). Poria et al. (2016) proposed a novel method to detect sarcasm using Convolution Neural Networks. They have developed models based on a pre-trained convolutional neural network for extracting sentiment, emotion and personality features for sarcasm detection. Amir et al. (2016) proposed a deep-learning based architecture to automatically learn user embeddings. In their proposed approach they have used this user embeddings to provide contextual features, going beyond the lexical and syntactic cues for sarcasm. Zhang et al. (2016) used a bi-directional gated recurrent neural network followed by a pooling neural network to detect sarcasm.\nAll these past works deals with the detection of sarcasm that occurs in text but they did not talk about incongruity due to numbers. Our work is the first in this area that tackles the task to identify the presence of numerical sarcasm in tweets."

      "heading" : "3 Motivation",
      "text" : "Consider the following sentences:\n1. This phone has an awesome battery back-up of 38 hours. (Non-sarcastic).\n2. This phone has an awesome battery back-up of 2 hours. (Sarcastic).\n3. This phone has a terrible battery back-up of 2 hours (Non-sarcastic).\nSentences 1 and 3 are non-sarcastic while Sentence 2 is sarcastic. Consider Sentences 1 and 2. The two sentences differ only in the numerical value (‘38’ versus ‘2’). The sarcasm in Sentence 2 can be understood in terms of the incongruity2 between the word ‘awesome’ and ‘2 hours’ in case of the battery life. On the contrary, Sentences 2 and 3 differ in one word with varying surface sentiment (‘awesome’ versus ‘terrible’). Detecting sarcasm in sentences like Sentence 2 using information from Sentences 1 and 3 in a dataset is the key idea of our rule-based approach to detect sarcasm in numerical portions of text.\nSince sarcasm is an infrequent phenomenon and we deal with a specific form of sarcasm (namely\n2Ivanko and Pexman (2003) describe the relationship between incongruity and sarcasm.\nsarcasm in numerical text), it is worthwhile to estimate how many sarcastic sentences contain numbers. A set of approximately 100,000 sarcastic tweets contained 11,488 tweets with numbers in them, amounting to 11.48%."

      "text" : "In order to detect numerical sarcasm, we implement two rule-based approaches as described in the forthcoming subsections."
    }, {
      "heading" : "4.1 Approach-1: Noun phrase exact matching",
      "text" : "In this approach, we first create two repositories, i.e., sarcastic and non-sarcastic using a training dataset. Each entry in the repository is of the format: (Tweet Index No., Noun Phrase list, Mean of Number unit3, Std Dev of Number unit4, Number Unit5). The repositories are created as follows. For each sarcasm-labeled tweet in the training dataset, we perform the following steps:\n• Step-1: Extract noun phrases in the tweet, using a parser.\n• Step-2: Select Number unit as the word following the word POS tagged as ’CD’. Examples of number units are minutes, hour, days, years etc.\n• Step-3: We add an entry to the corresponding repository according to the label of the tweet. This entry is of the format as specified above.\nFor example, if there is a sarcastic tweet- “This phone has an awesome battery back-up of 2 hours”, constituency parse tree of this tweet obtained from nltk parser is shown in Figure 1 :\nWe extract the Noun phrases from this constituency parse tree and create a noun-phrase list of this sarcastic tweet as follows: [‘phone’, ‘awesome’, ‘battery’, ‘backup’, ‘hours’] After obtaining the noun phrase list, tweet is stored in the sarcastic repository as: (Tweet Index No., [‘phone’, ‘awesome’, ‘battery’, ‘backup’, ‘hours’], mean of numbers\n3The average value of all the numbers corresponding to the Number unit\n4Standard Deviation of all the numbers corresponding to the Number unit\n5We calculate the Mean and SD for all possible units present in the dataset\nhaving unit as ‘hours’, Std dev of numbers having unit as ‘hours’ ,‘hours’ ) Similarly, for all the other tweets, i.e, numericalsarcastic/ non-sarcastic tweets, same approach is used to store them in their respective repositories.\nNumerical Sarcasm in a test tweet is predicted as follows. We extract noun phrases, number and number unit from the test tweet. Then, following rules are applied:\n• We first consult the sarcastic tweet repository. On matching words in the noun phrase list between the test tweet and entries in the repository, the most similar entry is selected from the sarcastic repository. We then match the number unit of the entry with that in the test tweet.\n• If the number unit matches, we check whether the number present in the test tweet lies within ±2.586 Std dev of the mean value for that number unit present in the matched sarcastic entry. For example: Test Tweet: ‘I love writing this paper at 11 am’. Matched Sarcastic Tweet: ‘I love writing this paper daily at 3.5 am’. So, the number 11 is not within desired confidence interval and the test tweet is non-sarcastic.\n• If the number unit does not match, we consult the non-sarcastic tweet repository and find the most similar entry based on exact matching of the noun phrase list of test tweet and entry in the repository. If the number unit matches, we check whether the number present in the test tweet lies within±2.58 Std dev of the mean value for that number unit present in the matched non-sarcastic entry. If it lies then predict the tweet as non-sarcastic\n6z value of 2.58 indicates the 99% Confidence Interval\nand if it does not then predict sarcastic. For example: Test Tweet: ‘I am so productive when my room is 81 degrees’. Matched Non-sarcastic Tweet: ‘I am very much productive in my room as it has 21.27 degrees’. So, the number 81 is not within desired confidence interval and the tweet becomes sarcastic.\n• Finally, if no match is found, then the tweet is predicted as non-sarcastic."

      "heading" : "4.2 Approach-2: Noun phrase cosine similarity matching",
      "text" : "Approach-1 is restrictive in terms of the phrase matching. Therefore, Approach-2 relaxes the constraint by using cosine similarity to match the phrases in the test tweet and the repository entry. This approach also creates two repositories, i.e., sarcastic and non-sarcastic as follows:\n• Step-1: We first convert the noun phrase list into its vector representation.\n• Step-2: This vector representation is created by summation of the 200-dimension word embeddings7 of the words present in the noun phrase list and then dividing it by their count.\n• Step-3: Now the repositories are of the form: (Tweet Index No., Vector representation of Noun phrase list, Mean of Number unit, Std Dev of Number unit, Number Unit).\nFor example, if there is a numerical sarcastic tweet- “8:30 am meetings are the best way to start birthday weekend”. The Noun phrase list of this tweet is : [‘meetings’, ‘way’, ‘birthday’, ‘weekend’] In order to create the vector representation of this tweet, 200-dimension vector embedding of each of the word in the noun-phrase list is added and then each component of the resulting embedding is divided by 4 as their are four words in the nounphrase list. The intuition behind using the vector representation created from the noun-phrase list is that it helps to easily capture the tweets that are similar to the new tweet. The rules that are used in this approach are also same as used in Approach-1 but now to match the test tweet and tweets from repository, cosine similarity is used. In this case, the entry with the maximum cosine similarity is\n7Learned from a tweet corpus containing 6 million tweet words.\nselected (as against the entry with exact match in Approach-1)."

Positive/Negative word is said to be highly emotional if its part-ofspeech tag is one among the following : ‘JJ’, ‘JJR’, ‘JJS’, ‘RB’, ‘RBR’, ‘RBS’, ‘VB’, ‘VBD’, ‘VBG’, ‘VBN’, ‘VBP’, ‘VBZ’.\n• Emoticon-based features : These features includes positive emoticon, negative emoticon, contrast between word, i.e, a boolean feature that will be one if both positive and negative words are present in the tweet, contrast between emoji, i.e, it will take the value as one when either positive word and negative emoji is present or negative word and positive emoji is present in the tweet.\n• Punctuation-based features : These features include number of exclamation marks, number of dots, number of question mark, number of capital letter words, number of single quotations.\n• Number in the tweet : This feature is simply the number present in the tweet.\n• Number unit in the tweet : This feature is a one hot representation of the type of unit present in the tweet. Example of number unit can be hour, minute, etc. So, based on the unit present in the tweet that position in the one hot vector takes the value as one and the rest takes the value zero.\n• Tweet Embeddings: We learn word embeddings of different dimensions, i.e., 25-D, 50- D, 100-D, 150-D, 200-D, 250-D, 300-D of tweet words using word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) tool on a large corpora of 6 million tweets. These word embeddings are used to create the tweet embedding by summing up the word vectors of all the words present in\nthe tweet and finally dividing each component of the resulting vector by the count of total number of words present in the tweet. Finally, we obtain the tweet embeddings of different dimension that we use to train the classifiers."

Standard RNNs becomes unable to learn long-term dependencies as the gap between two\ntime steps becomes large. We adopted the standard architecture of LSTM proposed by (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997).\nThe LSTM architecture has a range of repeated modules for each time step as in a standard RNN. At each time step, the output of the module is controlled by a set of gates in IRd as a function of the old hidden state ht−1 and the input at the current time step xt: the forget gate ft, the input gate it, and the output gate ot. These gates collectively decide how to update the current memory cell ct and the current hidden state ht . We use d to denote the memory dimension in the LSTM and all vectors in this architecture share the same dimension. The LSTM transition functions are defined as follows:\nit = σ(Wi · [ht−1, xt] + bi) (4)\nft = σ(Wf · [ht−1, xt] + bf ) (5)\nC̃t = tanh(WC · [ht−1, xt] + bC) (6)\nCt = ft Ct−1 + it C̃t (7)\not = σ(Wo · [ht−1, xt] + bo) (8)\nht = ot tanh(Ct) (9)\nThis architecture is shown in Figure 3.

      "heading" : "5 Experiment Setup",
      "text" : "We use three datasets for performing experiments which are described in Table 1 and their creation details are described below: (A) Dataset-1: To create this dataset, we extract tweets from Twitter-API (https://dev. twitter.com). The tweets containing hashtags #sarcasm, #sarcastic, #BeingSarcastic are labeled\nas sarcastic, while those with #nonsarcasm, #notsarcastic are labeled as the non-sarcastic. We remove URLs, duplicate tweets, retweets, Username and other Non-ASCII characters in these tweets. (B) Dataset-2: From Dataset-1, we retain only the tweets that contain numerical characters to create Dataset-2. Additional processing is performed to remove irrelevant tweets, like the ones which contains alphabet or special character adjacent to a number like Model34d, 4s, <3 (heart smiley) etc. We divide this dataset into Training set containing 8681 Non-Sarcastic tweets and 8681 Numerical Sarcastic tweets. (C) Dataset-3: For Deep learning experiments, we need a bigger dataset, so we created Dataset3 from dataset-1, whose details are given in Table 1. Since there were no more Numeric-Sarcastic tweets we added more Non-Sarcastic tweets to increase dataset size. (D) Test Data: Test set details are given in Table 1. This dataset is used to evaluate previous approaches as well as all the approaches mentioned in this paper.\nWe re-implement work reported by Buschmeier et al. (2014), González-Ibánez et al. (2011), Liebrecht et al. (2013) and Joshi et al. (2015) for Sarcasm detection, to show the degradation in performance for Numeric-Sarcastic Dataset. We train classifiers for the features introduced by these approaches, using SVMperf by Joachims (2006) with RBF kernel. We compare their performance\nagainst our approaches, and report the average 5- fold cross-validation values in the next section.\nWe train the SVM with RBF kernel and c = 1.0 using grid-search, Random-forest with number of estimators = 10 and KNN with neighbors K = 3 using scikit8 using features as described in section 4.3 and using the same dataset, i.e., Dataset-2 which is also used in Rule-based approach. The test data that we use is the same as already described in Table 1.\nFrom Dataset-3, we calculated the max length of the tweet as 36 words so we padded all the shorter tweets by special PAD character. In all deep learning experiments, we initialized embedding matrix E first by random values and then by pre-trained word embeddings and tried to investigate results with different size word embeddings.\nFor CNN-FF Model, we use 128 number of filters each of size 3, 4 and 5, i.e., total 128 × 3 filters. Drop-out probability for this implementation is 0.5 and training is performed by applying mini-batch gradient descent. In the pooling layer, we perform max-over time pooling over the output from each filter.\nFor LSTM-FF model, training is performed by applying batch-gradient descent with Adagrad optimizer having learning rate as 0.3. We also investigated with different hidden unit dimension as 20, 40 and 128 and drop-out probability of 0.25.\nFor CNN-LSTM-FF Model, number of filters are 64, each with the same dimension, i.e., 5 × Embeddingsize. We investigated the results with different size embeddings and drop-out probability is 0.25 for this architecture. All the deep learning experiments were implemented using tensorflow (2016)."

We see that three of the past four works give an\n8http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules\nF1-score that is close to each other on Dataset-2. On Dataset-1 and Dataset-2, the best F1-score of 0.72 and 0.25 respectively are obtained by using features from Joshi et al. (2015), there is a degradation of 47% on Dataset-2 which contains only numerical tweets. This degradation clearly shows that these past approaches are not able to capture the sarcasm that arise due to numbers in the text. All the past 4 approaches are build to detect the normal sarcasm in which the incongruity arises due to text. When the incongruity arises due to numbers these approaches gets degraded in their performance as shown in Table 2. This clearly shows that there is a need to develop a system that is able to capture numerical sarcasm.\nThe results of Rule-based approaches are shown Table 6, along with results of other approaches. We see that among the 2 rule based approach, Approach-1 performs better with an F1-score of 0.82.\nThe evaluation of machine learning experiments is done using different combination of features, i.e., Sentiment (S), Punctuation (P), Emoticon based (E), Number value and Number Unit. We have also investigated with different dimensional (25-D, 50-D...300-D) tweet embeddings as features. We train SVM classifier and reported the results in Table 3. Results show that SVM give best F1-score of 0.83 with 300-D Tweet word embedding . We train KNN classifier and results are reported in 4. This classifiers also give best result with tweet-embedding as feature but of different dimension, i.e., 50-D. Table 5 shows the result of Random Forest classifier. We observe from the table that as we append more features like number\nvale and number unit to S, P and E the F1-score becomes 0.75. Finally, when we give 100-D tweet embedding as input, the best F1-score is 0.82.\nAs mentioned in section 5, we performed deep learning experiments by initializing embedding matrix in two settings, the best result for all the deep-learning experiments are obtained by initializing with the pre-trained tweet word embeddings. Refer Table 6 for deep learning experiments results. For CNN-FF model, the F1-score of 0.93 is obtained with embedding size of 250-D. For CNNLSTM-FF model, the F1-score of 0.91 with 200- D embedding size and for LSTM-FF model, we obtain the F1-score of 0.90 with 25-D embedding size.\nTable 6 compares the results for all the implemented approaches and also the past approaches. The best overall F1-score of 0.93 is obtained by CNN-FF Model. We see an improvement of 68% in F1-score against the best performing past approach of Joshi et al. (2015)."

Unit is not present as well as\nthe time is present in wrong format.\n• Presence of multiple numbers: Some tweets contain multiple numbers and this makes it more challenging to identify sarcasm due to numbers. For example- ‘ $34.04 for a 10 mile trip that takes 19 minutes? that makes sense’.\n• Sarcasm due to text but not number: Some tweets contain number but they are sarcastic not because of the presence of number. For example- ‘First asthma attack in 6 years. forgot how much fun they are’, in this tweet the sarcasm is arising because of the word “fun” present at the end of the tweet."
