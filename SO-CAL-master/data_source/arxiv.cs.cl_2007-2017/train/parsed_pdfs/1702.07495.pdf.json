VMFMix is analogous to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in that they can capture the co-occurrence patterns acorss multiple documents. The difference is that in VMFMix, the topic-word distribution is defined on a continuous n-dimensional hypersphere. Hence VMFMix is used to derive topic embeddings, i.e., representative vectors, from multiple sets of embedding vectors. An efficient Variational Expectation-Maximization inference algorithm is derived. The performance of VMFMix on two document classification tasks is reported, with some preliminary analysis.\nWe present a simplification of the Bayesian vMF mixture model proposed in [2]1. For computational efficiency, the priors on the vMF mean {µk} and on the vMF concentration {κk} are removed. This model is referred to as VMFMix.\nA Python implementation of VMFMix is available at https://github.com/askerlee/vmfmix."

      "text" : "The performance of this model was evaluated on two text classification tasks that are on 20 Newsgroups (20News) and Reuters, respectively. The experimental setup for the compared methods were identical to that in [3]. Similar to TopicVec, VMFMix learns an individual set of K topic embeddings from each category of documents, and all these sets are combined to form a bigger set of topic embeddings for the whole corpus. This set of topic embeddings are used to derive the topic proportions of each document, which are taken as features for the SVM classifier. TheK for 20News and Reuters are chosen as 15 and 12, respectively, which are identical to TopicVec.\nThe macro-averaged precision, recall and F1 scores of all methods are presented in\nTable 1.\nWe can see from Table 1 that, VMFMix achieves better performance than Doc2Vec, LDA, sLDA and LFTM. However, its performance is still inferior to BOW, Mean word embeddings (MeanWV), TWE and TopicVec. The reason might be that by limiting the embeddings in the unit hypersphere (effectively normalizing them as unit vectors), certain representational flexibility is lost.\nAn empirical observation we have is that, VMFMix approaches convergence very quickly. The variational lower bound increases only slightly after 10~20 iterations. By manually checking the intermediate parameter values, we see that after so many iterations, the parameters change very little too. It suggests that VMFMix might easily get stuck in local optima.\nNonetheless, VMFMix might still be relevant when the considered embedding vectors are infinite and continuously distributed in the embedding space, as opposed to the finite vocabulary of word embeddings2. Such scenarios include the neural encodings of images from a convolutional neural network (CNN)."
