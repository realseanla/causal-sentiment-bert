      "text" : "Translating English negative sentences into Korean is fairly challenging since the ways of expressing negation in the two languages are not exactly the same. The generally accepted way of the negative sentence translation in EKMT was to simply negate the predicate of its corresponding affirmative sentence, which cannot give the accurate Korean equivalent for some English negative sentences, e.g. partial negatives. We did linguistic comparison between the ways of expressing negation in English and Korean and propose an algorithm for the accurate Korean equivalents to the English negative sentences in EKMT. 1. Linguistic comparison of English and Korean negation\nLinguistically, negation refers to a grammatical construction with negative polarity [1]. The negative sentence and its affirmative correspondent are closely related in English and so are they in Korean. This requires that we should consider the English negative sentences in close relation with their affirmative correspondents and Korean equivalents.\nEnglish and Korean negative sentences have the following features in common;\na. The negative sentences are declaratives, interrogatives or imperatives in both\nlanguages.\nb. The negative sentences have their affirmative correspondents, which can be made\nnegative by adding negative words.\nintensify or soften the negation.\ne. Negation is subdivided into general negation, partial negation, double negation and\nintensified negation.\nDespite these common features, there are still differences, the most important one of which is the way of adding negative words to the affirmative sentences. The table below gives the comparison between English and Korean negative sentences. The underlined words are the negative words and the bold words are the negation-related words in English and Korean.\nPart of\nSpeech\nNegative\nWords\nEnglish Negative\nSentences Korean Equivalents\nCorresponding\nAffirmative Sentences\nAdverb\nnot\nI did not believe at all that\nhe was coming.\n나는 그가 온다는것을 전혀\n믿지 않았다.\nI believed that he was\ncoming.\nNot much is known about\nthe disease.\n그 질병에 대하여 많은것이\n알려지지는 않았다.\nMuch is known about the\ndisease.\nNot many people have read\nthe report.\n많은 사람들이 그 기사를\n읽은것은 아니다.\nMany people have read the\nreport.\nNot one of the students\ncould answer.\n학생들가운데서 한사람도\n대답할수 없었다.\nOne of the students could\nanswer.\nnever\nHe has never been there. 그는 거기에 가본적이 전혀\n없다. He has been there.\nNever again would he say\nthat.\n그는 다시는 그런 말을 하지 않을것이다. He would say that again.\nhardly I can hardly believe it. 나는 그것을 거의나 믿을수\n없다. I can believe it.\nlittle Little did I know that my\nlife was about to change.\n나는 나의 생활이\n변하리라는것을 거의나 알지\n못하였다.\nI knew that my life was\nabout to change.\nnowhere He has nowhere to live.\nI am going nowhere.\n그는 살곳이 없다. 나는 아무데도 가지 않는다. He has somewhere to live.\nnothing She's nothing like her\nbrother.\n그는 자기의 동생과 전혀 비슷하지 않다. She's like her brother.\nAs the table shows the negative words in English include adverbs, pronouns and determiners,\ntherefore the subject, predicate, object, adverbial modifiers or attributes can be negated, while in Korean the negation is expressed by adding agglutinative suffixes (the underlined words in Korean sentences) to the predicates and by adding other related words (the bold words in Korean sentences) to the sentences in some cases. This significant difference poses a main problem for the translation of the English negative sentences into Korean. 2. Classification of English negative sentences\nSome English sentences with negative words are not negative sentences, so they are not\ntranslated into Korean negative sentences.\nHe just stopped working for no reason. (그는 아무 리유도 없이 일을 그만두었다.) The victory was nothing less than a miracle. (그 승리는 그야말로 기적이였다.)\nequivalents have less difference except the negative words and the negation-related words.\nLittle did I know that my life was about to change. (나는 나의 생활이 변하리라는것을 거의나 알지 못하였다.) I knew that my life was about to change. (나는 나의 생활이 변하리라는것을 알고있었다.)\nConsidering the features described above, we concluded that it is very important to decide whether the sentence with a negative word is a negative sentence and what sort of negative sentence it is. a. If the subject, predicate or the object of the sentence is negated or a negative word itself, it is a negative sentence.\nNo one could hear me. (negative subject) We said nothing about her. (negative object) He has never been there. (negative predicate)\nHowever, if the negative word is not the subject, object or predicate of a sentence but a part of an idiomatic expression (e.g. for no reason, be nothing less than, etc), the Korean equivalent might not be a negative sentence. b. We subdivided the English negative sentences into single negative (one negative word in the sentence) and double negative sentences (two or more negative words in the sentence) according to the number of negative words in the sentence, and also into general negative, partial negative and intensified negative sentences according to the part of sentence which is negated.\nThe Korean equivalent of the general negative sentence can be made from its corresponding affirmative sentence by adding agglutinative suffix, while those of the partial negative and intensified negative sentences require other negation-related words as well. 3. Translation of English negative sentences 3.1 The determination of English negative sentence\nTo translate English negative sentence, the parser should decide; a. whether the sentence with a negative word is a negative sentence.\nAccording to which part of the sentence is negated, we subdivided the negative sentences\ninto six categories;\n Negative Subject – Affirmative Predicate – Affirmative Object (NS-AP-AO)  Negative Subject – Negative Predicate – Affirmative Object (NS-NP-AO)\n Affirmative Subject – Negative Predicate – Affirmative Object (AS-NP-AO)  Affirmative Subject – Negative Predicate – Negative Object (AS-NP-NO) If the sentence matches one of the above sentence structures, the parser decides that it is\na negative sentence.\nb. what sort of negative sentence it is.\nAccording to the number of negative words and the negated part of sentence we conclude\nthat;\n Single negative sentence is general negative, partial negative or intensified negative. The negative sentence with negative subject, negative object or negative predicate which is modified by the words like ‘every, all, always, entirely, necessarily, etc’ is a partial negative sentence.\n Single negative sentence with negative predicate which is not a partial negative\nsentence is a general negative sentence.\n Single negative sentence with negative subject or negative object which is not a\npartial negative sentence is an intensified negative sentence.\n Double negative sentence is an intensified negative sentence.\nc. which negative agglutinative suffixes and related words should be added to the corresponding Korean affirmative sentence.\nKorean language has various negative agglutinative suffixes to the predicate such as “~이 아니다”, “~지 못하다”, “~지 않다” and “~지 말다”. It is not easy to decide which one makes a natural expression in Korean. In 3.2 and 3.3, we describe the principles to choose correct suffixes and related words to the corresponding Korean affirmative sentences.\n3.2 Negative agglutinative suffixes to Korean predicate\nThe negative agglutinative suffixes to Korean predicate is decided by; a. The kind of predicate verb in English sentence and its tense and aspect\nIf the predicate is “a copular verb + noun”, add “~이 아니다” or “~이 없다” to the predicate of the Korean affirmative sentence, and if the predicate is a lexical verb and the auxiliary verb do is used, add “~지 않다” or “~지 못하다”.\nShe is not my younger sister. 그 녀자는 나의 녀동생이 아니다. He doesn’t get up early in the morning.\nHe has never been there. 그는 거기에 가본적이 없다.\nb. The kind of English negative sentence\nIf the negative sentence is a general negative, the above rule is applied to choose a suffix\nto Korean predicate.\nIf it is an intensified negative, the Korean negative suffix is added as general negative\nsentence.\nNo trains will be affected by this accident. 렬차들은 이 사고에 의하여 전혀 영향을 받지 않을것이다. He has made promises, but kept none of them. 그는 약속을 하였지만 하나도 지키지 않았다.\nIf it is a partial negative, the agglutinative suffix “~ㄴ것은 아니다” is added.\nIt is not always true that combining two substances into one releases energy. 두 물질을 하나로 결합하면 에네르기가 방출된다는것이 언제나 진실인것은 아니다. If an auxiliary verb is negated in a partial negative sentence, the suffixes “~지는 않다” or “~수는 없다” is added to the Korean equivalent of the lexical verb and change it according to the tense of the English predicate.\nThe particles will not necessarily move the same way under identical conditions. 립자들이 동일한 조건에서 반드시 같은 방식으로 움직이지는 않을것이다.○ 립자들이 동일한 조언에서 반드시 같은 방식으로 움직일것이지는 않다. ×\nc. The collocation of the Korean predicate\nIn Korean, the terminative predicates of sentences are verbs or adjectives. According to the characteristics of Korean verb or adjective collocation, the suffix “~지 않다” or “~지 못하다” is added.\nTheir effort accomplished little or nothing. 그들의 노력은 거의 아무것도 달성하지 못하였다. ○ 그들의 노력은 거의 아무것도 달성하지 않았다. ×\nThe Korean equivalents of some English negative predicates are completely different from their Korean affirmatives, thus making them impossible to be negated by adding agglutinative suffixes. In this case, the Korean predicate is replaced by appropriate word.\nI don’t know what these symbols mean.\nSome negatives sentences (e.g. intensified negatives and double negatives) are accurately translated in Korean not only by adding negative suffix to the Korean predicate but also by adding adverb and changing the particle to the subject or the object.\na. If it is a single negative (one negative word in the sentence), the negation-related words\nare added according to the English negative word. - If the predicate verb is negated by adverb “not”, no related words are added.\nThe rooms don’t have air-conditioners. 방들에는 공기조화기가 없다.\n- If the negative word in the sentence is “never”, “little” or “few”, the related adverbs are\nadded to the Korean equivalent. She never looked like her photograph. 그 녀자는 자기 사진과 전혀 비슷해보이지 않는다.\nb. If it is a partial negative, the particle added to the subject of a Korean equivalent changes\nfrom 는(은) to 가(이).\nNot all my friends were at the wedding. 나의 모든 친구들이 결혼식에 참가한것은 아니였다.\nc. If it is an intensified negative in which the subject or the object is negated, the particle to\nthe Korean subject or object noun should be changed or other related words added. - If the subject or object is a negative pronoun or is negated by the determiner “no”, the\nparticle to the Korean subject or object noun should be changed. Not one person remembered my birthday. 한 사람도 나의 생일을 기억하지 못하였다. I have seen none of them before. 나는 그들중 누구도 이전에 본적이 없다.\n- If the subject or object is negated by the determiner “little” or “few” to make a\nquasi-negative, negation-related words are added. Few students could answer the question. 거의 모든 학생들이 그 질문에 대답할수 없었다. He showed little interest in my suggestion. 그는 나의 제안에 거의 흥미를 보이지 않았다.\nd. If it is a double negative, the particles to the subject or the object should be changed and\nadd negation-related words as the intensified negative.\nDecide the type of\nEnglish negative\nsentence\nEnglish Negative\nSentence\nDecide the negative word and its insert\nposition\nDecide the additional\nnegation-related\nwords\nPlace the Korean\nnegative word and its\nrelated words\nKorean Negative\nSentence\nInitial\n:Negation Count\n:Negation Type\n:Insert Position of\nNegative Words\nKorean Negative\nSuffix to the\nPredicate\nKorean\nNegation-Related\nAdverb\nKorean Particle to Subject and Object\nNegation Count 1 Single Negation 2 Double Negation\nNegation Type\nGeneral Negation Partial Negation Intensified Negation\nInsert Position of Negative Words After Predicate After Auxiliary\n{'~이 아니다,' '~지 않다,' '~한적이 없다,' '~인것은 아니다,' '~하지는 않는다'}\n{'전혀,' '거의나,' '결코,'}\n{'도'}\nFinal\nact The workflow of Translating English Negative Sentences into Korean"

The following table shows the number of negative sentences of each kind.\nThere were 5 partial negative sentences among 505 single negatives.

(by the earlier algorithm) 그것들이 의뢰기의 요청들에 대한 그 어떤 지식도 가지지 않기때문에 봉사기들은 그렇게 할수 없다. (by the proposed algorithm) As the examples show, the proposed algorithm improved the translation of negative\nsentences, making it accurate and similar to the human translation. 6. Conclusion\nNegative sentences don’t account for large proportion in English text, but their translation is important. We did a comparative study on the negation in English and Korean to establish a new translation algorithm in EKMT and introduced it to English-to-Korean Machine Translation System “Ryongnamsan” and conclude that it is effective. 7.
