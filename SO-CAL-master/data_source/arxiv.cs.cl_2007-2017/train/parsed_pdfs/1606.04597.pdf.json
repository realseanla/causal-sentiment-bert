      "text" : "Parallel corpora, which are large collections of parallel texts, serve as an important resource for inducing translation correspondences, either at the level of words (Brown et al., 1993; Smadja and McKeown, 1994; Wu and Xia, 1994) or phrases (Kupiec, 1993; Melamed, 1997; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003). However, the availability of large-scale, wide-coverage corpora still remains a challenge even in the era of big data: parallel corpora are usually only existent for resourcerich languages and restricted to limited domains such as government documents and news articles.\nTherefore, intensive attention has been drawn to exploiting non-parallel corpora for acquiring translation correspondences. Most previous efforts have concentrated on learning parallel lexicons from non-parallel corpora, including parallel sentence and lexicon extraction via bootstrapping (Fung and Cheung, 2004), inducing parallel lexicons via canonical correlation analysis (Haghighi\n∗Corresponding author: Yang Liu.\net al., 2008), training IBM models on monolingual corpora as decipherment (Ravi and Knight, 2011; Nuhn et al., 2012; Dou et al., 2014), and deriving parallel lexicons from bilingual word embeddings (Vulić and Moens, 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013; Vulić and Moens, 2015).\nRecently, a number of authors have turned to a more challenging task: learning parallel phrases from non-parallel corpora (Zhang and Zong, 2013; Dong et al., 2015). Zhang and Zong (2013) present a method for retrieving parallel phrases from non-parallel corpora using a seed parallel lexicon. Dong et al. (2015) continue this line of research to further introduce an iterative approach to joint learning of parallel lexicons and phrases. They introduce a corpus-level latentvariable translation model in a non-parallel scenario and develop a training algorithm that alternates between (1) using a parallel lexicon to extract parallel phrases from non-parallel corpora and (2) using the extracted parallel phrases to enlarge the parallel lexicon. They show that starting from a small seed lexicon, their approach is capable of learning both new words and phrases gradually over time.\nHowever, due to the structural divergence between natural languages as well as the presence of noisy data, only using asymmetric translation models might be insufficient to accurately identify parallel lexicons and phrases from non-parallel corpora. Dong et al. (2015) report that the accuracy on Chinese-English dataset is only around 40% after running for 70 iterations. In addition, their approach seems prone to be affected by noisy data in non-parallel corpora as the accuracy drops significantly with the increase of noise.\nSince asymmetric word alignment and phrase alignment models are usually complementary, it is natural to combine them to make more accurate predictions. In this work, we propose to in-\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 59\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n5 Ju\nn 20\n16\ntroduce agreement-based learning (Liang et al., 2006; Liang et al., 2008) into extracting parallel lexicons and phrases from non-parallel corpora. Based on the latent-variable model proposed by Dong et al. (2015), we propose two kinds of loss functions to take into account the agreement between both phrase alignment and word alignment in two directions. As the inference is intractable, we resort to a Viterbi EM algorithm to train the two models efficiently. Experiments on the Chinese-English dataset show that agreementbased learning is more robust to noisy data and leads to substantial improvements in phrase alignment and machine translation evaluations."

      "heading" : "2 Background",
      "text" : "Given a monolingual corpus of source language phrases E = {e(s)}Ss=1 and a monolingual corpus of target language phrases F = {f (t)}Tt=1, we assume there exists a parallel corpus D = {〈e(s), f (t)〉|e(s) ↔ f (t)}, where e(s) ↔ f (t) denotes that e(s) and f (t) are translations of each other.\nAs a long sentence in E is usually unlikely to have an translation in F and vise versa, most previous efforts build on the assumption that phrases are more likely to have translational equivalents on the other side (Munteanu and Marcu, 2006; Cettolo et al., 2010; Zhang and Zong, 2013; Dong et al., 2015). Such a set of phrases can be constructed by collecting either constituents of parsed sentences or strings with hyperlinks on webpages (e.g., Wikipedia). Therefore, we assume the two monolingual corpora are readily available and focus on how to extract D from E and F .\nTo address this problem, Dong et al. (2015) introduce a corpus-level latent-variable translation model in a non-parallel scenario:\nP (F |E;θ) = ∑ m\nP (F,m|E;θ)︸ ︷︷ ︸ phrase alignment , (1)\nwhere m is phrase alignment and θ is a set of model parameters. Each target phrase f (t) is restricted to connect to exactly one source phrase: m = (m1, . . . ,mt, . . .mT ), where mt ∈ {0, 1, . . . , S}. For example, mt = s denotes that f (t) is aligned to e(s). Note that e(0) represents an empty source phrase.\nThey follow IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993)\nto further decompose the model as\nP (F,m|E;θ) = p(T |S) (S + 1)T T∏ t=1 P (f (t)|e(mt);θ), (2)\nwhere P (f (t)|e(mt);θ) is a phrase translation model that can be further defined as\nP (f (t)|e(mt);θ) = δ(mt, 0) +\n(1− δ(mt, 0)) ∑ a\nP (f (t),a|e(mt);θ)︸ ︷︷ ︸ word alignment . (3)\nDong et al. (2015) distinguish between empty and non-empty phrase translations. If a target phrase f (t) is aligned to the empty source phrase e(0) (i.e., mt = 0), they set the phrase translation probability to a fixed number . Otherwise, conventional word alignment models such as IBM Model 1 can be used for non-empty phrase translation:\nP (f (t),a|e(mt);θ)\n= p(J (t)|I(mt))\n(I(mt) + 1)J (t) J(t)∏ j=1 p(f (t) j |e (mt) aj ), (4)\nwhere p(J |I) is a length model and p(f |e) is a translation model. We use J (t) to denote the length of f (t).\nTherefore, the latent-variable model involves two kinds of latent structures: (1) phrase alignment m between source and target phrases, (2) word alignment a between source and target words within phrases.\nGiven the two monolingual corpora E and F , the training objective is to maximize the likelihood of the training data:\nθ∗ = argmax θ\n{ L(θ) } , (5)\nwhere\nL(θ) = logP (F |E;θ)−∑ I λI (∑ J p(J |I)− 1 ) −\n∑ e γe (∑ f p(f |e)− 1 ) −\n∑ f ∑ e σ(f, e,d) log σ(f, e,d) p(f |e) .(6)\nNote that d is a small seed parallel lexicon for initializing training 1 and σ(f, e,d) checks whether an entry 〈f, e〉 exists in d.\nGiven the monolingual corpora and the optimized model parameters, the Viterbi phrase alignment is calculated as\nm∗ = argmax m\n{ P (F,m|E;θ∗) } (7)\n= argmax m { T∏ t=1 P (f (t)|e(mt);θ∗) } .(8)\nFinally, parallel lexicons can be derived from the translation probability table of IBM model 1 θ∗ and parallel phrases can be collected from the Viterbi phrase alignment m∗. This process iterates and enlarges parallel lexicons and phrases gradually over time.\nAs it is very challenging to extract parallel phrases from non-parallel corpora, unidirectional models might only capture partial aspects of translation modeling on non-parallel corpora. Indeed, Dong et al. (2015) find that the accuracy of phrase alignment is only around 50% on the ChineseEnglish dataset. More importantly, their approach seems to be vulnerable to noise as the accuracy drops significantly with the increase of noise. As source-to-target and target-to-source translation models are usually complementary (Och and Ney, 2003; Koehn et al., 2003; Liang et al., 2006),\n1Due to the difficulty of learning translation correspondences from non-parallel corpora, many authors have assumed that a small seed lexicon is readily available (Gaussier et al., 2004; Zhang and Zong, 2013; Vulić and Moens, 2013; Mikolov et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2015).\nit is appealing to combine them to improve alignment accuracy."

      "text" : "The basic idea of our work is to encourage the source-to-target and target-to-source translation models to agree on both phrase and word alignments.\nFor example, Figure 1 shows two example Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese phrase alignments on the same non-parallel data. As each model only captures partial aspects of translation modeling, our intuition is that the links on which two models agree (highlighted in red) are more likely to be correct.\nMore formally, let P (F |E;−→θ ) be a sourceto-target translation model and P (E|F ;←−θ ) be a target-to-source model, where −→ θ and ←− θ are corresponding model parameters. We use −→m = (−→m1, . . . ,−→mt, . . . ,−→mT ) to denote sourceto-target phrase alignment. Likewise, the targetto-source phrase alignment is denoted by ←−m = (←−m1, . . . ,←−ms, . . . ,←−mS).\nTo ease the comparison between −→m and←−m, we represent them as sets of non-empty links equivalently:\n−→m = { 〈−→mt, t〉|−→mt 6= 0 } (9)\n←−m = { 〈s,←−ms〉|←−ms 6= 0 } . (10)\nFor example, suppose the source-to-target and target-to-source phrase alignments are −→m =\n(2, 3, 0, 0) and ←−m = (0, 1, 2). The equivalent link sets are −→m = {〈2, 1〉, 〈3, 2〉} and ←−m = {〈2, 1〉, 〈3, 2〉}. Therefore, −→m is said to be equal to←−m (i.e., δ(−→m,←−m) = 1).\nFollowing Liang et al. (2006), we introduce a new training objective that favors the agreement between two unidirectional models:\nJ (−→θ ,←−θ ) = logP (F |E;−→θ ) + logP (E|F ;←−θ )−\nlog ∑ −→m,←−m P (−→m|E,F ;−→θ )P (←−m|F,E;←−θ )\n×∆(E,F,−→m,←−m,−→θ ,←−θ ), (11)\nwhere the posterior probabilities in two directions are defined as P (−→m|E,F ;−→θ ) = T∏ t=1 P (f (t)|e( −→mt);−→θ )∑S s=0 P (f (t)|e(s);−→θ ) (12)\nP (←−m|F,E;←−θ ) = S∏\ns=1\nP (e(s)|f ( ←−ms);←−θ )∑T\nt=0 P (e (s)|f (t);←−θ )\n.

They show that starting from a small seed lexicon, their approach is capable of learning both new words and phrases gradually over time. However, due to the structural divergence between natural languages as well as the presence of noisy data, only using asymmetric translation models might be insufficient to accurately identify parallel lexicons and phrases from non-parallel corpora.

The basic idea is to encourage two asymmetric latent-variable translation models (i.e., source-to-target and target-to-source) to agree on identifying latent phrase and word alignments. The agreement is defined at both word and phrase levels. We develop a Viterbi EM algorithm for jointly training the two unidirectional models efficiently. Experiments on the ChineseEnglish dataset show that agreementbased learning significantly improves both alignment and translation performance.",
