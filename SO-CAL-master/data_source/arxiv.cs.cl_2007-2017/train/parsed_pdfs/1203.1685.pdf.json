      "text" : "Myanmar is an agglutinative language with a very productive inflectional system. This means that for any NLP application on Myanmar to be successful, some amount of functional analysis is necessary. Without it, the development of grammatical relations would not be feasible due to the sparse data problem bound to exist in the training data. It is the process of analyzing an input sequence in order to determine its grammatical structure with respect to a given grammar. Grammatical relations operate at word-level with the assumption that input sentences are presegmented, POS tagged and chunked.\nThe natural language processing community is in the strong position of having many available approaches to solving some of its most fundamental problems [1]. We have taken Myanmar language for information processing. Our approach makes use of two components. They are function tagging and grammatical relations. Function tags are useful for any application trying to follow the thread of the text –they find the ‘who does what’ of each clause, which can be useful to gain information about the situation or to learn more about the behaviour of words in the sentence [2]. The goal of function tagging is to assign syntactic categories like subject, object, time and location to each word in the text document. In case of function tagging, we use Naive Bayesian theory and the functional annotated tagged corpus. Grammatical relations are the process of analyzing an input sequence in order to determine its grammatical structure with\nrespect to a given grammar. The goal of the second one is to produce the relations of the grammatical structures of the sentences in Myanmar text as a parse tree.\nMyanmar is SOV language. It is also a variable phrase order language. The free phrase order feature of Myanmar makes statistical function tagging a challenging task. Function tagging is a part of the Myanmar to English machine translation project. If high quality translation is to be achieved, language understanding is a necessity. One problem in Myanmar language processing is the lack of grammatical regularity in the language. This leads to very complex Myanmar grammar in order to obtain satisfactory results, which in term increases the complexity in the grammatical relation process, it is desired that simple grammar is to be used.\nIn our approach, we take the chunk level phrase with the combination of POS tag and its category which is the output of a fully described morphological analyzer [3][4], which is very important for agglutinative languages like Myanmar. A small corpus annotated manually serves as training data because the large scale Myanmar Corpus is unavailable at present. Since the large-scale annotated corpora, such as Penn Treebank, have been built in English, statistical knowledge extracted from them has been shown to be more and more crucial for natural language disambiguation [5]. As a distinctive language, Myanmar has many characteristics different from English. The use of statistical information efficiently in Myanmar language is still a virgin land waiting to explore.\nNaïve Bayesian is chosen for its simplicity and user-friendliness. Naive-Bayesian classifier make strong assumptions about how the data is generated, and use a probabilistic model that reflects these assumptions [6]. They use a collection of labelled training examples to estimate the parameters of the generative model. Classification of new examples is performed with Bayes’ rule by selecting the class that is most likely to have generated the example."

      "heading" : "2. LITERATURE SURVEY",
      "text" : "Blaheta and Johnson [7] addressed the task of function tags assignment. They used a statistical algorithm based on a set of features grouped in trees, rather than chains. The advantage was that features can better contribute to overall performance for cases when several features are sparse. When such features are conditioned in a chain model the sparseness of a feature can have a dilution effect of an ulterior (conditioned) one.\nMihai Lintean and Vasile Rus[8] described the use of two machine learning techniques, naive Bayes and decision trees, to address the task of assigning function tags to nodes in a syntactic parse tree. They used a set of features inspired from Blaheta and Johnson [7]. The set of classes they used in their model corresponds to the set of functional tags in Penn Treebank. To generate the training data, they have considered only nodes with functional tags, ignoring nodes unlabeled with such tags. They trained the classifiers on sections 1-21 from Wall Street Journal (WSJ) part of Penn Treebank and used section 23 to evaluate the generated classifiers.\nYong-uk Park and Hyuk-chul Kwon [9] tried to disambiguate for syntactic analysis system by many dependency rules and segmentation. Segmentation is made during parsing. If two adjacent morphemes have no syntactic relations, their syntactic analyzer makes new segment between these two morphemes, and find out all possible partial parse trees of that segmentation and combine them into complete parse trees. Also they used adjacent-rule and adverb subcategorization to disambiguate of syntactic analysis. Their syntactic analyzer system used morphemes for the basic unit of parsing. They made all possible partial parse trees on each segmentation process, and tried to combine them into complete parse trees.\nMark-Jan Nederhof and Giorgio Satta[10] considered the problem of parsing non-recursive context-free grammars, i.e., context-free grammars that generate finite languages and presented two tabular algorithms for these grammars. They presented their parsing algorithm, based on the CYK (Cocke–Younger–Kasami) algorithm and Earley’s alogrithm. As parsing CFG (context-\nfree grammar), they have taken a small hand-written grammar of about 100 rules. They have ordered the input grammars by size, according to the number of nonterminals (or the number of nodes in the forest, following the terminology by Langkilde (2000)).\nKyongho Min and William H. Wilson [11] discussed the robustness of four efficient syntactic error-correcting parsing algorithms that are based on chart parsing with a context-free grammar. They implemented four versions of a bottom-up error-correcting chart parser: a basic bottom-up chart parser, and chart parsers employing selectivity, top-down filtering, and a combination of selectivity and a top-down filtering. They detected and corrected syntactic errors using a system component called IFSCP (Ill-Formed Sentence Chart Parser) described by Min & Wilson (1994), together with a spelling correction module. They tested 4 different lengths of sentences (3, 5, 7, and 11) and 5 different error types, with a grammar of 210 context-free rules designed to parse a simple declarative sentence with no conjunctions, passivisation, or relative clauses."

      "text" : "Unlike English language Myanmar is syntax of relatively free-phrase-order language. This can be easily illustrated with the example “သူသည္ စာအုပ္ကုိ စားပြဲေပၚတြင္ ထားသည္။” (He places the book on the table) as shown in table 1. All are valid sentences [12].\nIn all the cases, subject is သူ (He), object is စာအုပ္ကို (the book), place is စားပြဲေပၚတြင္ (on the table) and verb is ထားသည္ (places). From the above example, it is clear that phrase order does not determine the functional structure in Myanmar language and permits scrambling. Myanmar language follows Subject-Object-Verb orders in contradiction with English language."

      "heading" : "3.2. Issues of Myanmar Language",
      "text" : "The highly agglutinative language like Myanmar, nouns and verbs get inflected. Many times we need to depend on syntactic function or context to decide upon whether the particular word is a noun or adjective or adverb or post position [12]. This leads to the complexity in Myanmar grammatical relations. A noun may be categorized as common, proper or compound. Similarly, verb may be finite, infinite, gerund or contingent.\nA number of issues are affecting the function tagging for Myanmar language.\n Myanmar phrases can be written in any order as long as the verb phrase is at the end of sentence. For example: ေမာင္လွသည္ - စာအုပ္တစ္အုပ္ကုိ - ေမာင္ဘအား - ေပးသည္။ Mg Hla - a book - to Mg Ba - gives\n(or) စာအုပ္တစ္အုပ္ကုိ - ေမာင္ဘအား - ေမာင္လွက - ေပးသည္။ a book - to Mg Ba - Mg Hla - gives (Ma Hla gives a book to Mg Ba.)\n The phrase order of Myanmar language is free. The sentence can be constructed by placing emphatic phrases at the beginning of a sentence. For example: သူသည္- သတင္းစာကုိ - ဖတ္သည္။(Subj-Obj-Verb) He - newspaper – reads (or) သတင္းစာကုိ - သူ - ဖတ္သည္။ (Obj-Subj-Verb) newspaper - he - reads (He reads the newspaper.)  The subject or object of the sentence can be skipped, and still be a valid sentence. For example: ရန္ကုန္သို႔သြားသည္။ (Go to Yangon)\n Myanmar language makes prominent usage of particles, which are untranslatable words that are suffixed or prefixed to words to indicate level of respect, grammatical tense, or mood. For example: ေမာင္ေမာင္ - မ်ား - ပထမ - ဆု - ရ - လွ်င္ - သူ႔မိဘမ်ား - က - အံ့ၾသ - လိမ့္မည္။ Mg Mg - particle - first - prize - wins - if - his parents - PPM - surprise - will (If Mg Mg wins the first prize, his parents will surprise.)  In Myanmar language, an adjective can specialize before or after a noun unlike other languages. For example: သူသည္ - ခ်မ္းသာေသာ - လူ -တစ္ေယာက္ -ျဖစ္သည္။ He - rich - man - a - is (or) သူသည္ - လူ - ခ်မ္းသာ - တစ္ေယာက္ -ျဖစ္သည္။ He - man - rich - a - is (He is a rich man.)  The subject /object can be another sentence, which does not contain subject or object. For example: ကေလးမ်ားသစ္ပင္ေအာက္တြင္ကစားေနသည္ ကုိ ကၽြန္ေတာ္ျမင္သည္။ (I see the children playing under the tree.)\n The postpositions of subject phrases or object phrases can be hidden. For example: သူသည္- ဆရာ၀န္ -တစ္ေယာက္ - ျဖစ္သည္။ He - doctor - a - is (or) သူ - ဆရာ၀န္ - တစ္ေယာက္ - ျဖစ္သည္။ He - doctor - a - is (He is a doctor.)  The postpositions of time phrases or place phrases can be omitted. For example: သူမ - ေက်ာင္း - သုိ႔ - သြားသည္။ She - school - to - goes (or) သူမ - ေက်ာင္း - သြားသည္။\nShe - school - goes (She goes to school.)\n The verb phrase can be hidden in a Myanmar sentence. For example: သူ - ေမာင္လွ -ပါ။ He - Mg Hla - particle (He is Mg Hla.)\nThese issues will cause a lot of problem during function tagging, and a lot of possible tags will be resulted."

      "heading" : "3.3. Grammar of Myanmar Language",
      "text" : "Grammar studies the rules behind languages. The aspect of grammar that does not concern meaning directly is called syntax. Myanmar (syntax: SOV), because of its use of postposition (wi.Bat), would probably be defined as a “postpositional language”, whereas English (syntax: SVO) because of its use of preposition would probably be defined as a “prepositional language”.\nThere are really only two parts of speech in Myanmar, the noun and the verb, instead of the usually accepted eight parts (Pe Maung Tin 1956:195). Most Myanmar linguists [13] accepted there are eight parts of speech in Myanmar. Myanmar nouns and verbs need the help of suffixes or particles to show grammatical relations.\nFor example: ေက်ာင္းသူမ်ားသာ ဂုဏ္ထူးရသည္။ သူတုိ႔သည္ အတန္းထဲမွာ ႐ိွၾက၏။\nMyanmar is a highly verb-prominent language and that suppression of the subject and omission of personal pronouns in connected text result in a reduced role of nominals. This observation misses the critical role of postposition particles marking sentential arguments and also of the verb itself being so marked. The key to the view of Myanmar being structures by nominals is found in the role of the particles. Some particles modify the word's part of speech. Among the most prominent of these is the particle အ, which is prefixed to verbs and adjectives to form nouns or adverbs.There is a wide variety of particles in Myanmar [14].\nFor example: သူတုိ႔သည္ မႏ ၱေလးတြင္ ၈ ရက္ တိတိ လည္ခဲ့သည္။\nStewart remarked that “The Grammar of Burmese is almost entirely a matter of the correct use of particles”(Stewart 1956: xi). How one understands the role of the particles is probably a matter of one's purpose."

There are two kinds of clause in a complex sentence called independent clause(IC) and dependent clause (DC).There must be at least one independent clause in a sentence.

In probability estimation for Naive Bayesian classifiers, namely that the attribute values are conditionally independent when the target value is given. Naive Bayesian classifiers are well-matched to the function tagging problem.\nThe Naïve Bayesian classifier is a term in Bayesian statistics dealing with a simple probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong (naïve) independence assumptions.

The system operates at word-level with the assumption that input sentences are pre-segmented, pos-tagged and chunked.\nEach proposed function tag is regarded as a class and the task is to find what class/tag a given word in a sentence belongs to a set of predefined classes/tags. A feature is a POS tag word with category. The category of a word is added to the POS tag to obtain more accurate lexical information. It can be formed from the features of that word. For example, noun has 16 categories such as animals, person, objects, food, location, etc. There are 47 categories in our corpus. We show some features of Myanmar words as shown in table 4.\nIn Myanmar language, some words have same meaning but in different features as shown in table 5.\nA class is a one of the proposed function tags.

The chunk types are shown in table 7.\nA chunk contains a Myanmar head word and its modifier. It can contain more than one POS tag and one of the POS tags is selected with respect to the chunk type. In the following chunk, the POS tag (n.animals) is selected with respect to the chunk type (NC).\nFor example: NC [ေခြး/n.animals,တစ္/part.number,ေကာင္/part.type]\nIf the noun chunk (NC) contains more than one noun, the last noun (n.food) is selected as a main word according to the nature of Myanmar language.\nFor example: NC [ေဆာင္းရာသီ/n.time,သီးႏံွပင္/n.food,မ်ား/part.number]\nThere are many possible function tags (t1, t2…tk) for each POS tag with category (pc).

One is simple sentence set, in which every sentence has no more than 15 words. The other is complex sentence set, in which every sentence has more than 15 words. There are 1800 simple sentences and 1200 complex sentences in the corpus.\nFor evaluation purpose, different numbers of sentences collected from Myanmar textbooks of middle school and Myanmar grammar books are used as a test set. The test set can be divided into two groups: first group sentences are composed of word patterns in corpus and second group sentences are composed of word patterns that are not in the corpus. There are 60 sentences in the first group and 40 in the second one.The sentences are tested in the program and the function tagged results are manually checked. In table 8, the performance of function tagging according to the two groups is described.\nAfter implementation of the system using the grammar, it has been seen that the system can easily generates the parse tree for a sentence if the sentence structure satisfies the grammar rules.\nFor example we take the following Myanmar simple sentence မလွ သည္ သူ႔အေမ အတြက္ ကိတ္မုန္႔ ဝယ္လာသည္။ (Ma Hla buys a cake for her mother.)\nThe structure of the above sentence is Subj-Aim-Obj-Pla-Verb. This is a correct sentence according to the Myanmar literature. According to the grammar a possible top-down derivation for the above simple sentence is\n1. Sentence [start] 2. >>I-sent [Sentence→I-sent ] 3. >> Subj-Aim-Obj- Verb [I-sent→Subj-Aim-Obj-Verb] 4. >> PSubj SubjP -Aim-Obj- Verb [Subj → PSubj SubjP] 5. >> PSubj SubjP –PAim-AimP-Obj- Verb [Aim → PAim AimP] 6. >> PSubj SubjP –PAim-AimP-Obj-Verb [Obj→Obj] For example we take the following Myanmar complex sentence မုိး႐ြာလွ်င္ကေလးမ်ားသည္လမ္းေပၚတြင္ေဘာလုံးကန္ၾကသည္။ (If it rains, the children play the football on the road.)\nThe structure of the above sentence is Verb-CCS-Subj-Pla-Obj-Verb. This is a correct sentence according to the Myanmar literature. According to the grammar a possible top-down derivation for the above complex sentence is\n1. Sentence [start] 2. >>I-sent CCS I-sent [Sentence→I-sent CCS I-sent] 3. >>Verb CCS I-sent [I-sent→Verb] 4. >>Verb CCS Subj Pla Obj Verb [I-sent→Subj Pla Obj Verb] 5. >>Verb CCS PSubj SubjP Pla Obj Verb [Subj → PSubj SubjP] 6. >>Verb CCS PSubj SubjP PPla PlaP Obj Verb [Pla → PPla PlaP] 7. >>Verb CCS PSubj SubjP PPla PlaP Obj Verb [Obj→Obj]\nFrom the above derivation it has been seen that the Myanmar sentence is correct according to the grammar. So our system generates a parse tree successfully.\nOur program tests only the sentence structure according to the grammar rules.

      "text" : "In this paper, we investigate the function tag of the word depending on the sentence structure of Myanmar language. We used Naïve Bayesian technique for the task of assigning function tags. For grammatical relations of the function tags, we use context free grammar. The parse tree can be built by using function tags.\nAs function tagging is a pre-processing step for grammatical relations, the errors occurred in the task of function tagging affect the relations of the words. The corpus may be balanced because Naïve Bayesian framework probability simply describes uncertainty. The corpus creation is time consuming. The corpus is the resource for the development of Myanmar to English translation system and we expect the corpus to be continually expanded in the future because the tested sentence can be added into the corpus.\nIn this work we have considered limited number of Myanmar sentences to construct the grammar rules. In future work we have to consider as many sentences as we can and some more tags for constructing the grammar rules because Myanmar language is a free-phrase-order language. Word position for one sentence may not be same in the other sentences. So we can not restrict the grammar rules for some limited number of sentences."

Part of the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comes from the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphological system. Function tagging is a pre-processing step to show grammatical relations of Myanmar sentences. In the task of function tagging, which tags the function of Myanmar sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunking information, we use Naive Bayesian theory to disambiguate the possible function tags of a word. We apply context free grammar (CFG) to find out the grammatical relations of the function tags. We also create a functional annotated tagged corpus for Myanmar and propose the grammar rules for Myanmar sentences. Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with simple sentences and complex sentences.",
