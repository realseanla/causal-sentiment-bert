      "text" : "Previous POS(Part Of Speech) tagging methods of Chinese can be largely classified into 2. One is a method using POS tagging rules that is extracted by Chinese experts, and the other is to u se a statistical model, it usually needs huge Chinese corpus. In case of use the first method, it is very difficult to extract rules and these rules can’t represent va rious language examples. So this method was used in the early years of POS tagging and has been used together with other methods. Other method, corpus-based statistical methods have many advantages, but it needs large amount of POS corpus. To solve these problems, some researchers are studying about a method that uses raw text data ext racted from internet[2, 5, 6]. In this paper we propose a POS decision method imitate Chinese translator whose native language\nis Korean and POS decision rule extracting method using Chinese –Korean bilingual corpus. 1. Availability of Korean translation information in Chinese POS decision Machine translation system is a typical expert system, so the closer translation method to translati\non expert, the higher accuracy of the translation system. Translation expert whose mother tongue is Korean generate Korean words from Chinese words w hen he translates Chinese, and verifies their translation and finally complete the translation. For example, consider following sentence. 精密的观察是科学研究的基础(세밀한 관찰은 과학연구의 기초이다.) When the expert translates this sentence, expert generate Chinese words ‘科学研究’ from 《과학\n연구》, and he knows these words are right words and 《과학은 연구한다》are not right through his experience.\nClassical method is to divide the sentence as 精密/的/观察/是/科学/研究/的/基础, and decide the POS of multi-POS word‘研究’using statistical information.\nThis method largely depends on the amount of corpus and their fields. We can use Korean POS tagging system for this problem. Using the POS tagged words of 《세밀한 관찰은 과학연구의 기초이다.》, we can realize the n\noun combination of 《과학연구》and it tells us the POS of Chinese word ‘研究’is noun. In conclusion using large amount of Korean POS tagged corpus, we can improve the performance of Chinese POS tagging system. 2. Acquisition method of POS decision rule from Chinese-Korean bilingual corpus. Above-mentioned method can be applied into noun - noun conjunction, but it can not be applied in to verb decision and so on. Generally we use following rules for the POS decision of Chinese multi POS words. <ruleset name=\"posdecpos\" kind=\"vn\"> <rule cond=\"any+word(了)\"> setpos(0,v) </rule> Acquisition of these rules generally needs many efforts and it is difficult to decide the confidence of rule. We can use Chinese-Korean bilingual corpus to extract statistical rule. Consider the acquisition method through a example.\nChinese sentence: 我的朋友学习中国语 Translation: 나의 동무는 중국어를 배운다 For above example, do the word dividing for Chinese and do the POS tagging for Korean. 我/的/朋友/学习/中国语 나/N 의/T 동무/N 는/T 중국어/N 를/T 배우다/V ㄴ다/T In this sentence, morpheme analysis of 《배운다》is 《배우다/동사 + ㄴ다/맺음토》and verb t\nranslation of 学习 is 《배우다》, so 学习 is used in verb. Chinese sentence Cs and Korean sentence Ks can be represented as follows.\nncccCs 21:\nmkkkKs 21: where, mn, are the number of Chinese words and Korean words, ii kc , are the i th word of Chines e sentence and Korean sentence. Generally Chinese word ic has several POS. First, do the morpheme analysis of Chinese sentence Cs and Korean sentence Ks . Let the result be ni cccc  //// 21 , mi kkkk  //// 21 . The algorithm decide the POS of ic as follows. Using this method with Chinese POS tagging system, we can train the context of Chinese POS wit hout POS tagged corpus.

The POS deciding rule was represented as follows.\n<ruleset name=\"posdecpos\" kind=\"Deciding type\"> <rule cond=\"context\"> setpos( multi POS position, POS information) </rule> Unknown properties are Deciding type, multi POS position, POS information. For all sentences of training data, we apply the algorithm described above and find unknown pro\nperties and record it, then can extract POS deciding rules and certainty factor.\n3. Chinese POS tagging method\nWe constitute the Chinese POS tagging system with above mentioned methods. First, we extracted noun-noun conjunction from Korean POS tagged corpus and saved it in diction\nary. And then acquired the POS tagging rule using Chinese-Korean bilingual corpus. Finally we propose the POS tagging method as follows.\n1. Do the word dividing of Chinese sentence Cs and denote it be ncccCs 21: 2. For single POS words, decides the POS of the word.. 3. For the word ic that it has several POS and it includes noun, find the noun conjunction\nii cc 1 , 1iicc in noun conjunction dictionary, and if it success , tag the word to be noun. 4. Do the POS tagging using the POS tagging rule. 5. For the words untagged above , tag using statistical model as follows.[1]\n)( )|()|( )( )|()|([maxarg 1112\ni\niiii\ni\niiii\nt i tp wtpttp tp wtpTtpPOS i   \nwhere, 772.01  , 22.02 "

In the future we must study about the POS tagging method of Chinese verb using Korean toe inf ormation and the POS decision rule."
