      "text" : "We present a dataset of manually annotated relationships between characters in literary texts, in order to support the training and evaluation of automatic methods for relation type prediction in this domain (Makazhanov et al., 2014; Kokkinakis, 2013) and the broader computational analysis of literary character (Elson et al., 2010; Bamman et al., 2014; Vala et al., 2015; Flekova and Gurevych, 2015). In this work, we solicit annotations from workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk on four dimensions of interest: for a given pair of characters, we collect judgments as to the coarse-grained category (professional, social, familial), fine-grained category (friend, lover, parent, rival, employer), and affinity (positive, negative, neutral) that describes their primary relationship in a text. We do not assume that this relationship is static; we also collect judgments as to whether it changes at any point in the course of the text.\nThe annotations describe character dyads in 109 texts ranging from Homer’s Iliad to Joyce’s Ulysses (see section 3 for a full list). Rather than relying on annotators’ expertise in these texts, we frame the annotation problem as one of estimating the relationship as depicted in a third-party summary (SparkNotes); this allows annotators to provide judgments on the relationship between pairs of characters by only reading a summary of a book, and not the book itself. While this approach naturally loses the nuance of a truly expert opinion, it allows us to broadly characterize a large number literary dyads, assess the feasibility of this annotation strategy, and provide a foundation on which other work can build. All data is openly available at http:// github.com/dbamman/characterRelations, and we encourage contributions and corrections."

      "text" : "Our primary corpus selection criterion was that a text is both available on Project Gutenberg (to enable computational analysis of an open-access text) and is the subject of a study guide on www.sparknotes. com (to enable annotation by non-experts). SparkNotes provides a detailed summary of the plot and major characters in texts, often a structured format (e.g., a section denoted “Character List” ); from this summary we extract all characters and use them to populate the following questionnaire.\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n00 72\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nD ec\n2 01\n5\nFictional Character Relationship Analysis\nIn this task, you’ll be identifying the relationship type that exists between two characters in The Good Soldier by Ford Madox Ford, using a description and summary of that work from SparkNotes. (For example, if reading To Kill a Mockingbird, you’d mark that Atticus Finch is the father of Scout Finch.)\nWe expect this task to take approximately 20 minutes. Please read the \"Character List,\" \"Plot Overview,\" and \"Character Analysis / Analysis of Major Characters\" pages here: http://www.sparknotes.com/ lit/goodsoldier/.\nAfter reading these pages, list all of the relationships that you can identify between the characters described there. To complete a relationship, find the two characters in the dropdown menus below with First Character and Second Character. Then, answer the following questions using these guidelines:\nAffinity:\nHow do the two characters feel toward each other? For example, if they are friendly, select \"Positive\". If it is unclear how they feel toward each other or if they do not have strong opinions about each other, select \"Neutral\". If they are enemies or rivals, or hate each other, select \"Negative\".\nCategory:\nHow are the two characters related? If they are friends, select \"Social\". If they share a relationship because they work with each other, select \"Professional\". If they are family, then select \"Familial\".\nKind:\nSpecifically, how is the First Character related to the Second Character? For example, if the First Character is the husband of the Second Character, then select \"husband\". Please keep the Category and the Kind consistent:\nIf you selected \"Social\", then the Kind must be one of these:\n• friend • enemy • acquaintance • lovers • unrequited love interest (X is in love with Y, but Y is not in love with X) • rivals\nIf you selected \"Professional\", then the Kind must be one of these:\n• employer • employee • colleague • servant • master • student • teacher • client\n• person offering service to client (e.g., lawyer)\nIf you selected \"Familial\", then the Kind must be one of these:\n• husband/wife • brother/sister • cousin • uncle/aunt • niece/nephew • child • parent • grandchild • grandparent • orphan • foster parent • step-child • step-parent • in-law relation (e.g., mother-in-law; specify in detail) • half relation (e.g., half-sister; specify in detail)\nChange:\nDoes the relationship between the two characters significantly change at some point in the book? For example, does a \"positive\" relationship become \"negative\", or do \"lovers\" become \"husband/wife\" or \"friends\" become \"enemies\"? If so, select \"Yes\" here and describe the change in the Detail section below. If the relationship remains the same throughout (for example, \"brother/sister\"), then select \"No\".\nDetail:\nIf the relationship type you feel holds between two characters was not provided, or you want to provide additional information, enter it here.\nIf two characters hold multiple relations to each other (such as \"Professional: colleague\" and \"Social: lovers\"), enter those multiple relations in different rows below. Please identify a total of 10 relations between characters in the rows below.\n(Users then select a pair of characters from the following list and label the relations specified above):\n• John Dowell • Florence Hurlbird Dowell • Leonora Powys Ashburnham • Captain Edward Ashburnham • Nancy Rufford • Jimmy • Uncle John Hurlbird • Maisie Maidan • Rodney Bayham • Mrs. Basil • La Dolciquita\n• The Misses Hurlbird • Selmes • Major Rufford\nWe present this questionnaire to workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, soliciting two independent judgments for each of the 109 literary texts. Since we are soliciting judgments regarding any 10 character pairs in the text (and not a fixed set of such dyads), many of the character pairs from different annotators for the same work do not overlap. We collect a total of 2,170 annotations; among these, 392 character dyads have annotations by two different annotators, from which we can calculate agreement statistics. Table 1 lists the inter-annotator agreement rate (and Fleiss’ κ, correcting for chance) for each of the four annotation classes. The agreement rates for both the coarse- and fine-grained categories are both high, even when correcting for chance (κ = 0.812 and 0.744, respectively). 18.1% of character pairs are judged to exhibit some change over the course of the text. While annotators display high agreement on this (75.7%), their agreement is in fact quite low when correcting for chance (κ = 0.208). Judging whether a dyad’s relationship is positive, negative or neutral also proves to be quite difficult, with low agreement rates across annotators.\nFigure 1 shows the distribution of affinity and coarse-grained category annotations, while figure 2 shows the distribution of fine-grained category annotations."
