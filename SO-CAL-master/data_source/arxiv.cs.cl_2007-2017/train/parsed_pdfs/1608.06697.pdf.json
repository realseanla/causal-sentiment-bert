      "text" : "This report is a supplementary document to Goddard, Taboada and Trnavac (2016), henceforth GTT. It contains NSM semantic explications for attributive uses of 24 evaluational adjectives, accompanied by brief comments or supporting observations. The assumptions and operating principles of the NSM approach (cf. Goddard (2011), Goddard and Wierzbicka (2014)) are explained in GTT, along with the analytical procedure that led to the explications proposed below. The analysis drew on corpus data from WordsBanks Online, a commercially available corpus service. For background to the study of evaluational language generally, and its application to sentiment analysis, see Martin and White (2005), and Taboada et al. (2011).\nEvaluational adjectives, and the language of evaluation generally, pose fascinating challenges for semantic description, both on account of their inherent subjectivity and because of the sheer number of subtly different meanings involved. For the same reasons, they pose special challenges for computational linguistics and affective computing, including for sentiment analysis (Hudlicka 2003; Taboada et. al 2011; Trnavac & Taboada 2012).\nThe primary goals of the GTT paper are two-fold. The first goal is to apply the Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) approach to a selection of evaluational adjectives. The NSM approach is a well developed approach to lexical-semantic analysis, based on reductive paraphrase (Wierzbicka 1996; Goddard & Wierzbicka 2014; Peeters 2006; Goddard 2011; Levisen 2012; and other works). There is a large “back catalogue” of NSM studies into the evaluative lexicon, especially in the domains of emotion and values (e.g. Wierzbicka 1999; Harkins & Wierzbicka 2001), but this is the first NSM study of evaluational adjectives. We present and discuss original NSM explications for a total of 39 such adjectives (15 in the GTT paper; 24 in this report), arguing that they fall into five sub-groups, each conforming to a distinct structure or semantic template. This selection has not been chosen at random, but is a subset of about 40-50 adjectives currently under study.\nOur second goal is to compare these results with the picture developed within the Appraisal Framework (Martin & White 2005; Martin in press; among others). This is arguably the most influential approach to evaluational language, having been developed over the last 15 years under the auspices of Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halliday 1985; Halliday & Matthiessen 2014). SFL follows the structuralist tradition insofar as it is based on a system of classifications and oppositions.\nThe five groupings that have emerged from the process of NSM analysis are listed in Table 1, with sample adjectives for each grouping. In the Appraisal Framework (Martin & White 2005), they fall into the category of Appreciation, which has a number of subtypes as discussed later. In Table 1, each grouping has two rows, one for positive and one for negative adjectives.\nIn the rest of this report, we include explications for 24 of the adjectives in Table 1. The templates are listed in the same order as in GTT."

      "heading" : "1 TEMPLATE A WORDS",
      "text" : "Words falling under Template A, e.g. great, wonderful, terrific, awesome, fabulous, terrible, awful, dreadful, can be characterised as “first-person thought-plus-feeling” words. These words are overtly subjective, modelled in the explications by the lead component ‘I think about it like this: ...’. Then follows a model thought, which in this set of explications begins with a strong evaluation: either ‘this X is very good’ or ‘this X is very bad’. The special character of each evaluation comes from the thought component, which is different for each adjective. The template is completed with a component indicating that on account of thinking as he/she does, the speaker feels ‘something very good’ or ‘something very bad’, as the case may be.\nGreat, wonderful, and terrific are explicated in GTT. Explications for five additional Template A\nwords follow."

Fabulous sounds enthusiastic, breathless, deliberately hyperbolic."

That’s awful for you vs. *That’s dreadful for you. Similarly, a sentence like I’ve got an awful pimple seems quite ordinary, but would be odd with dreadful. • There are collocational indications that the thought behind dreadful is broader and less personal than for awful, e.g. descriptions of the climate tend to sound better with dreadful than with awful."

      "heading" : "2 TEMPLATE B WORDS",
      "text" : "Words falling under the B Templates (subtypes B1 and B2) are termed “experiential” evaluators. Examples include: entertaining, delightful for B1, gripping, exciting for B2. They differ from the Template A words in several ways. First, they are less overtly subjective. This is modelled in the explications by a component saying that ‘someone can think like this (about it): ...’. That is, these evaluational words in this group work by invoking a hypothetical ‘someone’ and attributing certain thoughts and associated feelings to this hypothetical someone. Second, words in this group say something about someone’s “experience” of the things being evaluated. Briefly, this means that the thoughts and feelings being depicted are associated with the time period during which someone experiences (watches, reads, or is otherwise exposed to) the stimulus. Third, the B2 Template includes an additional semantic component alluding to a potential bodily effect on the experiencer.\nThe notation => indicates that the details of the top-most section of the explications are not spelt out in full (mainly because they vary somewhat depending on the nature of the noun). See GTT for more detail.\nEntertaining, delightful, gripping and exciting are explicated in GTT. Explications for ten\nadditional Template B1/B2 words follow."

Goddard in press).\na compelling1 –, e.g. a compelling performance, a compelling story =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: “something is happening now\nI want to know what will happen after this, I can’t not (= have to) know it”\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something because of it\nnot like people feel at many other times\nThe word compelling has two distinct meanings: the “experiential” meaning explicated above, and another purely cognitive meaning, as in phrases like compelling evidence, a compelling reason, argument, etc. Only the “experiential” meaning (which, incidentally is highly languagespecific) can occur in the frame It’s compelling.\na fascinating –, e.g. a fascinating exploration, conversation =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: “I want to know more about this, I want it very much\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something very good because of it\nThere is an intuition that if something is fascinating, we are finding out something new and we want more (i.e. fascinating implies very interesting, at least from a cognitive point of view), but also that fascinating is somehow pleasurable, as captured in the final component.\na touching –, e.g. a touching story, memoir, ballad =>\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: “someone did something a moment ago, not like people do at many times\nbecause of this, I know that this someone feels something very good towards\nsomeone else at this time”\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can’t not feel something good for a short time\n• The word touching is not inherently durational (cf. expressions like a touching moment, a touching gesture), but we explicate it above in a durational frame. • Describing something as touching implies a more or less immediate reaction to an act that shows someone’s strong affection towards someone else. It is akin to heart-warming. • On a point of detail, the final ‘feeling’ component contains a time adjunct that states that the feeling is short-lived."

Children use the word boring a lot earlier than interesting. It implies that someone is “attending” to what’s happening and finds it wanting.\na predictable —, e.g. a predictable storyline, ending, response\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: “something is happening now\nI knew before that this would happen”\nwhen someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something bad because of it\nInterestingly, this explication is not “prospective”, i.e. it is not about having the impression of knowing what’s coming next, but rather about recognising something about what is happening now (e.g. in the film or book). This is a simpler and more “experiential” meaning than one would expect from the verb predict, which is future-oriented."

We explicate here its specialised “experiential” meaning in contexts like a tense movie, a tense scene. In its other meanings, e.g. in expressions like tense muscles, a tense situation, the word implies negative feeling but when used about a movie, book, etc., the implied feeling is not negative. This is accounted for by the component capturing the experiencer’s awareness of the “non-reality” of the situation. Note that whether or not a film, book, etc. is tense does not depend purely on unpredictability. One may know exactly what will happen but still find it tense.\na suspenseful —, e.g. a suspenseful romance, plot\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this about someone at many times:\n“something will happen after a very short time\nmaybe it will be very good for this someone, maybe it will be very bad for this someone I want to know what will happen, I want to know it now”\nwhen this someone thinks like this, he/she can feel something because of it\nnot like people feel at many other times\nat the same time something can happen in this someone’s body because of it\nWith suspenseful, the experiencer is sure that something will happen very soon, and the stakes are high, but the potential event in question does not necessarily have to be negative. Suspense can also come from waiting to find out whether something very good will happen, e.g. winning a competition or prize, cf. Don’t keep in me in suspense.\na stunning —, e.g. a stunning performance =>\nduring this time (e.g. when someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain things happen\nto this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: “this is something very good, I don’t know how it can be like this\nbecause of this I can’t think well at this moment”\nwhen someone thinks like this, he/she can’t not feel something because of it people don’t feel like this at many times at the same time he/she can feel something in the body because of it\n• Many uses of stunning occur in non-durational contexts, and pertain to the immediate cognitive experience of seeing something remarkable, e.g. stunning looks, or realising that something remarkable has happened, e.g. a stunning victory. Above, however, we explicate the word used in a durational context, as it pertains to the experience of someone watching a film, a performance, etc. • Data from WordBanks shows that stunning rarely occurs conjoined with other adjectives and almost never occurs with very or extremely (though can be modified with Focus intensifiers, e.g. absolutely, quite, simply)."

Goddard 2014).\na sickening –, e.g. a sickening re-enactment; sickening cruelty\nduring this time (e.g. when this someone watches this film, reads this book; when certain\nthings happen to this someone),\nthis someone can think like this at many times: “something very bad is happening to someone’s body at this time\nI can’t not think about it”\nwhen someone thinks like this, he/she can’t not feel something very bad because of it\nlike people can’t not feel something very bad at some times\nwhen something very bad is happening inside the body\n• Like disgusting, the word sickening is hardly ever modified by very. • Many nouns that commonly go with sickening, e.g. abuse, cruelty, attack, and crime, clearly evoke human action as the cause. • Even more frequently it is found in a non-durational frame with nouns denoting sounds of someone’s body undergoing a traumatic impact, e.g. collision, thud, crack."

The explications account for this by explaining woeful in terms of someone’s very bad performance leading to a very bad “personal” consequence (‘this is very bad for someone’). • In relation to the final component of both explications, it can be noted that dictionaries sometimes mention causing ‘gloom’, ‘dismay’ or ‘sadness’ as part of the meanings of these words."
