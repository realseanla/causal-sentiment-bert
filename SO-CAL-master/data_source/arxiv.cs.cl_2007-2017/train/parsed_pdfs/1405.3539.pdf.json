      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "We establish an approach for mapping out narrative, with a primary focus on emotional attachment. Two extensively studied testbeds are used. Our methodology does not seek to isolate the qualities of interest. Rather, we map these qualities (i) through their interaction, and (ii) in context.\nThe new interdisciplinarity that we pursue here is between computational science and psychoanalysis. Longer term our aim is data-driven generative modeling. This is a different line of work relative to computational and psychological interdisciplinarity [24], largely using behavioral modeling. There are strong parallels here, in our view, with, respectively, unsupervised and supervised pattern recognition. Our approach is unsupervised, or data driven.\nAn interesting psychoanalytic view of the link between emotion and interaction is in [5]: “Emotions are a multifaceted object of interest. They should not\nar X\niv :1\n40 5.\n35 39\nv1 [\ncs .A\nbe considered as producers of interaction. It might be more correct to reverse the order of causation: social interaction is the medium with the power to evoke and regulate human emotions.”\nIn brief, we carry out a metric embedding of the semantics of the discourse, and determine subplots of the narrative. From the metric embedding of the semantics we map the trajectory of emotional qualities, and emotional interactions of the characters. We carry out an ultrametric (tree or hierarchy topology) embedding so as to structure the antinomies or polarities of the qualities studied.\nIn section 2, we present a short review of various strands of work in this area, that have lessons to be drawn. We indicate where, and why, our work differs.\nSection 3 deals with our methodology of unsupervised pattern recognition. An Appendix provides background description.\nSection 4 relates to subplot analysis in the dialog of Ilsa and Rick in the Casablanca movie. We ask: how is the overall dialog of Ilsa and Rick to be understood in terms of subplots? Such subplots are found by us in decreasing order of importance or salience. They are determined in terms of factors, i.e. principal components or latent semantics. In section 5 we analyze emotion through emotional interaction. From the data, we find the major determinants of emotional interaction. This work is based on dialog from the Casablanca movie. Since this has been very extensively analyzed, it provides us with an evaluation testbed.\nSections 6 and 7 are a study of the narrative and evolution of emotion from part of Flaubert’s 19th century novel. We also take a much analyzed novel, Madame Bovary, for another analysis of emotion. Since we use text from this novel, with description as well as dialog, this case study shows how well our methodology can handle general textual data."

      "heading" : "2 Review of Determining and Tracking Emotion",
      "text" : "in Various Application Domains\nWe review in this section a number of approaches to determining and tracking emotional context in text and/or related data.\nIn subsection 2.1, lexical analysis based machine learning is used on social media data in order to label such data in terms of emotion or mood. In subsection 2.2 lexical analysis is used on novels in order to subtype them, and otherwise label them, in terms of emotional descriptors. The extrapolation of such an approach is proposed for characterizing the development of indications towards anti-social behavior. Subsection 2.3 uses a hierarchy of mood states, that is manually created, and this is applied in a dynamic, evolving context."

      "heading" : "2.1 Supervised Lexical Analysis for Sentiment and Mood Analysis",
      "text" : "In [28], positive or negative sentiment towards consumer products is the focus.\nTwo approaches are used – “mood setting” which characterizes social web texts on scales of +1 to +5, and −1 to −5, for selected sentiment words, with some context taken into account, such as questions, negations, exclamation marks, emoticons, and the use of the adverb “very”. “Lexicon extension” (also referred to on page 3 of [28] as lexical extension) seeks other additional words that are to a greater or lesser extent characteristic of alternative moods.\nIn [20], rather than positive and negative scales of sentiment, “valence” and “arousal” are studied. In [8], the terms “mood”, “affective state” and “emotion” are identical. Schwartz’s typology of motivational values is used, and these are further taken on two dimensions, positive/negative and passive/active. This study was to associate moral value terms with mood defined by degree of the set of motivational values. Marked corpora were used.\nRelative to the work described, which we can characterize as lexical and supervised, our work is unsupervised and is data driven, in particular insofar as uncontrolled term sets are determined through our pipeline processing and analysis. A further and crucial point of note is how the work described takes emotion as, very largely, mood, with a view towards prediction of a user’s behavior. Such behavior can be purchase of a commodity, or an anti-social act."

      "heading" : "2.2 Emotion Tracking through Lexical Analysis",
      "text" : "In the emotion tracking project, [27], the approach taken is to determine terms and phrases that carry sentiment semantics, and then label them in degree of positivity or negativity. Examples of application areas are marketing and conflict prediction, the latter entailing the search for “drastic changes in emotions towards a certain topic” [27]. (Multiple murder in a school shooting is at issue here, and in subsection 2.1, street rioting in the UK was at issue.)\nIt is noted in [9] how sentiment analysis, as a new area of text analysis, has come to the fore in recent years. Emotion or affective content in novels is the focus, together with visualization. This work studies Gothic novels, that are “rich in dark and gloomy topics”, hence negative emotions, and with subgenres of terror and horror. 823 nouns, verbs and adjectives are associated with a 147 class hierarchy. Thus, the “cruelty” class was associated with such words as “cruel”, “pitilessness”, “unkind”. A root class, “negative-emotion”, has seven child node classes, including “anxiety”, “daze”, “despair”, “generaldislike”, “humility”, “ingratitude” and “sadness”. With the given hierarchy, sentiment-bearing words are detected and associated with the relevant node in the hierarchy. Scores are defined from the class members to summarize the tree structure. These scores can be used to distinguish between the sub-genres noted, of terror and horror. Predominance of sentiment classes, in the hierarchy, serves to distinguish sub-genres, or novels, or indeed authors.\nWhere our work differs from [9] is that we seek semantic characterization from data in an unsupervised, rather than supervised, way. In determining and tracking very faint emotional signal in our data, we recognize that parts of speech and function words can have a highly important role in expressing emotion."

      "heading" : "2.3 Narrative of Emotion together with Narrative of Actions",
      "text" : "In this subsection, we review work focused on storyboarding or dramatization. In addition to the storyline defined in [22] as a sequence of actions (designed to address a task that the story defines), referred to as the plot, this work seeks to use “character” ([22], section 1) also. In the plot, there is generation of action sequences. With character, the plot’s actions are to be driven by intention and longer term motivations.\nIn an analysis of three chapters from Flaubert’s 19th century novel, Madame Bovary, [6], a top level polarity of feelings (states of mind) into “duty” and “pleasure” is used; and a set of five “emotional input” feelings, being combinations of “valence” and “arousal”, that are determined in real time from the voice of a user interactively playing the role of Emma Bovary’s lover, Rodolphe. These emotional input feelings are: NegativeActive, NegativePassive, Neutral, PositiveActive and PositivePassive.\nIn discussing other work, [6] (in their section 6) note the objective being simulation and training, conferring believability on the virtual actors, while not at issue are narrative as such, or aesthetic aspects. It is acknowledged (in their section 7) that the emotional categories for both state of feelings and expectations are limited in number and genre-specific."

Emotions of partners in a relationship are modeled using ordinary differential equations. The dynamical system that ensues is then explored in terms of its system properties (such as chaotic behavior). Parameter values are provided in analogy with the film content.\nKhrennikov [10, 11] has developed and explored dynamical systems in padic (p prime) number systems. Cognitive process dynamics, represented as paths and trajectories in trees, imply that (see [11] p. 138) a “pathway contributes to distinct psychological functions”, and furthermore that “pathways going through reasoning-centres can go through some emotional centre. Thus reason participates in the creation of emotions and vice versa.” Such dynamical systems work is not data-driven as in our approach."

This is also what Benzécri [1–3] referred to as “letting the data speak for them-\nselves”, and “the model must follow the data and not the other way around”. Our approach is one of (i) data encoding, (ii) measurement including especially qualitative information through proxied expression of such information, (iii) pattern and trend determination and display, and thereafter (iv) model selection from the data."

      "heading" : "3.1 Euclidean Geometry for Mapping the Semantics, Tree Topology for Chronology of the Semantics",
      "text" : "Our starting point is the mapping of semantics into a visually-based representational space. This is accomplished by considering text (or other multimedia data) units crossed by the entities that comprise them and that serve to define them – words, in the case of text. Thus each text unit, e.g. a chapter of a novel, or scene of a filmscript, or one or some consecutive set of Twitter tweets, and so on, is contextually described by the frequencies of occurrence (including absence) of words in the word set used. Similarly, each word has a vector of the text units in which it appears. Context, therefore, is part and parcel of our data from the start.\nThe choice of words in the word list, for filmscript and for novels, includes – without loss of generality – setting all upper case to lower case, excluding punctuation, and excluding most numeric information.\nThe dual spaces of text units and works are then mapped mathematically (and analytically using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of these dual spaces, defined from the positive semidefinite matrix of their relationships) into a Euclidean space, termed a factor space (or principal component space, or latent semantic space). Planar projections of the factor spaces provide visualizations of the text units and words of the dual spaces. These planar projections are based on decreasing informativeness of the factors or space dimensions, provided by the moments of inertia that the eigenvalues define.\nSee the Appendix for a short review of the salient aspects of such analysis. On the basis of the representation of the field of study, analysis of change over time, including continuity and change, next avails of a hierarchical mapping. We can require that the hierarchy be based on the chronology or given sequence of text units (e.g. dialog elements, descriptive text segments). The algorithmic requirements to realise this (the pairwise agglomerative criterion that ensures a well-defined hierarchy, viz. with a monotonic sequence of agglomeration values: the complete linkage criterion) are described in [18]. Typically the full dimensional field representation (i.e. factor space) is input to the hierarchy building algorithm. An innovation is the use for this hierarchical clustering, of words or of text units, of orientations of text units, provided by the correlations or cosines of angles with the factors.\nSee the Appendix for a short review of the particular hierarchical clustering algorithm that follows, and is determined from, the semantic mapping of our data.\nIn summary, our initial data is endowed with the χ2 metric in order to account for all semantic information; in mapping the dual spaces into the factor\nspace, we are endowing them with the Euclidean metric; in then mapping the dual spaces now in their Euclidean geometry, whether their coordinate projections or orientations (correlations, cosines), into an ultrametric topology. Ultrametric topology expresses hierarchy."

      "heading" : "3.2 Analysis of Emotion: The Importance of Tool or Function Words",
      "text" : "In general we can distinguish between (i) tool words, form words, function words, empty words, grammar or grammatical words (examples: articles, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and so on); and (ii) content words, full words. In [17], we cite many studies, using many languages, to support the following. Tool words are of importance for style analysis, and full words for content analysis. However style itself can be useful for describing context and relative properties. In particular ways we can approach the analysis of content through tool words. Non-tool full words can be very specific, and therefore not at all helpful for comparative exploration of texts or text fragments.\nContent words, with lemmatization and stemming, are important in supporting retrieval. Other forms of style and content can be relevant too, such as sentence length, patterns of punctuation usage, word length, use of the passive tense, etc. For us we make the following choice, given our aim in this work. The “texture” of the text is all important. Pennebaker [21], and see also [15], analyzed “junk” words (articles, pronouns, prepositions) and showed how they typified gender, and personal relationships (in the heading of [15], “word usage predicts romantic attraction”).\nThus we have a particular interest in tool or function words. In this context, there is no benefit to us in lemmatization and stemming. Note also that the very limited number of words used in dialog precludes this."

We selected just the dialog of the two, Ilsa and Rick, and in addition required that this dialog be alternating. (There were some cases within a scene involving Ilsa and Rick where the dialog of one of these involved other characters: such cases were not included, given our objective of focusing on direct Ilsa and Rick conversations.) Thus, dialog elements were alternating\nbetween the two, Ilsa and Rick, with just a few instances of repeated utterances of the same person (Ilsa or Rick).\nIn all there were 150 dialog utterances. The number of words in these utterances was 528, with: upper case set to lower case, numeric values included, punctuation set to blank, words constituted of ≥ 1 contiguous letters. Next we required, to support the contrasting of utterances, that a word should be used a sufficient number of times. We required that each word be used in at least two different utterances, and that each word be used at least twice overall. This gave the total number of words retained as 261.\nThe data input is a csv, comma separated values format, file. It is available at www.narrativization.com. The first few dialog utterances and the very final one are as follows, where we have Sequence Number (of the utterance), Name (Ilsa or Rick), and the Expression – the utterance. The dashes are as in the original script.\n1, RICK, \"-- Hello, Ilsa.\" 2, ILSA, \"Hello, Rick.\" 3, ILSA, \"-- This is Mr. Laszlo.\" 4, RICK, \"How do you do?\" 5, ILSA, \"I wasn’t sure you were the same. Let’s see, the last time we met --\" 6, RICK, \"-- It was La Belle Aurore.\" 7, ILSA, \"How nice. You remembered.

      "text" : "Our first analysis is frequency of occurrence cross-tabulations of the 150 utterances with the 261 word set. Figures 1 and 2 are separately displayed simply to avoid overcrowding. The factors (axes, components) are the principal axes of inertia of the cloud of weighted utterance points, and this overall cloud inertia is identical to the inertia of the cloud of weighted word points. (See the Appendix for further background.) The projections on this best fitting, principal factor, plane respresent just 2.28% (first factor) plus 2.16% (second factor) of the inertia of the cloud of 150 utterances, or identically the inertia of the cloud of 261 words. This is typical for the sparse utterance/word data that is analyzed.\nTo focus our attention on the most influential utterances and words, the contribution to inertia of the factors is checked out. A threshold of 3 times the mean contribution was used here. This was a trade-off between decreasing inertia contributions, versus the need to restrict attention to a limited number of utterances and of words. Figures 1 and 2 show words and utterances that have inertia contributions that are greater than 3 times the mean (word or utterance, respectively) contribution. In Figure 2, utterances 17, 1, 2, 13, 68, 25, 147, 57 contributed strongly to the inertia and are on the negative side of the first factor. There were no utterances contributing strongly to the positive side of the first factor. For the second factor, utterances 20, 145, 28, 42, 36, 52, and also 1, 2, 13, contributed strongly to the positive side of this factor. Contributing strongly to the negative side of factor 2 were utterances 72, 111.\nDominant Words for these Factors\nDominant Utterances for these Factors\nWhile Figure 1 has the names “Ilsa” and “Rick” in the word set, i.e. among the 261 words, in Figure 2 we use these names, the speaker of each of the utterances (coded for each utterance as 1 if the speaker, and as 0 if not the speaker), as supplementary attributes. That is, they are projected into the factor space subsequent to the determination of the factor space. They are passive attributes. It is very interesting to note how these supplementary words have very close projections in the principal factor plane (Figure 2) as when they are used as words in the dialog itself (Figure 1).\nThe utterances in Figure 2, that are the most important for this principal factor plane, are really interesting as shown in the following list.\n• 20, Rick: “Here’s looking at you, kid.” 145, Rick: “Here’s looking at you, kid.” 36, Rick, “You said it! Here’s looking at you, kid.” 120, Rick, “All right, I will. Here’s looking at you, kid.”\n• 28, Rick: “Uh huh.” 42, Rick: “Looking for a job.”\n• 52, Rick: “– The train for Marseilles leaves at five o’clock. I’ll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.”\n• 72, Ilsa, “Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He’d understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I’ll be leaving Casablanca soon and we’ll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we’ll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.” 111, Ilsa, “Oh, it wasn’t my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.”\n• 57, Ilsa, “Oh, darling!”\n• 68, Ilsa, “Yes.” 25, Ilsa, “Yes?” 147, Ilsa, “Yes.”\n• 13, Ilsa, “Say goodnight to Sam for me.”\n• 1, Rick, “– Hello, Ilsa.” 2, Ilsa, “Hello, Rick.” 17, Ilsa, “Goodnight.”\nEspecially interestingly, our semantic mapping has indicated the importance of the famous catch-phrase of the Casablanca movie script, “Here’s looking at you, kid”. We also note the importance of the one-word dialog utterances,\n“Yes”. We repeat a point made earlier: with such short utterances, we are truly studying the “texture” of the dialog.\nWe note how important Sam, the piano player, is here in mediating the relationship of Ilsa and Rick (cf. upper left of the principal factor plane). The upper left quadrant is a somewhat formal and friendly space, referenced to the background context. In that sense, the Ilsa/Rick relationship is very much mediated by the ambient context. The upper right quadrant is, we could say informally, Rick’s space. It is here where we find his celebrated, and repeated, phrase “Here’s looking at you, kid.” The lower left quadrant is, again informally, Ilsa’s space, with a somewhat more amorous tendency.\nWere we to have a straightforwardly maturing relationship between Ilsa and Rick, then we might find the chronology of utterances in some simple pattern in the principal factor plane. We do not find such a pattern, because the relationship between these characters evolves through the film. The narrative and the subplots of the narrative are what we look at next."

      "heading" : "4.3 Semantic Analysis through Euclidean, Factor Space Embedding: Application to Determining the Most Salient Subplots",
      "text" : "In order to examine the subplots that are interwoven into the overall narrative, we proceed as follows. The utterances, which are relevant for the emotional content as we have shown in the previous subsection, are not always suitable directly for studying the evolution of the narrative. (After all, there are a few utterances that just have “Yes” and “No”. But in an emotional context, clearly they have their role.)\nSo, to study the evolution of the narrative, we use scenes. The scenes, and the dialog utterances that come from them, are listed in Table 1. From the input data point of view, we aggregate the utterance data to provide the scene data. Therefore, we have up to now a 150× 261 utterances × words table with 0 values whenever the word was not used in the utterance, and a value greater than 0 for the number of times the word was used in the utterance. (The largest such frequency of occurrence is 7, and this is the case for “you” in utterance 95, and for “I” in utterance 113.) We aggregate rows 1 to 17 to form the new row of the scenes matrix, and so on (cf. Table 1). This gives us a frequency of occurrence scenes × words matrix of dimensions 11×261. This 11×261 matrix has 910 non-zero values and therefore has 31.7% occupancy. Its maximum value is 43 (“you” is used 43 times in one scene).\nThe factors, as the principal components, or latent variables, are the bearers of the information that underlies our data. They are given in order of decreasing importance. Therefore we will determine subplots in the overall narrative by looking at the factors, in succession. Since we can do that by displaying sets of planar projections, and also to economize on our discussion, we will discuss our findings by pairs of successive factors. We summarize our findings as follows, for the 11 scenes (and 261 words).\nFactors 1 and 2: The most important scenes (in terms of contribution to the inertia defining the principal axes of inertia, or factors) are scene 22 and scene 31. Scene 22 is where Ilsa and Rick meet again in Casablanca. Sam the piano-player and singer is present. At one point we have: “ILSA: Play it, Sam. Play ‘As Time Goes By.’ ”. Later there is this exchange: “RICK: Hello, Ilsa. ILSA: Hello, Rick.” There is discussion of Germans in Paris in the past. The scene ends with Ilsa and Rick saying “Goodnight” to one another. In scene 31, there is a flashback to the past in Paris, with Sam there too, and ending with: “ILSA: Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time.”. Therefore the positive quadrant for both factors is introductory and scene setting, based around Sam. Factor 2, negative half axis, refers to the past, in scene 31, and the positive half axis refers to the present, in particular scene 22. Factors 3 and 4: In the plane of factors 3 and 4, the preponderant scenes are as follows. Scenes 58 and 59, relate to Ilsa’s husband Victor Laszlo (“he”) getting transit papers to flee from Casablanca. Scenes 76 and 77 are at the airport where Rick sees off on the plane both Ilsa and Victor. Whereas the plane of factors 1 and 2 relates to Ilsa and Rick meeting up again, the plane of factors 3 and 4 relates to their separation from one another. Factors 5 and 6: In the plane of factors 5 and 6, scene 28 features, and this scene has Rick and Ilsa in a flashback to Paris, Rick in love with Ilsa stating that Victor Laszlo is dead, as she thought then. This plane also has as a preponderant scene, scene 77 which has Rick shooting dead Major Strasser, in self defence, and in order to allow Ilsa to escape from Casablanca with Victor. If the planes of factors 1 and 2, and of factors 3 and 4, are respectively the beginning and the end of Ilsa’s and Rick’s renewed relationship, then the plane\nof factors 5 and 6 is a succinct, pithy summary, through the scenes displayed, of the overall narrative of this renewed relationship. Factors 7 and 8: In the plane of factors 7 and 8, preponderant scene 28 is a Paris flashback, with a very short dialog where Rick is in discovery mode about Ilsa (with “Who are you really?”, and other questions to her). Then scene 43 is the market scene that we analyzed in [18]. That latter scene is the time when Ilsa announces that she will leave Casablanca, and that Victor Laszlo has been her husband all along. Again therefore Rick is put (unwillingly) into discovery mode about Ilsa. Factors 9 and 10: The plane of factors 9 and 10 counterposes scene 30, which in Paris points to Rick having to flee for safety, and Ilsa’s concern for Rick’s safety; with scene 70, where Rick indicates that he is helping both Victor and Ilsa flee for safety, and again Ilsa’s concern for Victor is uppermost.\nIn summary we have the following.\n1. The plane of factors 1 and 2: the beginning of the renewed meeting up of Ilsa and Rick in Casablanca, with the Paris background to this.\n2. The plane of factors 3 and 4: the end of the renewed meeting up of Ilsa and Rick in Casablanca.\n3. The plane of factors 5 and 6: a focus on what Rick did in the three-way relationship between Ilsa, Rick and Victor.\n4. The plane of factors 7 and 8: subplot of Rick in discovery mode about Ilsa, actively back in Paris, and with Ilsa in the more active, revealing role, now in Casablanca. In the latter revelation, Victor enters decisively into their – Ilsa’s, Rick’s – relationship.\n5. The plane of factors 9 and 10: subplot of Ilsa’s concern for Rick, Ilsa’s concern for Victor, and Rick’s crucial support of Victor.\nOur semantic analysis thus far has been firstly to determine emotional interaction between Ilsa and Rick, which was done through analysis of dialog utterances (subsection 4.2). Then (this subsection 4.3) we determined subplots in the overall narrative."

Hence our interest in the direct interaction of the two characters, Ilsa and Rick.\n• Emotion, that is expression of states of mind of subjects, is formed and evolves against the backdrop of external events and (personal, social, physical) context. Hence we traced out subplots (in subsection 4.3) because they define this context.\nWe now use the full factor, latent semantic embedding space. Hence no reduction in information is at issue, e.g. through a low dimensional semantic approximation. As explained in the appendix, for the 261-dimensional cloud of scenes, and the 11-dimensional cloud of words, the inherent dimensionality of the factor space is maximum 10 (i.e. ≤ min{261− 1, 11− 1})."

      "text" : "Let us use particular words as proxies of strong emotional feeling. We recall that dialog alone is at issue here (no metadata, nor any involvement by other characters), in scenes where Ilsa and Rick were exchanging successive utterances with each other. The word “kiss” was rare in the dialog and therefore not retained for analysis. We used the words “darling” and “love”. Figure 3 indicates that scene 31 is highest in terms of emotional attachment, as indicated by both of the sentiment-bearing words that we used. The last utterance recorded for Ilsa in this scene is: “Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time.” In scene 70, Rick assures Ilsa that he will help Victor Laszlo to escape, and thus there is less of a direct and immediate emotional attachment between the pair in that scene. The dénouement in the very last scene points to close emotional attachment, proxied by the word “love”, as Ilsa and Victor fly away.\nWe see therefore how easy it is to track sentiment or other emotional states, through sentiment-bearing or -expressing terms.\nWe additionally tracked, by scene, the terms “Rick” and “Ilsa” in the dialog. We found these names as used in the dialog to closely track the swings of movement ranging over low values in Figure 3 implying strong emotional attachment (e.g. in scene 31), and swings away from emotional attachment (e.g. in scene 70). We also found the differences, by scene, to be very small between Rick and Ilsa, again using these names from the dialog. We did find differences, with Rick more imposing in scenes 22, 28, less so in 31, 58 and 70 (note that what we found was every second scene, with the exception of the very last), relative to Ilsa who was more imposing in all other scenes. However these differences between Rick and Ilsa were small."

We use a sequence-constrained, or chronological, agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm (see Appendix).\nFurthermore, also a methodological innovation in this work, we endow the correlation set, of each scene with all factors, with this ultrametric topology. Implementation-wise, this means that we use for each scene its set of correlations, i.e. cosines squared between the point and the axis (rather than the set of projections, or coordinates) in the factor space. The reason for doing this\nSequence-constrained hierarchical clustering\nis to focus on relative orientation of the narrative, rather than on the evolving relative position of the narrative.\nIn Figure 4, we look at relatively large caesuras. Consider the partition with five clusters. A horizontal cut of the dendrogram at level 0.95 provides five clusters. The five cluster labels are, for the 11 scenes: 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5. The fourth and ninth scenes, viz. scene 30 and scene 70, are singletons in this partition. There is discontinuity in the evolution of the narrative expressed by these scenes.\nFrom Figure 3, the highlighted boxes refer to the cases of scenes 30 and 70. In Figure 3 these two scenes are a drifting apart of Rick and Ilsa. Such drifting apart is manifested there through somewhat greater distance of the semantic location of the terms “darling” or “love” from the overall semantic location of the scene. These relatively foreceful discontinuities, given by the singleton clusters in the five-cluster partition in Figure 4, are indicative of the changes over scenes 28, 30, 31, and over scenes 59, 70, 75.\nIf we look for the next discontinuity, determined by a partition with six clusters, and the next partition again with seven clusters, we find the crucial scene to be, respectively, 26 (the second in sequence) and 31 (the fifth in sequence). Figure 3 provides an insightful perspective on what is happening to provide an explanation of these discontinuities.\nIn moving from scene 28 to 30, the former here ends with a passionate kiss, and the latter is where Ilsa expresses her concern that Rick should flee Paris\nfor his safety. In moving from scene 30 to 31, and then from 31 to 43, we have scene 31 where Ilsa and Rick are emotionally close, ending on Ilsa asking Rick to kiss her.\nIn moving from scene 59 to 70, the former ends in emotionally proximity, while scene 70 is where Ilsa expresses her concern that Victor Laszlo needs to flee Casablanca for his safety. Then in moving from scene 70 to 75, the latter details the start of the departure by plane of Ilsa and Victor.\nIn the summary of the two parts of Figure 4 that are most at issue in our discussion (namely, the transition between scenes 28, 30, 31, and the transition between scenes 59, 70, 75), we note affection, and non-affection is anxiety or apprehension. In line with other work reviewed in section 2, we can easily label by scene the degree of affection, including emotional attachment, of the pair. This can be accomplished directly from Figure 3."

In this Flaubert work we use the same methods (i) to analyze strong emotional content, (ii) based on dialog and on extensive description provided by the novel, and (iii) we have a three-way interplay of the characters (Emma, Charles and Rodolphe). Because of the greater amount of data used, encompassing the dialog, the emotional “signal” coming from this data is faint. We demonstrate the broad and general applicability of our methodology even with such faint emotional information."

      "text" : "In particular because it was used in modeling mood in an interactive game context, [6], we chose to look at the very emotional interplay between Emma Bovary and Rodolphe Boulanger in Chapters 9, 10, 11 and 12 of Flaubert’s 19th century novel. With the four selected chapters of Madame Bovary, we have an initial task to address in regard to episodization or segmentation. Chafe [7] in relating and establishing mappings between memory and story, or narrative, considered the following units: (i) memory expressed as a “disjointed chunk” of text; (ii) episode, expressed by a paragraph; (iii) thought, expressed by a sentence; and (iv) a focus, expressed by a phrase. For full generality of implementation, we adopted the following approach. Taking the four Madame Bovary chapters, the following preprocessing was carried out: upper case was set to lower case; punctuation was deleted; adjacent characters of length 1 or greater were words; and that furnished 3069 unique words. We chose text units of 20 successive lines, giving rise to 22 successive text segments. This input data is available at address www.narrativization.com.\nTo have sufficient commonality of words, we required 5 occurrences of a word in a text segment, and furthermore at least a combined frequency of 5 presences of the word in all text segments. That resulted in the 22 text segments being cross-tabulated with 358 words. As previously, using frequency of occurrence values for the 22 text segments, crossed by the 358 words, we embedded word profiles, and text segment profiles (“profile” in the sense explained in the Appendix) in a Euclidean, factor, latent semantic space. From the fulldimensionality factor space, a chronological, sequence-respecting, hierarchical clustering was built. High contributing text segments were determined, that were more than 3 times the mean text segment contribution. High contributing words were similarly determined that were more than 6 times (due to the long tailed word frequency distribution) the mean word contribution."

Rodolphe is Emma’s lover, and Charles is Emma’s husband.\nFigure 5 presents an interesting perspective that can be considered relative to the original text. Rodolphe is emotionally scoring over Charles in text segment 1, then again in 3, 4, 5, 6. In text segment 7, Emma is accosted by Captain Binet, giving her qualms of conscience. Charles regains emotional ground with Emma through Emma’s father’s letter in text segment 10, and Emma’s attachment to her daughter, Berthe. Initially the surgery on Hippolyte in text segment 11 draws Emma close to Charles. By text segment 14 Emma is walking out on Charles following the botched surgery. Emma has total disdain for Charles in text segment 15. In text segment 16 Emma is buying gifts for Rodolphe in spite of potentially making Charles indebted. In text segments 17 and 18, Charles’ mother is there, with a difficult mother-in-law relationship for Emma. Plans for running away ensue, with pangs of conscience for Emma, and in the final text segment there is Rodolphe refusing to himself to leave with Emma.\nWe recall that the text segments are somewhat crudely defined by us on the grounds of being easily defined.

      "text" : "We have exemplified our data driven approach to mapping out narrative flow on two case studies. Validation has been with reference to the two extensively analyzed case studies. Simultaneously we have paid attention to procedural aspects including scalability, robustness and efficiency. Our work draws on new understanding of the relationship between subconscious, including emotion, and conscious mental processing, see e.g. [29].\nIn sections 4 and 5, precisely the dialog was used. This directly expressed emotion in the content of the dialog. Our focus was on: (i) the relative continuity and change in the chronology of the narrative; and (ii) major determinants of change. The latter involved affection versus anxiety in the relationship of Ilsa and Rick, in the Casablanca movie.\nIn sections 6 and 7, due to use of text segments, more indirect expression of emotion ensued, for the three characters. So each of the text segments was characterized by Emma’s primary emotional attachment, to lover Rodolphe or to husband Charles.\nThe overall visualization and summary of the evolving narrative is given by the hierarchy. It encapsulates chronology, change and context in the overall multidimensional semantics landscape.\nOur concluding remarks concern deployment and operational use of this approach. This includes its interaction and context aspects. In [23], we used\nthis approach to the mapping out of narrative. We used it (i) for comparative evaluation of proposed literary works, and (ii) for collaborative authoring. The latter is a dynamic, evolving context. We showed how the mapping of narrative leads to product (published books) and client satisfaction (decision making for selection and positioning of book proposals).\nOther potential applications noted in section 2 include gamification, and social behavior analysis and forensics."

      "heading" : "Appendix: Correspondence Analysis and Hierar-",
      "text" : "chical Clustering\nAnalysis Chain\nCorrespondence Analysis, in conjunction with hierarchical clustering, is a data analysis platform to provide access to the semantics of information expressed by the data. The way it does this is (i) by viewing each observation or row vector as the average of all attributes that are related to it; and by viewing each attribute or column vector as the average of all observations that are related to it; and (ii) by taking into account the clustering and dominance relationships given by the hierarchical clustering.\nThe analysis chain comprising semantic mapping and classification is as follows.\n1. The starting point is a matrix that cross-tabulates the dependencies, e.g. frequencies of joint occurrence, of an observations crossed by attributes matrix.\n2. By endowing the cross-tabulation matrix with the χ2 metric on both observation set (rows) and attribute set (columns), we can map observations and attributes into a factor (or latent semantic variable) space, endowed with the Euclidean metric.\n3. Interpretation is through (i) projections of observations, attributes or clusters onto factors; (ii) contributions by observations, attributes or clusters to the inertia of the factors; and (iii) correlations of observations, attributes or clusters with the factors. The factors are ordered by decreasing importance.\n4. A hierarchical clustering is induced on the Euclidean space, the factor space. In this work we use orientations, rather than projections.\nCorrespondence Analysis shares the same underlying geometric bases with Principal Components Analysis. While Principal Components Analysis is particularly suitable for quantitative data, Correspondence Analysis is appropriate for the following types of input data: frequencies, contingency tables, probabilities, categorical data, and mixed qualitative/categorical data.\nSee [26] for discussion of how Latent Semantic Analysis differs from Correspondence Analysis, to begin with in regard to input data preparation for analysis.\nThe factors are defined by a new orthogonal coordinate system endowed with the Euclidean distance. The factors are determined from the eigenvectors of a positive semi-definite matrix (hence with non-negative eigenvalues). This matrix which is diagonalized (i.e. subjected to singular value decomposition) encapsulates the requirement for the new coordinates to successively best fit the given data.\nThe “standardizing” inherent in Correspondence Analysis (a consequence of the χ2 distance) treats rows and columns in a symmetric manner. One byproduct is that the row and column projections in the new space may both be plotted on the same output graphic presentations (the principal factor plane given by the factor 1, factor 2 coordinates; and other pairs of factors).\nFrom Frequencies of Occurrence to Clouds of Profiles, each Profile with an Associated Mass\nFrom the initial frequencies data matrix, a set of probability data, fij , is defined by dividing each value by the grand total of all elements in the matrix. In correspondence analysis, each row (or column) point is considered to have an associated weight. The weight of the ith row point is given by fi = ∑ j fij and\nthe weight of the jth column point is given by fj = ∑\ni fij . We consider the row points to have coordinates fij/fi, for all j, thus allowing points of the same profile to be identical (i.e. superimposed). The ith point – because it is what we analyze – fij/fi, for all j, is viewed as the conditional (empirical) probability of column j given row i; and symmetrically for fij/fj , for all i, the conditional (empirical) probability of row i given column j.\nThe following weighted Euclidean distance, the χ2 distance, is then used between row points:\nd2(i, k) = ∑ j 1 fj ( fij fi − fkj fk )2 (1)\nand an analogous distance is used between column points. The mean row point is given by the weighted average of all row points:∑\ni fi fij fi\n= fj for j = 1, 2, . . . , p. Similarly the mean column profile has ith coordinate fi.\nInput: Cloud of Points Endowed with the Chi Squared Metric\nThe cloud of points consists of the couples: (multidimensional) profile coordinate and (scalar) mass. The cloud of row points, NI , is the set of all 1 ≤ i ≤ n couples ({fij/fi|j = 1, 2, . . . p}, fi). The cloud of column points, NJ , is the set of all 1 ≤ j ≤ p couples ({fij/fj |i = 1, 2, . . . n}, fj). The vectors are real-valued, so {fij/fi|j = 1, 2, . . . p} ∈ Rp and {fij/fj |i = 1, 2, . . . n} ∈ Rn.\nThe overall inertia about the origin of cloud NI is:\nM2(NI) = ∑ i fi ∑ j 1 fj ( fij fi − fj )2\n= ∑ i,j fi fj ( fij − fifj fi )2 = ∑ i,j (fij − fifj)2 fifj\nNote how this uses the χ2 distance, defined above, and how the inertia is formally similar to the χ2 statistic of independence of observed fij values relative to the model, fifj , that is the product of the marginal probabilities.\nSimilarly we have the overall inertia about the origin of cloud NJ :\nM2(NJ) = ∑ j fj ∑ i 1 fi ( fij fj − fi )2\n= ∑ i,j fj fi ( fij − fifj fj )2 = ∑ i,j (fij − fifj)2 fifj\nWe have that the inertia of the row cloud, NI , is identical to the inertia of the column cloud, NJ .\nDecomposing the moment of inertia of the cloud NI , or of NJ since both analyses are inherently and integrally related, furnishes the principal axes of inertia, defined from a singular value decomposition.\nOutput: Cloud of Points Endowed with the Euclidean Metric in Factor Space\nThe χ2 distance between rows i and k, d2(i, k), has been defined in equation 1. In the factor space this pairwise distance is identical. The coordinate system and the metric change. For factors indexed by s and for total dimensionality S, we have S ≤ min {n − 1, p − 1} (there are n rows and p columns); the subtraction of 1 is since the χ2 distance is centered and hence there is a linear dependency which reduces the inherent dimensionality by 1); and denoting the projection of row i on the sth factor, Fs, as Fs(i), we have:\nd2(i, k) = S∑ s=1 (Fs(i)− Fs(k))2 (2)\nThe factors are ordered by decreasing moments of inertia. The moments of inertia associated with the factors, identically in the space of rows and of columns, are given by the eigenvalues associated with the decomposition of the inertia, arrived at through a singular value decomposition.\nIn addition to projections on the factorial axes, for point i, Fs(i), and for point j, Gs(j), we also have the following that are important for interpretation of results.\nWe have contributions: fiF 2 s (i) is the absolute contribution of point i to the moment of inertia λs, associated with factor s. Contributions are what determine the factors or axes.\nWe have also correlations. The correlation of a point with a factor is the cosine squared of that point/vector with the factor/axis. cos2 a = F 2s (i)/ ∑S s=1 F 2 s (i) is the relative contribution of the factor s to point i. The correlation is said to be the extent to which point i illustrates (or exemplifies) the factor.\nRelations for column points, j, and factors Gs(j), hold symmetrically.\nAnalysis of the Dual Spaces, Transition Formulas, and Supplementary Elements\nThe factors in the two spaces, of rows/observations and of columns/attributes, are inherently related as follows:\nFs(i) = λ − 12 s p∑ j=1 fij fi Gs(j) for s = 1, . . . , S; i = 1, . . . , n\nGs(j) = λ − 12 s n∑ i=1 fij fj Fs(i) for s = 1, . . . , S; j = 1, . . . , p (3)\nThese are termed the transition formulas. The coordinate of element i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, is the barycenter (center of gravity) of the coordinates of the elements j, 1 ≤ j ≤ p, with associated masses of value given by the coordinates of fij/fi of the profile of i. This is all to within the λ − 12 s constant.\nTypically we consider normalized factors, φs(i) = λ − 12 s Fs(i), and similarly\nψs(j) = λ − 12 s Gs(j).\nIn the output display, the barycentric principle comes into play: this allows us to simultaneously view and interpret observations and attributes.\nQualitatively different elements (i.e. row or column profiles), or ancillary characterization or descriptive elements may be placed as supplementary elements. This means that they are given zero mass in the analysis, and their projections are determined using the transition formulas. This amounts to carrying out a Correspondence Analysis first, without these elements, and then projecting them into the factor space following the determination of all properties of this space.\nIf rj is the jth element of a supplementary row, with mass r, then this profile is rj/r for all j. In the same way as we find the projections on the factors of the original (or main) row profiles, we do so for the supplementary row profile.\nA similar formula holds for supplementary columns. Such supplementary elements are therefore “passive” and are incorporated into the Correspondence Analysis results subsequent to the eigen-analysis being carried out.\nSequence-Constrained Hierarchical Clustering\nWe seek a hierarchical clustering that takes into account the observation sequence, i.e. observation i precedes observation i′ for all i, i′ ∈ I. We use the linear order on the observations. Let us switch to the term texts now, which is what our observations refer to in this work. We refer to “adjacent” texts when one follows the other with respect to this linear order, and this definition of adjacency is extended to allow for adjacent clusters of texts.\nThe agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm is as follows.\n1. Consider each text in the sequence of texts as constituting a singleton cluster. Determine the closest pair of adjacent texts, and define a cluster from them.\n2. Determine and merge the closest pair of adjacent clusters, c1 and c2, where closeness is defined by d(c1, c2) = max {dii′ such that i ∈ c1, i′ ∈ c2}.\n3. Repeat step 2 until only one cluster remains.\nHere we use a complete link criterion which additionally takes account of the adjacency constraint imposed by the sequence of texts in set I. It can be shown (see [16]) that the closeness value, given by d, at each agglomerative step is strictly non-decreasing. That is, if cluster c3 is formed earlier in the series of agglomerations compared to cluster c4, then the corresponding distances will satisfy dc3 ≤ dc4. (d here is as determined in step 2 of the algorithm above.)"
