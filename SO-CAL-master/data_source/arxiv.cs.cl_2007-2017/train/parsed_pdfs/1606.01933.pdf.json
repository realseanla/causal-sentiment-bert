      "text" : "Natural language inference (NLI) refers to the problem of determining entailment and contradiction relationships between a premise and a hypothesis. NLI is a central problem in language understanding (Katz, 1972; Bos and Markert, 2005; Benthem, 2008; MacCartney and Manning, 2009) and recently the large SNLI corpus of 570K sentence pairs was created for this task (Bowman et al., 2015). We present a new model for NLI and leverage this corpus for comparison with prior work.\nA large body of work based on neural networks for text similarity tasks including NLI have been published in recent years (Hu et al., 2014; Rocktäschel et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2015; Yin et al., 2016, inter alia). The dominating trend in these models is to build complex, deep text representation models, for example, with convolutional networks (LeCun et al., 1990, CNNs henceforth) or long short-term memory networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997,\nLSTMs henceforth) with the goal of deeper sentence comprehension. While these approaches have yielded impressive results, they are often computationally very expensive, and result in models having millions of parameters (excluding embeddings).\nHere, we take a different approach, arguing that in many cases natural language inference does not require deep modeling of sentence structure. Mere comparison of local text substructure followed by aggregation of this information may work equally well for making global inferences. For example, consider the following sentences:\n• Bob is in his room, but because of the thunder and lightning outside, he cannot sleep.\n• Bob is awake. • It is sunny outside.\nThe first sentence is complex in structure and it is challenging to construct a compact representation that expresses its entire meaning. However, it is fairly easy to conclude that the second sentence follows from the first one, by simply aligning Bob with Bob and cannot sleep with awake and recognizing that these are synonyms. Similarly, one can conclude that It is sunny outside contradicts the first sentence, by aligning thunder and lightning with sunny and recognizing that these are most likely incompatible.\nWe leverage this intuition to build a simpler and more lightweight approach to NLI within a neural framework that with considerably fewer parameters outperforms more complex existing neural architectures. In contrast to existing approaches, our approach only relies on alignment and is fully computationally decomposable with respect to the input text.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n01 93\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nJ un\n2 01\nH ( )+ +…+=ŷ\nin the\npark alice plays\nso m\neo ne\npl ay\nin g\nm us\nic\nou ts\nid e\nflute a solo G ( , )\nG ( , )\npark outside\nalice someone\nflute+ solo music\n…\nG ( , )=\n=\n= flute music F ( , )\nFigure 1: Pictoral overview of the approach, showing the Attend (left), Compare (center) and Aggregate (right) steps.\nAn overview of our approach is given in Figure 1. Given two sentences, where each word is represented by an embedding vector, we first create a soft alignment matrix using neural attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015). We then use the (soft) alignment to decompose the task into subproblems that can are solved separately. Finally, the results of these subproblems are merged to produce the final classification. In addition, we optionally apply intra-sentence attention (Cheng et al., 2016) to endow the model with a richer encoding of substructures prior to the alignment step.\nAsymptotically our approach does the same total work as a vanilla LSTM encoder, while being trivially parallelizable across sentence length, which can allow for considerable speedups in low-latency settings. Empirical results on the SNLI corpus show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, while using almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters compared to complex LSTM-based approaches."

      "text" : "Our method is motivated by the central role played by alignment in machine translation (Koehn, 2009) and previous approaches to sentence similarity modeling (Haghighi et al., 2005; Das and Smith, 2009; Chang et al., 2010; Fader et al., 2013). The neural counterpart to alignment, attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015), which is a key part of our approach, was originally proposed and has been predominantly used in conjunction with LSTMs (Rocktäschel et al., 2016; Wang and Jiang, 2015) and to a lesser extent with CNNs (Yin et al., 2016). In contrast, our use of attention is purely based on word embeddings and our method essentially consists of feed-forward networks that operate largely independently of word order."

We assume that each ai, bj ∈ Rd is a word embedding vector of dimension d and that each sentence is prepended with a “NULL” token. Our training data comes in the form of labeled pairs {a(n),b(n),y(n)}Nn=1, where y(n) = (y\n(n) 1 , . . . , y (n) C ) is an indicator vector encoding the label and C is the number of output classes. At test time, we receive a pair of sentences (a,b) and our goal is to predict the correct label y.\nInput representation. Let ā = (ā1, . . . , ā`a) and b̄ = (b̄1, . . . , b̄`b) denote the input representation of each fragment that is fed to subsequent steps of the algorithm. The vanilla version of our model simply defines ā := a and b̄ := b. With this input representation, our model does not make use of word order. However, we discuss an extension using intrasentence attention in Section 3.4 that uses a minimal amount of sequence information.\nThe core model consists of the following three components (see Figure 1), which are trained jointly:\nAttend. First, soft-align the elements of ā and b̄ using a variant of neural attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and decompose the problem into the comparison of aligned subphrases.\nCompare. Second, separately compare each aligned subphrase to produce a set of vectors {v1,i}`ai=1 for a and {v2,j} `b j=1 for b. Each v1,i is a nonlinear combination of ai and its (softly) aligned subphrase in b (and analogously for v2,i).\nAggregate. Finally, aggregate the sets {v1,i}`ai=1 and {v2,j}`bj=1 from the previous step and use the result to predict the label ŷ."

      "heading" : "4 Computational Complexity",
      "text" : "We now discuss the asymptotic complexity of our approach and how it offers a higher degree of parallelism than LSTM-based approaches. Recall that d denotes embedding dimension and ` means sentence length. For simplicity we assume that all hidden dimensions are d and that the complexity of matrix(d× d)-vector(d× 1) multiplication is O(d2).\nA key assumption of our analysis is that ` < d, which we believe is reasonable and is true of the SNLI dataset (Bowman et al., 2015) where ` < 80, whereas recent LSTM-based approaches have used d ≥ 300. This assumption allows us to bound the complexity of computing the `2 attention weights.\nComplexity of LSTMs. An LSTM cell is O(d2), resulting in a complexity of O(`d2) to encode the sentence. Adding attention as in Rocktäschel et al. (2016) increases this complexity to O(`d2 + `2d).\nComplexity of our Approach. Application of a feed-forward network requires O(d2) steps. Thus, the Compare and Aggregate steps have complexity O(`d2) and O(d2) respectively. For the Attend step, F is evaluated O(`) times, giving a complexity of\nO(`d2). Each attention weight eij requires one dot product, resulting in a complexity of O(`2d).\nThus the total complexity of the model is O(`d2 + `2d), which is equal to that of an LSTM with attention. However, note that with the assumption that ` < d, this becomes O(`d2) which is the same complexity as a regular LSTM. Moreover, unlike the LSTM, our approach has the advantage of being parallelizable over `, which can be useful at test time."

      "heading" : "5 Experiments",
      "text" : "We evaluate our approach on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset (Bowman et al., 2015). Given a sentences pair (a,b), the task is to predict whether b is entailed by a, b contradicts a, or whether their relationship is neutral. Following Bowman et al. (2015), we remove examples labeled “–” (no gold label) from the dataset, which leaves 549,367 pairs for training, 9,842 for development, and 9,824 for testing. We use the tokenized sentences provided in the dataset as input to our method.\nWe use 300 dimensional GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014) to represent words, projected down to 200 dimensions, a number determined via hyperparameter tuning. OOV words are hashed to one of 100 random embeddings. All embeddings remain fixed during training, but the projection matrix is trained. We additionally tuned the following hyperparameters: network size (2-layers, each with 200 neurons), batch size (4), dropout ratio (0.2) and learning rate (0.05–vanilla, 0.025–intra-attention), with optimal values in parentheses. The method was im-\nplemented in TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015). Each hyperparameter setting was run on a single machine with 10 asynchronous gradient-update threads, using Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) for optimization.\nResults in terms of 3-class accuracy are shown in Table 1. Our approach, which ignores word order, achieves state-of-the-art results with almost an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the LSTMN of Cheng et al. (2016). Adding intra-sentence attention gives a considerable improvement of 0.5 percentage points over the existing state of the art. Table 2 gives a breakdown of accuracy on the development set showing that most of our gains stem from neutral, while most losses come from contradiction pairs."
