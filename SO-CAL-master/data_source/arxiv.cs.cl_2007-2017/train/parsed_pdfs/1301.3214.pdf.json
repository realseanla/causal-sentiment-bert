      "text" : "Sentiment analysis predicts the presence of a positive or negative emotion y in a text document x. Despite its successes in industry, sentiment analysis is limited as it flattens the structure of human emotions into a single dimension. An alternative that has attracted a few researchers in recent years is to construct a finite collection of emotions and fit a predictive model for each emotion (see for example [1]). There are several significant difficulties with the above approach. First, it is hard to capture a complex statistical relationship between a large number of binary variables (representing emotions) and a high dimensional vector (representing the document). It is also hard to imagine a reliable procedure for compiling a finite list of all possible human emotions. Finally, it is not clear how to use documents expressing a certain emotion.Using labeled documents only in fitting models predicting their denoted labels ignores the relationship among emotions, and is problematic for emotions with only a few annotated.\nWe propose an alternative approach that models a stochastic relationship between the document X , an emotion label Y (such as sleepy or happy), and a position on the mood manifold Z . We assume that all the emotional aspects in the documents are captured by the manifold, implying that the emotion label Y can be inferred directly from the projection Z of the document on the manifold, without needing to consult the document again."

      "text" : "We make the following four modeling assumptions concerning the document X , the discrete emotion label Y ∈ {1, 2, . . . , C}, and the position on the continuous mood manifold Z ∈ Rl.\n1. We have the graphical structure: X → Z → Y , implying that the emotion label Y ∈ {1, . . . , C} is independent of the document X given Z .\n2. The distribution of Z ∈ Rl given a specific emotion label Y = y is Gaussian: {Z|Y = y} ∼ N (µy ,Σy)\n3. The distribution of Z given the document X (typically in a bag of words or n-gram representation) is a linear regression model: {Z|X = x} ∼ N (θ⊤x,Σx).\n4. The distances between the vectors in {E(Z|Y = y) : y ∈ C} are similar to the corresponding distances in {E(X |Y = y) : y ∈ C}.\nWe make the following observations. First, the first assumption implies that the emotion label Y is simply a discretization of the continuous Z . It is consistent with well known research in psychology (see Section 2) and with random projection theory, which state that it is often possible to approximate high dimensional data by projecting it on a low dimensional continuous space. Second, while X , Y are high dimensional and discrete, Z is low dimensional and continuous. This, together with the conditional independence in assumption 1 above, implies a higher degree of accuracy than modeling directly X → Y . Intuitively, the number of parameters is on the order of dim(X) + dim(Y ) as opposed to dim(X)dim(Y ). Third, the Gaussian models in assumptions 2 and 3 are simple, and lead to efficient computational procedures. We also found them to work well in our experiments. The model may be easily adapted, however, to more complex models such as mixture of Gaussians or non-linear regression models (for example, we experimented with quadratic regression models). Fourth, assumption 4 suggests that we can estimate E(Z|Y = y) for all y ∈ C via multidimensional scaling. MDS finds low dimensional coordinates for a set of points that approximates the spatial relationship between the points in the original high dimensional space. Lastly, the models in assumptions 2 and 3 are statistical and can be estimated from data using maximum likelihood.\nMotivated by the fourth modeling assumption, we determine the parameters µy = E(Z|Y = y), y ∈ C by running multidimensional scaling (MDS) or Kernel PCA on the empirical versions of {E(X |Y = y) : y ∈ C}.\nWe estimate the parameter θ, defining the regression X → Z , by maximizing the likelihood which requires integrating over Z ∈ Rl, a computationally difficult task when l is not very low. We make use of approximating the Gaussian pdf with Dirac’s delta function on p(z),\nθ̂ ≈ argmax θ\n∑\ni\nlog p(y(i))pθ(z (i)∗|x(i)) ∑\ny p(z (i)∗|y)p(y)\n= argmax θ\n∑\ni\nlog pθ(z (i)∗|x(i)) (1)\nwhere z(i) ∗ = argmaxz p(z|y (i)) = E(Z|y(i)), which is equivalent to a least squares regression.\nOne interpretation of our model X → Z → Y is that Z forms a sufficient statistic of X for Y . We can thus consider adapting a wide variety of predictive models (for example, logistic regression or SVM) on Z 7→ Y . These discriminative classifiers are trained on {(Ẑ(i), Y (i)), i = 1, . . . , n}."

      "text" : "We used crawled Livejournal1 data as the main dataset. About 20% of the blog posts feature these optional annotations in the form of emoticons. The annotations may be chosen from a pre-defined list of possible emotions, or a novel emotion specified by the author. We crawled 15,910,060 doc-\n1http://www.livejournal.com\numents and selected 1,346,937 documents featuring the most popular 32 emotion labels (in respect to the number of documents annotated in).\nIn Figure 1, we compare our model to Watson and Tellegen’s well known psychological model. We make the following observations. First, the horizontal axis expresses a sentiment polarity-like emotion. The left part features emotions such as accomplished, happy and excited, while the right part features emotions such as sad and depressed. This is in agreement with Watson and Tellegen’s observations. Second, the vertical axis expresses the level of mental engagement or energy level. The top part features emotions such as exhausted or tired, while the bottom part features emotions such as curious or excited. This agrees partially with the engagement dimension in the psychological model. Third, the neutral moods blank, stay in the middle of the picture. This agreement between our mood manifold and the psychological findings is remarkable in light of the fact that the two models used completely different experimental methodology (blog data vs. surveys).\nWe performed emotion classification experiment (Table 1, left) on the Livejournal data. We considered the goal of predicting the most popular 32 moods. We also considered a binary classification tasks obtained by partitioning the set of moods into two clusters.\nTable 1 compare classification results using the original bag of words feature space and the manifold model, using different types of classification methods: LDA, QDA with different covariance matrix models, and logistic regression. Bold faces are improvements over the baseline with statistical significance of t-test of random trials. Most of experimental results show that the mood manifold model results in statistically significant improvements than using original bag of words feature."

      "text" : "In this paper, we introduced a continuous representation for human emotions Z and constructed a statistical model connecting it to documents X and to a discrete set of emotions Y . Our fitted model bears close similarities to models developed in the psychological literature, based on human survey data. Several attempts were recently made at inferring insights from social media or news data through sentiment prediction. It is likely that the current multivariate view of emotions will help make progress on these important and challenging tasks."
