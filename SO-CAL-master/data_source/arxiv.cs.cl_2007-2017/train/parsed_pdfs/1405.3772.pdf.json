      "text" : "Introduction\nInstructions nautiques is the name of a nautical book series [5] published by the French Marine Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOM). They are the French counterpart of the United States Coast Pilot [3], published by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Office of Coast Survey, and of the British Admiralty Sailing Directions [7] published by the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office.\nThese publications aim to supplement charts (both paper ones and ENCs = Electronic Nautical Charts), in the sense that they provide the mariner with supplemental information not in the chart.\nInformation for the Instructions nautiques is provided by survey vessels, port officers, maritime officers and mariners in general. In some cases, it may require immediate update, for example to notify a shipwreck or some important change of the navigation conditions.\nThe SHOM is building a knowledge base that will cover both ENCs and nautical instructions. This knowledge base will communicate with ENCs and navigation equipment and, since updates can be frequent, the Instructions nautiques will have to be generated on-the-fly by the knowledge base.\nTo summarize, we have two constraints:\n1. the information contained in the knowledge base, has to be easily updatable by people not necessarily proficient in the ontology formalism;\n‹ The final publication is available at http://link.springer.com.\nar X\niv :1\n40 5.\n37 72\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n1 5\n2. the Instructions nautiques, or at least part of them, have to be automatically generated out of the knowledge base.\nTo fulfill constraint 1, we have built INAUT, a controlled language based on French natural language, and dedicated to the population and update of the SHOM knowledge base. Contraint 2 is fulfilled by generation of texts in INAUT out of the knowledge base. In fact, the texts generated will be in a more “literary” and concise version of the language, called LitINAUT (= Literary INAUT, §4) that will bring them closer to legacy human author production.\nTo our knowledge, INAUT is the first maritime CNL1\nIn the following, we present our model of the Instructions nautiques (§1), the SHOM knowledge base (§3), the controlled language (§3) and its generation (§4), the main operations (interaction with ENCs (§5) and collaborative updates of the knowledge base (§6)) as well as future extensions and open problems (§7).\n1 Modelling the Instructions nautiques\nWe model the Instructions nautiques as a set of three graphs pS,G,Kq: the hierarchical structure of the document S, the geographic areas graph G and the SHOM knowledge base K (see §3). Between these graphs we have two functions: g which maps some nodes of S and of K (those that are goereferenced) to nodes of G, and κ that maps leaf nodes of S to subgraphs of K. Furthermore, we have a set T of titles of hierarchical subdivisions, a set A of geopolygons, and functions τ and α mapping nodes of S (resp. G) to T (resp. A). Finally, there is a set M of functions tµu defined both as T Ñ T and as A Ñ A, called modifiers. Here are the details:\n– graph S represents the hierarchical structure of a given volume. S is rooted, oriented and ordered. Let V pSq be the vertices and EpSq the edges of S; – the five first levels of V pSq represent hierarchical subdivisions. Let us denote ` the level function. The root n0 represents the entire document; – function τ : V pSq Ñ T maps every node n to a title τpnq, – V pSq can be written as2 V pSq “ VG\\V G (VG are the georeferenced nodes)\nwhere we have a function g : VG Ñ G that maps every georeferenced node to a node in G, which again is mapped to a geopolygon in A by α; – when generating a volume of the Instruction nautiques, the leafs of S are mapped to subgraphs of K through function κ. These subgraphs are then converted to text paragraphs in LitINAUT language; – edges EpGq of G represent partial inclusion 9Ă in A, in the sense that we have G1G P EpGq (or apG1q 9ĂapGq) if and only if AreapapG1q X apGqq ą 0.8 AreapapG1qq;\n1 With the exception of Seaspeak [6], a CNL defined in 1985 by the International Maritime Lecturers Association. In 2001 it evolved into SMCP (Standard Marine Communication Phrases [2]) which is still used today. These CNLs, dedicated to oral communication between ships, are “human-only”. 2 We denote by \\ the disjoint union: C “ A\\B ðñ pC “ AYBq ^ pAXB “ Hq.\nOn Fig. 2 the reader can see an example of Instructions nautiques data in our model: on the left, the document structure tree, on the right, the geographical area graph. The gray box contains the LitINAUT text generated from section Généralités of §2.2.4. In the text, geographical entities are marked up by brackets. Dashed arrows between the two graphs represent function g."

Hence we have σ : RS Ñ Cˆ C and ι : RS Ñ 2IˆI; 4. complex relations are relations between n instances (n ě 2) which can also\nhave relation attributes. Hence we have: σ : RC Ñ Śn C ˆ Śm\nT (where Śn\ndenotes n-fold product) and ι : RÑ 2 Śn Iˆ Śm V, with n ě 2, m ě 0;\n5. an noteworthy difference between complex relations and simple relations, is lexicalization. Indeed, we have: λ : C Ñ LC, λ : I Ñ LI, λ : A Ñ LA, λ : RS Ñ LRS as expected, but λ : RC Ñ LRC ˆ Śn LRS ˆ Śm LA, i.e., a\nrelation has its own name, but requires also names for all instances involved in the relation as well as all relation attributes.\nThe concepts C of the SHOM knowledge base K, belong to the domain of maritime navigation: ports, capes, sea currents, ships, etc.\nAs for S nodes, instances I are of two types I “ IG \\ I G: IG are georeferenced entities: “[baie de Banyuls]”, “[cap d’Osne]”, etc., in the sense that there is a map g between I and the graph G; I G are non-georeferenced instances, such as “agglomération”, “port,” etc. They don’t need to be located on the map, and their purpose is purely descriptive of the environment.\nNotice that the names of IG instances often contain a hint to the predominant concept to which they belong (“baie”, “cap”, “port”, etc.), while in the case of I G instances, their names are often names of predominant concepts per se.\nSimple relations RS represent verbs in passive or active voice “est abrité par”, “est possible”, etc. Notice that most relations representing a passive verb have a symmetric relation representing the corresponding active verb: “A est abrité par B” has the symmetric relation “B abrite A”;\nLitINAUT: La [baie de Banyuls] est limitée au NW par le [cap d’Osne] et à l’Est par l’[île Grosse] rattachée à la côte par un terre-plein. Elle est divisée en deux parties par l’[île Petite] reliée au rivage par un terre-plein : à l’Ouest l’[anse de la Ville] bordée par une plage dominée par l’agglomération et à l’Est l’[anse de Fontaulé] qui abrite le port.

L’[anse de Fontaulé] abrite le port.\nComplex relations are n-ary (n ě 2) and can have attributes: for example “est limité par” has attribute “direction.” In this case, lexicalization requires names for all instances or attributes participating in the relation. In the case of “est limité par” the members of the relation are instances “limitant”, “limité” and attribute “à.”\nAs an example, the reader can see on Fig. 3 the sentence of Fig. 2, represented in LitINAUT, INAUT and as a subgraph of K. Instances “[baie de Banyuls]”, “[cap d’Osne]”, etc. belong to IG. Instances “côte”, “plage”, “port”, “rivage”, belong to I G. Complex relations are reified as nodes. Attributes of instances have been included underneath, marked by character @."

      "heading" : "3 The controlled languages INAUT and LitINAUT",
      "text" : "INAUT is a controlled language with a rather large vocabulary (based on the existing Instructions nautiques corpus) but with a simple syntax, given by the following grammar:\nS Ñ NP VP NP Ñ modif det NN | det NN | NN NN Ñ adj NN | NN adj noun VP Ñ verb NP | verb NP PP PP Ñ prep det NN | prep NN\nwhere symbols in small caps are terminal, all nouns belong to LI (the set of lexical references for instances of K) and to V (the set of values of attributes of K), all verbs belong to LRS YLRC , all adjectives belong to V, and modifiers, determinants and prepositions belong to a closed list.\nThe verb, always in 3rd person or in the infinitive, can be active or passive. In most cases it is possible to change the voice of the verb, which implies a permutation of the NPs in subject and object position, leaving the PPs intact:\nLa [baie de Banyuls] est limitée par le [cap d’Osne] au NW. Le [cap d’Osne] limite la [baie de Banyuls] au NW.\nDefinite articles are used for all instances in G the names of which start with the name of a concept to which belongs the instance: for example, the name “baie de Banyuls” starts with “baie” (= bay) which is the name of a concept in C, hence in INAUT the definite article is used: “la [baie de Banyuls]”.\nOtherwise, no article is used:\n[Notre-Dame de la Salette] est un amer remarquable à l’WSW du port.\nInstances in I G are, by default, used with definite articles. When an indefinite article is required, the information is stored in a dedicated attribute. Indefinite articles are used in object position only:\nL’[anse de la Ville] est bordée par une plage. La plage est dominée par l’agglomération.\nModifiers are represented by (a closed set of) expressions outside the brackets of the geographic entity: in “au fond de l’[anse de la Ville]”, we have modifier “au fond de” and entity “[anse de la Ville].” In K there is a modifier relation whenever a modifier is used. This relation does not produce INAUT text but serves to connect subgraphs in K during content determination (§4).\nIn the following sections we will discuss the three main operations of controlled languages INAUT and LitINAUT: generation (§ 4), interaction with ENCs (§ 5), collaborative updates of the knowledge base (§ 6)."

      "heading" : "4 Controlled language generation",
      "text" : "One of the design goals of our system is to be able to produce automatically a large part of the Instructions nautiques, so that after collaborative updates new versions of the entire document can automatically be produced.\nWe have divided the task into two stages: (1) produce INAUT text corresponding to a given leaf node of S; (2) convert INAUT language into LitINAUT.\nSuppose given a leaf node S of S. Producing the corresponding INAUT text is typically a Natural Language Generation problem.\nReiter & Dale [4, § 3.3] divide the language generation task into seven subtasks: content determination, document structuring, lexicalisation, aggregation, referring expression generation, linguistic realisation and structure realisation.\nContent determination. Using Algorithm 1, we find the subgraph K of K which is geographically the most relevant to S. We apply tags to its connected components using a rule-based decision system: for example, when a connected component contains the instance “mouillage” then it is tagged as belonging to a leaf node of type “Mouillages.” If after applying the rules no tag has been affected, then the component belongs to a leaf node of default type “Généralités.”\nInput: S,G,K and a leaf node S P S Result: The subgraph K Ă K which represents the text corresponding to S GS Ð gpSq; K Ð H; for G P G do\nif G 9ĂGS and g´1pGq P IG then K Ð K Y g´1pGq;\nend end for k P K do\nif Dk1 such that kk1 P UndirectedpKq and kk1 R K then if k1 P I G or k1 P V or pk1 P IG and gpk1q 9ĂGSq then\nK Ð K Y kk1; end if k1 P RC and Dk2 member of k1 such that gpk2q 9ĂGS then\nK Ð K Y kk1; for m member of k1 do\nK Ð K Y k1m; end\nend end\nend\nAlgorithm 1: Content determination algorithm.\nDocument structuring. This is the most difficult phase since it deals with the order in which sentences are written. Let K bet the subgraph of K to be converted into INAUT.\nWe subdivide the task in four subtasks:\n1. sort connected components Ki of K; 2. for each component find a starting node s; 3. find the order in which the relations of each component will be converted\ninto INAUT, starting from s; 4. convert relations into INAUT in the order given by 1 and 3.\nFor subtask 1, we will sort components. The sorting criteria are: (a) if there is a significant difference in size between the cumulated geographic areas of two components, the larger one will precede the smaller one, (b) otherwise, calculate the barycenters of cumulated geographic areas of components; the path defined by their barycenters should be roughly parallel to the guiding path of the volume. For example, on Fig. 2 the areas of nodes §2.2.1–§2.2.5 follow a SE to NW direction, this direction can be chosen for the order of connected components.\nTo accomplish steps 2 and 3 we define weights w on nodes and relations. Calculation of these weights is based on criteria we will describe below, as well as on training using machine learning algorithms on the existing Instructions nautiques corpus.\nNotice that we use undirected graphs since every edge can be inverted by changing voice.\nThe first and most obvious criterion is the relation between nodes in Ki and the parent of the leaf node of S that established the connection with K (i.e., κ´1pKq). If among the nodes there is one whose geographic area and/or name\nmatches as closely as possible the one of the parent of the leaf node, it is a good choice. For example, in our case, node §2.2.4 of S is “Port de Banyuls-sur-Mer” which is much closer to “baie de Banyuls” than to “cap d’Osne”, both in terms of geographic area than simply of string comparison of names.\nThe second criterion for choosing the starting node is its position in the G lattice. Let km “ g´1pmaxG gpKiqq. If km P Ki then it is an obvious choice. Otherwise we take local maxima in G and proceed with weighting.\nFinally, another criterion is of semantic nature, the one of “interest” for the navigator: an order can be established between concepts to which instances of Ki belong, for example a port instance will be more interesting than a beach instance. This weight is inherited by neighboring nodes: for instance, a bay containing a port is more interesting than a bay containing a beach, etc.\nThe “semantic weight” of instances can be calculated by machine learning. Once the starting point has been established, we proceed to subtask 3. We will use a variant of DFS (depth-first search) to search Ki. Subtask 4 is the simplest one: from relations in K we build INAUT sentences, by applying rules, for example choosing the verb’s voice according to the direction of the search in Ki, adding articles matching nouns, etc. There still remains a difficulty: finding the right order of prepositional phrases, as in:"

      "text" : "When the difference may be purely stylistic (as above), the order can be obtained by machine learning. In other cases, such as in “est divisé par” of Fig. 2, it is mandatory to group some relations: the text representing “ài” must immediately follow the one representing “diviseuri” since indices disappear in the textual realization and only proximity allows to distinguish the divisors of the entity.\nAnother important phenomenon is text added by default: for example, to realize relation “est divisé par” we need to add the number of divisors, this is done by counting the members of the relation of type “diviseur” and generate “en deux parties” (= in two parts).\nAggregation and referring expressions generation: LitINAUT language. At this stage, generation of INAUT has been completed. The result, as it can be seen in Fig. 3, is not very eloquent, but remains closely related to the structure of K, so that it is easier for contributors to supply modifications and additions written in INAUT. To produce a human readable text as part of automatically generated Instructions nautiques document, we need two extra steps: aggregation of several sentences into a single one, and generation or referring expressions. The result of these two operations is called LitINAUT language.\nBy the fact of using DFS to search Ki, often the object of a sentence is the subject of the following one. Aggregation merges them into a single sentence:\nL’[anse de la Ville] est bordée par une plage."

      "text" : "As said in the introduction, Instructions nautiques are defined as a complement to charts, and, in particular, to ENCs. Therefore it is important to define interactions between K and ENCs, via INAUT. By specifying, for example, an area of interest on an ENC (for example, by drawing a zone on a touchscreen) the user may receive LitINAUT text in return. Generating this text automatically has the advantage of being (a) limited to the zone of interest given by the user; (b) conform to local conditions, for example time of the day (some relations or attributes in K may be time-dependent) or meteorological conditions, or parameters of the user’s vessel (size, tonnage, etc.); (c) up-to-date, since other users may constantly provide new information.\nTo provide adaptive LitINAUT text, we first position the area U given by the user in A, and hence in G. Knowing the subgraph of G that matches as closely as possible U in A, we find the relevant nodes in K by going through g´1. These nodes form a subgraph of K and we apply the techniques described in 4 to generate the corresponding text in LitINAUT.\nAdditional structure can be added to the text sent to the ENC device, so that the user can filter the text and display only specific types of information, as for example information on mooring, landing, etc."

To achieve this goal, INAUT will be used as a tool for collaborative update.\nIndeed, INAUT has been designed as the optimal compromise between easiness of use (since contributors have a priori no KM proficiency) and formality (as the knowledge base will be fed directly by the incoming data).\nTo make the system more robust, we validate on two levels. First, the lexical and syntactic level: a Web interface analyzes segments written in INAUT and validates them. In case of errors it provides correction hints. Second, the semantic level: a human controller monitors incoming INAUT data which, depending on the contributors trust level are automatically fed into the knowledge base (with the possibility of making the modification retroactive) or are stored in a waiting list until manual validation."

This requires extension of INAUT to interrogative sentences and increased use of the concept hierarchy. Another extension deals with the issue of dangerosity. Indeed, one of goals of Instructions nautiques is to alert the navigator on possible dangers. Ideally, the ENC should automatically send queries about dangerosity to the knowledge base involving the current position of the vessel and various external conditions, and in case of a positive answer, alert the navigator by all means possible. Special NLG techniques can then be used, since the communicative goal will not be simply to inform, but to alert."
