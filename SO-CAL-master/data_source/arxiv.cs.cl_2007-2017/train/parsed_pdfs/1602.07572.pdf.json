In this paper, we introduce DENSIFIER, a method that learns an orthogonal transformation of the embedding space that focuses the information relevant for a task in an ultradense subspace of a dimensionality that is smaller by a factor of 100 than the original space. We show that ultradense embeddings generated by DENSIFIER reach state of the art on a lexicon creation task in which words are annotated with three types of lexical information – sentiment, concreteness and frequency. On the SemEval2015 10B sentiment analysis task we show that no information is lost when the ultradense subspace is used, but training is an order of magnitude more efficient due to the compactness of the ultradense space."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Embeddings are useful for many tasks, including word similarity (e.g., Pennington et al. (2014a)), named entity recognition (NER) (e.g., Collobert et al. (2011)) and sentiment analysis (e.g., Kim (2014), Kalchbrenner et al. (2014), Severyn and Moschitti (2015)). Embeddings are generic representations, containing different types of information about a word. Statistical models can be trained to make best use of these generic representations for a specific application like NER or sentiment analysis.\nOur hypothesis in this paper is that the information useful for any given task is contained in an ultradense subspace Ru. We propose the new method\nDENSIFIER to identify Ru. Given a set of word embeddings, DENSIFIER learns an orthogonal transformation of the original space Ro on a task-specific training set. Orthogonal transformations “reorder” the space without adding or removing information and preserve the bilinear form, i.e., Euclidean distance and cosine. The transformed embeddings concentrate all information relevant for the task in Ru. The benefits of Ru compared to Ro are (i) highquality and (ii) efficient representations. (i) DENSIFIER moves non-task-related information outside of Ru, i.e., into the orthogonal complement of Ru. As a result, Ru provides higher-quality representations for the task than Ro; e.g., noise that could result in overfitting is reduced in Ru compared to Ro. (ii) Ru has a dimensionality smaller by a factor of 100 in our experiments. As a result, training statistical models on these embeddings is much faster. These models also have many fewer parameters, thus again helping to prevent overfitting, especially for complex, deep neural networks.\nWe show the benefits of ultradense representations in two text polarity classification tasks (SemEval2015 Task 10B, Czech movie reviews).\nIn the most extreme form, ultradense representations – i.e., Ru – have a single dimension. We exploit this for creating lexicons in which words are annotated with lexical information, e.g., with sentiment. Specifically, we create high-coverage lexicons with up to 3 million words (i) for three lexical properties: for sentiment, concreteness and frequency; (ii) for five languages: Czech, English, French, German and Spanish; (iii) for two domains, Twitter and News, in a domain adaptation setup.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n07 57\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 Fe\nb 20\nThe main advantages of this method of lexicon creation are: (i) We need a training lexicon of only a few hundred words, thus making our method effective for new domains and languages and requiring only a minimal manual annotation effort. (ii) The method is applicable to any set of embeddings, including phrase and sentence embeddings. Assuming the availability of a small hand-labeled lexicon, DENSIFIER automatically creates a domain dependent lexicon based on a set of embeddings learned on a large corpus of the domain. (iii) While the input lexicon is discrete – e.g., positive (+1) and negative (-1) sentiment – the output lexicon is continuous and this more fine-grained assessment is potentially more informative than a simple binary distinction.\nWe show that lexicons created by DENSIFIER beat the state of the art on SemEval2015 Task 10E (determining association strength).\nOne of our goals is to make embeddings more interpretable. The work on sentiment, concreteness and frequency we present in this paper is a first step towards a general decomposition of embedding spaces into meaningful, dense subspaces. This would lead to cleaner and more easily interpretable representations – as well as representations that are more effective and efficient."

The matrixQ := UV T is the nearest orthogonal matrix to Q′ in both the 2-norm and the Frobenius norm (Fan and Hoffman, 1955).\nSGD for this problem is sensitive to the learning rate. If the learning rate is too large, a large jump results and the reorthogonalized matrix Q basically is a random new point in the parameter space. If the learning rate is too small, then learning can take long. We found that our training regime of starting at a high learning rate (5) and multiplying by .99 in each iteration is effective. Typically, the cost initially stays about constant (random jumps in parameter space), then cost steeply declines in a small number of about 50 iterations (sweet spot); the curve flattens after that.

It consists of all words covered by the embedding set, each associ-\nated with its one-dimensional ultradense subspace representation (which is simply a real number), an indicator of the word’s strength for that property.\nThe embeddings and lexicon resources used in this paper cover five languages and three domains (Table 1). The Google News embeddings for English2 and the FrWac embeddings for French3 are publicly available. We use word2vec to train 400- dimensional embeddings for English on a 2013 Twitter corpus of size 5.4 109. For Czech, German and Spanish, we train embeddings on web data of sizes 3.3, 8.0 and 3.8 109, respectively. We use the following lexicon resources for sentiment: SubLex 1.0 (Veselovská and Bojar, 2013) for Czech; WHM for English [the combination of MPQA (Wilson et al., 2005), Opinion Lexicon (Hu and Liu, 2004) and NRC Emotion lexicons (Mohammad and Turney, 2013)]; FEEL (Abdaoui et al., 2014) for French; German Polarity Clues (Waltinger, 2010) for German; and the sentiment lexicon of Pérez-Rosas et al. (2012) for Spanish. For concreteness, we use BWK, a lexicon of 40,000 English words (Brysbaert et al., 2014). For frequency, we exploit the fact that word2vec stores words in frequency order; thus, the ranking provided by word2vec is our lexicon resource for frequency.\nFor a resource/embedding-set pair (L,E), we intersect the vocabulary of L with the top 80,000 words of E to filter out noisy, infrequent words that\n2https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ 3http://fauconnier.github.io/\ntend to have low quality embeddings. For the sentiment and concreteness resources, L∗(w) ∈ {−1, 1} for all words w covered. We create a resource Lf for frequency by setting Lf (w) = 1 for the 2000 most frequent words and Lf (w) = −1 for words at ranks 20000-22000. 1000 words randomly selected from the 5000 most frequent are the test set.4 We designate three sets of dimensions Ds, Dc and Df to represent sentiment, concreteness and frequency, respectively, and arbitrarily set Dc = {11} for English and Dc = ∅ for the other languages since we do not have concreteness resources for them, Ds = {1} and Df = {21}.

We reimplement the linguisticallyinformed convolutional neural network (lingCNN) of Ebert et al. (2015) that has close to state-of-the-art performance on the task.5 We initialize the first layer of lingCNN, the embedding layer, in three different ways: (i) 400-dimensional Twitter embeddings (Section 3); (ii) 40-dimensional ultradense embeddings derived from (i); (iii) 4-dimensional ultradense embeddings derived from (i). The objective weighting is αs = .4, optimized on the development set.\nThe embedding layer converts a sentence into a matrix of word embeddings. We also add linguistic features for words, such as sentiment lexicon scores. The combination of embeddings and linguistic features is the input for a convolution layer with filters spanning 2-5 words (100 filters each). This is followed by a max pooling layer, a rectifier nonlinearity (Nair and Hinton, 2010) and a fully connected softmax layer predicting the final label. The model is trained with SGD using AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) and `2 regularization (λ = 5 ∗ 10−5). Learning rate is 0.01.

We report macro F1 of positive and negative classes (the official SemEval evaluation metric) and accuracy over the three classes.

The 4-dimensional ultradense embeddings lead to only a small loss of 1.5% even though the size of the embeddings is smaller by a factor of 100 (again not a significant drop). Training time is shorter by a factor of 44 (178/4).\nWe perform the same experiment on CSFD, a Czech movie review dataset (Habernal et al., 2013), to show the benefits of ultradense embeddings for a low-resource language where only one rather small lexicon is available. As original word embeddings we train new 400 dimensional embeddings on a large Twitter corpus (3.3 109 tokens). We use DENSIFIER to create 40 and 4 dimensional embeddings out of these embeddings and SubLex 1.0 (Veselovská and Bojar, 2013). Word polarity features are also taken from SubLex. A simple binary negation indicator is implemented by searching for all tokens beginning with “ne”. Since that includes superlative forms having the prefix “nej”, we remove them with the exception of common negated words, such as “nejsi” (engl. “you are not”). We randomly split the 91k dataset instances into 90% train and 10% test and report accuracy and macro F1 score over all three classes.\nTable 4 shows that what we found for English is also true for Czech. There is only a small performance drop when using ultradense embeddings (not significant for 40 dimensional embeddings) while the speed improvement is substantial."

      "heading" : "5 Parameter Analysis",
      "text" : "In this section, we analyze two parameters: size of ultradense subspace and size of lexicon resource. We leave an evaluation of another parameter, the size of the embedding training corpus, for future work, but empirical results suggest that this corpus should ideally have a size of several billion tokens.\nSize of Subspace. With the exception of the two\ntext polarity classification experiments, all our subspaces have dimensionality d∗ = 1. The question arises: does a one-dimensional space perhaps have too low a capacity to encode all relevant information and could we further improve our results by increasing the dimensionality of the subspace to values d∗ > 1? The lexicon resources that we train and test on are all binary; thus, if we use values d∗ > 1, then we need to map the subspace embeddings to a one-dimensional scale for evaluation. We do this by training, on the train part of the resource, a linear transformation from the ultradense subspace to the one-dimensional scale (e.g., to the sentiment scale).\nFigure 3 compares different values of ds for three different types of subspaces in this setup, i.e., the setup in which the subspace representations are mapped via linear transformation to a onedimensional sentiment value: (i) Random: we take the first ds dimensions of the original embeddings; (ii) PCA: we compute a PCA and take the first ds principal components; (iii) Ultradense subspace of dimensionality ds. We use the word embeddings and lexicon resources of line 6 in Table 1. For random, the performance starts dropping when the subspace is smaller than 200 dimensions. For PCA, the performance is relatively stable until the subspace becomes smaller than 100. In contrast, ultradense subspaces have almost identical performance for all values of ds, even for ds = 1. This suggests that a single dimension is sufficient to encode all sentiment information needed for sentiment lexicon creation. However, for other sentiment tasks more dimensions may be needed, e.g., for modeling different emotional dimensions of polarity: fear, sadness, anger etc.\nAn alternative approach to creating a lowdimensional space is to simply train lowdimensional word2vec embeddings. The following experiment suggests that this does not work very well. We used word2vec to train 60-dimensional twitter embeddings with the same settings as on line 5 in Table 1. While the correlation for 400-dimensional embeddings shown in Table 1 is .661, the correlation of 60-dimensional embeddings is only .568. Thus, even though we show that the information in 400-dimensional embeddings that is relevant for sentiment can be condensed into a single dimension, hundreds of dimensions seem to\nbe needed if we use word2vec to collect sentiment information. If we run word2vec with a small dimensionality, only a subset of available sentiment information is “harvested” from the corpus.\nNext, we analyze what size of training resource is required to learn a good transformation Q. Labeled resources that cover many words are not always available or might suffer from lack of quality. We use the settings of lines 6 (sentiment) and 7 (concreteness) in Table 1. Figure 3 shows that a small training resource of 300 entries is sufficient for high performance. This suggests that DENSIFIER can create a high quality output lexicon for a new language by hand-labeling only 300 words; and that a small, high-quality resource may be preferable to a large lower-quality resource (semi-automatic or out of domain). To provide further evidence, we train DENSIFIER on only the trial data of SemEval2015 task 10E. To convert the continuous trial data to binary −1 / 1 labels, we discard all words with sentiment values between −0.5 and 0.5 and round the remaining values, giving us 39 positive and 38 negative training words. The resulting lexicon has τ = .627 (Table 3, line 8).6 This is worse than τ = .654 (line 6) for the setup in which we used several large resources, but still better than all previous work. This indicates that DENSIFIER is especially suited for languages or\n6 Here, we tune αs on train (not on trial as before).

      "text" : "To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to train an orthogonal transformation to reorder word embedding dimensions into ultradense subspaces. However, there is much prior work on postprocessing word embeddings. Faruqui et al. (2015) perform postprocessing based on a semantic lexicon with the goal of fine-tuning word embeddings. Their transformation is not orthogonal and therefore does not preserve distances. They show that their approach optimizes word embeddings for a given application, i.e., word similarity, but also that it worsens them for other applications like detecting syntactic relations. Faruqui et al. (2015)’s approach also does not have the benefit of ultradense embeddings, in particular the benefit of increased efficiency. In a tensor framework, Rothe and Schütze (2015) transform the word embeddings of a language to sense (synset) embeddings. In their work, all embeddings live in the same space whereas we explicitly want to change the embedding space to create ultradense embeddings with several desirable properties.\nXing et al. (2015) restricted the work of Mikolov et al. (2013) to an orthogonal transformation to ensure that normalized embeddings stay normalized. This transformation is learned between two embedding spaces of different languages to exploit similarities. They normalized word embeddings in a first\nstep, something that did not improve our results. Sentiment lexicons are often created semiautomatically, e.g., by extending a manually labeled seed set of sentiment words or by adding for each word its synonyms/antonyms. Another approach is to start with a seed set of manually labeled sentiment words and search for frequently cooccurring words (Turney, 2002; Kiritchenko et al., 2014). Heerschop et al. (2011) used WordNet together with a PageRank-based algorithm to propagate the sentiment of the seed set to unknown words. Scheible (2010) presented a semi-automatic approach based on machine translation of sentiment lexicons. The winning system of SemEval2015 10E (Amir et al., 2015) was based on structured skip-gram embeddings with 600 dimensions and support vector regression with RBF kernels. Hamdan et al. (2015), the second ranked team, used the average of six sentiment lexicons as a final sentiment score, a method that cannot be applied to low resource languages. We showed that the lexicons created by DENSIFIER achieve better performance than other semi-automatically created lexicons.\nTang et al. (2014b) train sentiment specific embeddings by extending Collobert & Weston’s model and Tang et al. (2014a)’s skip-gram model. The first model automatically labels tweets as positive/negative based on emoticons, a process that cannot be easily transferred to other domains like news. The second uses the Urban Dictionary to expand a small list of 350 sentiment seeds. In our work, we showed that a training resource of about the same size is sufficient without an additional dictionary. DENSIFIER differs from this work in that it does not need a text corpus, but can transform existing, publicly available word embeddings. DENSIFIER is independent of the embedding learning algorithm and therefore extensible to other word embedding mod-\nels like GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014b), to phrase embeddings (Yu and Dredze, 2015) and even to sentence embeddings (Kiros et al., 2015)."

      "text" : "We have introduced DENSIFIER, a method that is trained to focus embeddings used for an application to an ultradense subspace that contains the information relevant for the application. In experiments on SemEval, we demonstrate two benefits of the ultradense subspace. (i) Information is preserved even if we focus on a subspace that is smaller by a factor of 100 than the original space. This means that unnecessary noisy information is removed from the embeddings and robust learning without overfitting is better supported. (ii) Since the subspace is 100 times smaller, models that use the embeddings as their input representation can be trained more efficiently and have a much smaller number of parameters. The subspace can be learned with just 80−300 training examples, achieving state-of-the-art results on lexicon creation.\nWe have shown in this paper that up to three orthogonal ultradense subspaces can be created. In future work, we will explore the possibility of factoring all information present in an embedding into a dozen or so orthogonal subspaces. This factorization would not change the information embeddings contain, but it would make them more compact for any given application, more meaningful and more interpretable.\nThe nine large DENSIFIER lexicons shown in Table 1 are publicly available under http://www. cis.lmu.de/˜sascha/Ultradense/."

In this paper, we introduce DENSIFIER, a method that learns an orthogonal transformation of the embedding space that focuses the information relevant for a task in an ultradense subspace of a dimensionality that is smaller by a factor of 100 than the original space. We show that ultradense embeddings generated by DENSIFIER reach state of the art on a lexicon creation task in which words are annotated with three types of lexical information – sentiment, concreteness and frequency. On the SemEval2015 10B sentiment analysis task we show that no information is lost when the ultradense subspace is used, but training is an order of magnitude more efficient due to the compactness of the ultradense space.",
