      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Dependency parsing is an approach to syntactic analysis inspired by dependency grammar. In recent years, several domains of Natural Language Processing have benefited from dependency representations, such as synonym generation (Shinyama, Sekine, and Sudo 2002), relation extraction (Nguyen, Moschitti, and Riccardi 2009) and machine translation (Katz-Brown et al. 2011; Xie, Mi, and Liu 2011). A primary reason for using dependency structures instead of more informative constituent structures is that they are usually easier to be understood and is more amenable to annotators who have good knowledge of the target domain but lack of deep linguistic knowledge (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003) while still containing much useful information needed in application.\nDependency structure represents a parsing tree as a directed graph with different labels on each edge, and some methods based on graph models have been applied to it and achieved high performance. Based on the report of the CoNLL-X shared task on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi 2006; Nivre et al. 2007), there are currently two dominant approaches for data-driven dependency parsing: local-and-greedy transitionbased algorithms (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003; Nivre and Scholz 2004; Attardi 2006; McDonald and Nivre 2007), and globally optimized graph-based algorithms (Eisner 1996; McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005; McDonald et al. 2005; McDonald and Pereira 2006; Carreras 2007; Koo and Collins 2010), and graph-based parsing models have achieved state-ofthe-art accuracy for a wide range of languages.\n∗ 1Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence Department of Computer Science and Engineering. 2MOE-Microsoft Key Laboratory for Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems.

E-mail: xuezhe.ma@gmail.com, zhaohai@cs.sjtu.edu.cn\n© 2012 Center for Brain-Like Computing and Machine Intelligence\nThere have been several existing graph-based dependency parsers, most of which employed online learning algorithms such as the averaged structured perceptron (AP) (Freund and Schapire 1999; Collins 2002) or Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer 2003; Crammer et al. 2006; McDonald 2006) for learning parameters. However, One shortcoming of these parsers is that learning parameters of these models usually takes a long time (several hours for an iteration). The primary reason is that the training step cannot be performed in parallel, since for online learning algorithms, the updating for a new training instance depends on parameters updated with the previous instance.\nPaskin (2001) proposed a variant of the inside-outside algorithm (Baker 1979), which were applied to the grammatical bigram model (Eisner 1996). Using this algorithm, the grammatical bigram model can be learning by off-line learning algorithms. However, the grammatical bigram model is based on a strong independence assumption that all the dependency edges of a tree are independent of one another. This assumption restricts the model to first-order factorization (single edge), losing much of the contextual information in dependency tree. Chen et.al (2010) illustrated that a wide range of decision history can lead to significant improvements in accuracy for graph-based dependency parsing models. Meanwhile, several previous works (Carreras 2007; Koo and Collins 2010) have shown that grandchild interactions provide important information for dependency parsing. Therefore, relaxing the independence assumption for higher-order parts to capture much richer contextual information within the dependency tree is a reasonable improvement of the bigram model.\nIn this paper, we present a generalized probabilistic model that can be applied to any types of factored models for projective dependency parsing, and an algorithmic framework for learning these statistical models. We use the grammatical bigram model as the backbone, but relax the independence assumption and extend the inside-outside algorithms to efficiently compute the partition functions and marginals (see Section 2.4) for three higherorder models. Using the proposed framework, parallel computation technique can be employed, significantly reducing the time taken to train the parsing models. To achieve empirical evaluations of our parsers, these algorithms are implemented and evaluated on three treebanks—Penn WSJ Treebank (Marcus, Santorini, and Marcinkiewicz 1993) for English, Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al. 2005) for Chinese and Prague Dependency Treebank (Hajič 1998; Hajič et al. 2001) for Czech, and we expect to achieve an improvement in parsing performance. We also give an error analysis on structural properties for the parsers trained by our framework and those trained by online learning algorithms. A free distribution of our implementation has been put on the Internet.1.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the probabilistic models and the algorithm framework for training the models. Related work is presented in Section 3. Section 4 presents the algorithms of different parsing models for computing partition functions and marginals. The details of experiments are reported in Section 5, and conclusions are in Section 6."

An equivalent and more convenient formulation of the projectivity constrain is that if a dependency tree can be written with all words in a predefined linear order and all edges drawn on the plane without crossing edges (see Figure 1(b)). The example in Figure 1 belongs to the class of projective dependency trees where crossing dependencies are not allowed.\nDependency trees are often typed with labels for each edge to represent additional syntactic information (see Figure 1(a)), such as sbj and obj for verb-subject and verb-object head-modifier interactions, respectively. Sometimes, however, the dependency labels are omitted. Dependency trees are defined as labeled or unlabeled according to whether the dependency labels are included or dropped. In the remainder of this paper, we will focus on unlabeled dependency parsing for both theoretical and practical reasons. From theoretical respect, unlabeled parsers are easier to describe and understand, and algorithms for unlabeled parsing can usually be extended easily to the labeled case. From practical respect, algorithms of labeled parsing generally have higher computational complexity than them of unlabeled version, and are more difficult to implement and verify. Finally, the dependency labels can be accurately tagged by a two-stage labeling method (McDonald 2006), utilizing the unlabeled output parse."

      "heading" : "2.4 Problems of Training and Decoding",
      "text" : "In order to train and decode dependency parsers, we have to solve three inference problems which are central to the algorithms proposed in this paper.\nThe first problem is the decoding problem of finding the best parse for a sentence when all the parameters of the probabilistic model have been given. According to decision theory, a reasonable solution for classification is the Bayes classifier which classify to the most probable class, using the conditional distribution. Dependency parsing could be regarded as a classification problem, so decoding a dependency parser is equivalent to finding the dependency tree y∗ which\nhas the maximum conditional probability:\ny ∗ = argmax\ny∈T(x)\nPr(y|x)\n= argmax y∈T(x) log Pr(y|x)\n= argmax y∈T(x)\n{\n∑\nj\nλjFj(y,x)\n}\n. (2)\nThe second and third problems are the computation of the partition function Z(x) and the gradient of the log-likelihood (see Equation (1)).\nFrom the definition above, we can see that all three problems require an exhaustive search over T(x) to accomplish a maximization or summation. It is obvious that the cardinality of T(x) grows exponentially with the length of x, thus it is impractical to perform the search directly. A common strategy is to factor dependency trees into sets of small parts that have limited interactions:\nFj(y,x) = ∑\np∈y\nfj(p,x). (3)\nThat is, dependency tree y is treated as a set of parts p and each feature function Fj(y,x) is equal to the sum of all the features fj(p,x).\nWe denote the weight of each part p as follows:\nw(p,x) = exp\n{\n∑\nj\nλjfj(p,x)\n}\n.\nBased on Equation (3) and the definition of weight for each part, conditional probability Pr(y|x) has the the following form:\nPr(y|x) = 1\nZ(x) exp\n{\n∑\nj\nλj ∑\np∈y\nfj(p,x)\n}\n= 1\nZ(x) exp\n{\n∑\np∈y\n∑\nj\nλjfj(p,x)\n}\n= 1\nZ(x)\n∏\np∈y\nw(p,x)\nFurthermore, Equation (2) can be rewritten as:\ny ∗ = argmax\ny∈T(x)\n∑\np∈y\nlogw(p,x),\nand the partition function Z(x) and the second item in the summation of Equation (1) are\nZ(x) = ∑\ny∈T(x)\n[\n∏\np∈y\nw(p,x)\n]\n,\nand\n∑\ny∈T(xk)\nPr(y|xk)Fj(y,xk)\n= ∑\ny∈T(xk)\n∑\np∈y\nPr(y|xk)fj(p,xk)\n= ∑\np∈P(xk)\n∑\ny∈T(p,xk)\nfj(p,xk)Pr(y|xk)\n= ∑\np∈P(xk)\nfj(p,xk) ∑\ny∈T(p,xk)\nPr(y|xk),\nwhere T(p,x) = {y ∈ T(x)|p ∈ y} and P(x) is the set of all possible part p for sentence x. Note that the remaining problem for the computation of the gradient in Equation (1) is to compute the marginal probability m(p) for each part p:\nm(p) = ∑\ny∈T(p,x)\nPr(y|x).\nThen the three inference problems are as follows:\nProblem 1: Decoding\ny ∗ = argmax\ny∈T(x)\n∑\np∈y\nlogw(p,x).\nProblem 2: Computing the Partition Function\nZ(x) = ∑\ny∈T(x)\n[\n∏\np∈y\nw(p,x)\n]\n.\nProblem 3: Computing the Marginals\nm(p) = ∑\ny∈T(p,x)\nPr(y|x), for all p."

      "text" : "It should be noted that for the parsers trained by online learning algorithms such as AP or MIRA, only the algorithm for solving the decoding problem is required. However, for the motivation of training parsers using off-line parameter estimation methods such as maximum likelihood described above, we have to carefully design algorithms for the inference problem 2 and 3.\nThe proposed probabilistic model is capable of generalization to any types of parts p, and can be learned by using the framework which solves the three inference problems. For different types of factored models, the algorithms to solve the three inference problems are different. Following Koo and Collins (2010), the order of a part is defined as the number of dependencies it contains, and the order of a factorization or parsing algorithm is the maximum of the order\nof the parts it uses. In this paper, we focus on three factorizations: sibling and grandchild, two different second-order parts, and grand-sibling, a third-order part:\nsibling grandchild grand-sibling\ns tr s tr s s t t r r g\ng\nIn this paper, we consider only projective trees, where crossing dependencies are not allowed, excluding non-projective trees, where dependencies are allowed to cross. For projective parsing, efficient algorithms exist to solve the three problems, for certain factorizations with special structures. Non-projective parsing with high-order factorizations is known to be NPhard in computation (McDonald and Pereira 2006; McDonald and Satta 2007). In addition, our models capture multi-root trees, whose root-symbols have one or more children. A multi-root parser is more robust to sentences that contain disconnected but coherent fragments, since it is allowed to split up its analysis into multiple pieces."

We define the order of l as the number of labels l contains, and denote it as o(l). It should be noted that the order of l is not necessarily equal to the order of p, since l may contain labels of parts of edges in p.

In fact, the grammatical bigram probabilistic model is a special case of our probabilistic model, by specifying the parts p as individual edges. The grammatical bigram model is based on a strong independence assumption: that all the dependency edges of a tree are independent of one another, given the sentence x.\nFor the first-order model (part p is an individual edge), a variant of the inside-outside algorithm, which was proposed by Baker (1979) for probabilistic context-free grammars, can be applied for the computation of partition function and marginals for projective dependency structures. This inside-outside algorithm is built on the semiring parsing framework (Goodman 1999).

Figure 2 provides graphical specifications of these parsing algorithms.\nMcDonald et al. (2005) presented the first-order dependency parser, which decomposes a dependency tree into a set of individual edges. A widely-used dynamic programming algorithm (Eisner 2000) was used for decoding. This algorithm introduces two interrelated types of dynamic programming structures: complete spans, and incomplete spans (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005). Larger spans are created from two smaller, adjacent spans by recursive combination in a bottom-up procedure.\nThe second-order sibling parser (McDonald and Pereira 2006) breaks up a dependency tree into sibling parts—pairs of adjacent edges with shared head. Koo and Collins (2010) proposed a parser that factors each dependency tree into a set of grandchild parts. Formally, a grandchild part is a triple of indices (g, s, t) where g is the head of s and s is the head of t. In order to parse this factorization, it is necessary to augment both complete and incomplete spans with grandparent indices. Following Koo and Collins (2010), we refer to these augmented structures as g-spans.\nThe second-order parser proposed in Carreras (2007) is capable to score both sibling and grandchild parts with complexities of O(n4) time and O(n3) space. However, the parser suffers an crucial limitation that it can only evaluate events of grandchild parts for outermost grandchildren.\nThe third-order grand-sibling parser, which encloses grandchild and sibling parts into a grand-sibling part, was described in Koo and Collins (2010). This factorization defines all grandchild and sibling parts and still requires O(n4) time and O(n3) space."

Parameters in these models are typically learned using standard classification techniques to predict one transition from a set of possible transitions given a state history.\nRecently, several approaches have been proposed to improve transition-based dependency parsers. In the aspect of decoding, beam search (Johansson and Nugues 2007; Huang, Jiang, and Liu 2009) and partial dynamic programming (Huang and Sagae 2010) have been applied to improve one-best search.

Note that since our algorithm considers multi-root dependency trees, we should perform another recursive step to compute the inside probability β for the complete span C0,t, after the computation of β for all g-spans.\nAlgorithm 2 illustrates the algorithm for computing outside probabilities α. This is a topdown dynamic programming algorithm, and the key of this algorithm is to determine all the contributions to the final Z(x) for each g-span; fortunately, this can be done deterministically for all cases. For example, the complete g-span Cgs,t with g < s < t has two different contributions: combined with a g-span Csr,t+1, of which r > t, in the right side to build up a larger g-span I g s,r; or combined with a g-span Irg,s, of which r > t or r < g, in the left side to form a larger g-span Crg,t. So α(C g s,t) is the sum of two items, each of which corresponds to one of the two cases (See Algorithm 2). It should be noted that complete g-spans Cgs,t with g = 0 or g = n are two special cases.\nAfter the computation of β and α for all spans, we can get marginals using following equation:\nm(g, s, t) = β(Igs,t) · α(I g s,t)/z(x).\nSince the complexity of the both Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 is O(n4) time and O(n3) space, the complexity overall for training this model is O(n4) time and O(n3) space, which is the same as the decoding algorithm of this factorization."

We denote a sibling span as Ss,t where s and t are successive modifiers with a shared head. Formally, a sibling span Ss,t represents the region between successive modifiers s and t of some head. The graphical specification of the second-order sibling model for dynamic-programming, which is in the original work of Eisner (Eisner 1996), is shown in Figure 2. The key insight is that an incomplete span is constructed by combining a smaller incomplete span with a sibling span that covers the region between the two successive modifiers. The new way allows for the collection of pairs of sibling dependents in a single state. It is no surprise that the dynamic-programming structures and derivations of the algorithm for computing β is the same as that of the decoding algorithm, and we omit the pseudo-code of this algorithm.\nThe algorithm for computing α can be designed with the new dynamic programming structures. The pseudo-code of this algorithm is illustrated in Algorithm 3. We use ws,r,t to denote the weight of a sibling part (s, r, t). The computation of marginals of sibling parts is quite different from that of the first-order dependency or second-order grandchild model. For the introduction of sibling spans, two different cases should be considered: the modifiers are at the left/right side of the head. In addition, the part (s,−, t), which represents that t is the inner-most modifier of s, is a special case and should be treated specifically. We can get marginals for all sibling parts with s < r < t as following:\nm(s, r, t) = β(Is,r) · β(Sr,t) · α(Is,t) · ws,r,t/z(x) m(t, r, s) = β(Ss,r) · β(It,r) · α(It,s) · wt,r,s/z(x) m(s,−, t) = β(Ct,s+1) · α(Is,t) · ws,−,t/z(x) m(t,−, s) = β(Cs,t−1) · α(It,s) · wt,−,s/z(x),\nSince each derivation is defined by a span and a split point, the complexity for training and decoding of the second-order sibling model is O(n3) time and O(n2) space.\nAlgorithm 3 Compute outside probability α for second-order Sibling Model\nRequire: α(C0,n) = 1.0 α(Cn,0) = 1.0"

Formally, a grand-sibling is a 4-tuple of indices (g, s, r, t) where (s, r, t) is a sibling part and (g, s, t) is a grandchild part. The algorithm of this factorization can be designed based on the algorithms for grandchild and sibling models.\nLike the extension of the second-order sibling model to the first-order dependency model, we define the sibling g-spans Sgs,t, where Ss,t is a normal sibling span and g is the index of the head of s and t, which lies outside the region [s, t] with the implication that (g, s, t) forms a valid sibling part. This model can also be treated as an extension of the sibling model by augmenting it with a grandparent index for each span, like the behavior of the grandchild model for the firstorder dependency model. Figure 2 provides the graphical specification of this factorization for dynamic-programming, too. The overall structures and derivations is similar to the second-order sibling model, with the addition of grandparent indices. The same to the second-order grandchild model, the grandparent indices can be set deterministically in all cases.\nThe pseudo-code of the algorithm for the computation of the outside probability α is illustrated in Algorithm 4. It should be noted that in this model there are two types of special cases—one is the sibling-g-span Sgs,t with g = 0 or g = n, as the complete g-span C g s,t with g = 0 or g = n in the second-order grandchild model; another is the inner-most modifier case as the second-order sibling model.

Dependencies are extracted by using Penn2Malt2 tool with standard head rules (Yamada and Matsumoto 2003). For Chinese, we adopt the data split from Zhang and Clark (2009), and we also used the Penn2Malt tool to convert the data into dependency structures. Since the dependency trees for English and Chinese are extracted from phrase structures in Penn Treebanks, they contain no crossing edges by construction.

For example, third-order grand-sibling model evaluates parts for dependencies, siblings, grandchildren and grand-siblings, so that the feature function of a dependency parse is given by:\nF (y,x) = ∑\n(s,t)∈y\nfdep(s, t,x)\n+ ∑\n(s,r,t)∈y\nfsib(s, r, t,x)\n+ ∑\n(g,s,t)∈y\nfgch(g, s, t,x)\n+ ∑\n(g,s,r,t)∈y\nfgsib(g, s, r, t,x)\nwhere fdep, fsib, fgch, and fgsib are the feature functions of dependency, sibling, grandchild, and grand-sibling parts.\nFirst-order dependency features fdep, second-order sibling features fsib and second-order grandchild features fgch are based on feature sets from previous work (McDonald, Crammer, and Pereira 2005; McDonald and Pereira 2006; Carreras 2007), to which we added lexicalized versions of several features. For instance, our first-order feature set contains lexicalized “in-between” features that recognize word types that occur between the head and modifier words in an attachment decision, while previous work has defined in-between features only for POS tags. As another example, the second-order features fsib and fgch contains lexical trigram features, which also excluded in the feature sets of previous work. The third-order grand-sibling features are based on Koo and Collins (Koo and Collins 2010). All feature templates for used in our parsers are outlined in Table 2.\nAccording to Table 2, several features in our parser depend on part-of-speech (POS) tags of input sentences. For English, POS tags are automatically assigned by the SVMTool tagger (Gimenez and Marquez 2004); For Chinese, we used gold-standard POS tags in CTB. Following Koo and Collins (2010), two versions of POS tags are used for any features involve POS: one using is normal POS tags and another is a coarsened version of the POS tags.5\n4 English evaluation ignores any token whose gold-standard POS is one of {” “ : , .}; Chinese evaluation ignores any token whose tag is “PU” 5 For English, we used the first two characters, except PRP and PRP$; for Czech, we used the first character of the tag; for Chinese, we dropped the last character, except PU and CD."

The method of parameter estimation for our models is the limited memory BFGS algorithm (L-BFGS) (Nash and Nocedal 1991), with L2 regularization. L-BFGS algorithm is widely used for large-scale optimization, as it combines fast training time with low memory requirement which is especially important for large-scale optimization problems.\nMeanwhile, L-BFGS can achieve highly competitive performance. Development sets are used for tuning the hyper-parameter C which dictates the level of the regularization in the model.\nFor the purpose of comparison, we also run experiments on graph-based dependency parsers of the three different factorizations, employing two online learning methods: The kbest version of the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) (Crammer and Singer 2003; Crammer et al. 2006; McDonald 2006) with k = 10, and averaged structured perceptron (AP) (Freund and Schapire 1999; Collins 2002).

Each parser is trained for 10 iterations and selects parameters from the iteration that achieves the highest parsing performance on the development set.\nThe feature sets were fixed for all three languages.

For example, for the third-order grand-sibling model, the parsers trained by L-BFGS method improve the UAS of 0.6% for PTB, 2.1% for CTB and 1.1% for PDT, compared with the parsers trained by AP. For the parsers trained by MIRA, our parsers achieve the same UAS for PTB, and higher parsing accuracies (about 0.2% better) for both CTB\nand PDT. Moreover, it should be noticed that our algorithms achieve significant improvement of RA and CM on all three treebanks for the parsers trained by MIRA, although the parsers trained by L-BFGS and MIRA exhibit no statistically significant different in the parsing performance of UAS.\nAs mentioned above, parallel computation techniques could be applied to our models to speed up parser training. Table 4 lists the average training time for our three models with different number of cores. According to this table, the training time of our parsers trained by off-line LBFGS method with more than 10 cores is much less than the cost of the parsers trained by online learning methods MIRA. We omit the training time of online learning method AP, since the training times for MIRA and AP are nearly the same according to our experiences.

Our methods achieve competitive or state-of-the-art performance on three treebanks for languages of English, Chinese and Czech. By analyzing errors on structural properties of length factors, we have shown that the parsers trained by online and off-line learning methods have distinctive error distributions despite having very similar parsing performance of UAS overall. We have also demonstrated that by exploiting parallel computation techniques, our parsing models can be trained much faster than those parsers using online training methods."

Using this algorithm, the grammatical bigram model can be learning by off-line learning algorithms. However, the grammatical bigram model is based on a strong independence assumption that all the dependency edges of a tree are independent of one another. This assumption restricts the model to first-order factorization (single edge), losing much of the contextual information in dependency tree. Chen et.al (2010) illustrated that a wide range of decision history can lead to significant improvements in accuracy for graph-based dependency parsing models.",

The grammatical bigram model is based on a strong independence assumption: that all the dependency edges of a tree are independent of one another, given the sentence x. For the first-order model (part p is an individual edge), a variant of the inside-outside algorithm, which was proposed by Baker (1979) for probabilistic context-free grammars, can be applied for the computation of partition function and marginals for projective dependency structures.",

Partition functions and marginals for high-order dependency trees can be computed efficiently, by adapting our algorithms which extend the inside-outside algorithm to higher-order cases. To show the effectiveness of our algorithms, we perform experiments on three languages— English, Chinese and Czech, using maximum conditional likelihood estimation for model training and L-BFGS for parameter estimation. Our methods achieve competitive performance for English, and outperform all previously reported dependency parsers for Chinese and Czech.",
