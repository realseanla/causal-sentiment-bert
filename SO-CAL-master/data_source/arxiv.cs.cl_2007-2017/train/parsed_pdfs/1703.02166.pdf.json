With the languages having the complex writing system like the Khmer language in Southern of Vietnam, this problem really very intractable, posing the significant challenges. Although there are some experts in Vietnam as well as international having deeply researched this problem, there are still no reasonable results meeting the demand, in particular, no treated thoroughly the ambiguous phenomenon, in the process of Khmer language processing so far. This paper present a solution based on the syllable division into component clusters using two syllable models proposed, thereby building a Khmer syllable database, is still not actually available. This method using a lexical database updated from the online Khmer dictionaries and some supported dictionaries serving role of training data and complementary linguistic characteristics. Each component cluster is labelled and located by the first and last letter to identify entirety a syllable. This approach is workable and the test results achieve high accuracy, eliminate the ambiguity, contribute to solving the problem of word segmentation and applying efficiency in Khmer language processing.\nKEYWORDS\nAmbiguity; component cluster; labelling; lexical database; natural language processing; syllable database; syllable formation; word segmentation."

      "text" : "In natural language processing, the problem of word segmentation (WS), or dividing a string of written language into its component words in a document, always put out immediately after many processing steps such as encoding, building typing tool, editing documents, etc. For the languages using Latin alphabet such as English, Vietnamese, or many other languages in the world, the problem of WS does not pose much difficulty. In such writing systems, there are the delimiters (spaces, or punctuation) between words to identify exactly any word appeared in document. The general characteristics of WS in these languages are identified by their meanings and eliminate ambiguity, depending on context of documents. Several methods have been proposed and familiar as the maximum matching method, finding the conditional random field, learning machine, support vector machines, hidden Markov models and so on [4][6][8][9]. The Khmer language belongs to South Asian group (Thai, Laotian, Vietnamese…) having a very complicated writing system. The letters are writing seamless and in order from top to bottom, left to right, but not using any delimiter between words. As written, the letters or signs can be placed below, above, front and behind a central character [1]. A word can be read in many different ways depending on the context of document. There are many ways to syllable formation, causing the ambiguity in orthography and meanings [1][2][3][24]. Therefore, all language processing approaches on the computer, especially the problem of WS, always deal with a big challenge, it has not been resolved in a satisfactory manner so far.\nThe WS methods for Khmer documents is mainly based on two approaches: on the characters and on the words. The first approach carried out by groups of characters respectively appearing in sentences into syllables, depending on the case where the characters can repeated. For example the string ABCD can be split into AB CD or AB BC CD, and so on... The second approach seeks to separate complete words (single or compound) in a sentence in three ways: basing on statistical frequency of the words, using existing vocabulary in a lexical database (LDB), or the combination of these both ways [6][7][10][11]. However, the effectiveness of this methods is still not high, it should be studied further. The drawback in general is unable to recognize the new words as well as simple word or compound words, it does not resolve the ambiguity phenomenon. On the other hand, these methods are not yet fully exploited these specific characteristics of Khmer language in the Southern Vietnam, it has changed many factors, borrowed words become more complex than original Cambodia's Khmer language. In approach based on the words, an other method proposed is building graphs analyzing sentences [8]. This method identifies new words by searching, analyzing lists which may correspond to the shortest paths on a graph [7]. Although the WS is relatively effective, can be resolve ambiguity problem, but this method is only suitable for languages having the signs of separation or identification for syllables and using a syllable database (SDB). However, there is not yet SDB for Khmer language built so far using for universal services for many different purposes, such as spelling checking, classification of Khmer documents, etc. This paper proposed a solution for building a Khmer SDB. After the introduction, the paper mainly includes the following content: analysing all features of Khmer language; proposing two syllable models, SC and CC, to recognize the characters combined in component clusters of a syllable; dividing each entry from a LDB into component clusters; labeling specific position based on the first and last letters of each cluster to determine the limits of each syllable, updating processed syllables in the SDB; test implementation and evaluation of the results. The last part of paper is the conclusion and directions for further research."

The Khmer language\nbelongs to 150 Mon-Khmer language in Southeast Asia, mainly distributed in Cambodia, Thailand. In Vietnam, besides Khmer people living in Southern Vietnam, there are 19 ethnic groups who have the same language MonKhmer, scattered mainly in the Central Highlands like Bana, XeDang, Koho, Hre, Mnong, Stieng, Cotu, etc. These languages are so far not virtually researched in the domain of natural language processing The Khmer language is monosyllable, voiceless (no dialcritical marks like Vietnamese, Laotian and Thai), borrowed from many languages, including Sanskrit, Thai, Cham, Chinese, Vietnamese, including France, Portugal [2][5]. In Vietnam, Young Khmer generation has borrowed many Vietnamese words. For example, in the sentence េគថងូ វ អីនឹង? (What do they announce?), the new word ថូង វ (announce) is\nborrowed from Vietnamese language. The Khmer grammar uses word family, sentence structure, sentence classe et types, etc. but it is not too complicated."

Only the consonant ឡ in voice O has not the leg sign, the 32 remaining consonants all have leg\nsigns, dominant the syllable formation [1][3][7][14].\nIn our research, we used conventionally the leg sign ◌្ preceding the consonant having the leg so\nthat the computers can recognize them in consonant combinations. It is true of the consonant combination .ត having a ◌្ before the consonant រ.\nThere are 24 common vowels (or dependent) and 14 independent vowels. A common vowel always has a meaning even when it is not combined with any other consonants, for example, ឦ\n(northeast), ឥ (rainbow), etc. An independent vowel only has a meaning when it is combined with\nother consonants, the pronunciation is depending on the consonants in voice O or in voice Ô. The TABLE III. below introduce a list of signs and 10 digits from 0 to 9. In the numeral system, the reading 6 7 8 9 is respectively reassembling 5 with 1 2 3 4. The numbers of tens onwards normally use the familiar numeral system, for example ១០ (10), ១៩ (19), and so on.\nThe Khmer writing system uses a structure of three levels (similar to Thai and Laotian): leg (below), body and hair (above). The leg includes the vowels, the body include the combination of\nconsonants and vowels, the hair include the vowels or signs. For example, the word ខxyំ (me)\nconsists of three levels: the leg is the vowel ◌ុ, the body is the combination of consonant ខx and the\nhair is the vowel ◌.ំ"

      "heading" : "2.3. Khmer syllable formation",
      "text" : "The syllables in Khmer are used to form the words. In reality, there are three types of single word formation: semi-syllable as ខxy ំ (I), one syllable as កង ់ (bicycle), or two syllables as សzិតេចក (banana\nbunch). A compound word has at least two single words. In case of compound word with two syllable, just one of the two syllables has meaning. For example, សិត (idiom) has only one syllable\n(pouring water) has meaning. A phrase consists of a group of words having at least three syllables. The Khmer syllable formation is very complex. There are four ways for combinations into syllables: a consonant is combined with a other consonant as បង (he); a consonant is combined\nwith a vowel as ជ ី (fertilizer); a consonant coupling with a vowel is combined with a other\nconsonant as េរ6ន (study); a consonant having the leg sign is combined with a vowel as ែ.ស (field).\nThe dependent vowels in the TABLE II are always behind consonants, though there are possible 9 different positions: front, back, top, bottom, front back, on the bottom, front on, on the back and lower back. When there are two syllables combined, the final consonant of the first syllable is written overlapping on the first consonant of the second syllable. For example, in ក{| ស់ (sneezing),\nthe final consonant ណ់ of the syllable កណ់ is written overlapping on the initial consonant ដ of the\nsyllable }ស់. So, the Khmer syllable formation often causes ambiguity. It is true that there are two\nways of divide the word ~រក (infant) into two syllables, or ~ | រក (duck/ find), or ~រ | ក (hungry/ neck)."

      "text" : "To properly identify syllables Khmer, the pre - processing step removes the misspelled characters and rearrange the consistent order of characters which appeared in each component cluster based on the models SC or CC. This step is based on three phases: Handling the position of each character in syllables\nThis phase is related to the way how to entry Khmer characters into the computer. At present, almost editor system for Khmer documents use Unicode and is available on the internet, or installed by default in Windows. The typing method for Khmer documents is similar with Vietnamese documents from a ASCII keyboard. The users typed in a row any character forming the words and sentences of document, in order from top to bottom, left to right. Usually, there are two typing methods: normal typing and NIDA1 typing [12]. A Khmer syllable can be typing in different ways, each way forming a combination of independent characters. For example, there are 4 different combinations for syllable ស|ី (women), each combination containing 6 characters to\nbe typed in turn as follow:\n(1) ស + ◌្ + ត + ◌្ + រ + ◌ ី= (ស, ◌្, ត, ◌្, រ, ◌)ី\n(2) ស + ◌្ + រ + ◌្ + ត + ◌ ី= (ស, ◌្, រ, ◌្, ត, ◌)ី\n(3) ស + ◌្ + ត + ◌ ី+ ◌្ + រ = (ស, ◌្, ត, ◌,ី ◌្, រ )\n1 NIDA (National Information Communication Technology Development Authority) a government agency responsible for managing\nthe development of the information technology industry in Cambodia.\n(4) ស + ◌្ + រ + ◌ ី+ ◌្ + ត = (ស, ◌្, រ, ◌,ី ◌្, ត)\nIn fact, when there are many possibilities for combining independent typed characters to entry a syllable can cause ambiguity. This leads to more difficulties to match and identify the syllable. Using the models SC or CC, this phase assign the label for each component cluster in order to convert the syllables into a uniform combination. So, any character appeared in a syllable will have the correct order and the consistent position to match. In the example above, all three combinations (2), (3), (4) have been converted into (1). Handling different sign in syllable but identical morpheme\nIn Khmer language, there are different signs to use to entry a syllable but identical morpheme which maybe causes the misspelling. For example, there are three typing ways to entry the syllable ហ yី containing 5 characters as follow:\n(1) ហ + ◌ ៊+ ◌្ + ស + ◌ ី= ហ៊ី = (ហ, ◌,៊ ◌្, ស, ◌)ី\n(2) ហ + ◌្ + ស + ◌ ៊+ ◌ ី= ហ yី = (ហ, ◌្, ស, ◌,៊ ◌)ី\n(3) ហ + ◌្ + ស + ◌ ៉+ ◌ ី= ហ៉ = (ហ, ◌្, ស, ◌,៉ ◌)ី\nThe typing way (3) has the same morpheme with (1) and (2) but misspelled. In this phase, (2) was transferred into (1) and replace the character ◌៉៉ ៉ ៉in (3) into ◌៊៊ ៊ ៊for the correct spelling.\nHandling different consonant leg sign in syllable but identical morpheme and different meaning The combination of the sub-consonant ត or ដ with the consonant leg sign ◌្្្្ can form one\nmorpheme but different meanings. For example:\n(1) ◌្ + ត = ◌| (subconsonant ត)\n(2) ◌្ + ដ = ◌ (subconsonant ដ)\nThe morphemes in (1) with subconsonant ត and in (2) with sub-consonant ដ are the same. This\nphase changes sub-consonant signs follow the principle: if the main consonant is ណ then the sub-\nconsonant is ដ ; conversely, if the main consonant is not ដ, use sub-consonant ត."

There are no marks to identify each syllable Ai, i=1..m in the entry W. It is necessary to find the beginning position and the end position of Ai which can contain k clusters Cj, j=1..k, need to exactly locate. Assuming tj is the label to assign location for each cluster Cj. There are 4 types of labels as follow::\nLL Assigned to the left cluster of the syllable; a new syllable can be appear when combined this cluster with its right clusters. RR Assigned to the right cluster of the syllable; a new syllable can be appear when combined this cluster with its left clusters. MM Assigned to center cluster of syllable. LR In case of being independent syllable.\nThe determination of the position of each component cluster in syllable to assign labels uses three supplementary DB (3), (4) and (5). Here (3) contain all their characteristics. Assuming (Cj\np) specify the characteristic of Cj, where p∈{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}, there are 5 cases occurred for Cj as follow:\n(Cj 0) : Cj is the courrent cluster. (Cj -1) : The left cluster of Cj. (Cj -2) : The left cluster of (Cj\n-1). (Cj\n1) : The right cluster of Cj. (Cj 2) : The right cluster of (Cj 1).\nSo, the labeling for location of component cluster from (Cj0) can adding 4 possibilities:\n(Cj -2 , Cj -1), (Cj -1 , Cj 1), (Cj 1 , Cj 2), (Cj -2Cj -1 , Cj 1Cj 2) The training database (TDB), named (4), contain the selected syllables combined from all overlapping component clusters causing the ambiguity. For example, the syllable គរយ (percent)\ncontaining គ and រយ is updated in (4), because this two clusters are overlapping ambiguity and\nexisting in the TDB. The DB (5) treat the case of consecutive clusters which do not contain characteristic signs to identify syllable. Here (5) contains all the component clusters appearing in DB (2) but not existing in the TDB (4). From the DB (2) containing all the component clusters, it is need to search all items having maximum two clusters satisfying the syllable model SC, or CC. If the item just is a cluster, it is labelled in left and right. After that, this item is updated into labelled cluster DB (6). It is true of the cluster C-1C0C1 has no distinctive signs to identify syllable. So, from (5), it can be manually labelled C1(LL), C0(RR), C1(LR) or C1(LR), C0(LL), C1(RR) and then updated into (6).

    "abstractText" : "Word segmentation is a basic problem in natural language processing. With the languages having the complex writing system like the Khmer language in Southern of Vietnam, this problem really very intractable, posing the significant challenges. Although there are some experts in Vietnam as well as international having deeply researched this problem, there are still no reasonable results meeting the demand, in particular, no treated thoroughly the ambiguous phenomenon, in the process of Khmer language processing so far. This paper present a solution based on the syllable division into component clusters using two syllable models proposed, thereby building a Khmer syllable database, is still not actually available. This method using a lexical database updated from the online Khmer dictionaries and some supported dictionaries serving role of training data and complementary linguistic characteristics. Each component cluster is labelled and located by the first and last letter to identify entirety a syllable. This approach is workable and the test results achieve high accuracy, eliminate the ambiguity, contribute to solving the problem of word segmentation and applying efficiency in Khmer language processing.",
