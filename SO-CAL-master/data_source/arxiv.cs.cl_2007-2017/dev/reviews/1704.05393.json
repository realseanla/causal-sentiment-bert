Unsupervised and Agnostic Aggregation of Online Reviews", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel approach for aggregating online reviews, according to the opinions they express. Our methodology is unsupervised - due to the fact that it does not rely on pre-labeled reviews - and it is agnostic - since it does not make any assumption about the domain or the language of the review content. We measure the adherence of a review content to the domain terminology extracted from a review set. First, we demonstrate the informativeness of the adherence metric with respect to the score associated with a review. Then, we exploit the metric values to group reviews, according to the opinions they express. Our experimental campaign has been carried out on two large datasets collected from Booking and Amazon, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:20:25 GMT  (1143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05393v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["michela fazzolari", "marinella petrocchi", "alessandro tommasi", "cesare zavattari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05393"}
