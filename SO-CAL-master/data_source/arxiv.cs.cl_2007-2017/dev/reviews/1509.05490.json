Among these attempts, translation-based methods build entity and relation vectors by minimizing the translation loss from a head entity to a tail one. In spite of the success of these methods, translation-based methods also suffer from the oversimplified loss metric, and are not competitive enough to model various and complex entities/relations in knowledge bases. To address this issue, we propose \\textbf{TransA}, an adaptive metric approach for embedding, utilizing the metric learning ideas to provide a more flexible embedding method. Experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets and our proposed method makes significant and consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 02:40:07 GMT  (365kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05490v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 02:21:20 GMT  (158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05490v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["han xiao", "minlie huang", "yu hao", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05490"}
