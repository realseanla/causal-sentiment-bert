In this paper we present an information-theoretic approach based on the Minimum Message Length Criterion for solving the Lexical Access Problem. We model sentences using phoneme realizations seen in training, and word and part-of-speech information obtained from text corpora. We show results on multiple-speaker, continuous, read speech and discuss a heuristic using equivalence classes of similar sounding words which speeds up the recognition process without significant deterioration in recognition accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:24 GMT  (979kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1572v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ian thomas", "ingrid zukerman", "jonathan oliver", "david albrecht", "bhavani raskutti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1572"}
