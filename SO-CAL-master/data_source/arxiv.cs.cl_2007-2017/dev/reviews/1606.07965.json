We explore and compare token-level and dialogue act-level automatic summarization methods using both unsupervised and supervised learning frameworks. In the supervised summarization setting, and given true clusterings of decision-related utterances, we find that token-level summaries that employ discourse context can approach an upper bound for decision abstracts derived directly from dialogue acts. In the unsupervised summarization setting,we find that summaries based on unsupervised partitioning of decision-related utterances perform comparably to those based on partitions generated using supervised techniques (0.22 ROUGE-F1 using LDA-based topic models vs. 0.23 using SVMs).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Jun 2016 20:45:14 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07965v1", "ACL Workshop on Automatic Summarization for Different Genres, Media, and Languages, 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL Workshop on Automatic Summarization for Different Genres, Media, and Languages, 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "claire cardie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07965"}
