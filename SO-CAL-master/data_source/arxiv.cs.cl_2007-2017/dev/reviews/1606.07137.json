Our approach first applies a set of rule-based techniques to extract candidate study sizes from the abstracts of the articles. Supervised classification is then performed over the candidates with support vector machines, using a small set of lexical, structural, and contextual features. With only a small annotated training set of 201 RCTs, we obtained an accuracy of 88\\%. We believe that this system will aid complex medical text processing tasks such as summarisation and question answering.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 23:35:59 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07137v1", "unpublished"]], "COMMENTS": "unpublished", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["abeed sarker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07137"}
