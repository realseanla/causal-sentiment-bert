We investigate dependency parsing of Singlish by constructing a dependency treebank under the Universal Dependencies scheme, and then training a neural network model by integrating English syntactic knowledge into a state-of-the-art parser trained on the Singlish treebank. Results show that English knowledge can lead to 25% relative error reduction, resulting in a parser of 84.47% accuracies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use neural stacking to improve cross-lingual dependency parsing on low-resource languages. We make both our annotation and parser available for further research.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 May 2017 08:27:42 GMT  (890kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06463v1", "Accepted by ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hongmin wang", "yue zhang", "guangyong leonard chan", "jie yang", "hai leong chieu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.06463"}
