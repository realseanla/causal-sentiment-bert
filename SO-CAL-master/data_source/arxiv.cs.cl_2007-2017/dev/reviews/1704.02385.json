This exchange is not free from participants with malicious intentions, which do not contribute with the written conversation. Among different communities users adopt strategies to handle such users. In this paper we present a comprehensive categorization of the trolling phenomena resource, inspired by politeness research and propose a model that jointly predicts four crucial aspects of trolling: intention, interpretation, intention disclosure and response strategy. Finally, we present a new annotated dataset containing excerpts of conversations involving trolls and the interactions with other users that we hope will be a useful resource for the research community.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 22:08:39 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02385v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["luis gerardo mojica"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02385"}
