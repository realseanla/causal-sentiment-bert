This is the task 17 of SemEval 2015. Here we present our simple taxonomy structuring techniques which, despite their simplicity, ranked first in this 2015 benchmark. We use large quantities of text (English Wikipedia) and simple heuristics such as term overlap and document and sentence co-occurrence to produce hypernym lists. We describe these techniques and pre-sent an initial evaluation of results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 17:53:01 GMT  (318kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01271v1", "submitted to SemEval 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 09:05:18 GMT  (309kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01271v2", "SemEval 2015, Jun 2015, Denver, United States"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to SemEval 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gregory grefenstette"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.01271"}
