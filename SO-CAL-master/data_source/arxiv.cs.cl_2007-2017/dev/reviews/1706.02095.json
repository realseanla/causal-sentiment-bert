Four runs were submitted, with approaches ranging from a trivial system that selected the first $n$ snippets, to the use of deep learning approaches under a regression framework. Our experiments and the ROUGE results of the five test batches of BioASQ indicate surprisingly good results for the trivial approach. Overall, most of our runs on the first three test batches achieved the best ROUGE-SU4 results in the challenge.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 09:04:29 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02095v1", "Conference paper"], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Aug 2017 07:11:19 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02095v2", "As published in BioNLP2017. 9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["diego molla-aliod"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02095"}
