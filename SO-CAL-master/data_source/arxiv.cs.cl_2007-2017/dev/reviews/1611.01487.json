{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Nov-2016", "title": "Morphological Inflection Generation with Hard Monotonic Attention", "abstract": "We present a supervised sequence to sequence transduction model with a hard attention mechanism which combines the more traditional statistical alignment methods with the power of recurrent neural networks. We evaluate the model on the task of morphological inflection generation and show that it provides state of the art results in various setups compared to the previous neural and non-neural approaches. Eventually we present an analysis of the learned representations for both hard and soft attention models, shedding light on the features such models extract in order to solve the task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 18:42:47 GMT  (2156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01487v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 12:33:44 GMT  (2145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01487v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 08:51:27 GMT  (591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01487v3", "Accepted as a long paper in ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["roee aharoni", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.01487"}
