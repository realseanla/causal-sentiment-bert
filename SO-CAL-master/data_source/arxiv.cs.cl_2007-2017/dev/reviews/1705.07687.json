Supervised approaches to Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis obtain good results for the domain/language their are trained on, but having manually labelled data for training supervised systems for all domains and languages use to be very costly and time consuming. In this work we describe W2VLDA, an unsupervised system based on topic modelling, that combined with some other unsupervised methods and a minimal configuration, performs aspect/category classifiation, aspectterms/opinion-words separation and sentiment polarity classification for any given domain and language. We also evaluate the performance of the aspect and sentiment classification in the multilingual SemEval 2016 task 5 (ABSA) dataset. We show competitive results for several languages (English, Spanish, French and Dutch) and domains (hotels, restaurants, electronic-devices).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 12:01:10 GMT  (326kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07687v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 07:36:48 GMT  (329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07687v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aitor garc\\'ia-pablos", "montse cuadros", "german rigau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07687"}
