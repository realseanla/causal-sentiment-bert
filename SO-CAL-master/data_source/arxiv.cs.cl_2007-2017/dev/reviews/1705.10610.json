By incorporating automatic syntactic features with word embeddings as input for bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), our system, although simpler than some deep learning architectures, achieves a much better result for Vietnamese NER. The proposed method achieves an overall F1 score of 92.05% on the test set of an evaluation campaign, organized in late 2016 by the Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) community. Our named entity recognition system outperforms the best previous systems for Vietnamese NER by a large margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 08:10:15 GMT  (153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10610v1", "7 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1705.04044"], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 16:23:40 GMT  (153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10610v2", "7 pages, 3 figures, resolve text overlapping. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1705.04044"], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 16:17:49 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10610v3", "7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to PACLIC 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1705.04044"], ["v4", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 02:32:16 GMT  (153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10610v4", "7 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures, accepted to PACLIC 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1705.04044", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thai-hoang pham", "phuong le-hong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10610"}
