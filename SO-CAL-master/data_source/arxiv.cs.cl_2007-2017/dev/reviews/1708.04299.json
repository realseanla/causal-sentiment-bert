This paper introduces a corpus for text-based emotion detection on multiparty dialogue as well as deep neural models that outperform the existing approaches for document classification. We first present a new corpus that provides annotation of seven emotions on consecutive utterances in dialogues extracted from the show, Friends. We then suggest four types of sequence-based convolutional neural network models with attention that leverage the sequence information encapsulated in dialogue. Our best model shows the accuracies of 37.9% and 54% for fine- and coarse-grained emotions, respectively. Given the difficulty of this task, this is promising.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 20:01:44 GMT  (998kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04299v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sayyed m zahiri", "jinho d choi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04299"}
