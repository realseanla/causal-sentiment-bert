In this work we present a simple REG experiment that allows the use of larger training data sets by grouping speakers according to their overspecification preferences. Intrinsic evaluation shows that this method generally outperforms the personalised method found in previous work.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 10:47:10 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03693v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thiago castro ferreira", "ivandre paraboni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03693"}
