We bring the two threads of research together in first proposing a text-based method based on adaptive grids, followed by a hybrid network- and text-based method. Evaluating over three Twitter datasets, we show that the empirical difference between text- and network-based methods is not great, and that hybridisation of the two is superior to the component methods, especially in contexts where the user graph is not well connected. We achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 00:32:33 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04803v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.SI", "authors": ["afshin rahimi", "duy vu", "trevor cohn", "timothy baldwin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.04803"}
