That causes a problem for depending tasks, such as entity linking and relation extraction. We propose a generic and robust approach for high-recall named entity recognition. Our approach is easy to train and offers strong generalization over diverse domain-specific language, such as news documents (e.g. Reuters) or biomedical text (e.g. Medline). Our approach is based on deep contextual sequence learning and utilizes stacked bidirectional LSTM networks. Our model is trained with only few hundred labeled sentences and does not rely on further external knowledge. We report from our results F1 scores in the range of 84-94% on standard datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:06:14 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06757v1", "8 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sebastian arnold", "felix a gers", "torsten kilias", "alexander l\\\"oser"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06757"}
