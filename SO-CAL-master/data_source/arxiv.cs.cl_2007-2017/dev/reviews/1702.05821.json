However, manual editing is expensive so we want to ensure this effort is focused on high-value tasks. And we want to maintain stylistic consistency, a particular challenge in crowd settings. We present a case study, analysing human post-editing in the context of a template-based biography generation system. An edit flow visualisation combined with manual characterisation of edits helps identify and prioritise work for improving end-to-end efficiency and accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 00:23:06 GMT  (73kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05821v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bo han", "will radford", "ana\\\"is cadilhac", "art harol", "rew chisholm", "ben hachey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05821"}
