As a result, automatically classifying reviews according to different requirements evolves as a popular research topic and is very essential in our daily life. In this paper, we focused on reviews of hot TV series in China and successfully trained generic classifiers based on 8 predefined categories. The experimental results showed promising performance and effectiveness of its generalization to different TV series.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 03:33:46 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02378v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:55:40 GMT  (225kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02378v2", "submitted to IDD"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yufeng ma", "long xia", "wenqi shen", "mi zhou", "weiguo fan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02378"}
