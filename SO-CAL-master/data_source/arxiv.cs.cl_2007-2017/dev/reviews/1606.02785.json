We propose an attention-based neural network model that is able to absorb information from multiple text units to construct informative, concise, and fluent summaries. An importance-based sampling method is designed to allow the encoder to integrate information from an important subset of input. Automatic evaluation indicates that our system outperforms state-of-the-art abstractive and extractive summarization systems on two newly collected datasets of movie reviews and arguments. Our system summaries are also rated as more informative and grammatical in human evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 00:15:23 GMT  (162kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02785v1", "NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "wang ling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02785"}
