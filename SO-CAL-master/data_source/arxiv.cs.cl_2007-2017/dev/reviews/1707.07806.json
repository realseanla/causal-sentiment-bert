We propose a new online learning algorithm that searches faster as training progresses. The two key ideas are using macro grammars to cache the abstract patterns of useful logical forms found thus far, and holistic triggering to efficiently retrieve the most relevant patterns based on sentence similarity. On the WikiTableQuestions dataset, we first expand the search space of an existing model to improve the state-of-the-art accuracy from 38.7% to 42.7%, and then use macro grammars and holistic triggering to achieve an 11x speedup and an accuracy of 43.7%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 03:42:40 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07806v1", "EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 23:35:23 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07806v2", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yuchen zhang", "panupong pasupat", "percy liang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07806"}
