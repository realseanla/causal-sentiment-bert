Previous work has shown that modeling soft constraints, where the model is encouraged, but not require to obey the constraints, can substantially improve segmentation performance. On the other hand, for imposing hard constraints, dual decomposition is a popular technique for efficient prediction given existing algorithms for unconstrained inference. We extend the technique to perform prediction subject to soft constraints. Moreover, with a technique for performing inference given soft constraints, it is easy to automatically generate large families of constraints and learn their costs with a simple convex optimization problem during training. This allows us to obtain substantial gains in accuracy on a new, challenging citation extraction dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 05:24:02 GMT  (26kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1349v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 13:27:02 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1349v2", "appears in Proc. the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL2014)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR", "authors": ["sam anzaroot", "alexandre passos", "david belanger", "andrew mccallum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.1349"}
