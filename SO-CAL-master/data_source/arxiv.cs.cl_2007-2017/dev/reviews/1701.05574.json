Sarcasm detection has been a challenging research problem, and its importance for NLP applications such as review summarization, dialog systems and sentiment analysis is well recognized. Sarcasm can often be traced to incongruity that becomes apparent as the full sentence unfolds. This presence of incongruity- implicit or explicit- affects the way readers eyes move through the text. We observe the difference in the behaviour of the eye, while reading sarcastic and non sarcastic sentences. Motivated by his observation, we augment traditional linguistic and stylistic features for sarcasm detection with the cognitive features obtained from readers eye movement data. We perform statistical classification using the enhanced feature set so obtained. The augmented cognitive features improve sarcasm detection by 3.7% (in terms of F-score), over the performance of the best reported system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 19:32:06 GMT  (292kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05574v1", "The 54th Annual Meeting of The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "The 54th Annual Meeting of The Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["abhijit mishra", "diptesh kanojia", "seema nagar", "kuntal dey", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.05574"}
