{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Jul-2017", "title": "A Sub-Character Architecture for Korean Language Processing", "abstract": "We introduce a novel sub-character architecture that exploits a unique compositional structure of the Korean language. Our method decomposes each character into a small set of primitive phonetic units called jamo letters from which character- and word-level representations are induced. The jamo letters divulge syntactic and semantic information that is difficult to access with conventional character-level units. They greatly alleviate the data sparsity problem, reducing the observation space to 1.6% of the original while increasing accuracy in our experiments. We apply our architecture to dependency parsing and achieve dramatic improvement over strong lexical baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 02:09:23 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06341v1", "EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 16:00:50 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06341v2", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["karl stratos"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.06341"}
