Detecting crisis from social media text automatically and accurately can have profound consequences. However, detecting a general state of crisis without explaining why has limited applications. An explanation in this context is a coherent, concise subset of the text that rationalizes the crisis detection. We explore several methods to detect and explain crisis using a combination of neural and non-neural techniques. We evaluate these techniques on a unique data set obtained from Koko, an anonymous emotional support network available through various messaging applications. We annotate a small subset of the samples labeled with crisis with corresponding explanations. Our best technique significantly outperforms the baseline for detection and explanation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 13:44:54 GMT  (120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09585v1", "Accepted at CLPsych, ACL workshop. 8 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at CLPsych, ACL workshop. 8 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["rohan kshirsagar", "robert morris", "sam bowman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09585"}
