In addition to the tagset, we develop a mapping from 25 different treebank tagsets to this universal set. As a result, when combined with the original treebank data, this universal tagset and mapping produce a dataset consisting of common parts-of-speech for 22 different languages. We highlight the use of this resource via two experiments, including one that reports competitive accuracies for unsupervised grammar induction without gold standard part-of-speech tags.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2011 23:06:54 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["slav petrov", "dipanjan das", "ryan mcdonald"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.2086"}
