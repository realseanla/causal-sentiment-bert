This paper demonstrates that neural sequence-to-sequence models obtain state of the art or close to state of the art results on existing datasets. In an effort to make machine transliteration accessible, we open source a new Arabic to English transliteration dataset and our trained models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 19:21:19 GMT  (15kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09565v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["mihaela rosca", "thomas breuel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09565"}
