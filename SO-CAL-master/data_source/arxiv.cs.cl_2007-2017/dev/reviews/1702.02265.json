{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Feb-2017", "title": "Neural Machine Translation with Source-Side Latent Graph Parsing", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel neural machine translation model which jointly learns translation and source-side latent graph representations of sentences. Unlike existing pipelined approaches using syntactic parsers, our end-to-end model learns a latent graph parser as part of the encoder of an attention-based neural machine translation model, so the parser is optimized according to the translation objective. Experimental results show that our model significantly outperforms the previous best results on the standard English-to-Japanese translation dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 03:32:23 GMT  (131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02265v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 01:47:16 GMT  (279kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02265v2", "Add results of using \"Pre-training\" in Table 2 and 3, with analysis on the learned latent graphs and translations"], ["v3", "Sun, 16 Apr 2017 22:46:08 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02265v3", "Reported additional results"], ["v4", "Mon, 24 Jul 2017 14:52:06 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02265v4", "Accepted as a full paper at the 2017 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2017)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kazuma hashimoto", "yoshimasa tsuruoka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.02265"}
