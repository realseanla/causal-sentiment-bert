This metric combines two techniques, one based on sentence length and the other based on compression code length. Experiments on sample test parallel Arabic-English corpora indicate the combination of these two techniques improves accuracy of the identification of satisfactory and unsatisfactory sentence pairs compared to sentence length and compression code length alone. The new method proposed in this research is effective at filtering noise and reducing mis-translations resulting in greatly improved quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 17:49:45 GMT  (2371kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03752v1", "in CCSEA-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in CCSEA-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["saad alkahtani", "wei liu", "william j teahan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.03752"}
