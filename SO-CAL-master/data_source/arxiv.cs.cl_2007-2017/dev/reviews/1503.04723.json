Virality, in our view, is a phenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different effects of persuasive communication are comprised. By exploiting a high-coverage and bilingual corpus of documents containing metrics of their spread on social networks as well as a massive affective annotation provided by readers, we present a thorough analysis of the interplay between evoked emotions and viral facets. We highlight and discuss our findings in light of a cross-lingual approach: while we discover differences in evoked emotions and corresponding viral effects, we provide preliminary evidence of a generalized explanatory model rooted in the deep structure of emotions: the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) circumplex. We find that viral facets appear to be consistently affected by particular VAD configurations, and these configurations indicate a clear connection with distinct phenomena underlying persuasive communication.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 16:43:58 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04723v1", "preprint version of WWW 2015 'Web Science Track' paper"]], "COMMENTS": "preprint version of WWW 2015 'Web Science Track' paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["marco guerini", "jacopo staiano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04723"}
