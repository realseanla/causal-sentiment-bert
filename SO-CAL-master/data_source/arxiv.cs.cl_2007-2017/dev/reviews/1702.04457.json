Phrase mining is important in various tasks including automatic term recognition, document indexing, keyphrase extraction, and topic modeling. Most existing methods rely on complex, trained linguistic analyzers, and thus likely have unsatisfactory performance on text corpora of new domains and genres without extra but expensive adaption. Recently, a few data-driven methods have been developed successfully for extraction of phrases from massive domain-specific text. However, none of the state-of-the-art models is fully automated because they require human experts for designing rules or labeling phrases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 03:35:03 GMT  (1693kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04457v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Mar 2017 19:33:41 GMT  (5373kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04457v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jingbo shang", "jialu liu", "meng jiang", "xiang ren", "clare r voss", "jiawei han"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04457"}
