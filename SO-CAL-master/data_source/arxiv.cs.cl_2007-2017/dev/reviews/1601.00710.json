Using the neural encoder-decoder framework, we explore several combination methods and report up to +4.8 Bleu increases on top of a very strong attention-based neural translation model.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 00:49:22 GMT  (259kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00710v1", "5 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["barret zoph", "kevin knight"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.00710"}
