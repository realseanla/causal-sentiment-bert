Many approaches understandably use subjective categories which are more fine-grained than a straightforward polarity-based spectrum. However, the definition of such categories is non-trivial and, in fact, we argue for a need to incorporate communicative elements even beyond subjectivity. To support our position, we report experiments on a sentiment-labelled corpus of posts taken from a medical support forum. We argue that not only is a more fine-grained approach to text analysis important, but simultaneously recognising the social function behind affective expressions enable a more accurate and valuable level of understanding.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 15:23:31 GMT  (188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01910v1", "9 pages, 1 figure, conference workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 1 figure, conference workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["amit navindgi", "caroline brun", "c\\'ecile boulard masson", "scott nowson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01910"}
