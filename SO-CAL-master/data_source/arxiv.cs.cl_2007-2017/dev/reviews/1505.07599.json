In recent years, word segmentation and POS tagging have undergone great development. The popular method is to regard these two tasks as sequence labeling problem, which can be handled with supervised learning algorithms such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF). However, the performances of the state-of-the-art systems are still relatively low for the informal texts, such as micro-blogs, forums. In this shared task, we wish to investigate the performances of Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging for the micro-blog texts.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 May 2015 08:54:13 GMT  (3kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07599v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 29 May 2015 02:45:24 GMT  (3kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07599v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 18:44:59 GMT  (7kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07599v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xipeng qiu", "peng qian", "liusong yin", "shiyu wu", "xuanjing huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.07599"}
