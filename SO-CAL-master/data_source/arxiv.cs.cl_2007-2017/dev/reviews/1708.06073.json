The system adds a CNN-BLSTM acoustic model to the set of model architectures we combined previously, and includes character-based and dialog session aware LSTM language models in rescoring. For system combination we adopt a two-stage approach, whereby subsets of acoustic models are first combined at the senone/frame level, followed by a word-level voting via confusion networks. We also added a confusion network rescoring step after system combination. The resulting system yields a 5.1\\% word error rate on the 2000 Switchboard evaluation set.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 03:17:23 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06073v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 23:30:37 GMT  (50kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06073v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["w xiong", "l wu", "f alleva", "j droppo", "x huang", "a stolcke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06073"}
