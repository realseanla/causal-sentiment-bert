The purpose of this work two-fold: firstly to show the validity of the developed engine to correctly identify and label the entities of the universe of discourse with a labelled-combined XTM-DITA model. Secondly to explain the improvements achieved in the information retrieval process thanks to the use of a object-oriented database (JPOX) as well as its integration into the Lucene-type database search process to not only accomplish more accurate searches, but to also help the future development of a recommender system. We finish with a brief demo in a 3D-graph of the results of the aforementioned search.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 19:26:20 GMT  (912kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07313v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["piedad garrido", "jesus tramullas", "manuel coll"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07313"}
