The parser uses Stack-LSTMs that compose constituent nodes with dependency-based derivations. In experiments, we show that this model adapts to different styles of dependency relations, but this choice has little effect for predicting constituent structure, suggesting that LSTMs induce useful states by themselves.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 21:38:28 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00489v1", "IWPT 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "IWPT 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["miguel ballesteros", "xavier carreras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00489"}
