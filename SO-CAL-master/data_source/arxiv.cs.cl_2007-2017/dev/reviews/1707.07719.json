In particular, we propose a way to utilize a linear-chain conditional random field output layer for predicting entity types and relations between entities at the same time. Our experiments show that global normalization outperforms a locally normalized softmax layer on a benchmark dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jul 2017 19:39:22 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07719v1", "EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 06:37:55 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07719v2", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["heike adel", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07719"}
