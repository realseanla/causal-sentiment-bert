Experimental results show that the neural network-based parsers perform significantly better than the traditional parsers. We report the highest parsing scores published to date for Vietnamese with the labeled attachment score (LAS) at 73.53% and the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) at 80.66%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 13:14:52 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00995v1", "To appear in Proceedings of the 14th Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of the 14th Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dat quoc nguyen", "mark dras", "mark johnson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00995"}
