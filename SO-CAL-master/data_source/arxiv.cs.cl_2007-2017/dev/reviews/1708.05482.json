It is a much more difficult task compared to emotion classification. Inspired by recent advances in using deep memory networks for question answering (QA), we propose a new approach which considers emotion cause identification as a reading comprehension task in QA. Inspired by convolutional neural networks, we propose a new mechanism to store relevant context in different memory slots to model context information. Our proposed approach can extract both word level sequence features and lexical features. Performance evaluation shows that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on a recently released emotion cause dataset, outperforming a number of competitive baselines by at least 3.01% in F-measure.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 02:07:36 GMT  (363kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05482v1", "Accepted by EMNLP 2017"], ["v2", "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 01:43:43 GMT  (1081kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05482v2", "Accepted by EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lin gui", "jiannan hu", "yulan he", "ruifeng xu", "qin lu", "jiachen du"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.05482"}
