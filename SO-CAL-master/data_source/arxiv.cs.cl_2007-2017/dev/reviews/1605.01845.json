An in-depth investigation of this question has not been previously carried out. Understanding this aspect can contribute to a more efficient selection of candidate sentences which, besides reducing the time required for item writing, can also ensure a higher degree of variability and authenticity. We present a set of relevant aspects collected based on the qualitative analysis of a smaller set of context-dependent corpus example sentences. Furthermore, we implemented a rule-based algorithm using these criteria which achieved an average precision of 0.76 for the identification of different issues related to context dependence. The method has also been evaluated empirically where 80% of the sentences in which our system did not detect context-dependent elements were also considered context-independent by human raters.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 07:30:53 GMT  (184kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01845v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ildik\\'o pil\\'an"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01845"}
