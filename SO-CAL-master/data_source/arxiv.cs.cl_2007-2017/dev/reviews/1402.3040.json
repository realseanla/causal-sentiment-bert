In the MARVS theory, there are two different types of modules: Event Structure Modules and Role Modules. There are also two sets of attributes: Event-Internal Attributes and Role-Internal Attributes, which are linked to the Event Structure Module and the Role Module, respectively. In this study, we focus on four transitive verbs as chi1(eat), wan2(play), huan4(change) and shao1(burn) and explore their event structures by the MARVS theory.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Feb 2014 06:44:24 GMT  (262kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3040v1", "Chinese Lexical Semantics Workshop 2011(CLSW 2011) published in International Journal of Computer Processing of Languages (Vol. 24, No. 01, March 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Chinese Lexical Semantics Workshop 2011(CLSW 2011) published in International Journal of Computer Processing of Languages (Vol. 24, No. 01, March 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jia-fei hong", "kathleen ahrens", "chu-ren huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.3040"}
