Thus, we propose the use of tree-structured Long Short-Term Memory with an attention mechanism that pays attention to each subtree of the parse tree. Experimental results indicate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a Japanese sentiment classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 09:08:46 GMT  (246kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00924v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ryosuke miyazaki", "mamoru komachi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00924"}
