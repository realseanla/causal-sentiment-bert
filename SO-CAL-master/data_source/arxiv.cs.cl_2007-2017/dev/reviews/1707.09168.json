We argue that relevant law articles play an important role in this task, and therefore propose an attention-based neural network method to jointly model the charge prediction task and the relevant article extraction task in a unified framework. The experimental results show that, besides providing legal basis, the relevant articles can also clearly improve the charge prediction results, and our full model can effectively predict appropriate charges for cases with different expression styles.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 09:46:29 GMT  (1455kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09168v1", "10 pages, accepted by EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, accepted by EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["bingfeng luo", "yansong feng", "jianbo xu", "xiang zhang", "dongyan zhao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.09168"}
