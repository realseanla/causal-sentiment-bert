However, current crowdsourcing genre taxonomies lack the concept of cooperation, which is the principal element of modern video games and may potentially drive the annotators' interest. This survey on crowdsourcing taxonomies and cooperation in linguistic resources provides recommendations on using cooperation in existent genres of crowdsourcing and an evidence of the efficiency of cooperation using a popular Russian linguistic resource created through crowdsourcing as an example.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Aug 2014 08:32:49 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4245v1", "Initially submitted to RuSSIR 2014 (this http URL), 9 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 12:23:03 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.4245v2", "11 pages, 2 figures, accepted to RuSSIR 2014, the final publication is available at link.springer.com"]], "COMMENTS": "Initially submitted to RuSSIR 2014 (this http URL), 9 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["dmitry ustalov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.4245"}
