We propose a novel probabilistic classifier that leverages conversational, lexical and semantic information. The approach is evaluated empirically on a set of customer service chat logs from a Chinese e-commerce website. It outperforms heuristic baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 20:33:17 GMT  (669kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02801v1", "AAAI2017 student abstract camera-ready version"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI2017 student abstract camera-ready version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenchao du", "pascal poupart", "wei xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.02801"}
