Given a pair of Spanish-English sentences, each system must estimate their semantic similarity by a score between 0 and 5. In our submission, we use syntax-based, dictionary-based, context-based, and MT-based methods. We also combine these methods in unsupervised and supervised way. Our best run ranked 1st on track 4a with a correlation of 83.02% with human annotations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 10:07:22 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01346v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jeremy ferrero", "frederic agnes", "laurent besacier", "didier schwab"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01346"}
