By positive speech we understand speech that works for the betterment of a given situation, in this case relations between different communities in a conflict-prone country. We worked with four Twitter data sets. Through semi-manual opinion mining, we found that positive speech accounted for &lt; 1% of the data . In fully automated studies, we tested two approaches: unsupervised statistical analysis, and supervised text classification based on distributed word representation. We discuss benefits and challenges of those approaches and report empirical evidence obtained in the study.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 21:49:45 GMT  (832kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08866v1", "13 pages, 6 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 6 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marina sokolova", "vera sazonova", "kanyi huang", "rudraneel chakraboty", "stan matwin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08866"}
