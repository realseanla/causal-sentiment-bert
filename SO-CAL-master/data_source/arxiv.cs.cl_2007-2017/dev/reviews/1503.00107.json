{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Feb-2015", "title": "Non-linear Learning for Statistical Machine Translation", "abstract": "Modern statistical machine translation (SMT) systems usually use a linear combination of features to model the quality of each translation hypothesis. The linear combination assumes that all the features are in a linear relationship and constrains that each feature interacts with the rest features in an linear manner, which might limit the expressive power of the model and lead to a under-fit model on the current data. In this paper, we propose a non-linear modeling for the quality of translation hypotheses based on neural networks, which allows more complex interaction between features. A learning framework is presented for training the non-linear models. We also discuss possible heuristics in designing the network structure which may improve the non-linear learning performance. Experimental results show that with the basic features of a hierarchical phrase-based machine translation system, our method produce translations that are better than a linear model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 09:53:32 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00107v1", "submitted to a conference"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to a conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["shujian huang", "huadong chen", "xinyu dai", "jiajun chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.00107"}
