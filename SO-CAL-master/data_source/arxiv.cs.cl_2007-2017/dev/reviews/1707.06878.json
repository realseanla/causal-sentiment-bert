In word sense disambiguation (WSD), knowledge-based systems tend to be much more interpretable than knowledge-free counterparts as they rely on the wealth of manually-encoded elements representing word senses, such as hypernyms, usage examples, and images. We present a WSD system that bridges the gap between these two so far disconnected groups of methods. Namely, our system, providing access to several state-of-the-art WSD models, aims to be interpretable as a knowledge-based system while it remains completely unsupervised and knowledge-free. The presented tool features a Web interface for all-word disambiguation of texts that makes the sense predictions human readable by providing interpretable word sense inventories, sense representations, and disambiguation results. We provide a public API, enabling seamless integration.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 12:56:06 GMT  (4529kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06878v1", "In Proceedings of the the Conference on Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2017). 2017.
