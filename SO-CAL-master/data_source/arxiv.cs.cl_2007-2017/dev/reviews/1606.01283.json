We improve syntactic performance by using positional contexts, and solve the need to store the PPMI matrix in memory by working on aggregate data in external memory. The effectiveness of both modifications is shown using word similarity and analogy tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 21:39:42 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01283v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["alexandre salle", "marco idiart", "aline villavicencio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01283"}
