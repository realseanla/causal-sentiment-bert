{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Oct-2016", "title": "Civique: Using Social Media to Detect Urban Emergencies", "abstract": "We present the Civique system for emergency detection in urban areas by monitoring micro blogs like Tweets. The system detects emergency related events, and classifies them into appropriate categories like \"fire\", \"accident\", \"earthquake\", etc. We demonstrate our ideas by classifying Twitter posts in real time, visualizing the ongoing event on a map interface and alerting users with options to contact relevant authorities, both online and offline. We evaluate our classifiers for both the steps, i.e., emergency detection and categorization, and obtain F-scores exceeding 70% and 90%, respectively. We demonstrate Civique using a web interface and on an Android application, in realtime, and show its use for both tweet detection and visualization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 09:06:36 GMT  (1228kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04377v1", "This paper was presented at Workshop on Social Data Analytics and Management (SoDAM 2016), at Very Large Databases (VLDB 2016), in September 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper was presented at Workshop on Social Data Analytics and Management (SoDAM 2016), at Very Large Databases (VLDB 2016), in September 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["diptesh kanojia", "vishwajeet kumar", "krithi ramamritham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04377"}
