The paper starts by giving an overview of how events are treated in linguistics and philosophy. We follow this discussion by surveying how events and associated information are handled in computationally. In particular, we look at how textual documents can be mined to extract events and ancillary information. These days, it is mostly through the application of various machine learning techniques. We also discuss applications of event detection and extraction systems, particularly in summarization, in the medical domain and in the context of Twitter posts. We end the paper with a discussion of challenges and future directions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 17:33:39 GMT  (501kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04012v1", "This is work in progress.
