Recently, pruning algorithms for these models have shown to cut a large portion of the graph edges, with minimal damage to the resulting parse trees. Solving the inference problem in run time complexity determined solely by the number of edges (m) is hence of obvious importance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 13:56:25 GMT  (67kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07482v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 07:15:19 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07482v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 14:48:26 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07482v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 22:07:37 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07482v4", "Accepted to ACL 2016, camera ready version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["effi levi", "roi reichart", "ari rappoport"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.07482"}
