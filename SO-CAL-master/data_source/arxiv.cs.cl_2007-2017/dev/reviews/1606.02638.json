To that end, we first create (for experimental purposes) an entailment dataset for the clinical domain, and a highly competitive supervised entailment system, ENT, that is effective (out of the box) on two domains. We then explore self-training and active learning strategies to address the lack of labeled data. With self-training, we successfully exploit unlabeled data to improve over ENT by 15% F-score on the newswire domain, and 13% F-score on clinical data. On the other hand, our active learning experiments demonstrate that we can match (and even beat) ENT using only 6.6% of the training data in the clinical domain, and only 5.8% of the training data in the newswire domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 16:56:19 GMT  (667kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02638v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["chaitanya p shivade", "preethi raghavan", "siddharth patwardhan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02638"}
