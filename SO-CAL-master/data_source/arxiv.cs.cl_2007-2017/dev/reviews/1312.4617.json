This is attributed to the affordability of accessing social network sites such as Twitter, Google+, Facebook and other social network sites through the internet and the web 2.0 technologies. Many people are becoming interested in and relying on the SM for information and opinion of other users on diverse subject matters. It is important to translate sentiment expressed by SM users to useful information using data mining techniques [39]. This underscores the importance of data mining techniques on SM. Data mining techniques are capable of handling the three dominant research issues with SM data which are size, noise and dynamism. This paper reviews data mining techniques currently in use on analysing SM and looked at other data mining techniques that can be considered in the field.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 02:53:38 GMT  (900kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4617v1", "22 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 23:20:08 GMT  (1042kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4617v2", "25 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL", "authors": ["mariam adedoyin-olowe", "mohamed medhat gaber", "frederic stahl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4617"}
