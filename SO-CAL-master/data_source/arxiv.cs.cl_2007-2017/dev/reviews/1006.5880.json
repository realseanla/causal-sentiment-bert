In this paper we provide strong empirical support for SDRT's version of RFC. The analysis of about 100 doubly annotated documents by five different naive annotators shows that SDRT's RFC is respected about 95% of the time. The qualitative analysis of presumed violations that we have performed shows that they are either click-errors or structural misconceptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 15:10:33 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5880v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stergos afantenos", "nicholas asher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.5880"}
