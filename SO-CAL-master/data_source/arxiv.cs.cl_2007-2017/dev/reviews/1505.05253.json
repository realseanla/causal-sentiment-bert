{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-May-2015", "title": "Knowlege Graph Embedding by Flexible Translation", "abstract": "Knowledge graph embedding refers to projecting entities and relations in knowledge graph into continuous vector spaces. State-of-the-art methods, such as TransE, TransH, and TransR build embeddings by treating relation as translation from head entity to tail entity. However, previous models can not deal with reflexive/one-to-many/many-to-one/many-to-many relations properly, or lack of scalability and efficiency. Thus, we propose a novel method, flexible translation, named TransF, to address the above issues. TransF regards relation as translation between head entity vector and tail entity vector with flexible magnitude. To evaluate the proposed model, we conduct link prediction and triple classification on benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that our method remarkably improve the performance compared with several state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 05:57:32 GMT  (801kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05253v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 03:48:55 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05253v2", "This paper has been withdraw by the author due to an error in sec3.1"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jun feng", "mantong zhou", "yu hao", "minlie huang", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.05253"}
