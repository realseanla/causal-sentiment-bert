Much of this is in text form, insurmountable in scope for humans and incomprehensible in structure for computers. Text mining is an expanding field of research that seeks to utilize the information contained in vast document collections. General data mining methods based on machine learning face challenges with the scale of text data, posing a need for scalable text mining methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 02:49:27 GMT  (4651kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02332v1", "PhD Thesis, Computer Science, University of Waikato, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "PhD Thesis, Computer Science, University of Waikato, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["antti puurula"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02332"}
