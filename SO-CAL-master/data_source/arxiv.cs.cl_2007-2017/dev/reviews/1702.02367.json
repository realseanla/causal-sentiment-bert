In a scenario in which the user profile can be considered as a question, intelligent agents able to answer questions can be used to find the most relevant answers for a given user. In this work we propose a novel model based on Artificial Neural Networks to answer questions with multiple answers by exploiting multiple facts retrieved from a knowledge base. The model is evaluated on the factoid Question Answering and top-n recommendation tasks of the bAbI Movie Dialog dataset. After assessing the performance of the model on both tasks, we try to define the long-term goal of a conversational recommender system able to interact using natural language and to support users in their information seeking processes in a personalized way.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 10:58:02 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02367v1", "Paper accepted and presented at the Deep Understanding and Reasoning: A challenge for Next-generation Intelligent Agents (URANIA) workshop, held in the context of the AI*IA 2016 conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper accepted and presented at the Deep Understanding and Reasoning: A challenge for Next-generation Intelligent Agents (URANIA) workshop, held in the context of the AI*IA 2016 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["claudio greco", "alessandro suglia", "pierpaolo basile", "gaetano rossiello", "giovanni semeraro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02367"}
