It has gained its importance in e-learning applications, mobile service based applications and project management tools. User's decisions on software acquisitions are often ad hoc or based on preference due to difficulty in quantitatively measure software quality-in-use. However, why quality-in-use measurement is difficult? Although there are many software quality models to our knowledge, no works surveys the challenges related to software quality-in-use measurement. This paper has two main contributions; 1) presents major issues and challenges in measuring software quality-in-use in the context of the ISO SQuaRE series and related software quality models, 2) Presents a novel framework that can be used to predict software quality-in-use, and 3) presents preliminary results of quality-in-use topic prediction. Concisely, the issues are related to the complexity of the current standard models and the limitations and incompleteness of the customized software quality models. The proposed framework employs sentiment analysis techniques to predict software quality-in-use.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Jan 2015 06:51:42 GMT  (402kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07676v1", "9 pages, 4 figures, Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences, Vol. 5, No. 11, November 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures, Journal of Emerging Trends in Computing and Information Sciences, Vol. 5, No. 11, November 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL", "authors": ["issa atoum", "chih how bong", "narayanan kulathuramaiyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07676"}
