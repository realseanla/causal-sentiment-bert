The Moses-based system was optimised for the news domain and differs from other available systems in four ways: (1) News items are automatically categorised on the source side, before translation; (2) Named entity translation is optimised by recognising and extracting them on the source side and by re-inserting their translation in the target language, making use of a separate entity repository; (3) News titles are translated with a separate translation system which is optimised for the specific style of news titles; (4) The system was optimised for speed in order to cope with the large volume of daily news articles.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 18:25:10 GMT  (780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2943v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["marco turchi", "martin atkinson", "alastair wilcox", "brett crawley", "stefano bucci", "ralf steinberger", "erik van der goot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.2943"}
