Interaction between these two families takes the form of linear distributivity principles. We study proof nets for the Lambek-Grishin calculus and the correspondence between these nets and unfocused and focused versions of its sequent calculus.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 19:16:20 GMT  (70kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6384v1", "Revised version to appear as a chapter in E.
