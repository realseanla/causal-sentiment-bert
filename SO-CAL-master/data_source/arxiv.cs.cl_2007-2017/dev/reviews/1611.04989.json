The shared task was to predict Part of Speech (POS) tag at word level for a given text. The code-mixed text is generated mostly on social media by multilingual users. The presence of the multilingual words, transliterations, and spelling variations make such content linguistically complex. In this paper, we propose an approach to POS tag code-mixed social media text using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture. We submitted the results for Hindi-English (hi-en), Bengali-English (bn-en), and Telugu-English (te-en) code-mixed data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 19:02:35 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04989v1", "7 pages, Published at the Tool Contest on POS tagging for Indian Social Media Text, ICON 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 04:28:06 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04989v2", "7 pages, Published at the Tool Contest on POS tagging for Indian Social Media Text, ICON 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, Published at the Tool Contest on POS tagging for Indian Social Media Text, ICON 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["raj nath patel", "prakash b pimpale", "m sasikumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04989"}
