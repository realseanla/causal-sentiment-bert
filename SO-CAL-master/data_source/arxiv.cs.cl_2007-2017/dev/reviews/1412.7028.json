{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Dec-2014", "title": "Joint RNN-Based Greedy Parsing and Word Composition", "abstract": "This paper introduces a greedy parser based on neural networks, which leverages a new compositional sub-tree representation. The greedy parser and the compositional procedure are jointly trained, and tightly depends on each-other. The composition procedure outputs a vector representation which sumarrizes syntactically (parsing tags) and semantically (words) sub-trees. Composition and tagging is achieved over continuous (word or tag) representations, and recurrent neural networks. We reach F1 performance on par with well-known existing parsers, while having the advantage of speed, thanks to the greedy nature of the parser.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 15:40:31 GMT  (257kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7028v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v2", "Thu, 25 Dec 2014 17:39:39 GMT  (260kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7028v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 15:04:34 GMT  (260kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7028v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v4", "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 21:57:49 GMT  (273kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7028v4", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["jo\\\"el legrand", "ronan collobert"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7028"}
