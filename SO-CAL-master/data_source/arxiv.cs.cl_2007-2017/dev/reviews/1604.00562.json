{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Apr-2016", "title": "Reasoning about Pragmatics with Neural Listeners and Speakers", "abstract": "We present a model for pragmatically describing scenes, in which contrastive behavior results from a combination of inference-driven pragmatics and learned semantics. Like previous learned approaches to language generation, our model uses a simple feature-driven architecture (here a pair of neural \"listener\" and \"speaker\" models) to ground language in the world. Like inference-driven approaches to pragmatics, our model actively reasons about listener behavior when selecting utterances. For training, our approach requires only ordinary captions, annotated _without_ demonstration of the pragmatic behavior the model ultimately exhibits. In human evaluations on a referring expression game, our approach succeeds 81% of the time, compared to a 64% success rate using existing techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 21:52:03 GMT  (1172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00562v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 13:48:20 GMT  (932kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00562v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["jacob andreas", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.00562"}
