In this paper we present an information-theoretic approach based on the Minimum Message Length Criterion for solv­ ing the Lexical Access Problem. We model sentences using phoneme realizations seen in training, and word and part-of-speech informa­ tion obtained from text corpora. We show res­ ults on multiple-speaker, continuous, read speech and discuss a heuristic using equivalence classes of similar sounding words which speeds up the recognition process without significant deteriora­ tion in recognition accuracy.",
