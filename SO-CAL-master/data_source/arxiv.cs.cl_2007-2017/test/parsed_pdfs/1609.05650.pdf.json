      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Dialect Identification (DID) problem is a special case of the more general problem of Language Identification (LID). LID refers to the process of automatically identifying the language class for given speech segment or text document, while DID classifies between dialects within the same language class, making it a more challenging task than LID. A good DID system used as a front-end to an automatic speech recognition system, can help improve the recognition performance\nby providing dialectal data for acoustic and language model adaptation to the specific dialect being spoken [1].\nIn this work, we focus on Arabic DID which can can be posed as a five class classification problem, given that the Arabic language can be divided into five major dialects; Egyptian (EGY), Gulf (GLF), Lavantine (LAV), Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and North African (NOR) [2].\nOver the past decade, great advances have been made in the field of automatic language identification (LID). Research effort has focused on coming up with mathematical representations of speech utterances, that encodes the information about the language being spoken. These approaches are also known as Vector Space Modeling approaches [3], where speech utterances are represented by a continuous vector of high dimensions. Two predominant Vector Space Modeling approaches are Phonotactic and Acoustic. Phonotactic approaches attempt to model the n-gram phone statistics of speech. Phone sequences for each utterance are extracted using one or multiple phone recognisers. A Vector Space Model (VSM) is then constructed using a term-document matrix [4], followed by an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [5] to map the high dimensional feature space to a low dimensional Vector Subspace (Section 2.1), giving a Phonotactic VSM. In other cases, a phone n-gram language model is used to model the phone statistics instead of a VSM [6, 7, 8]. On the other hand, Acoustic approaches attempt to extract dialect discriminative information from speech using low level acoustic features, such as pitch, prosody, shifted delta ceptral coefficients, bottleneck features [9, 10]. One of the most successful acoustic approaches is, the use of i-Vector framework for LID, where i-Vectors are extracted for each speech utterance, using an i-Vector extractor that consists of a GMM-UBM trained on top of BNF, followed by a Total Variability Subspace Model [2, 11]. The extracted i-Vectors give an Acoustic VSM (Section 2.2). These methods are also used for DID.\nEach of the two VSMs is used as an input to a back-end discriminative classifier, which is trained to find a suitable decision boundary in these vector spaces. This gives us two DID\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n05 65\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 Se\np 20\nsystems built using the Acoustic and Phonotactic VSMs. At prediction time, output scores from the two DID systems are combined to give a final score, on the basis of which classification decision is made. This model combination approach has been shown to give performace improvements on the DID task [2]. This also shows that the two systems are complementary to each other, which leads us to investigate a feature space combination approach i.e. to construct a single VSM by combining Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs, in an attempt to encode useful discriminative information in that single VSM.\nIn this work, we present a feature space combination approach. We form a combined VSM that incorporates useful information, necessary for DID, from both the Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs. To achieve this goal, we make use of the well known multi-view dimensionality reduction technique known as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), devloped by H. Hotelling [12] (Section 2.3). We show the performance of the combined VSM on Arabic DID task and compare it against the performance of Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs used alone (Section 5). CCA VSM shows superior performance. The advantages of our feature space combination approach over model combination are two fold: Only one backend classifier needs to be trained and; Unlabeled data from other domain can easily be used in CCA framework to construct the single VSM. In this work, we do not experiment with unlabeled data and leave it as an extension to our current work."

Details about the phone recognizer can be found in [2]. VSM is constructed in two steps; 1) Construct a term-document matrix, X ∈ RN×d (See Fig 1), where each speech utterance in represented by a Phonotactic feature vector, p = (f(p, s1), f(p, s2), . . . , f(p, sd)) ∈ Rd×1, where N is the number of speech utterances and f(p, s) is the number of times a phone n-gram (term) s appears in the utterance (document) p and 2) Perform Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (Equation 2) on X to learn a lower dimensional linear manifold, Π ∈ Rd×k, where k << d. SVD attempts to discover the latent structure in the high dimensional feature space. Note that, k is the number of largest singular values.

      "text" : "Acoustic VSM is constructed in two steps; 1) Extracting the bottleneck features (BNF) from speech and 2) Modeling BNF using the i-Vector extraction framework.\nWe use the same Deep Neural Network (DNN) based ASR system to extract the BNF as in our previous works [2, 13]. Two DNNs are used with 5 hidden layers and 1 Bottleneck Layer, all having sigmoidal neurons. Tied-phone states are used as the target to the DNNs. The target labels of dimension 3040 are provided by a GMM-HMM baseline system trained on 60 hours of Arabic Broadcast speech [14]. Input to the DNN consists of 11 consecutive frames stacked together, where for each frame 23 fbank features along with pitch and voicing probability are extracted. The output of the BN layer from the first DNN are fed as inputs to the second DNN, which acts as a correction DNN for the first model. Time offsets at the input layer of the second DNN are -10, -5, 0, 5 and 10, giving an overall context of 31 frames at the input of the second DNN. The BNF from the first DNN are used in the i-Vector modeling framework.\ni-Vector modeling framework consists of building a GMM-UBM on a large amount of data using acoustic features (BNF), to model the dialectal feature space. The sufficient statistics of the GMM-UBM give a general idea of the data spread in the high dimensional Vector Space. GMM-UBM mean supervector is updated while adapting it to each utterance. This update information is encoded in a low dimensional latent vector known as an i-Vector. The latent variable model used to extract i-Vector is called Total Variability Subspace Model and is given by the equation:\nM = u+ Tv\nwhere u is GMM-UBM mean supervector. v is the latent vector, known as the i − V ector and T is the lower dimensional Vector Subspace. The parameters of the model are estimated using Maximum Likelihood training criterion. For a detailed explanation of i-Vector modeling framework, reader is directed to excellent work in [15, 11].\nIn this work, GMM-UBM model has 2048 gaussian components, MFCC features are extracted using a 25 ms window and the i-Vectors are 400 dimensional [2].\nFinally, we construct the acoustic VSM, XA ∈ RN×400, where the ith row is the 400 dimensional i-Vector representation corresponding to the speech utterance, ai. We also perform Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Within Class Co-variance Normalization (WCCN) on the Acoustic Vector Space, to increase the discriminative strength of the VSM. This method has been shown to improve DID (LID) performance [2, 11]."

Nodes of the graph represent Random Variables (RVs) and the structure encodes conditional independence assumptions. XP and XA are the Random Variables corresponding to the Phonotactic and Acoustic views of the data. Each data view is associated with two latent variables; 1) ZC , which is shared, and is the variable of interest that will form the final combined VSM, ZC and 2) φp and φa, which are the subspaces associated with the Phontactic and Acoustic views, respectively. CCA attempts to estimate φp and φa such that the correlation between the projections of the phonotactic feature vectors, p, on φp and acoustic feature vectors, a, on φa are maximized. Hence, CCA can be posed as the following optimization problem [16].\n[φp, φa] = arg max φp,φa φTp CXPXAφa√ φTp CXPXP φa √ φTaCXAXAφa\nThe above optimization formualtion can be massaged into the following eigenvalue problem.

The shared VSM is then fed to a back-end discriminative classifier. In our case, we use multi-class logistic regression, also known as softmax classification for DID [19, 20].\nThe parameter settings used for the softmax classifier can be found in Table 3. We use elastic net regularization i.e. using both an L1 and L2 regularizer. Stochastic Gradient Descent is used for learning the model parameters. Log-entropy loss function is used as the model training objective.\n1https://github.com/Qatar-Computing-Research-Institute/dialectID"

      "text" : "Table 4 gives performance of different VSMs on Arabic DID task. The standalone Phonotactic VSM, XP, performs rather poorly as compared to the standalone Acoustic VSM, XA. CCA VSM, ZC, which is formed by combining XP and XA using CCA performs better than both standalone VSMs, which is an expected outcome because ZC carries dialect discriminative information from both XP and XA.\nFurther improvements in performance are due to performing LDA and WCCN on ZC. LDA is a supervised dimensionality reduction technique that form a lower dimensional Vector Subspace such that the class separability between the data points is maximized, and hence the performance gain that we see due to LDA is to be expected. An interesting observation to note is that the LDA based Acoustic VSM, XA+LDA+WCCN, performs at par with the LDA based CCA VSM, ZC+LDA+WCCN. This shows that some of the useful discriminative information from the Acoustic VSM is lost while performing CCA and hence we finally concatenate the two LDA based VSMs to get the final accuracy of 60% on the DID task."

The single VSM constructed performed better than any of the Phonotcatic or Acoustic VSMs alone, but the LDA based CCA and Acoustic VSMs performed at par on the DID taks, while their combination gave us our best VSM for Arabic DID. We conclude that some dialect specific discriminative information is lost while performing CCA between Acoustic and Phonotactic VSMs and hence the final combination performs better. CCA is an unsupervised method and can easily incorporate unlabeled data from a different domain and act as a domain adaptation or semi-supervised learning method such as co-training as shown in [21]. We leave co-training and domain adaptation using CCA for our future work."

    "abstractText" : "In this work, we present a new Vector Space Model (VSM) of speech utterances for the task of spoken dialect identification. Generally, DID systems are built using two sets of features that are extracted from speech utterances; acoustic and phonetic. The acoustic and phonetic features are used to form vector representations of speech utterances in an attempt to encode information about the spoken dialects. The Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs, thus formed, are used for the task of DID. The aim of this paper is to construct a single VSM that encodes information about spoken dialects from both the Phonotactic and Acoustic VSMs. Given the two views of the data, we make use of a well known multi-view dimensionality reduction technique known as Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), to form a single vector representation for each speech utterance that encodes dialect specific discriminative information from both the phonetic and acoustic representations. We refer to this approach as feature space combination approach and show that our CCA based feature vector representation performs better on the Arabic DID task than the phonetic and acoustic feature representations used alone. We also present the feature space combination approach as a viable alternative to the model based combination approach, where two DID systems are built using the two VSMs (Phonotactic and Acoustic) and the final prediction score is the output score combination from the two systems.",
