Using a computational framework that formalizes the theory of Contrastive Analysis (CA), we demonstrate that language specific error distributions in ESL writing can be predicted from the typological properties of the native language and their relation to the typology of English. Our typology driven model enables to obtain accurate estimates of such distributions without access to any ESL data for the target languages. Furthermore, we present a strategy for adjusting our method to low-resource languages that lack typological documentation using a bootstrapping approach which approximates native language typology from ESL texts. Finally, we show that our framework is instrumental for linguistic inquiry seeking to identify first language factors that contribute to a wide range of difficulties in second language acquisition.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:59:45 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07609v1", "Published in CoNLL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in CoNLL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yevgeni berzak", "roi reichart", "boris katz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07609"}
