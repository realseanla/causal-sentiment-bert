POS is a fundamental element in natural language. However, state-of-the-art word embedding models fail to consider it. This paper proposes to use position-dependent POS relevance weighting matrices to model the inherent syntactic relationship among words within a context window. We utilize the POS relevance weights to model each word-context pairs during the word embedding training process. The model proposed in this paper paper jointly optimizes word vectors and the POS relevance matrices. Experiments conducted on popular word analogy and word similarity tasks all demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 18:22:39 GMT  (507kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07695v1", "Word embeddings"]], "COMMENTS": "Word embeddings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["quan liu", "zhen-hua ling", "hui jiang", "yu hu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07695"}
