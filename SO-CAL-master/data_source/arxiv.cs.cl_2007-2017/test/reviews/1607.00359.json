It is also at the heart of most state-of-the-art speech recognition systems since the 70's. However, from Gaussian mixture models HMMs (GMM-HMM) to deep neural network HMMs (DNN-HMM), the underlying Markovian chain of state-of-the-art models did not changed much. The \"left-to-right\" topology is mostly always employed because very few other alternatives exist. In this paper, we propose that finely-tuned HMM topologies are essential for precise temporal modelling and that this approach should be investigated in state-of-the-art HMM system. As such, we propose a proof-of-concept framework for learning efficient topologies by pruning down complex generic models. Speech recognition experiments that were conducted indicate that complex time dependencies can be better learned by this approach than with classical \"left-to-right\" models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 19:20:50 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00359v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["s\\'ebastien gagnon", "jean rouat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00359"}
