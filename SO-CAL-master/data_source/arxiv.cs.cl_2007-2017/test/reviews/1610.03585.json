Research in natural language dialogue should focus on designing communicative agents which can integrate themselves into these contexts and productively collaborate with humans. In this abstract, we propose a general situated language learning paradigm which is designed to bring about robust language agents able to cooperate productively with humans.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 02:45:45 GMT  (14kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03585v1", "5 pages, submitted to Machine Intelligence @ NIPS workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, submitted to Machine Intelligence @ NIPS workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jon gauthier", "igor mordatch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03585"}
