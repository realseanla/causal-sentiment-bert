The user controls the device through voice, where the speech-to-music ratio can be as low as -30 dB during music playback. We propose a speech enhancement front-end that relies on known robust methods for echo cancellation, double-talk detection, and noise suppression, as well as a novel adaptive quasi-binary mask that is well suited for speech recognition. The optimization of the system is then formulated as a large scale nonlinear programming problem where the recognition rate is maximized and the optimal values for the system parameters are found through a genetic algorithm. We validate our methodology by testing over the TIMIT database for different music playback levels and noise types. Finally, we show that the proposed front-end allows a natural interaction with the device for limited-vocabulary voice commands.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 14:37:47 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1379v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL", "authors": ["ramin pichevar", "jason wung", "daniele giacobello", "joshua atkins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1379"}
