We conduct an initial investigation that uses a matrix consisting of the parameters of a logistic regression classifier trained on a plausibility task as a transitive verb function. We compare our method to a commonly used corpus-based method for constructing a verb matrix.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 16:57:34 GMT  (123kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7942v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 14:19:29 GMT  (143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7942v2", "Full updated paper for NIPS learning semantics workshop, with some minor errata fixed"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tamara polajnar", "laura rimell", "stephen clark"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.7942"}
