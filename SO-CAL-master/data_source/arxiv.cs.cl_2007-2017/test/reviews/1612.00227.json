On the other hand, text based tasks for event recognition, as for example event coreference (i.e. recognizing whether two textual descriptions refer to the same event), do not take into account ontological information of the extracted events in their process. In this paper, we propose a method to derive event coreference on text extracted event data using semantic based rule reasoning. We demonstrate our method considering a limited (yet representative) set of event types: we introduce a formal analysis on their ontological properties and, on the base of this, we define a set of coreference criteria. We then implement these criteria as RDF-based reasoning rules to be applied on text extracted event data. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach over a standard coreference benchmark dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 12:58:02 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00227v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["stefano borgo", "loris bozzato", "alessio palmero aprosio", "marco rospocher", "luciano serafini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00227"}
