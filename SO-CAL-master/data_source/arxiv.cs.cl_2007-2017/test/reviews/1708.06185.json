The system combines lexical, syntactic and pre-trained word embedding features, trains them on general regressors and finally combines the best performing models to create an ensemble. The proposed system stood 3rd out of 22 systems in the leaderboard of WASSA-2017 Shared Task on Emotion Intensity.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 12:30:48 GMT  (245kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06185v1", "In Proceedings of the EMNLP 2017 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment, and Social Media (WASSA), September 2017, Copenhagen, Denmark"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of the EMNLP 2017 Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment, and Social Media (WASSA), September 2017, Copenhagen, Denmark", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["venkatesh duppada", "sushant hiray"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06185"}
