While existing approaches assume access to structured environment representations or use a pipeline of separately trained models, we learn a single model to jointly reason about linguistic and visual input. We use reinforcement learning in a contextual bandit setting to train a neural network agent. To guide the agent's exploration, we use reward shaping with different forms of supervision. Our approach does not require intermediate representations, planning procedures, or training different models. We evaluate in a simulated environment, and show significant improvements over supervised learning and common reinforcement learning variants.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 03:12:57 GMT  (2383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08795v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 15:10:11 GMT  (4607kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08795v2", "In Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dipendra kumar misra", "john langford", "yoav artzi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08795"}
