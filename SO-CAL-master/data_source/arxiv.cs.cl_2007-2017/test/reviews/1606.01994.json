{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Jun-2016", "title": "CFO: Conditional Focused Neural Question Answering with Large-scale Knowledge Bases", "abstract": "How can we enable computers to automatically answer questions like \"Who created the character Harry Potter\"? Carefully built knowledge bases provide rich sources of facts. However, it remains a challenge to answer factoid questions raised in natural language due to numerous expressions of one question. In particular, we focus on the most common questions --- ones that can be answered with a single fact in the knowledge base. We propose CFO, a Conditional Focused neural-network-based approach to answering factoid questions with knowledge bases. Our approach first zooms in a question to find more probable candidate subject mentions, and infers the final answers with a unified conditional probabilistic framework. Powered by deep recurrent neural networks and neural embeddings, our proposed CFO achieves an accuracy of 75.7% on a dataset of 108k questions - the largest public one to date. It outperforms the current state of the art by an absolute margin of 11.8%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 01:36:07 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01994v1", "Accepted into ACL2015"], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 03:04:38 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01994v2", "Accepted by ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted into ACL2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["zihang dai", "lei li", "wei xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.01994"}
