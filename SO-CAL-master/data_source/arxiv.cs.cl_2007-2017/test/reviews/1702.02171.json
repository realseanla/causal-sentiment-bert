We achieve the state of the art in two well-studied QA datasets, WikiQA and SemEval-2016 (Task 3A), through a basic transfer learning technique from SQuAD. For WikiQA, our model outperforms the previous best model by more than 8%. We demonstrate that finer supervision provides better guidance for learning lexical and syntactic information than coarser supervision, through quantitative results and visual analysis. We also show that a similar transfer learning procedure achieves the state of the art on an entailment task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 19:22:06 GMT  (784kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02171v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 17:15:18 GMT  (236kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02171v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 19:38:38 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02171v3", "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors because of insufficient experimental results"], ["v4", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 14:47:24 GMT  (663kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02171v4", "Published as a conference paper at ACL 2017 (short paper)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sewon min", "min joon seo", "hannaneh hajishirzi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.02171"}
