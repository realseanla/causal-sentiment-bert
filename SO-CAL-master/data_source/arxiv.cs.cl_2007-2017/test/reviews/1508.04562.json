This paper introduces two probabilistic topic models, Correlated LDA (C-LDA) and Correlated HDP (C-HDP). These address problems that can arise when analyzing large, asymmetric, and potentially weakly-related collections. Topic correlations in weakly-related collections typically lie in the tail of the topic distribution, where they would be overlooked by models unable to fit large numbers of topics. To efficiently model this long tail for large-scale analysis, our models implement a parallel sampling algorithm based on the Metropolis-Hastings and alias methods (Yuan et al., 2015). The models are first evaluated on synthetic data, generated to simulate various collection-level asymmetries. We then present a case study of modeling over 300k documents in collections of sciences and humanities research from JSTOR.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 08:30:37 GMT  (748kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04562v1", "EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["jingwei zhang", "aaron gerow", "jaan altosaar", "james evans", "richard jean so"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.04562"}
