Experiments are conducted on a rescore task on the PTB data set. It is shown that NCE-trained bi-directional NNLM outperformed the one trained by conventional maximum likelihood training. But still(regretfully), it did not out-perform the baseline uni-directional NNLM.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 07:27:49 GMT  (453kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06064v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 02:51:34 GMT  (458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06064v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 02:00:23 GMT  (458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06064v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tianxing he", "yu zhang", "jasha droppo", "kai yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06064"}
