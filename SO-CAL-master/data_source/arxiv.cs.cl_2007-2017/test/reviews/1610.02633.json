In particular, we present the first steps towards the development of a real-world Hindi-English machine translation system for doctor-patient communication. As this is a low-resource language pair, especially for speech and for the medical domain, our initial focus has been on gathering suitable training data from various sources. We applied a variety of methods ranging from fully automatic extraction from the Web to manual annotation of test data. Moreover, we developed a method for automatically augmenting the training data with synthetically generated variants, which yielded a very sizable improvement of more than 3 BLEU points absolute.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 06:42:02 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02633v1", "CICLING-2016: 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics, Keywords: Machine Translation, medical translation, doctor-patient communication, resource-poor languages, Hindi"]], "COMMENTS": "CICLING-2016: 17th International Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics, Keywords: Machine Translation, medical translation, doctor-patient communication, resource-poor languages, Hindi", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ahmad musleh", "nadir durrani", "irina temnikova", "preslav nakov", "stephan vogel", "osama alsaad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02633"}
