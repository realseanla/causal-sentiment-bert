Most existing methods only consider direct relations in representation learning. We argue that multiple-step relation paths also contain rich inference patterns between entities, and propose a path-based representation learning model. This model considers relation paths as translations between entities for representation learning, and addresses two key challenges: (1) Since not all relation paths are reliable, we design a path-constraint resource allocation algorithm to measure the reliability of relation paths. (2) We represent relation paths via semantic composition of relation embeddings. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that, as compared with baselines, our model achieves significant and consistent improvements on knowledge base completion and relation extraction from text.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 08:22:49 GMT  (164kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00379v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 15 Aug 2015 09:28:49 GMT  (166kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00379v2", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["yankai lin", "zhiyuan liu", "huan-bo luan", "maosong sun", "siwei rao", "song liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.00379"}
