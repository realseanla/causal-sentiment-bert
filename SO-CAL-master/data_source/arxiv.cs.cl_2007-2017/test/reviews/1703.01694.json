Zipf in 1935, is a classic empirical law that holds across a wide range of human languages. We demonstrate that length is one aspect of a much more general property of words: how distinctive they are with respect to other words in a language. Distinctiveness plays a critical role in recognizing words in fluent speech, in that it reflects the strength of potential competitors when selecting the best candidate for an ambiguous signal. Phonological information content, a measure of a word's string probability under a statistical model of a language's sound or character sequences, concisely captures distinctiveness. Examining large-scale corpora from 13 languages, we find that distinctiveness significantly outperforms word length as a predictor of frequency. This finding provides evidence that listeners' processing constraints shape fine-grained aspects of word forms across languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 00:38:51 GMT  (3231kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01694v1", "14 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 18:40:08 GMT  (3447kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01694v2", "16 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["stephan c meylan", "thomas l griffiths"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01694"}
