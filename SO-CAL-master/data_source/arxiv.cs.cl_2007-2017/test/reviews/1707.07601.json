Our model learns a common representation for images and their descriptions in two different languages (which need not be parallel) by considering the image as a pivot between two languages. We introduce a new pairwise ranking loss function which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric similarity between the two modalities. We evaluate our models on image-description ranking for German and English, and on semantic textual similarity of image descriptions in English. In both cases we achieve state-of-the-art performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jul 2017 15:08:13 GMT  (385kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.07601v1", "7 pages, EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV", "authors": ["spandana gella", "rico sennrich", "frank keller", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.07601"}
