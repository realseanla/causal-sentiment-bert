We carried out a number of experiments using the results of the two editions of the Discriminating between Similar Languages (DSL) shared task. We investigate the progress made between the two tasks, estimate an upper bound on possible performance using ensemble and oracle combination, and provide learning curves to help us understand which languages are more challenging. A number of difficult sentences are identified and investigated further with human annotation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 20:57:52 GMT  (321kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00031v1", "Proceedings of Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["cyril goutte", "serge l\\'eger", "shervin malmasi", "marcos zampieri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00031"}
