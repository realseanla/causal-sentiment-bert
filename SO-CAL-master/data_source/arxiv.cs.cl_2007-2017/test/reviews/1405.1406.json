WSD was recently addressed as a combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of senses that maximize the semantic relatedness among the target words. In this article, a novel algorithm for solving the WSD problem called D-Bees is proposed which is inspired by bee colony optimization (BCO)where artificial bee agents collaborate to solve the problem. The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a standard dataset (SemEval 2007 coarse-grained English all-words task corpus)and is compared to simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and two ant colony optimization techniques (ACO). It will be observed that the BCO and ACO approaches are on par.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 May 2014 19:26:35 GMT  (25kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1406v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sallam abualhaija", "karl-heinz zimmermann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1406"}
