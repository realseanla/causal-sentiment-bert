However, previous work has not investigated situations in which we would like to control the length of encoder-decoder outputs. This capability is crucial for applications such as text summarization, in which we have to generate concise summaries with a desired length. In this paper, we propose methods for controlling the output sequence length for neural encoder-decoder models: two decoding-based methods and two learning-based methods. Results show that our learning-based methods have the capability to control length without degrading summary quality in a summarization task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 00:01:27 GMT  (2968kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09552v1", "11 pages.
