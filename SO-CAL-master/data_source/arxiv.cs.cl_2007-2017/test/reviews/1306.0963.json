{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Jun-2013", "title": "Inferring Robot Task Plans from Human Team Meetings: A Generative Modeling Approach with Logic-Based Prior", "abstract": "We aim to reduce the burden of programming and deploying autonomous systems to work in concert with people in time-critical domains, such as military field operations and disaster response. Deployment plans for these operations are frequently negotiated on-the-fly by teams of human planners. A human operator then translates the agreed upon plan into machine instructions for the robots. We present an algorithm that reduces this translation burden by inferring the final plan from a processed form of the human team's planning conversation. Our approach combines probabilistic generative modeling with logical plan validation used to compute a highly structured prior over possible plans. This hybrid approach enables us to overcome the challenge of performing inference over the large solution space with only a small amount of noisy data from the team planning session. We validate the algorithm through human subject experimentation and show we are able to infer a human team's final plan with 83% accuracy on average. We also describe a robot demonstration in which two people plan and execute a first-response collaborative task with a PR2 robot. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates a logical planning technique within a generative model to perform plan inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 02:17:11 GMT  (182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0963v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-13)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Seventh AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-13)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.RO stat.ML", "authors": ["been kim", "caleb m chacha", "julie a shah"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.0963"}
