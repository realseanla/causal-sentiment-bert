We present the first system for this problem applied to a realistic multi-speaker dataset, the CALLHOME Spanish-English speech translation corpus. Our approach uses unsupervised term discovery (UTD) to cluster repeated patterns in the audio, creating a pseudotext, which we pair with translations to create a parallel text and train a simple bag-of-words MT model. We identify the challenges faced by the system, finding that the difficulty of cross-speaker UTD results in low recall, but that our system is still able to correctly translate some content words in test data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 16:30:23 GMT  (348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03856v1", "To appear in EACL 2017 (short papers)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in EACL 2017 (short papers)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["sameer bansal", "herman kamper", "adam lopez", "sharon goldwater"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03856"}
