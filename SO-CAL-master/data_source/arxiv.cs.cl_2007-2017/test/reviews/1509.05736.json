In this article a new sentence dataset for software quality-in-use is proposed. Three experts were chosen to annotate the data using a proposed annotation scheme. Then the data were reconciled in a (no match eliminate) process to reduce bias. The Kappa, k statistics revealed an acceptable level of agreement; moderate to substantial agreement between the experts. The built data can be used to evaluate software quality-in-use models in sentiment analysis models. Moreover, the annotation scheme can be used to extend the current dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 18:19:48 GMT  (192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05736v1", "6 pages,3 figures, conference Proceedings of 9th International Conference on IT in Asia CITA (2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages,3 figures, conference Proceedings of 9th International Conference on IT in Asia CITA (2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.CL", "authors": ["issa atoum", "chih how bong", "narayanan kulathuramaiyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05736"}
