In this paper we study the different types of links in Wikipedia, and contrast the use of the full graph with respect to just direct links. We apply a well-known random walk algorithm on two tasks, word relatedness and named-entity disambiguation. We show that using the full graph is more effective than just direct links by a large margin, that non-reciprocal links harm performance, and that there is no benefit from categories and infoboxes, with coherent results on both tasks. We set new state-of-the-art figures for systems based on Wikipedia links, comparable to systems exploiting several information sources and/or supervised machine learning. Our approach is open source, with instruction to reproduce results, and amenable to be integrated with complementary text-based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 15:08:21 GMT  (52kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01655v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 23:10:41 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01655v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["eneko agirre", "er barrena", "aitor soroa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01655"}
