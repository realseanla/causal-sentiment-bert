However, NL instructions are usually ambiguous and abstract so that the machines may misunderstand and incorrectly execute the task. To address this NL-based human-machine communication problem and enable the machines to appropriately execute tasks by following the end-user's NL instructions, we developed a Machine-Executable-Plan-Generation (exePlan) method. The exePlan method conducts task-centered semantic analysis to extract task-related information from ambiguous NL instructions. In addition, the method specifies machine execution parameters to generate a machine-executable plan by interpreting abstract NL instructions. To evaluate the exePlan method, an industrial robot Baxter was instructed by NL to perform three types of industrial tasks {'drill a hole', 'clean a spot', 'install a screw'}. The experiment results proved that the exePlan method was effective in generating machine-executable plans from the end-user's NL instructions. Such a method has the promise to endow a machine with the ability of NL-instructed task execution.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 04:06:47 GMT  (1155kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06468v1", "16 pages, 10 figures, article submitted to Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 2016 Aug"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 10 figures, article submitted to Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 2016 Aug", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.RO", "authors": ["rui liu", "xiaoli zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06468"}
