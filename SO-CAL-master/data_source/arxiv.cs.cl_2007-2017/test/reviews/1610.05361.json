In this paper, we extend existing end-to-end attention-based models that can be applied for Distant Speech Recognition (DSR) task. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end attention-based speech recognizer with multichannel input that performs sequence prediction directly at the character level. To gain a better performance, we also incorporate Highway long short-term memory (HLSTM) which outperforms previous models on AMI distant speech recognition task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 21:16:56 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05361v1", "8 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hassan taherian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05361"}
