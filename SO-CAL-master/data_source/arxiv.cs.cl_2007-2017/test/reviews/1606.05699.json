We instead aim to generate socially-informed timelines that contain both news article summaries and selected user comments. We present an optimization framework designed to balance topical cohesion between the article and comment summaries along with their informativeness and coverage of the event. Automatic evaluations on real-world datasets that cover four complex events show that our system produces more informative timelines than state-of-the-art systems. In human evaluation, the associated comment summaries are furthermore rated more insightful than editor's picks and comments ranked highly by users.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 22:52:09 GMT  (256kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05699v1", "NAACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "claire cardie", "galen marchetti"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.05699"}
