In our work this technique is used in combination with the detection of vocatives - the explicit forms of address used by the characters in a novel. We take advantage of the fact that certain vocatives indicate family relations between speakers. The extracted relations are then propagated using a set of rules. We report the results of the application of our method to Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 May 2014 16:07:19 GMT  (416kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0603v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["aibek makazhanov", "denilson barbosa", "grzegorz kondrak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0603"}
