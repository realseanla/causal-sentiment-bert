Existing methods typically rely on surface lexical and syntactic information. Yet, research in psychology shows that patterns of human conceptualisation, such as metaphorical framing, are reliable predictors of human expectations and decisions. In this paper, we present a method to learn patterns of metaphorical framing from large text collections, using statistical techniques. We apply the method to data in three different languages and evaluate the identified patterns, demonstrating their psychological validity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 17:58:23 GMT  (549kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09019v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["ekaterina shutova", "patricia lichtenstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09019"}
