We use labeled data from a high-resource language to increase performance on a low-resource language. In experiments on 21 language pairs from four different language families, we obtain up to 58% higher accuracy than without transfer and show that even zero-shot and one-shot learning are possible. We further find that the degree of language relatedness strongly influences the ability to transfer morphological knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 20:39:38 GMT  (971kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00052v1", "Accepted at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["katharina kann", "ryan cotterell", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.00052"}
