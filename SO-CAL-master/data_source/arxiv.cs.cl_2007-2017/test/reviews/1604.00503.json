On the other hand, it comes up with a new scheme TF-KLD-KNN to learn the discriminative weights of words and phrases specific to paraphrase task, so that a weighted sum of embeddings can represent sentences more effectively. Based on these two innovations we get competitive state-of-the-art performance on paraphrase identification.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 13:57:02 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00503v1", "NAACL'2015"]], "COMMENTS": "NAACL'2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["wenpeng yin", "hinrich sch\\\"utze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.00503"}
