Putting Numbers in Perspective with Compositional Descriptions", "abstract": "How much is 131 million US dollars? To help readers put such numbers in context, we propose a new task of automatically generating short descriptions known as perspectives, e.g. \"$131 million is about the cost to employ everyone in Texas over a lunch period\". First, we collect a dataset of numeric mentions in news articles, where each mention is labeled with a set of rated perspectives. We then propose a system to generate these descriptions consisting of two steps: formula construction and description generation. In construction, we compose formulae from numeric facts in a knowledge base and rank the resulting formulas based on familiarity, numeric proximity and semantic compatibility. In generation, we convert a formula into natural language using a sequence-to-sequence recurrent neural network. Our system obtains a 15.2% F1 improvement over a non-compositional baseline at formula construction and a 12.5 BLEU point improvement over a baseline description generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 00:20:41 GMT  (1726kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00070v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["arun tejasvi chaganty", "percy liang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.00070"}
