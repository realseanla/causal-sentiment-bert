We apply ConvNets to various large-scale datasets, including ontology classification, sentiment analysis, and text categorization. We show that temporal ConvNets can achieve astonishing performance without the knowledge of words, phrases, sentences and any other syntactic or semantic structures with regards to a human language. Evidence shows that our models can work for both English and Chinese.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 20:45:19 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01710v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 21:32:01 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01710v2", "This article contains a notification regarding dataset issues in the first page"], ["v3", "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 03:45:02 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01710v3", "Dataset duplicate issues fixed"], ["v4", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 04:42:29 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01710v4", "This technical report is superseded by a paper entitled \"Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification\",arXiv:1509.01626.
