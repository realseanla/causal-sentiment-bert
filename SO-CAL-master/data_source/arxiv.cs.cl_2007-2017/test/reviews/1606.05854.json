However, most existing BRNN models extract the information of questions and answers by directly using a pooling operation to generate the representation for loss or similarity calculation. Hence, these existing models don't put supervision (loss or similarity calculation) at every time step, which will lose some useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel BRNN model called full-time supervision based BRNN (FTS-BRNN), which can put supervision at every time step. Experiments on the factoid QA task show that our FTS-BRNN can outperform other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Jun 2016 11:03:47 GMT  (726kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05854v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 01:47:06 GMT  (726kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05854v2", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["dong xu", "wu-jun li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05854"}
