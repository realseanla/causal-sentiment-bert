End-to-end training using gradient descent is suggested, similarly to the training of connectionist temporal classification (CTC). We use a maximum a-posteriori (MAP) criterion with a simple language model in the training stage, and a standard HMM decoder without approximations. Recognition results are presented using speech databases. Our method compares favorably to CTC in terms of performance, robustness and quality of alignments.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 08:40:19 GMT  (876kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10356v1", "Submitted to Interspeech 2017"], ["v2", "Sun, 16 Jul 2017 15:12:39 GMT  (1184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10356v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Interspeech 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CL cs.NE", "authors": ["lior fritz", "david burshtein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10356"}
