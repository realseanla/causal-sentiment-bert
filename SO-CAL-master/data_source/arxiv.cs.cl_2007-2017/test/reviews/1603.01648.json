Yet, while much semantic structure is indeed expressed by syntax, many phenomena are not easily read out of dependency trees, often leading to further ad-hoc heuristic post-processing or to information loss. To directly address the needs of semantic applications, we present PropS -- an output representation designed to explicitly and uniformly express much of the proposition structure which is implied from syntax, and an associated tool for extracting it from dependency trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 22:47:46 GMT  (246kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01648v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["gabriel stanovsky", "jessica ficler", "ido dagan", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01648"}
