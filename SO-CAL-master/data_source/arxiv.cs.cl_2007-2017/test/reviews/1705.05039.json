A variation of our model is also discussed when discourse relations are treated as latent variables. Experimental results on two popular meeting corpora show that our joint model can outperform state-of-the-art approaches for both phrase-based content selection and discourse relation prediction tasks. We also evaluate our model on predicting the consistency among team members' understanding of their group decisions. Classifiers trained with features constructed from our model achieve significant better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 May 2017 23:45:49 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05039v1", "Accepted by ACL 2017. 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ACL 2017. 11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["kechen qin", "lu wang", "joseph kim"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.05039"}
