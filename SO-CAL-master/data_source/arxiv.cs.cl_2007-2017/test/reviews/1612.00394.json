But, these tasks only evaluate lexical semantics indirectly. In this paper, we study whether it is possible to utilize distributed representations to generate dictionary definitions of words, as a more direct and transparent representation of the embeddings' semantics. We introduce definition modeling, the task of generating a definition for a given word and its embedding. We present several definition model architectures based on recurrent neural networks, and experiment with the models over multiple data sets. Our results show that a model that controls dependencies between the word being defined and the definition words performs significantly better, and that a character-level convolution layer designed to leverage morphology can complement word-level embeddings. Finally, an error analysis suggests that the errors made by a definition model may provide insight into the shortcomings of word embeddings.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 19:42:37 GMT  (133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00394v1", "To appear in AAAI Conference 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in AAAI Conference 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["thanapon noraset", "chen liang", "larry birnbaum", "doug downey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.00394"}
