However, this dataset is too simple and too small for learning true reasoning abilities. \\cite{hermann2015teaching} therefore release a large scale news article dataset and propose a deep LSTM reader system for machine comprehension. However, the training process is expensive. We therefore try feature-engineered approach with semantics on the new dataset to see how traditional machine learning technique and semantics can help with machine comprehension. Meanwhile, our proposed L2R reader system achieves good performance with efficiency and less training data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 05:05:05 GMT  (947kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03284v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 May 2016 01:06:09 GMT  (947kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03284v2", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["tian tian", "yuezhang li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.03284"}
