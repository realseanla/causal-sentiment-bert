{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jun-2016", "title": "Query-Reduction Networks for Question Answering", "abstract": "We present Query-Regression Network (QRN), a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is suitable for end-to-end machine comprehension. While previous work largely relied on external memory and attention mechanism, QRN is a single recurrent unit with internal memory. Unlike most RNN-based models, QRN is able to effectively handle long-term dependencies and is highly parallelizable. In our experiments we show that QRN outperforms the state of the art in end-to-end bAbI QA tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 21:54:46 GMT  (111kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04582v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 21:54:45 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04582v2", "9 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 10:07:22 GMT  (514kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04582v3", "Title of the paper has changed from \"Query-Regression Networks for Machine Comprehension\""], ["v4", "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 00:05:06 GMT  (514kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04582v4", "Title of the paper has changed from \"Query-Regression Networks for Machine Comprehension\""], ["v5", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 22:04:54 GMT  (517kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04582v5", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017.
