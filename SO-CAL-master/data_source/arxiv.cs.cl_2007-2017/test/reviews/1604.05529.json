We address these issues and evaluate bi-LSTMs with word, character, and unicode byte embeddings for POS tagging. We compare bi-LSTMs to traditional POS taggers across languages and data sizes. We also present a novel bi-LSTM model, which combines the POS tagging loss function with an auxiliary loss function that accounts for rare words. The new model obtains state-of-the-art performance across 22 languages, and works especially well for morphologically complex languages. Our analysis suggests that bi-LSTMs are less sensitive to training data size and label corruptions (at small noise levels) than previously assumed.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 11:53:09 GMT  (415kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05529v1", "To appear in ACL 2016 (short)"], ["v2", "Thu, 19 May 2016 15:28:03 GMT  (579kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05529v2", "In ACL 2016 (short)"], ["v3", "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 08:17:43 GMT  (578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05529v3", "In ACL 2016 (short)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2016 (short)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["barbara plank", "anders s\u00f8gaard", "yoav goldberg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.05529"}
