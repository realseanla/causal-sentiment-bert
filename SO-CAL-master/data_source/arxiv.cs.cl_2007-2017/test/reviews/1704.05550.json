However, it has remained a serious challenge. Here, we first prove empirical limits on the recall (and F1-scores) of extractive summarizers on the DUC datasets under ROUGE evaluation for both the single-document and multi-document summarization tasks. Next we define the concept of compressibility of a document and present a new model of summarization, which generalizes existing models in the literature and integrates several dimensions of the summarization, viz., abstractive versus extractive, single versus multi-document, and syntactic versus semantic. Finally, we examine some new and existing single-document summarization algorithms in a single framework and compare with state of the art summarizers on DUC data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 22:21:22 GMT  (141kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05550v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR", "authors": ["rakesh verma", "daniel lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05550"}
