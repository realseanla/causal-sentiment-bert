The character composition model shows great improvement over the word-lookup model, especially for parsing agglutinative languages. These improvements are even better than using pre-trained word embeddings from extra data. On the SPMRL data sets, our system outperforms the previous best greedy parser (Ballesteros et al., 2015) by a margin of 3% on average.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 18:23:18 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10814v1", "Accepted in ACL 2017 (Short)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in ACL 2017 (Short)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["xiang yu", "ngoc thang vu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.10814"}
