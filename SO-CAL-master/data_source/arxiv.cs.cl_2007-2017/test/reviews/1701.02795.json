To perform machine translation between ASL and English, we utilize a generative approach. Specifically, we employ an adjustment to the IBM word-alignment model 1 (IBM WAM1), where we define language models for English and ASL, as well as a translation model, and attempt to generate a translation that maximizes the posterior distribution defined by these models. Then, using these models, we are able to quantify the concepts of fluency and faithfulness of a translation between languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 21:45:56 GMT  (238kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02795v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hardie cate", "zeshan hussain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02795"}
