The goal of the task is to identify if a given word in a given context is \"simple\" or \"complex\". Our system relies on linguistic features and cognitive complexity. We used several supervised models, however the Random Forest model outperformed the others. Overall our best configuration achieved a G-score of 68.8% in the task, ranking our system 21 out of 45.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 19:34:02 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02843v1", "In Proceedings of the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval-2016), a workshop of the 15th Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies (NAACL-2016) pp 982-985.
