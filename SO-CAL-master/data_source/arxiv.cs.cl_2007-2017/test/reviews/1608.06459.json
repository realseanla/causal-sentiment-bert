As different actors weigh in, texts change as they are drafted and redrafted, reflecting political preferences and power. This study provides a novel solution to the prob- lem of detecting amendments to political text based upon minimum edit distances. We demonstrate the usefulness of two language-insensitive, transparent, and efficient minimum-edit-distance algorithms suited for the task. These algorithms are capable of providing an account of the types (insertions, deletions, substitutions, and trans- positions) and substantive amount of amendments made between version of texts. To illustrate the usefulness and efficiency of the approach we replicate two existing stud- ies from the field of legislative studies. Our results demonstrate that minimum edit distance methods can produce superior measures of text amendments to hand-coded efforts in a fraction of the time and resource costs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 10:55:23 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06459v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CY", "authors": ["henrik hermansson", "james p cross"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06459"}
