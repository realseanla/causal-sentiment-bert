Unlike all other top systems of semantic dependency parsing that have to rely on a pipeline framework to chain up a series of submodels each specialized for a specific subtask, the one presented in this article integrates everything into one model, in hopes of achieving desirable integrity and practicality for real applications while maintaining a competitive performance. This integrative approach tackles semantic parsing as a word pair classification problem using a maximum entropy classifier. We leverage adaptive pruning of argument candidates and large-scale feature selection engineering to allow the largest feature space ever in use so far in this field, it achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the evaluation data set for CoNLL-2008 shared task, on top of all but one top pipeline system, confirming its feasibility and effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:45:39 GMT  (265kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6050v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["hai zhao", "xiaotian zhang", "chunyu kit"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.6050"}
