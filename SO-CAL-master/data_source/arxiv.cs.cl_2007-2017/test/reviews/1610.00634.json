We show that orthographic syllable level translation significantly outperforms models trained over other basic units (word, morpheme and character) when training over small parallel corpora.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 16:53:10 GMT  (160kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00634v1", "7 pages, 1 figure, compiled with XeTex, to be published at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure, compiled with XeTex, to be published at the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["anoop kunchukuttan", "pushpak bhattacharyya"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.00634"}
