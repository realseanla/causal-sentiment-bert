Ideally, however, debates would be won on the merits, as a function of which side has the stronger arguments. We propose a predictive model of debate that estimates the effects of linguistic features and the latent persuasive strengths of different topics, as well as the interactions between the two. Using a dataset of 118 Oxford-style debates, our model's combination of content (as latent topics) and style (as linguistic features) allows us to predict audience-adjudicated winners with 74% accuracy, significantly outperforming linguistic features alone (66%). Our model finds that winning sides employ stronger arguments, and allows us to identify the linguistic features associated with strong or weak arguments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 00:21:03 GMT  (435kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05040v1", "Accepted by TACL, 14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by TACL, 14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["lu wang", "nick beauchamp", "sarah shugars", "kechen qin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.05040"}
