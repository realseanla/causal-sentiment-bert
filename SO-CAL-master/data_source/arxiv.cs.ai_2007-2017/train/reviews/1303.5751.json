We look at two definitions for such partial MAPs, and prove important properties that are useful in designing algorithms for computing them effectively. We make use of these properties in modifying our standard MAP best-first algorithm, so as to handle irrelevance-based partial MAPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:33:28 GMT  (315kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5751v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["solomon eyal shimony"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5751"}
