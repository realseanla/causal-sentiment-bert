It was originally designed in UML with textual constraints, and in this report we present its formalisations in FOL and OWL, which accompanies the paper that describes, discusses, and analyses the KF metamodel in detail. These new formalizations contribute to give a precise meaning to the metamodel, to understand its complexity properties and to provide a basis for future implementations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 21:56:59 GMT  (599kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6545v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.LO", "authors": ["pablo r fillottrani", "c maria keet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6545"}
