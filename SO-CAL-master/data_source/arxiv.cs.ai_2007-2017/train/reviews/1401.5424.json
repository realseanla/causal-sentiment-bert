In much of the literature, AI systems have been limited to playing one game. Although, this specialization has resulted in stronger AI gaming systems it does not address the key concerns of AI researcher. AI researchers seek the development of AI agents that can autonomously interpret learn, and apply new knowledge. To achieve human level performance, current AI systems rely on game specific knowledge of an expert. The paper presents the full RTS language in hopes of shifting the current research focus to the development of general RTS agents. General RTS agents are AI gaming systems that can play any RTS games, defined in the RTS language. This prevents game specific knowledge from being hard coded into the system, thereby facilitating research that addresses the fundamental concerns of artificial intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 19:14:22 GMT  (729kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5424v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["roy hayes", "peter beling", "william scherer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5424"}
