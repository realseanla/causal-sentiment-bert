{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-May-2015", "title": "Automating change of representation for proofs in discrete mathematics", "abstract": "Representation determines how we can reason about a specific problem. Sometimes one representation helps us find a proof more easily than others. Most current automated reasoning tools focus on reasoning within one representation. There is, therefore, a need for the development of better tools to mechanise and automate formal and logically sound changes of representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 May 2015 22:14:55 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02449v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daniel raggi", "alan bundy", "gudmund grov", "alison pease"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02449"}
