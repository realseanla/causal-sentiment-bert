Trained only on sequences from a known grammar, though, they can still struggle to learn rules and constraints of the grammar.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 15:35:16 GMT  (185kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09231v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 04:00:12 GMT  (185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09231v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["matthew amodio", "swarat chaudhuri", "thomas reps"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09231"}
