In addition, conception of universal exploiters within object-oriented dynamic networks is also discussed. The main result of the paper is introduction of new exploiters-based knowledge extraction approach, which provides generation of a finite set of new classes of objects, based on the basic set of classes. The methods for calculation of quantity of new classes, which can be obtained using proposed approach, and of quantity of types, which each of them describes, are proposed. Proof that basic set of classes, extended according to proposed approach, together with union exploiter create upper semilattice is given. The approach always allows generating of finitely defined set of new classes of objects for any object-oriented dynamic network. A quantity of these classes can be precisely calculated before the generation. It allows saving of only basic set of classes in the knowledge base.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 17:21:37 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04206v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dmytro terletskyi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04206"}
