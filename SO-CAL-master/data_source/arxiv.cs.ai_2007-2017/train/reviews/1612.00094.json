As this decision criterion is not always suitable, we propose in this paper an algorithm for computing a policy optimal for the quantile criterion. Both finite and infinite horizons are considered. Finally we experimentally evaluate our approach on random MDPs and on a data center control problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 00:55:23 GMT  (430kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00094v1", "Long version of AAAI 2017 paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1611.00862"]], "COMMENTS": "Long version of AAAI 2017 paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1611.00862", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hugo gilbert", "paul weng", "yan xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.00094"}
