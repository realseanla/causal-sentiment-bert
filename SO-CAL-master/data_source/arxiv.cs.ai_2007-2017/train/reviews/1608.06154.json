However, in many domains degradation may not follow a pattern. We propose a Long Short Term Memory based Encoder-Decoder (LSTM-ED) scheme to obtain an unsupervised health index (HI) for a system using multi-sensor time-series data. LSTM-ED is trained to reconstruct the time-series corresponding to healthy state of a system. The reconstruction error is used to compute HI which is then used for RUL estimation. We evaluate our approach on publicly available Turbofan Engine and Milling Machine datasets. We also present results on a real-world industry dataset from a pulverizer mill where we find significant correlation between LSTM-ED based HI and maintenance costs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 12:59:31 GMT  (1237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06154v1", "Presented at 1st ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Machine Learning for Prognostics and Health Management, San Francisco, CA, USA, 2016. 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at 1st ACM SIGKDD Workshop on Machine Learning for Prognostics and Health Management, San Francisco, CA, USA, 2016. 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["pankaj malhotra", "vishnu tv", "anusha ramakrishnan", "gaurangi anand", "lovekesh vig", "puneet agarwal", "gautam shroff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06154"}
