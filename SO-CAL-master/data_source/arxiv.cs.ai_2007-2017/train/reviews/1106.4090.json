Refinement also brings with it additional proof obligations -- requiring a developer to discover properties relating to their design decisions. With the goal of reducing this burden, we have investigated how a general purpose theory formation tool, HR, can be used to automate the discovery of such properties within the context of Event-B. Here we develop a heuristic approach to the automatic discovery of invariants and report upon a series of experiments that we undertook in order to evaluate our approach. The set of heuristics developed provides systematic guidance in tailoring HR for a given Event-B development. These heuristics are based upon proof-failure analysis, and have given rise to some promising results.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 05:24:01 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4090v1", "In Proceedings Refine 2011,arXiv:1106.3488"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings Refine 2011,arXiv:1106.3488", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["maria teresa llano", "rew ireland", "alison pease"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.4090"}
