However, they are also slow, requiring a complete re-execution of the program on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals. C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls. We show that on several common models, C3 reduces proposal runtime by 20-100x, in some cases reducing runtime complexity from linear in model size to constant. We also demonstrate nearly an order of magnitude speedup on a complex inverse procedural modeling application.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Sep 2015 19:35:42 GMT  (891kb,AD)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02151v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 17:53:35 GMT  (891kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02151v2", "Fix typo in author name"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["daniel ritchie", "reas stuhlm\\\"uller", "noah d goodman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.02151"}
