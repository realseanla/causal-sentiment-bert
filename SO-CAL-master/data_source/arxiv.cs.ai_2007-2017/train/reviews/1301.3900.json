As multidimensional possibilistic models have been studied for several years, the demand for analogous tools in possibility theory seems to be quite natural. This paper is intended to be a promotion of de Cooman's measure-theoretic approcah to possibility theory, as this approach allows us to find analogies to many important results obtained in probabilistic framework. First, we recall semi-graphoid properties of conditional possibilistic independence, parameterized by a continuous t-norm, and find sufficient conditions for a class of Archimedean t-norms to have the graphoid property. Then we introduce Markov properties and factorization of possibility distrubtions (again parameterized by a continuous t-norm) and find the relationships between them. These results are accompanied by a number of conterexamples, which show that the assumptions of specific theorems are substantial.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:53:09 GMT  (380kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3900v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jirina vejnarova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3900"}
