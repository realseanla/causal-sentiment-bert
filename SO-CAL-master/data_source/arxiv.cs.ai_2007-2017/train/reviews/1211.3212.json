{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Nov-2012", "title": "Distributed Non-Stochastic Experts", "abstract": "We consider the online distributed non-stochastic experts problem, where the distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to $k$ sites, and the sites are required to communicate with each other via the coordinator. At each time-step $t$, one of the $k$ site nodes has to pick an expert from the set ${1, ..., n}$, and the same site receives information about payoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to minimize regret at time horizon $T$, while simultaneously keeping communication to a minimum.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Nov 2012 06:45:38 GMT  (1706kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3212v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["varun kanade", "zhenming liu", "bozidar radunovic"], "accepted": true, "id": "1211.3212"}
