Which level of local consistency should be used when searching for solutions in a constraint network is a basic question. Arc consistency and partial forms of arc consistency have been widely studied, and have been known for sometime through the forward checking or the MAC search algorithms. Until recently, stronger forms of local consistency remained limited to those that change the structure of the constraint graph, and thus, could not be used in practice, especially on large networks. This paper focuses on the local consistencies that are stronger than arc consistency, without changing the structure of the network, i.e., only removing inconsistent values from the domains. In the last five years, several such local consistencies have been proposed by us or by others. We make an overview of all of them, and highlight some relations between them. We compare them both theoretically and experimentally, considering their pruning efficiency and the time required to enforce them.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:54:17 GMT  (139kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0671v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["c bessiere", "r debruyne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0671"}
