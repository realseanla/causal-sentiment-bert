On this basis, the concept of vague partition is introduced, further, the concept of fuzzy set introduced by Zadeh in 1965 is redefined based on vague partition from the perspective of axiomatization. The thesis defended in this paper is that the relationship among vague attribute values should be the starting point to recognize and model vague phenomena from a quantitative view.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 11:27:45 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08665v1", "25 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1506.07821"]], "COMMENTS": "25 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1506.07821", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xiaodong pan", "yang xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08665"}
