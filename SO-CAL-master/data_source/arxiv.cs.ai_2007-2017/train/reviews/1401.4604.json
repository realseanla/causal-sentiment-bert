The lack of completeness guarantees, however, may be unacceptable for applications in areas such as health care and defence, where missing answers can adversely affect the applications functionality. Furthermore, even if an application can tolerate some level of incompleteness, it is often advantageous to estimate how many and what kind of answers are being lost.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:10:03 GMT  (775kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4604v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["bernardo cuenca grau", "boris motik", "giorgos stoilos", "ian horrocks"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4604"}
