We identify two important tasks to solve towards this objective, 1 group students so that they can maximally benefit from peer interaction and 2 find an optimal schedule of the educational material for each group. Thus, in this paper, we solve the problem of team formation and content scheduling for education. Given a time frame d, a set of students S with their required need to learn different activities T and given k as the number of desired groups, we study the problem of finding k group of students. The goal is to teach students within time frame d such that their potential for learning is maximized and find the best schedule for each group. We show this problem to be NP-hard and develop a polynomial algorithm for it. We show our algorithm to be effective both on synthetic as well as a real data set. For our experiments, we use real data on students' grades in a Computer Science department. As part of our contribution, we release a semi-synthetic dataset that mimics the properties of the real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 03:47:54 GMT  (704kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08762v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sanaz bahargam", "d\\'ora erdos", "azer bestavros", "evimaria terzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08762"}
