But how are we to evaluate artificial systems if we are not certain how to measure these capabilities in living systems, let alone how to define life or intelligence? Here I survey a concrete metric towards measuring abstract properties of natural and artificial systems, such as the ability to react to the environment and to control one's own behaviour.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 22:35:48 GMT  (634kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6703v1", "21 pages, Springer Cosmos Series Book on Metrics of sensory motor integration in robots and animals"], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 16:17:35 GMT  (634kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6703v2", "21 pages, Springer Cosmos Series Book on Metrics of sensory motor integration in robots and animals"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, Springer Cosmos Series Book on Metrics of sensory motor integration in robots and animals", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["hector zenil"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6703"}
