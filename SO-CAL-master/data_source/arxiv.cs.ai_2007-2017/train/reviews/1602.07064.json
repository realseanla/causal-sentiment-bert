The major advantage of this algorithm is the capability to leverage the information inherent to the hierarchical structures of taxonomies to infer correspondences which can allow to merge them in a later step. This method is particular relevant in scenarios where taxonomy alignment techniques exploiting textual information from taxonomy nodes cannot operate successfully.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 07:33:02 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07064v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["jorge martinez-gil"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07064"}
