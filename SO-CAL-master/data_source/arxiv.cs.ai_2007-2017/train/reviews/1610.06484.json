The proposed system can tune both its parameters and architecture in an online mode. It can be used for solving a wide range of Data Mining tasks (namely time series forecasting). The evolving cascade system with neo-fuzzy nodes can process rather large data sets with high speed and effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:27:11 GMT  (288kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06484v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["zhengbing hu", "yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "olena o boiko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06484"}
