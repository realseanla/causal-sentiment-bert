We propose a method that can discover and interpolate between context dependent high-level actions or body-affordances. These provide an abstract, low-dimensional interface indexing high-dimensional and time- extended action policies. Our method is related to recent ap- proaches in the machine learning literature but is conceptually simpler and easier to implement. More specifically our method requires the choice of a n-dimensional target sensor space that is endowed with a distance metric. The method then learns an also n-dimensional embedding of possibly reactive body-affordances that spread as far as possible throughout the target sensor space.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 04:07:57 GMT  (372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04391v1", "4 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["nicholas guttenberg", "martin biehl", "ryota kanai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04391"}
