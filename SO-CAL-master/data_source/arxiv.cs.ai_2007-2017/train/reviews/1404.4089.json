While such a polytime Apply function is known to exist for certain languages (e.g., OBDDs) and not exist for others (e.g., DNNF), its existence for certain languages remains unknown. Among the latter is the recently introduced language of Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs), for which a polytime Apply function exists for unreduced SDDs, but remains unknown for reduced ones (i.e. canonical SDDs). We resolve this open question in this paper and consider some of its theoretical and practical implications. Some of the findings we report question the common wisdom on the relationship between bottom-up compilation, language canonicity and the complexity of the Apply function.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 21:43:41 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4089v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guy van den broeck", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.4089"}
