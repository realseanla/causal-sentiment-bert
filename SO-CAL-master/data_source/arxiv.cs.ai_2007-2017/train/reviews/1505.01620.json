In the past we developed the notion of development graphs as a means to represent and maintain structured theories. In this paper we present a methodology and a resulting implementation to reveal the hidden structure of flat theories by transforming them into detailed development graphs. We review our approach using plain TSTP-representations of MIZAR articles obtaining more structured and also more concise theories.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 May 2015 08:16:19 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01620v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["serge autexier", "dieter hutter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.01620"}
