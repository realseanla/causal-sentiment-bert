The main goal of building a portfolio is to diversify the search process being carried out by each thread. As soon as one thread finishes, the instance can be deemed solved. In this paper we present a new open source distributed solver for MaxSAT solving that addresses two issues commonly found in multicore parallel solvers, namely memory contention and scalability. Preliminary results show that our non-portfolio distributed MaxSAT solver outperforms its sequential version and is able to solve more instances as the number of processes increases.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 May 2015 16:55:42 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02408v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["miguel neves", "in\\^es lynce", "vasco manquinho"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02408"}
