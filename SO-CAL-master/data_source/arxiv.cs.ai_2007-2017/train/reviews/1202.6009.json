SDC methods are either based on masking the original data, generating synthetic versions of them or creating hybrid versions by combining original and synthetic data. The choice of SDC methods for categorical data, especially nominal data, is much smaller than the choice of methods for numerical data. We mitigate this problem by introducing a numerical mapping for hierarchical nominal data which allows computing means, variances and covariances on them.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 17:37:20 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6009v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["josep domingo-ferrer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.6009"}
