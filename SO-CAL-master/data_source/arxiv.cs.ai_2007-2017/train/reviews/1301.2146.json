It is well known, as the logical foundation of the Semantic Web, description logic is lack of the ability of tolerating inconsistent or incomplete data. Recently, the ability of paraconsistent approaches in Semantic Web is weaker in this paper, we present a tableau algorithm based on sign transformation in Semantic Web which holds the stronger ability of reasoning. We prove that the tableau algorithm is decidable which hold the same function of classical tableau algorithm for consistent knowledge bases.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 15:07:22 GMT  (428kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2146v1", "11 pages, in Chinese; the 4th Chinese Semantic Web Symposium (CSWS 2010), Beijing, China"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, in Chinese; the 4th Chinese Semantic Web Symposium (CSWS 2010), Beijing, China", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xiaowang zhang", "guohui xiao", "zuoquan lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2146"}
