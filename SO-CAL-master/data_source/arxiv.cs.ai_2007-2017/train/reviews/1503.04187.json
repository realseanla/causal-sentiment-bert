To date, introductions to this theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends mainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological values can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and secondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by gradient descent on model parameters (the free-energy principle). The notion of active inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive neuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 18:58:25 GMT  (360kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04187v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["simon mcgregor", "manuel baltieri", "christopher l buckley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04187"}
