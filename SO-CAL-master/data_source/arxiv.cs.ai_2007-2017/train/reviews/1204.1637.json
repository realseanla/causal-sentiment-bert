We start with basics of DBN where we especially focus in Inference and Learning concepts and algorithms. Then we will present different levels and methods of creating DBNs as well as approaches of incorporating temporal dimension in static Bayesian network.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Apr 2012 13:55:29 GMT  (367kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1637v1", "9 pages, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 2, No. 7, 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, (IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, Vol. 2, No. 7, 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nabil ghanmy", "mohamed ali mahjoub", "najoua essoukri ben amara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1637"}
