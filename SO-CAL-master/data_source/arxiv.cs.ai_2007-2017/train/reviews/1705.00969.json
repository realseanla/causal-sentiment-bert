This paper presents the problem of coincidence within the framework of a first order logical theory formalising temporal multiple recurrence of two sequences of fixed duration eventualities and presents a solution to it The coincidence problem is described as: if two complex eventualities (or eventuality sequences) consisting respectively of component eventualities x0, x1,....,xr and y0, y1, ..,ys both recur over an interval k and all eventualities are of fixed durations, is there a sub-interval of k over which the incidence xt and yu for t between 0..r and s between 0..s coincide. The solution presented here formalises the intuition that a solution can be found by temporal projection over a cycle of the multiple recurrence of both sequences.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 16:54:18 GMT  (250kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00969v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1705.00211"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1705.00211", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["b o akinkunmi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00969"}
