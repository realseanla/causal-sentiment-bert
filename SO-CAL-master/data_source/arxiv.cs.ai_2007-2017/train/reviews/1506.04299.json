Connections between query causality and consistency-based diagnosis and database repairs (wrt. integrity constrain violations) have been established in the literature. In this work we establish connections between query causality and abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem. The unveiled relationships allow us to obtain new complexity results for query causality -the main focus of our work- and also for the two other areas.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Jun 2015 17:33:47 GMT  (22kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04299v1", "To appear in Proc.
