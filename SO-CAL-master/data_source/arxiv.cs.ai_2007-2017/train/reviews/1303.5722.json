{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Mar-2013", "title": "Time-Dependent Utility and Action Under Uncertainty", "abstract": "We discuss representing and reasoning with knowledge about the time-dependent utility of an agent's actions. Time-dependent utility plays a crucial role in the interaction between computation and action under bounded resources. We present a semantics for time-dependent utility and describe the use of time-dependent information in decision contexts. We illustrate our discussion with examples of time-pressured reasoning in Protos, a system constructed to explore the ideal control of inference by reasoners with limit abilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:31:01 GMT  (263kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5722v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric j horvitz", "geoffrey rutledge"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5722"}
