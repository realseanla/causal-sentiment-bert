To this purpose, a sequence of Face Image Descriptors (FID) is regarded as the output of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system. The temporal dynamics of such sequence of descriptors are represented by means of a Hankel matrix. The paper presents different strategies to compute dynamics-based representation of a sequence of FID, and reports classification accuracy values of the proposed representations within different standard classification frameworks. The representations have been validated in two very challenging application domains: emotion recognition and pain detection. Experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that the dynamics-based FID representation attains competitive performance when off-the-shelf classification tools are adopted.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 15:22:46 GMT  (135kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05001v1", "in IEEE Proceedings of Workshop on Analysis and Modeling of Face and Gestures (CVPRW 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "in IEEE Proceedings of Workshop on Analysis and Modeling of Face and Gestures (CVPRW 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["liliana lo presti", "marco la cascia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05001"}
