Since its inception in the 1970s, the model has been intensively studied and many variants of the prototype, such as Kernel-CMAC, Self-Organizing Map CMAC, and Linguistic CMAC, have been proposed. This review article focus on how the CMAC model is gradually developed and refined to meet the demand of fast, adaptive, and robust control. Two perspective, CMAC as a neural network and CMAC as a table look-up technique are presented. Three aspects of the model: the architecture, learning algorithms and applications are discussed. In the end, some potential future research directions on this model are suggested.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 04:27:11 GMT  (988kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02277v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["frank z xing"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02277"}
