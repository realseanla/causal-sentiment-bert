Their interest in reducing the search space is no longer questioned. Yet, their efficient implementation into CSP solver is still a challenge. In this paper, we introduce ESeR, an Event Selection Rules algorithm that filters events generated during propagation. This dynamic selection enables an efficient computation of explanations for intelligent backtracking al- gorithms. We show the effectiveness of our approach on the instances of the last three MiniZinc challenges", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 12:07:04 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08015v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["charles prud'homme", "xavier lorca", "narendra jussien"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08015"}
