In the following pages we will discuss about development of this field in recent decades, and its potential and applicability present in the various branches of scientific research. Also, we try to review briefly the different families of algorithms that are included in data mining research area, its scalability with increasing dimensionality of the input data and how they can be addressed and what behavior different methods in a scenario in which the information is distributed or decentralized processed so as to increment performance optimization in heterogeneous environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 22:22:17 GMT  (1130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05401v1", "in Spanish"]], "COMMENTS": "in Spanish", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["jose a garc\\'ia guti\\'errez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05401"}
