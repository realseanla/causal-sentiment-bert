This paper presents a combination of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with Answer Set Programming (ASP), named {\\em Online ASP for MDP} (oASP(MDP)), which is a method capable of constructing the set of domain states while the agent interacts with a changing environment. oASP(MDP) updates previously obtained policies, learnt by means of Reinforcement Learning (RL), using rules that represent the domain changes observed by the agent. These rules represent a set of domain constraints that are processed as ASP programs reducing the search space. Results show that oASP(MDP) is capable of finding solutions for problems in non-stationary domains without interfering with the action-value function approximation process.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 16:48:23 GMT  (612kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01417v1", "Submitted to IJCAI 17"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to IJCAI 17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["leonardo a ferreira", "reinaldo a c bianchi", "paulo e santos", "ramon lopez de mantaras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01417"}
