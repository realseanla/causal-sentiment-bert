Each project k is characterized by a valuation function; v_k(S) is the value generated by a set S of agents working on project k. We study the following classic problem in this setting: \"how should the agents divide the value that they collectively create?\". One traditional approach in cooperative game theory is to study core stability with the implicit assumption that there are infinite copies of one project, and agents can partition themselves into any number of coalitions. In contrast, we consider a model with a finite number of non-identical projects; this makes computing both high-welfare solutions and core payments highly non-trivial.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 09:53:40 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06781v1", "Under Review"]], "COMMENTS": "Under Review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["elliot anshelevich", "shreyas sekar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06781"}
