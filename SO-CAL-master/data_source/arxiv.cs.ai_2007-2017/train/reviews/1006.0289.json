Over the last decade, unsolicited bulk email has become a major problem for email users. An overwhelming amount of spam is flowing into users' mailboxes daily. In 2004, an estimated 62% of all email was attributed to spam. Not only is spam frustrating for most email users, it strains the IT infrastructure of organizations and costs businesses billions of dollars in lost productivity. In recent years, spam has evolved from an annoyance into a serious security threat, and is now a prime medium for phishing of sensitive information, as well the spread of malicious software. Therefore we propose an algorithm that uses a classifier as one of its components. Our proposal does not include the development of a classifier itself, instead of that it plans an adjustment in the classifier training set data in order to improve their performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 03:48:49 GMT  (198kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0289v1", "5 pages, 1 figure, Workshop de Investigadores en Ciencias de la Computaci\\'{o}n, WICC 2010, pp 48-52"], ["v2", "Thu, 14 Oct 2010 15:43:13 GMT  (74kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0289v2", "5 pages, 1 figure, Workshop de Investigadores en Ciencias de la Computaci\\'{o}n, WICC 2010, pp 48-52"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure, Workshop de Investigadores en Ciencias de la Computaci\\'{o}n, WICC 2010, pp 48-52", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["carlos m lorenzetti", "roc\\'io l cecchini", "ana g maguitman", "andr\\'as a bencz\\'ur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.0289"}
