This paper presents an integer programming model for a variation of BKP where the value of each element may depend on selecting or ignoring other elements. Strengths of such Value-Related Dependencies are assumed to be imprecise and hard to specify. To capture this imprecision, we have proposed modeling value-related dependencies using fuzzy graphs and their algebraic structure.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 03:14:05 GMT  (7kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06662v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["davoud mougouei", "david m w powers", "asghar moeini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06662"}
