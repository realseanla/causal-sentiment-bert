We present a new grading framework that merges results obtained by combination of these two approaches with results obtained by automated testing, leading to improved quality and precision of automated grading. These two approaches are also useful in providing a comprehensible feedback that can help students to improve the quality of their programs We also present our corresponding tools that are publicly available and open source. The tools are based on LLVM low-level intermediate code representation, so they could be applied to a number of programming languages. Experimental evaluation of the proposed grading framework is performed on a corpus of university students' programs written in programming language C. Results of the experiments show that automatically generated grades are highly correlated with manually determined grades suggesting that the presented tools can find real-world applications in studying and grading.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 16:10:20 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.7064v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["milena vujosevic-janicic", "mladen nikolic", "dusan tosic", "viktor kuncak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.7064"}
