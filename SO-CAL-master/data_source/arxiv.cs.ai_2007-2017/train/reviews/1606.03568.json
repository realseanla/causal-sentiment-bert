{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Jun-2016", "title": "Word Sense Disambiguation using a Bidirectional LSTM", "abstract": "In this paper we present a model that leverages a bidirectional long short-term memory network to learn word sense disambiguation directly from data. The approach is end-to-end trainable and makes effective use of word order. Further, to improve the robustness of the model we introduce dropword, a regularization technique that randomly removes words from the text. The model is evaluated on two standard datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on both datasets, using identical hyperparameter settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 08:12:02 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03568v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 22:47:07 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03568v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["mikael k{\\aa}geb\\\"ack", "hans salomonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03568"}
