Collaborative filtering algorithms that generate predictions by analyzing the user-item rating matrix perform poorly when the matrix is sparse. To alleviate this problem, this paper proposes a simple recommendation algorithm that fully exploits the similarity information among users and items and intrinsic structural information of the user-item matrix. The proposed method constructs a new representation which preserves affinity and structure information in the user-item rating matrix and then performs recommendation task. To capture proximity information about users and items, two graphs are constructed. Manifold learning idea is used to constrain the new representation to be smooth on these graphs, so as to enforce users and item proximities. Our model is formulated as a convex optimization problem, for which we need to solve the well-known Sylvester equation only. We carry out extensive empirical evaluations on six benchmark datasets to show the effectiveness of this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 05:45:03 GMT  (95kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08264v1", "CIKM 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "CIKM 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["zhao kang", "chong peng", "ming yang", "qiang cheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08264"}
