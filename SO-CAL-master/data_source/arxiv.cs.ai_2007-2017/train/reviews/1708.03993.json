This is especially true when designing this system for more than $\\mathbf{236~million}$ daily active users. Ranking strategy, the key module of the recommender system, needs to be precise, accurate, and responsive for estimating customers' intents. We propose a dynamic ranking paradigm, named as DNN-MAB, that is composed of a pairwise deep neural network (DNN) $\\mathit{pre}$-ranker connecting a revised multi-armed bandit (MAB) dynamic $\\mathit{post}$-ranker. By taking into account of explicit and implicit user feedbacks such as impressions, clicks, conversions, etc. DNN-MAB is able to adjust DNN $\\mathit{pre}$-ranking scores to assist customers locating items they are interested in most so that they can converge quickly and frequently. To the best of our knowledge, frameworks like DNN-MAB have not been discussed in the previous literature to either E-Commerce or machine learning audiences. In practice, DNN-MAB has been deployed to production and it easily outperforms against other state-of-the-art models by significantly lifting the gross merchandise volume (GMV) which is the objective metrics at JD.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 02:33:53 GMT  (7227kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03993v1", "7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by 'IJCAI-17 Workshop AI Applications in E-Commerce'"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 7 figures, accepted by 'IJCAI-17 Workshop AI Applications in E-Commerce'", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["yan yan", "wentao guo", "meng zhao", "jinghe hu", "weipeng p yan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.03993"}
