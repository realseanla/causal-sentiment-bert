The difference in instantiation order in the influence diagrams is reflected in the corresponding junction trees by the order in which the chance nodes are marginalized. This order of marginalization can be changed by table expansion and in effect the same junction tree with expanded tables may be used for calculating the expected utility for scenarios with different instantiation order. We also compare our method to the classic method of modeling different instantiation orders in the same influence diagram.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:55:04 GMT  (995kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1535v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["soren l dittmer", "finn verner jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1535"}
