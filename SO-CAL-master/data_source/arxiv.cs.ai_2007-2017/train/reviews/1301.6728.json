One of the central issues in constructing such agents is the representation and elicitation of user preferences or interests. This topic has long been studied in Decision Theory, but surprisingly little work in the area of recommender systems has made use of formal decision-theoretic techniques. This paper describes DIVA, a decision-theoretic agent for recommending movies that contains a number of novel features. DIVA represents user preferences using pairwise comparisons among items, rather than numeric ratings. It uses a novel similarity measure based on the concept of the probability of conflict between two orderings of items. The system has a rich representation of preference, distinguishing between a user's general taste in movies and his immediate interests. It takes an incremental approach to preference elicitation in which the user can provide feedback if not satisfied with the recommendation list. We empirically evaluate the performance of the system using the EachMovie collaborative filtering database.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:14 GMT  (464kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6728v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["hien nguyen", "peter haddawy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6728"}
