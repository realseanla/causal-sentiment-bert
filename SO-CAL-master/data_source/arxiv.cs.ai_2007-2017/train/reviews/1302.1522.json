One particular algorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured conditional probability tables. The algorithm as presented is not able to deal with actions with correlated effects. We describe a new decision theoretic regression operator that corrects this weakness. While conceptually straightforward, this extension requires a somewhat more complicated technical approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:53:51 GMT  (1133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1522v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1522"}
