The eLearning encyclopedia contains some 25.000 media objects and the eLearning platform provides services such as virtual and remote labs for experiments. With up to 350.000 users per month the platform is the most frequently used scientific educational service in the German spoken Internet. In this demo we show the benefit of mapping the static eLearning contents of ChemgaPedia to a Linked Data representation for Semantic Chemistry which allows for generating dynamic eLearning paths tailored to the semantic profiles of the users.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 23:55:47 GMT  (426kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1646v1", "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.
