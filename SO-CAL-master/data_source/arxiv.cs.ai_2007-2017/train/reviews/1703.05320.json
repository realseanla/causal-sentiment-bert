For the first task, our proposed model used a triple of features (LSI, Manhattan, Jaccard), and is based on paragraph level instead of article level as in previous studies. In fact, each single-paragraph article corresponds to a particular paragraph in a huge multiple-paragraph article. For the legal question answering task, additional statistical features from information retrieval task integrated into Convolutional Neural Network contribute to higher accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 01:06:07 GMT  (346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05320v1", "15 pages, 2 figures, Tenth International Workshop on Juris-informatics (JURISIN 2016) associated with JSAI International Symposia on AI 2016 (IsAI-2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 2 figures, Tenth International Workshop on Juris-informatics (JURISIN 2016) associated with JSAI International Symposia on AI 2016 (IsAI-2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["phong-khac do", "huy-tien nguyen", "chien-xuan tran", "minh-tien nguyen", "minh-le nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05320"}
