However, they rarely provide a semantic model to describe their contents. Semantic models of data sources represent the implicit meaning of the data by specifying the concepts and the relationships within the data. Such models are the key ingredients to automatically publish the data into knowledge graphs. Manually modeling the semantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and although desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging problem. Most of the related work focuses on semantic annotation of the data fields (source attributes). However, constructing a semantic model that explicitly describes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types is critical.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Jan 2016 00:55:25 GMT  (5164kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04105v1", "Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohsen taheriyan", "craig a knoblock", "pedro szekely", "jose luis ambite"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04105"}
