Ontological models and formalisms are discussed. We propose an ontology of mathematical knowledge, covering wide range of fields of mathematics. We demonstrate applications of this representation in mathematical formula search, and learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 18:47:18 GMT  (12kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6806v1", "10 pages, Lobachevskii J. of Mathematics, 2014, V.35, No 4"], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:24:57 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6806v2", "10 pages, Lobachevskii J. of Mathematics, 2014, V.35, No 4"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, Lobachevskii J. of Mathematics, 2014, V.35, No 4", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DL cs.IR", "authors": ["alexander elizarov", "alexander kirillovich", "evgeny lipachev", "olga nevzorova", "valery solovyev", "nikita zhiltsov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6806"}
