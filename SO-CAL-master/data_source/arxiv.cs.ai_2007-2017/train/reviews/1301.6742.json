In this paper, we present a new representation of noisy-max that allows for efficient inference in general Bayesian networks. Empirical studies show that our method is capable of computing queries in well-known large medical networks, QMR-DT and CPCS, for which no previous exact inference method has been shown to perform well.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:09 GMT  (273kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6742v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["masami takikawa", "bruce d'ambrosio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6742"}
