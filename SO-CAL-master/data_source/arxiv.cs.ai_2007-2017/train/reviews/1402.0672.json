This is achieved by assigning and assessing hard AI problems that could only be solved easily by human but not by machines. Applications of such assessments range from stopping spammers from automatically filling online forms to preventing hackers from performing dictionary attack. Today, the race between makers and breakers of CAPTCHAs is at a juncture, where the CAPTCHAs proposed are not even answerable by humans. We consider such CAPTCHAs as non user friendly. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for reverse Turing test - we call it the Line CAPTCHAs - that mainly focuses on user friendliness while not compromising the security aspect that is expected to be provided by such a system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 09:39:32 GMT  (372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0672v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["a k b karunathilake", "b m d balasuriya", "r g ragel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0672"}
