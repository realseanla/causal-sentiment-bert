The goal is to choose an allocation that maximises social welfare while taking their execution uncertainty into account. We show that this can be achieved by using the post-execution verification (PEV)-based mechanism if and only if agents' valuations satisfy a multilinearity condition. We then consider a more complex setting where an agent's execution uncertainty is not completely predictable by the agent alone but aggregated from all agents' private opinions (known as trust). We show that PEV-based mechanism with trust is still truthfully implementable if and only if the trust aggregation is multilinear.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Sep 2015 09:34:24 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05181v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["dengji zhao", "sarvapali d ramchurn", "nicholas r jennings"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05181"}
