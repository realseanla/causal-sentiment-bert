Unlike past work that has focused on diversifying the output of the decoder at word-level to alleviate this problem, we present a novel framework based on conditional variational autoencoders that captures the discourse-level diversity in the encoder. Our model uses latent variables to learn a distribution over potential conversational intents and generates diverse responses using only greedy decoders. We have further developed a novel variant that is integrated with linguistic prior knowledge for better performance. Finally, the training procedure is improved by introducing a bag-of-word loss. Our proposed models have been validated to generate significantly more diverse responses than baseline approaches and exhibit competence in discourse-level decision-making.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:55:00 GMT  (2438kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10960v1", "Accepted as a long paper in ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 03:38:58 GMT  (2438kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10960v2", "Added URL to data and model implementation.
