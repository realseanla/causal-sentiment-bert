This paper seeks an efficient and systematic discovery of nonobvious and valuable patterns between variables from a large database of solved cases via a probabilistic network (PN) modeling approach. The PN structure can be used to extract behavioral patterns and to gain insight into what factors influence these behaviors. Thus, when a new case is being investigated and the profile variables are unknown because the offender has yet to be identified, the observed crime scene variables are used to infer the unknown variables based on their connections in the structure and the corresponding numerical (probabilistic) weights. The objective is to produce a more systematic and empirical approach to profiling, and to use the resulting PN model as a decision tool.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2010 20:21:52 GMT  (718kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2202v1", "IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS January 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS January 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ramesh kumar gopala pillai", "dr ramakanth kumar p"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.2202"}
