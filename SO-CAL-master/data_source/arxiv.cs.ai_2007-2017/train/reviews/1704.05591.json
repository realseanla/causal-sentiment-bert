The proposed system takes advantage of OCR to read these characters in the query still images and provides a rough location estimate using a floor plan. Then, it finds depth and angle-of-view of the query using the information provided by the OCR engine in order to refine the location estimate. We derive novel formulas for the query angle-of-view and depth estimation using image line segments and the OCR box information. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed system through experiments in indoor scenarios. It is shown that our system demonstrates better performance compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks in terms of location recognition rate and average localization error specially under sparse database condition.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 02:43:23 GMT  (8582kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05591v1", "14 pages, 22 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 22 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["hamed sadeghi", "shahrokh valaee", "shahram shirani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05591"}
