We aim to characterise all classes of CSPs defined by a forbidden pattern that are solved by singleton arc consistency and closed under removing constraints. We identify five new patterns whose absence ensures solvability by singleton arc consistency, four of which are provably maximal and three of which generalise 2-SAT. Combined with simple counter-examples for other patterns, we make significant progress towards a complete classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 16:29:21 GMT  (30kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06215v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 20:10:25 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06215v2", "v2: improved presentation"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["clement carbonnel", "david a cohen", "martin c cooper", "stanislav zivny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.06215"}
