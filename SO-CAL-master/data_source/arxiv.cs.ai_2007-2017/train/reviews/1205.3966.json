In this system, each English alphabet is represented by binary values that are used as input to a simple feature extraction system, whose output is fed to our neural network system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 May 2012 15:57:24 GMT  (226kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3966v1", "5 pages, 3 Figure, ISSN:0975 - 8887"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 Figure, ISSN:0975 - 8887", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["yusuf perwej", "ashish chaturvedi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.3966"}
