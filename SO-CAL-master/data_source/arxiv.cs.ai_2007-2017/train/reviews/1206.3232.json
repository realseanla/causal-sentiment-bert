In contrast to importance sampling, AND/OR importance sampling caches samples in the AND/OR space and then extracts a new sample mean from the stored samples. We prove that AND/OR importance sampling may have lower variance than importance sampling; thereby providing a theoretical justification for preferring it over importance sampling. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that AND/OR importance sampling is far more accurate than importance sampling in many cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 12:33:40 GMT  (365kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3232v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vibhav gogate", "rina dechter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3232"}
