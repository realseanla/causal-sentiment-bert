Recently, evolving Multi-Context Systems (eMCSs) have been introduced as an extension of mMCSs that add the ability to both react to, and reason in the presence of commonly temporary dynamic observations, and evolve by incorporating new knowledge. However, the general complexity of such an expressive formalism may simply be too high in cases where huge amounts of information have to be processed within a limited short amount of time, or even instantaneously. In this paper, we investigate under which conditions eMCSs may scale in such situations and we show that such polynomial eMCSs can be applied in a practical use case.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 13:33:52 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05502v1", "International Workshop on Reactive Concepts in Knowledge Representation (ReactKnow 2014), co-located with the 21st European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014).
