This procedure can be applied with the COCO benchmarking platform. We describe initialization of and input to the algorithm and touch upon the relevance of termination and restarts. We introduce the concept of recommendations for benchmarking with COCO. Recommendations detach the solutions used in function calls from the anytime performance assessment of the algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 14:10:14 GMT  (20kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08776v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 May 2016 11:58:22 GMT  (20kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08776v2", "ArXiv e-prints,arXiv:1603.08776"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["nikolaus hansen", "tea tusar", "olaf mersmann", "anne auger", "dimo brockhoff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08776"}
