Ontologies can overcome the drawbacks of partially available, noisy, inconsistent, and heterogeneous data sources, by providing a semantic middleware between low level data and more general knowledge. In this paper, we engineer an ontology for the wind energy domain using description logic as technical instrumentation. We aim to integrate corpus of heterogeneous knowledge, both digital and human, in order to help the interested user to speed-up the initialization of a small-scale wind project. We exemplify one use case scenario of our ontology, that consists of automatically checking whether a planned wind project is compliant or not with the active regulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 08:23:28 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03179v1", "th Int.
