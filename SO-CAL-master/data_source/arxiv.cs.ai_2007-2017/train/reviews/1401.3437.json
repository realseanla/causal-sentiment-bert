They apply when one does not know the action model(the way actions affect the world) of a domain and must learn it from partial observations over time. Such scenarios are common in real world applications. They are challenging for AI tasks because traditional domain structures that underly tractability (e.g., conditional independence) fail there (e.g., world features become correlated). Our work departs from traditional assumptions about partial observations and action models. In particular, it focuses on problems in which actions are deterministic of simple logical structure and observation models have all features observed with some frequency. We yield tractable algorithms for the modified problem for such domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:52:56 GMT  (469kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3437v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eyal amir", "allen chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3437"}
