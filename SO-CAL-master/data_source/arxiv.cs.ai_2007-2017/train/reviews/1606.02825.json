{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jun-2016", "title": "Arbitrage-Free Combinatorial Market Making via Integer Programming", "abstract": "We present a new combinatorial market maker that operates arbitrage-free combinatorial prediction markets specified by integer programs. Although the problem of arbitrage-free pricing, while maintaining a bound on the subsidy provided by the market maker, is #P-hard in the worst case, we posit that the typical case might be amenable to modern integer programming (IP) solvers. At the crux of our method is the Frank-Wolfe (conditional gradient) algorithm which is used to implement a Bregman projection aligned with the market maker's cost function, using an IP solver as an oracle. We demonstrate the tractability and improved accuracy of our approach on real-world prediction market data from combinatorial bets placed on the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, where the outcome space is of size $2^{63}$. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation and empirical evaluation of an arbitrage-free combinatorial prediction market on this scale.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 04:59:50 GMT  (86kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02825v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 13:48:30 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02825v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["christian kroer", "miroslav dud\\'ik", "s\\'ebastien lahaie", "sivaraman balakrishnan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02825"}
