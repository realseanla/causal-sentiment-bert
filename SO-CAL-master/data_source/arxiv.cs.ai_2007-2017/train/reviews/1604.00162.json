We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions. More specifically, we translate adaptive logics into assumption-based argumentation and ASPIC+, ASPIC+ into assumption-based argumentation and a fragment of assumption-based argumentation into adaptive logics. Adaptive logics are closely related to Makinson's default assumptions and to a significant class of systems within the tradition of preferential semantics in the vein of KLM and Shoham. Thus, our results also provide close links between formal argumentation and the latter approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 08:14:30 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00162v1", "Contribution to the 16th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR'16), Cape Town"]], "COMMENTS": "Contribution to the 16th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR'16), Cape Town", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["jesse heyninck", "christian stra{\\ss}er"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00162"}
