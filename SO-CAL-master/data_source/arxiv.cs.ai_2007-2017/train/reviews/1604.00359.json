Besides giving the actual function definitions and presenting their (known) properties, this documentation also aims at giving the rationale behind our approach in terms of function groups, instances, and potential objective space normalization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 18:55:05 GMT  (78kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00359v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 25 May 2016 06:49:31 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00359v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["tea tusar", "dimo brockhoff", "nikolaus hansen", "anne auger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00359"}
