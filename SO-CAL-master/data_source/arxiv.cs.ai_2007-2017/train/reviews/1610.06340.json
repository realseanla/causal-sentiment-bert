We use the theory of belief functions to overcome the data imperfection problem. Besides, the proposed model searches to detect influencer users that adopt a positive opinion about the product, the idea, etc, to be propagated. Moreover, we present some experiments to show the performance of our model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 09:39:15 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06340v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["siwar jendoubi", "arnaud martin", "ludovic li\\'etard", "hend hadji", "boutheina yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06340"}
