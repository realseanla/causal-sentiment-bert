{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Apr-2016", "title": "Landmark-Based Plan Recognition", "abstract": "Recognition of goals and plans using incomplete evidence from action execution can be done efficiently by using planning techniques. In many applications it is important to recognize goals and plans not only accurately, but also quickly. In this paper, we develop a heuristic approach for recognizing plans based on planning techniques that rely on ordering constraints to filter candidate goals from observations. In the planning literature, these ordering constraints are called landmarks, which are facts or actions that cannot be avoided to achieve a goal. We show the applicability of planning landmarks in two settings: first, we use it directly to develop a heuristic-based plan recognition approach; second, we refine an existing planning-based plan recognition approach. Our empirical evaluation shows that our approach is not only substantially more accurate than the state-of-the-art in all available datasets, it is also an order of magnitude faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 14:44:03 GMT  (139kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01277v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 17:56:47 GMT  (442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01277v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 01:15:59 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01277v3", "Accepted as short paper in the 22nd European Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ECAI 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ramon fraga pereira", "felipe meneguzzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01277"}
