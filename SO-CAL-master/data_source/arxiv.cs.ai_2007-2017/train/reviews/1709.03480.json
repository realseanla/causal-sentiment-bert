High-level abstractions can often lead to good strategic decision making, but tactical decision quality may suffer due to lost details. A competing method is to sample the search space which often leads to good tactical performance in simple scenarios, but poor high-level planning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 17:17:51 GMT  (169kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03480v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nicolas a barriga", "marius stanescu", "michael buro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03480"}
