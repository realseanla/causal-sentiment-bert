This is a natural process and, at once, the complex thing we investigate. This always was a challenge - to understand how our mind works, and we are trying to find some universal models for this. A lot of ways have been considered so far, but we are looking for Something, we seek for approaches. And the goal is to find a consistent, noncontradictory view, which should at once be enough flexible in any dimensions to allow to represent various kinds of processes and environments, matters of different nature and diverse objects. Developing of such a model is the destination of this article.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 08:43:22 GMT  (674kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6207v1", "4 pages, 2 figures; ISBN: 978-1-4673-2984-2"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 2 figures; ISBN: 978-1-4673-2984-2", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kirill a sorudeykin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.6207"}
