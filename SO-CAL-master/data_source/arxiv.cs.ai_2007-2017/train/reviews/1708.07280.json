For robotic tasks, among others, plan execution can be captured as a sequence of visual images. For such domains, we propose to use deep neural networks in learning for planning, based on learning a reactive policy that imitates execution traces produced by a planner. We investigate architectural properties of deep networks that are suitable for learning long-horizon planning behavior, and explore how to learn, in addition to the policy, a heuristic function that can be used with classical planners or search algorithms such as A*. Our results on the challenging Sokoban domain show that, with a suitable network design, complex decision making policies and powerful heuristic functions can be learned through imitation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 05:24:36 GMT  (1113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07280v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["edward groshev", "aviv tamar", "siddharth srivastava", "pieter abbeel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07280"}
