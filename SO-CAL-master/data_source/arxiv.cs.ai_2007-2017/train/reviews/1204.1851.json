The input of our system is a set of time-stamped short-term activities (STA) detected on video frames. The output is a set of recognised long-term activities (LTA), which are pre-defined temporal combinations of STA. The constraints on the STA that, if satisfied, lead to the recognition of a LTA, have been expressed using a dialect of the Event Calculus. In order to handle the uncertainty that naturally occurs in human activity recognition, we adapted this dialect to a state-of-the-art probabilistic logic programming framework. We present a detailed evaluation and comparison of the crisp and probabilistic approaches through experimentation on a benchmark dataset of human surveillance videos.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Apr 2012 10:23:38 GMT  (2541kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1851v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 16:15:27 GMT  (606kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1851v2", "Accepted for publication in the Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP) journal"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anastasios skarlatidis", "alexander artikis", "jason filippou", "georgios paliouras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1851"}
