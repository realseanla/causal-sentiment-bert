Despite the success of embedding individual nodes for graph analytics, we notice that an important concept of embedding communities (i.e., groups of nodes) is missing. Embedding communities is useful, not only for supporting various community-level applications, but also to help preserve community structure in graph embedding. In fact, we see community embedding as providing a higher-order proximity to define the node closeness, whereas most of the popular graph embedding methods focus on first-order and/or second-order proximities. To learn the community embedding, we hinge upon the insight that community embedding and node embedding reinforce with each other. As a result, we propose ComEmbed, the first community embedding method, which jointly optimizes the community embedding and node embedding together. We evaluate ComEmbed on real-world data sets. We show it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks of node classification and community prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 14:50:41 GMT  (467kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09950v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 06:35:39 GMT  (540kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09950v2", "Code available atthis https URL"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["vincent w zheng", "sandro cavallari", "hongyun cai", "kevin chen-chuan chang", "erik cambria"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09950"}
