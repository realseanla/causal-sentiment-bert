We consider problems from Constraint Satisfaction, Global Constraints, Satisfiability, Nonmonotonic and Bayesian Reasoning. We show that, subject to a complexity theoretic assumption, none of the considered problems can be reduced by polynomial-time preprocessing to a problem kernel whose size is polynomial in a structural problem parameter of the input, such as induced width or backdoor size. Our results provide a firm theoretical boundary for the performance of polynomial-time preprocessing algorithms for the considered problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 08:31:41 GMT  (22kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5566v1", "This is a slightly longer version of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2011"], ["v2", "Thu, 11 Aug 2011 15:53:23 GMT  (23kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5566v2", "This is a slightly longer version of a paper that appeared in the proceedings of AAAI 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "This is a slightly longer version of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["stefan szeider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1104.5566"}
