We apply the ranking-based representation to zero-shot learning problems, and present deterministic and probabilistic zero-shot classifiers which can be built from pre-trained classifiers without retraining. We demonstrate their the advantages on two large real-world image datasets. In particular, we show that aggregating different sources of semantic information, including crowd-sourcing, leads to more accurate classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 20:00:53 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08039v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["jihun hamm", "mikhail belkin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.08039"}
