But it has been argued that we need other rules, in particular the rule of cross-entropy minimization, to handle updates that involve uncertain information. In this paper we re-examine such a case: van Fraassen's Judy Benjamin problem, which in essence asks how one might update given the value of a conditional probability. We argue that -- contrary to the suggestions in the literature -- it is possible to use simple conditionalization in this case, and thereby obtain answers that agree fully with intuition. This contrasts with proposals such as cross-entropy, which are easier to apply but can give unsatisfactory answers. Based on the lessons from this example, we speculate on some general philosophical issues concerning probability update.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:55:49 GMT  (971kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1543v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["adam j grove", "joseph y halpern"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1543"}
