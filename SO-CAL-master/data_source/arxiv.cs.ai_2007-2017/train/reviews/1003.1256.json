While a wide range of approaches have met varying levels of success, most IDS's rely on having access to a database of known attack signatures which are written by security experts. Nowadays, in order to solve problems with false positive alters, correlation algorithms are used to add additional structure to sequences of IDS alerts. However, such techniques are of no help in discovering novel attacks or variations of known attacks, something the human immune system (HIS) is capable of doing in its own specialised domain. This paper presents a novel immune algorithm for application to an intrusion detection problem. The goal is to discover packets containing novel variations of attacks covered by an existing signature base.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Mar 2010 12:51:22 GMT  (282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.1256v1", "10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.NE", "authors": ["gianni tedesco", "jamie twycross", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.1256"}
