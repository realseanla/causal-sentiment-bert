Comparing graphyical models with hidden variables (i.e., model equivalence, inclusion, and overlap). 3. Answering questions about the identification of a model or portion of a model, and about bounds on quantities derived from a model. 4. Determing whether a given set of independence assertions. We discuss the foundation of quantifier elimination and demonstrate its application to these problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:58:14 GMT  (401kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6698v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["dan geiger", "christopher meek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6698"}
