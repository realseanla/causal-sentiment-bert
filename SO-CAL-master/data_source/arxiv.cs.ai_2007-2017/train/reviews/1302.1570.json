We present a computational framework where stable joint plans can be studied, as well as several basic results about the representation, verification and synthesis of stable joint plans.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:13 GMT  (650kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1570v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["moshe tennenholtz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1570"}
