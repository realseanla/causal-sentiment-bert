This holds also for Description Logics, where research has focused on the explanation of both TBox reasoning and, more recently, query answering. Besides explaining the presence of a tuple in a query answer, it is important to explain also why a given tuple is missing. We address the latter problem for instance and conjunctive query answering over DL-Lite ontologies by adopting abductive reasoning; that is, we look for additions to the ABox that force a given tuple to be in the result. As reasoning tasks we consider existence and recognition of an explanation, and relevance and necessity of a given assertion for an explanation. We characterize the computational complexity of these problems for arbitrary, subset minimal, and cardinality minimal explanations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:39:28 GMT  (437kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0575v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["diego calvanese", "magdalena ortiz", "mantas simkus", "giorgio stefanoni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0575"}
