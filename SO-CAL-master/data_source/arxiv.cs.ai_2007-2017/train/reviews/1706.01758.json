Comparing to SGNS, although SPPMI provides a better solution, it is not necessarily better than SGNS in text classification tasks. Based on our analysis, SGNS takes into the consideration of weight calculation during decomposition process, so it has better performance than SPPIM in some standard datasets. Inspired by this, we propose a WL-SPPIM semantic model based on SPPIM model, and experiment shows that WL-SPPIM approach has better classification and higher scalability in the text classification task compared with LDA, SGNS and SPPIM approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 08:03:10 GMT  (508kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01758v1", "7pages, 5figures, Keywords: LDA, SPPIM, word embedding, low frequency, document classification"]], "COMMENTS": "7pages, 5figures, Keywords: LDA, SPPIM, word embedding, low frequency, document classification", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["ming li", "peilun xiao", "ju zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01758"}
