Changing Voter Reactions Over Time Using the Extreme AI Personality Engine", "abstract": "Can non-player characters have human-realistic personalities, changing over time depending on input from those around them? And can they have different reactions and thoughts about different people? Using Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine using the Five Factor model of personality, I answer these questions by creating personalities for 100 voters and allowing them to react to two politicians to see if the NPC voters' choice of candidate develops in a realistic-seeming way, based on initial and changing personality facets and on their differing feelings toward the politicians (in this case, across liking, trusting, and feeling affiliated with the candidates). After 16 test runs, the voters did indeed change their attitudes and feelings toward the candidates in different and yet generally realistic ways, and even changed their attitudes about other issues based on what a candidate extolled.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 11:21:17 GMT  (449kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05315v1", "8 pages, 3 tables, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 tables, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["jeffrey georgeson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05315"}
