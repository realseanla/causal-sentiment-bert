Given an argument with conclusion `$A$ or $B$', an argument based on $A$ with conclusion $C$, and an argument based on $B$ with conclusion $C$, we allow the construction of an argument with conclusion $C$. We show how our framework leads to different results than other approaches in non-monotonic logic for dealing with disjunctive information, such as disjunctive default theory or approaches based on the OR-rule (which allows to derive a defeasible rule `If ($A$ or $B$) then $C$', given two defeasible rules `If $A$ then $C$' and `If $B$ then $C$'). We raise new questions regarding the subtleties of reasoning defeasibly with disjunctive information, and show that its formalization is more intricate than one would presume.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 13:00:52 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08397v1", "Proceedings of SAC/KRR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of SAC/KRR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mathieu beirlaen", "jesse heyninck", "christian stra{\\ss}er"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08397"}
