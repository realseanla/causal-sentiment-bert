The approach aims at integrating techniques from different areas of AI and is based on the idea that simulated entities may freely exchange data and behavioural patterns. We define basic notions of a simulation-based programming paradigm and show how it can be used for implementing AI applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 13:34:34 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05373v1", "International Workshop on Reactive Concepts in Knowledge Representation (ReactKnow 2014), co-located with the 21st European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014).
