In this work, we introduce a new unsupervised domain adaptation algorithm for when there are multiple sources available to a learner. Our technique assigns a rough labeling on the target samples, then uses it to learn a transformation that aligns the two datasets before final classification. In this article we give a convenient implementation of our method, show several experiments using it, and compare it to other methods commonly used in the field.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 02:38:25 GMT  (263kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04889v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 05:25:20 GMT  (518kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04889v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 19:17:35 GMT  (6995kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04889v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["jordan t ash", "robert e schapire", "barbara e engelhardt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04889"}
