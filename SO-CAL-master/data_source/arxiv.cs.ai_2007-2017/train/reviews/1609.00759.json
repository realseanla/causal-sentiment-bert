A few similar systems have used a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver as backend. However, so far little is known about when the MIP solver is preferable. This paper explores this question. It describes the use of CPLEX as a backend for IDP and reports on experiments comparing both backends.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 22:20:05 GMT  (319kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00759v1", "internal report, 10 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "internal report, 10 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["san pham", "jo devriendt", "maurice bruynooghe", "patrick de causmaecker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00759"}
