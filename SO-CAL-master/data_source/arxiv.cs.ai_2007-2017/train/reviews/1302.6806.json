The links between independence and non-interactivity are investigated, and properties of these relations are given. The influence of the conjunction used to define a conditional measure of possibility is also highlighted: we examine three types of conjunctions: Lukasiewicz - like T-norms, product-like T-norms and the minimum operator.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:15:56 GMT  (633kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6806v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pascale fonck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6806"}
