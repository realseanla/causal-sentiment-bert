It was designed to construct multidimensional models (in the framework of credal sets) from a system of low- dimensional credal sets. In this paper we study its potential from the computational point of view utilizing methods of polyhedral geometry.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 14:46:44 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03352v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ji\\v{r}ina vejnarov\\'a", "v\\'aclav kratochv\\'il"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03352"}
