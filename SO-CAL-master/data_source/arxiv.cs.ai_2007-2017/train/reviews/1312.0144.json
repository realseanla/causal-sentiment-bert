In this paper, we study logics with a modal operator Kw for knowing whether but without a modal operator K for knowing that. This logic is not a normal modal logic, because we do not have that Kw phi -&gt; Kw psi and Kw phi implies Kw psi. Knowing whether logic cannot define many common frame properties, and its expressive power less than that of basic modal logic over classes of models without reflexivity. These features make axiomatizing knowing whether logics non-trivial. We axiomatize knowing whether logic over various frame classes. We also present an extension of knowing whether logic with public announcement operators and we give corresponding reduction axioms for that. We compare our work in detail to two recent similar proposals.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Nov 2013 19:18:49 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0144v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 11 Dec 2013 13:19:33 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0144v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 12 Dec 2013 10:02:26 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0144v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jie fan", "yanjing wang", "hans van ditmarsch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.0144"}
