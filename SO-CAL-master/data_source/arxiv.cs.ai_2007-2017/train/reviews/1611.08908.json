This puts the brakes on a broader uptake of CP. In this paper, we introduce MICE, a complete Java CP modeler that can use any Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver as a solution technique. Our aim is to provide an alternative tool for democratizing the \"CP-style\" modeling thanks to its simplicity of use, with reasonable solving capabilities. Our contributions include new decompositions of (reified) constraints and constraints on numerical variables.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 20:43:27 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08908v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thierry petit"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08908"}
