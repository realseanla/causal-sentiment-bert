They allow the sharing of geographically distributed resources in an efficient way, extending the boundaries of what we perceive as distributed computing. Various sciences can benefit from the use of grids to solve CPU-intensive problems, creating potential benefits to the entire society. Job scheduling is an integrated part of parallel and distributed computing. It allows selecting correct match of resource for a particular job and thus increases the job throughput and utilization of resources. Job should be scheduled in an automatic way to make the system more reliable, accessible and less sensitive to subsystem failures. This paper provides a survey on various heuristic algorithms, used for scheduling in grid.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 05:01:24 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5205v1", "6 Pages, 1 FiguerE, \"Published with International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)\". arXiv admin note: contains excessive text overlap with other internet sources"]], "COMMENTS": "6 Pages, 1 FiguerE, \"Published with International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)\". arXiv admin note: contains excessive text overlap with other internet sources", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI", "authors": ["d thilagavathi", "antony selvadoss thanamani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5205"}
