However, in general, when the factor graph is very loopy (i.e. cyclic), these solution methods suffer from bad performance, due to non-convergence and many exchanged messages. As to improve performances of the Max-Sum inference algorithm when solving loopy constraint optimization problems, we propose here to take inspiration from the belief-propagation-guided dec-imation used to solve sparse random graphs (k-satisfiability). We propose the novel DeciMaxSum method, which is parameterized in terms of policies to decide when to trigger decimation, which variables to decimate, and which values to assign to decimated variables. Based on an empirical evaluation on a classical BP benchmark (the Ising model), some of these combinations of policies exhibit better performance than state-of-the-art competitors.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 14:29:23 GMT  (532kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02209v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["jes\\'us cerquides", "r\\'emi emonet", "gauthier picard", "juan a rodr\\'iguez-aguilar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02209"}
