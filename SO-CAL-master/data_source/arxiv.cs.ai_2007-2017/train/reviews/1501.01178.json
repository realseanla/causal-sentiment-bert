Many constraints have been proposed in the literature for this type of problem, but a general framework for handling these constraints is missing. We investigate the use of constraint programming as general framework for this task. We first identify four categories of constraints that are applicable to sequence mining. We then propose two constraint programming formulation: the first formulation introduces a new global constraint called exists embedding that hides the complexity of the inclusion relation. However, this approach does not support one category of constraints. To support such constraints, we develop a second for- mulation that is more general but incurs more overhead. Both formulations can be related to the projected database technique used in specialised algorithms, and can use projected frequency to speed up the search. Experiments demonstrate the flexibility towards constraint-based settings and compare the approach to existing methods. Finally, we discuss the benefits and limitations of a CP-based approach for constrained mining.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 13:47:24 GMT  (59kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01178v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 13:50:53 GMT  (63kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01178v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 16:31:27 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01178v3", "In Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming (CPAIOR), 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["benjamin negrevergne", "tias guns"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.01178"}
