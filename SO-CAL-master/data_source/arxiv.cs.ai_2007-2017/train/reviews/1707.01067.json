Using ELF, we implement a highly customizable real-time strategy (RTS) engine with three game environments (Mini-RTS, Capture the Flag and Tower Defense). Mini-RTS, as a miniature version of StarCraft, captures key game dynamics and runs at 40K frame-per-second (FPS) per core on a Macbook Pro notebook. When coupled with modern reinforcement learning methods, the system can train a full-game bot against built-in AIs end-to-end in one day with 6 CPUs and 1 GPU. In addition, our platform is flexible in terms of environment-agent communication topologies, choices of RL methods, changes in game parameters, and can host existing C/C++-based game environments like Arcade Learning Environment. Using ELF, we thoroughly explore training parameters and show that a network with Leaky ReLU and Batch Normalization coupled with long-horizon training and progressive curriculum beats the rule-based built-in AI more than $70\\%$ of the time in the full game of Mini-RTS. Strong performance is also achieved on the other two games. In game replays, we show our agents learn interesting strategies. ELF, along with its RL platform, will be open-sourced.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 16:48:56 GMT  (2309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01067v1", "Submission to NIPS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submission to NIPS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yuandong tian", "qucheng gong", "wenling shang", "yuxin wu", "larry zitnick"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.01067"}
