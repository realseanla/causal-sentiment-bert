The proposed approach has four main steps: 1) generation of the composition graph for a request; 2) computation of the optimal composition that minimizes a single objective QoS function; 3) multi-step optimizations to reduce the search space by identifying equivalent and dominated services; and 4) hybrid local-global search to extract the optimal QoS with the minimum number of services. An extensive validation with the datasets of the Web Service Challenge 2009-2010 and randomly generated datasets shows that: 1) the combination of local and global optimization is a general and powerful technique to extract optimal compositions in diverse scenarios; and 2) the hybrid strategy performs better than the state-of-the-art, obtaining solutions with less services and optimal QoS.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 14:56:28 GMT  (243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06254v1", "Preprint accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["pablo rodriguez-mier", "manuel mucientes", "manuel lama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06254"}
