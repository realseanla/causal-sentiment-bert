Assuming that a domain modification could occur in the CSP, it shows how to express, in a predictive way, the probability that a domain value becomes inconsistent, then it express the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values in each domain of the constraint network. Thus, it express the expectation of the number of arc-inconsistent values for the whole constraint network. Next, it provides bounds for each of these three probabilistic indicators. Finally, a polytime algorithm, which propagates the probabilistic information, is presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 11:03:26 GMT  (374kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03894v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM cs.DS", "authors": ["amine balafrej", "xavier lorca", "charlotte truchet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03894"}
