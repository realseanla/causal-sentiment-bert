In addition to direction, there are multiple methods to perform the translation, four of which we explore in this paper: word-based, 10-best, context-based, and grammar-based. We build a feature for each combination of translation direction and method, and train a model that learns optimal feature weights. On a large forum dataset consisting of posts in English, Arabic, and Chinese, our novel learn-to-translate approach was more effective than a strong baseline (p&lt;0.05): translating all text into English, then training a classifier based only on English (original or translated) text.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 22:12:50 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08210v1", "12 pages.
