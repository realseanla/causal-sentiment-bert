Unlike bilateral negotiation between two individuals, this type of negotiations entails to adopt an intra-team strategy for negotiation teams in order to make team decisions and accordingly negotiate with the opponent. It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents' negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment. While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede. This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders. Furthermore, it provides an extension of the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings. Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 12:11:02 GMT  (510kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04736v1", "Novel Insights in Agent-based Complex Automated Negotiation, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Novel Insights in Agent-based Complex Automated Negotiation, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["victor sanchez-anguix", "reyhan aydogan", "vicente julian", "catholijn jonker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04736"}
