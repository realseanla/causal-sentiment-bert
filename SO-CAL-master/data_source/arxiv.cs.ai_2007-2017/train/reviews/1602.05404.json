This enables the solution of known positions so far (up to the 10 x 10 board) much quicker (measured in number of investigated nodes).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 13:34:04 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05404v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jos w h m uiterwijk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05404"}
