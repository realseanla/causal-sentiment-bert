This framework unifies the main semantics proposed by the state of art and introduces new ones based on cardinality and majority principles. It relies on two key notions: modifiers and inference strategies. An inconsistency-tolerant semantics is seen as a composite modifier plus an inference strategy. We compare the obtained semantics from a productivity point of view.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Feb 2016 15:13:00 GMT  (307kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05828v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jean francois baget", "salem benferhat", "zied bouraoui", "madalina croitoru", "marie-laure mugnier", "odile papini", "swan rocher", "karim tabia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05828"}
