The aim of this paper is to propose BN as a suitable tool for dependability analysis, by challenging the formalism with basic issues arising in dependability tasks. We will discuss how both modeling and analysis issues can be naturally dealt with by BN. Moreover, we will show how some limitations intrinsic to combinatorial dependability methods such as Fault Trees can be overcome using BN. This will be pursued through the study of a real-world example concerning the reliability analysis of a redundant digital Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with majority voting 2:3", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:36 GMT  (298kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6734v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["luigi portinale", "rea bobbio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6734"}
