In this paper, two strategies are combined in order to reduce the knowledge engineering cost induced by the adaptation knowledge (CA) acquisition task: CA is learned from the case base by the means of knowledge discovery techniques, and the CA acquisition sessions are opportunistically triggered, i.e., at problem-solving time.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 12:08:47 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0132v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fadi badra", "am\\'elie cordier", "jean lieber"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.0132"}
