Here, we show that this is in fact a good strategy which performs on average only 7% worse than the best possible solution in terms of the total distance traveled to gather all the items. Even when accounting for errors due to the inability of people to accurately measure distances by eye, the performance only goes down to 16% of the optimal solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 20:43:56 GMT  (1700kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06175v1", "3 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["andrej gajduk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06175"}
