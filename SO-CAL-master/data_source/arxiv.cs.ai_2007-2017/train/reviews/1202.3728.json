Our approach incorporates domain knowledge in the form of preconditions and effects of events, and we show that it outperforms state-of-the-art supervised learning systems on the task of reconstructing RoboCup soccer games from their commentaries.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (707kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3728v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hannaneh hajishirzi", "julia hockenmaier", "erik t mueller", "eyal amir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3728"}
