Such constraints are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jul 2013 18:01:30 GMT  (455kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2867v1", "To appear in proceedings of CP'13, LNCS 8124. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.1790"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of CP'13, LNCS 8124. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1307.1790", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["david a cohen", "peter g jeavons", "evgenij thorstensen", "stanislav \\v{z}ivn\\'y"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.2867"}
