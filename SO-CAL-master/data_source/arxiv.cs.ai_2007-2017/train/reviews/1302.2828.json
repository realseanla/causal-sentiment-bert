Its applications include planning for teams of mobile robots, such as autonomous aircrafts, cars, or underwater vehicles. The state-of-the-art algorithms for cooperative pathfinding typically rely on some heuristic forward-search pathfinding technique, where A* is often the algorithm of choice. Here, we propose MA-RRT*, a novel algorithm for multi-agent path planning that builds upon a recently proposed asymptotically-optimal sampling-based algorithm for finding single-agent shortest path called RRT*. We experimentally evaluate the performance of the algorithm and show that the sampling-based approach offers better scalability than the classical forward-search approach in relatively large, but sparse environments, which are typical in real-world applications such as multi-aircraft collision avoidance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Feb 2013 15:47:43 GMT  (83kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2828v1", "To appear at AAMAS 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at AAMAS 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["michal \\v{c}\\'ap", "peter nov\\'ak", "ji\\v{r}\\'i vok\\v{r}\\'inek", "michal p\\v{e}chou\\v{c}ek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.2828"}
