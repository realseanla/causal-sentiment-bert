The problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty. We describe the approach we have adopted to modelling and solving this problem, seen as a Markov Decision Problem, building effective policies for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:47:47 GMT  (2182kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5859v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["maria fox", "derek long", "daniele magazzeni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5859"}
