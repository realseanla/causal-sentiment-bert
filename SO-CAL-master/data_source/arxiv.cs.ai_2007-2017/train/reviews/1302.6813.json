We relate this qualitative modal logic to the many--valued analogues MVS5 and MVKD45 of the well known modal logics of knowledge and belief S5 and KD45 respectively. Completeness results are obtained for such logics and therefore, they extend previous existing results for qualitative possibilistic logics in the classical non-fuzzy setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:37 GMT  (906kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6813v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["petr hajek", "dagmar harmancov\\'a", "francesc esteva", "pere garcia", "lluis godo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6813"}
