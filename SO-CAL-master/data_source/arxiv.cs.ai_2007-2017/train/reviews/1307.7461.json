We identify four distinct strategies for such an integration: (i) low-level checks are done for all possible cases in advance and then this information is used during plan generation, (ii) low-level checks are done exactly when they are needed during the search for a plan, (iii) first all plans are computed and then infeasible ones are filtered, and (iv) by means of replanning, after finding a plan, low-level checks identify whether it is infeasible or not; if it is infeasible, a new plan is computed considering the results of previous low- level checks. We perform experiments on hybrid planning problems in robotic manipulation and legged locomotion domains considering these four methods of integration, as well as some of their combinations. We analyze the usefulness of levels of integration in these domains, both from the point of view of computational efficiency (in time and space) and from the point of view of plan quality relative to its feasibility. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in the light of experimental results and provide some guidelines on choosing proper strategies for a given domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 05:07:57 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7461v1", "In Workshop on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics (KRR) (International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "In Workshop on Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics (KRR) (International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP) 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["esra erdem", "volkan patoglu", "peter sch\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7461"}
