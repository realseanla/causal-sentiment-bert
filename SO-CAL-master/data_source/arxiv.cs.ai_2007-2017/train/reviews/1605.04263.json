These queries are translated on-the-fly into SQL queries by OBDA systems. Standard SPARQL-to-SQL translation techniques in OBDA often produce SQL queries containing redundant joins and unions, even after a number of semantic and structural optimizations. These redundancies are detrimental to the performance of query answering, especially in complex industrial OBDA scenarios with large enterprise databases. To address this issue, we introduce two novel notions of OBDA constraints and show how to exploit them for efficient query answering. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on large datasets using real world data and queries, showing that these techniques strongly improve the performance of query answering up to orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 May 2016 17:29:28 GMT  (552kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04263v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 16 May 2016 09:21:26 GMT  (569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04263v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["dag hovland", "davide lanti", "martin rezk", "guohui xiao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04263"}
