Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems. Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases. We relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:30:21 GMT  (359kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5714v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gregory f cooper", "edward h herskovits"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5714"}
