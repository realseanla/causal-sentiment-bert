In particular, it considers the neural binding structure of an earlier paper. To help with this, the paper describes some new methods in the areas of image processing and high-level behaviour simulation. The work is all based on earlier research by the author and the new additions are intended to fit in with the overall design. For image processing, a grid-like structure is used with 'full linking'. Each cell in the classifier grid stores a list of all other cells it gets associated with and this is used as the learned image that new input is compared to. For the behaviour metric, a new prediction equation is suggested, as part of a simulation, that uses feedback and history to dynamically determine its course of action. While the new methods are from widely different topics, both can be compared with the binary-analog type of interface that is the main focus of the paper. It is suggested that the simplest of linking between a tree and ensemble can explain neural binding and variable signal strengths.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 08:32:03 GMT  (1007kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04806v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 13:41:41 GMT  (1019kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04806v2", "Some new information and equation corrections"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kieran greer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04806"}
