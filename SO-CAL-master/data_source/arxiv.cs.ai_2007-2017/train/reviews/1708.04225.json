In this paper, we propose a method where general purpose pretrained visual models serve as an object-centric prior for the perception system of a learned policy. We devise an object-level attentional mechanism that can be used to determine relevant objects from a few demonstrations, and then immediately incorporate those objects into a learned policy. A task-independent meta-attention locates possible objects in the scene, and a task-specific attention identifies which objects are predictive of the demonstrations. The scope of the task-specific attention is easily adjusted by showing demonstrations with distractor objects or with diverse relevant objects. Our results indicate that this approach exhibits good generalization across object instances using very few samples, and can be used to learn a variety of manipulation tasks using reinforcement learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 17:42:59 GMT  (9157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04225v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 00:14:15 GMT  (9157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04225v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 17:06:36 GMT  (5898kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04225v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["coline devin", "pieter abbeel", "trevor darrell", "sergey levine"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04225"}
