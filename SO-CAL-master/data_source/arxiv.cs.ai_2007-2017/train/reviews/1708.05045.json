When facing KBs in different natural languages, conventional cross-lingual entity alignment methods rely on machine translation to eliminate the language barriers. These approaches often suffer from the uneven quality of translations between languages. While recent embedding-based techniques encode entities and relationships in KBs and do not need machine translation for cross-lingual entity alignment, a significant number of attributes remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a joint attribute-preserving embedding model for cross-lingual entity alignment. It jointly embeds the structures of two KBs into a unified vector space and further refines it by leveraging attribute correlations in the KBs. Our experimental results on real-world datasets show that this approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art embedding approaches for cross-lingual entity alignment and could be complemented with methods based on machine translation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 19:30:17 GMT  (898kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05045v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 26 Sep 2017 02:06:08 GMT  (898kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05045v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["zequn sun", "wei hu", "chengkai li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05045"}
