Real-time query selectivity estimation (the problem of estimating the number of rows in the data satisfying a given predicate) is an important practical problem for such databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:52:06 GMT  (279kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3884v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["dmitry y pavlov", "heikki mannila", "padhraic smyth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3884"}
