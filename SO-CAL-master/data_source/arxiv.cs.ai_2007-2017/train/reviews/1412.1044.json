{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Dec-2014", "title": "Problem Theory", "abstract": "We define a problem theory from first principles. We investigate the objects of this theory: problems, resolutions, and solutions. We relate problem theory with set theory and with computing theory. We find taxonomies for resolutions and for problems. We build a hierarchy of resolvers: mechanism, adaptor, internalizer, learner, and subject. We show that the problem theory is complete. Finally, we propose a thesis: We are Turing complete subjects because we are the result of an evolution of resolvers of the survival problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 18:13:34 GMT  (426kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1044v1", "37 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 10:03:24 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1044v2", "40 pages"], ["v3", "Sun, 12 Apr 2015 10:37:07 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1044v3", "42 pages.
