{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-May-2017", "title": "Cross-Domain Perceptual Reward Functions", "abstract": "In reinforcement learning, we often define goals by specifying rewards within desirable states. One problem with this approach is that we typically need to redefine the rewards each time the goal changes, which often requires some understanding of the solution in the agents environment. When humans are learning to complete tasks, we regularly utilize alternative sources that guide our understanding of the problem. Such task representations allow one to specify goals on their own terms, thus providing specifications that can be appropriately interpreted across various environments. This motivates our own work, in which we represent goals in environments that are different from the agents. We introduce Cross-Domain Perceptual Reward (CDPR) functions, learned rewards that represent the visual similarity between an agents state and a cross-domain goal image. We report results for learning the CDPRs with a deep neural network and using them to solve two tasks with deep reinforcement learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 04:54:36 GMT  (1768kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09045v1", "A shorter version of this paper was accepted to RLDM (this http URL)"], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 15:44:37 GMT  (1732kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09045v2", "A shorter version of this paper was accepted to RLDM (this http URL)"], ["v3", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 15:40:28 GMT  (1732kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09045v3", "A shorter version of this paper was accepted to RLDM (this http URL)"]], "COMMENTS": "A shorter version of this paper was accepted to RLDM (this http URL)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ashley d edwards", "srijan sood", "charles l isbell jr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09045"}
