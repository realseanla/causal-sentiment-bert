Unnecessary nondeterminism and the construction of large models are two primary sources of inefficiency in the tableau-based reasoning calculi used in state-of-the-art reasoners. In order to reduce nondeterminism, we base our calculus on hypertableau and hyperresolution calculi, which we extend with a blocking condition to ensure termination. In order to reduce the size of the constructed models, we introduce anywhere pairwise blocking. We also present an improved nominal introduction rule that ensures termination in the presence of nominals, inverse roles, and number restrictions---a combination of DL constructs that has proven notoriously difficult to handle. Our implementation shows significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art reasoners on several well-known ontologies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:37:06 GMT  (519kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3485v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["boris motik", "rob shearer", "ian horrocks"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3485"}
