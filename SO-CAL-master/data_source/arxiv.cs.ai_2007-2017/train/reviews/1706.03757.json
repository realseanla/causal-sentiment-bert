In this paper we describe the Semantic Entity Retrieval Toolkit (SERT) that provides implementations of our previously published entity representation models. The toolkit provides a unified interface to different representation learning algorithms, fine-grained parsing configuration and can be used transparently with GPUs. In addition, users can easily modify existing models or implement their own models in the framework. After model training, SERT can be used to rank entities according to a textual query and extract the learned entity/word representation for use in downstream algorithms, such as clustering or recommendation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 17:51:05 GMT  (916kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03757v1", "Submitted to Neu-IR '17 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 14:30:49 GMT  (920kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03757v2", "SIGIR 2017 Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval (Neu-IR'17). 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Neu-IR '17 SIGIR Workshop on Neural Information Retrieval", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["christophe van gysel", "maarten de rijke", "evangelos kanoulas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03757"}
