Broadly speaking, RankPL can be used to represent and reason about processes that exhibit uncertainty expressible by distinguishing \"normal\" from\" surprising\" events. RankPL allows (iterated) revision of rankings over alternative program states and supports various types of reasoning, including abduction and causal inference. We present the language, its denotational semantics, and a number of practical examples. We also discuss an implementation of RankPL that is available for download.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 23:58:26 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07226v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["tjitze rienstra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07226"}
