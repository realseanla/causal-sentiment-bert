We extend mMCSs with (abstract) sensors and define the notion of a run of the extended systems. We then show how typical problems arising in online reasoning can be addressed: handling potentially inconsistent sensor input, modeling intelligent forms of forgetting, selective integration of knowledge, and controlling the reasoning effort spent by contexts, like setting contexts to an idle mode. We also investigate the complexity of some important related decision problems and discuss different design choices which are given to the knowledge engineer.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 13:28:11 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05366v1", "International Workshop on Reactive Concepts in Knowledge Representation (ReactKnow 2014), co-located with the 21st European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014).
