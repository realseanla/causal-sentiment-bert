In DL-PA, the abstract atomic programs of PDL are replaced by assignments of propositional variables to truth values. This makes DL-PA enjoy some interesting meta-logical properties that PDL does not, such as eliminability of the Kleene star, compactness and interpolation. We define and analytic tableaux calculus for DL-PA and show that it matches the known complexity results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 12:54:41 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2161v1", "20 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["tiago de lima", "andreas herzig"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2161"}
