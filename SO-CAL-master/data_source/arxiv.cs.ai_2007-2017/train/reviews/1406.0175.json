Game developers are always in constant search for techniques that can automatically create computer games minimizing the developer's task. In this work we present an evolutionary strategy based solution towards the automatic generation of two player board games. To guide the evolutionary process towards games, which are entertaining, we propose a set of metrics. These metrics are based upon different theories of entertainment in computer games. This work also compares the entertainment value of the evolved games with the existing popular board based games. Further to verify the entertainment value of the evolved games with the entertainment value of the human user a human user survey is conducted. In addition to the user survey we check the learnability of the evolved games using an artificial neural network based controller. The proposed metrics and the evolutionary process can be employed for generating new and entertaining board games, provided an initial search space is given to the evolutionary algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 1 Jun 2014 16:04:04 GMT  (879kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0175v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["zahid halim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.0175"}
