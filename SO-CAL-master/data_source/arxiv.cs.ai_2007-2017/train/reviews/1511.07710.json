However, we can use structure in the scene to search for objects without processing the entire image. We propose a search technique that sequentially processes image regions such that the regions that are more likely to correspond to the query class object are explored earlier. We frame the problem as a Markov decision process and use an imitation learning algorithm to learn a search strategy. Since structure in the scene is essential for search, we work with indoor scene images as they contain both unary scene context information and object-object context in the scene. We perform experiments on the NYU-depth v2 dataset and show that the unary scene context features alone can achieve a significantly high average precision while processing only 20-25\\% of the regions for classes like bed and sofa. By considering object-object context along with the scene context features, the performance is further improved for classes like counter, lamp, pillow and sofa.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 14:05:28 GMT  (11596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07710v1", "Appeared in British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["varun k nagaraja", "vlad i morariu", "larry s davis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07710"}
