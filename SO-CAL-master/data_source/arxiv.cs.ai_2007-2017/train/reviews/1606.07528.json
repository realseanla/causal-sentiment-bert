We reduce plan verification and conformant planning to model checking problems of our logic. We show that the model checking problem of the iteration-free fragment is PSPACE-complete. By using two non-standard (but equivalent) semantics, we give novel model checking algorithms to the full language and the iteration-free language.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:33:19 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07528v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.LO", "authors": ["quan yu", "yanjun li", "yanjing wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07528"}
