In that paper we have also studied reductions by means of those solutions which are fuzzy equivalences. In this paper we will see that in some cases better reductions can be obtained using the solutions of this system that are fuzzy quasi-orders. Generally, fuzzy quasi-orders and fuzzy equivalences are equally good in the state reduction, but we show that right and left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders give better reductions than right and left invariant fuzzy equivalences. We also show that alternate reductions by means of fuzzy quasi-orders give better results than alternate reductions by means of fuzzy equivalences. Furthermore we study a more general type of fuzzy quasi-orders, weakly right and left invariant ones, and we show that they are closely related to determinization of fuzzy recognizers. We also demonstrate some applications of weakly left invariant fuzzy quasi-orders in conflict analysis of fuzzy discrete event systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 21:37:24 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5451v1", "42 pages, submitted to Information Sciences"]], "COMMENTS": "42 pages, submitted to Information Sciences", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.AI", "authors": ["aleksandar stamenkovi\\'c", "miroslav \\'ciri\\'c", "jelena ignjatovi\\'c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.5451"}
