These approaches have achieved state of the art results in simplified closed-domain settings such as the SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) dataset, which provides a pre-selected passage, from which the answer to a given question may be extracted. More recently, researchers have begun to tackle open-domain QA, in which the model is given a question and access to a large corpus (e.g., wikipedia) instead of a pre-selected passage (Chen et al., 2017a). This setting is more complex as it requires large-scale search for relevant passages by an information retrieval component, combined with a reading comprehension model that \"reads\" the passages to generate an answer to the question. Performance in this setting lags considerably behind closed-domain performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 18:08:35 GMT  (213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00023v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["shuohang wang", "mo yu", "xiaoxiao guo", "zhiguo wang", "tim klinger", "wei zhang", "shiyu chang", "gerald tesauro", "bowen zhou", "jing jiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00023"}
