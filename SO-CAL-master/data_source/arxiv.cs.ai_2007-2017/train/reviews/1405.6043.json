In contrast to previous algorithms in the area, our algorithm does not proceed by dynamic programming but works along an elimination order, solving a weighted version of constraint satisfaction. Moreover, we give evidence that this deviation from more standard algorithm is not a coincidence, but that there is likely no dynamic programming algorithm of the usual style for $\\beta$-acyclic $\\mathrm{\\#SAT}$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 May 2014 12:38:18 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6043v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI", "authors": ["johann brault-baron", "florent capelli", "stefan mengel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6043"}
