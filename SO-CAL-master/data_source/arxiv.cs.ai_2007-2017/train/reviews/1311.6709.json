In many cases, one service is not enough to complete the business requirement; composition of web services is carried out. Autonomous composition of web services to achieve new functionality is generating considerable attention in semantic web domain. Development time and effort for new applications can be reduced with service composition. Various approaches to carry out automated composition of web services are discussed in literature. Web service composition using ontologies is one of the effective approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how the ontology based composition can be made faster for each customer. We propose a framework to provide precomposed web services to fulfil user requirements. We detail how ontology merging can be used for composition which expedites the whole process. We discuss how framework provides customer specific ontology merging and repository. We also elaborate on how merging of ontologies is carried out.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:41:19 GMT  (383kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6709v1", "6 pages, 9 figures; CUBE 2013 International Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 9 figures; CUBE 2013 International Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["debajyoti mukhopadhyay", "archana chougule"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.6709"}
