They have been applied in various visual tasks, such as object recognition, segmentation, and visual question-answering, to get state-of-the-art performances taking advantage of the expanded representations. However, bilinear representations tend to be high-dimensional, limiting the applicability to computationally complex tasks. We propose low-rank bilinear neural networks using Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication), commonly implemented in many scientific computing frameworks. We show that our model outperforms compact bilinear pooling in visual question-answering tasks, having a better parsimonious property.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 04:29:52 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04325v1", "13 pages, 1 figure, &amp; appendix included"], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 05:31:27 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04325v2", "13 pages, 1 figure, &amp; appendix included"], ["v3", "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 05:22:01 GMT  (83kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04325v3", "13 pages, 1 figure, &amp; appendix.
