The discovery of which of these resources are the most appropriate to solve a given task is a complex research question, since there is a large amount of plausible candidates and there is little, mostly unstructured, metadata to be able to decide among them.We contribute a semi-automatic approach,based on semantic techniques, to assist researchers in the discovery of the most appropriate web services to full a set of given requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Dec 2010 01:12:57 GMT  (154kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1667v1", "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.
