Furthermore, we show that unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis is false, it is not possible to obtain constant factor approximations for these problems even having sub-exponential time (in $n$) available.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 15:41:43 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3529v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 21:49:23 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3529v2", "31 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Mar 2014 18:21:16 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3529v3", "39 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI", "authors": ["endre boros", "aritanan gruber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3529"}
