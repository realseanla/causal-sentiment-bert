However, this approach does not apply straightforwardly when the action space is discrete, which may have limited its adoption. In this work, we introduce two discrete planning tasks inspired by existing question-answering datasets and show that it is in fact possible to effectively perform planning via backprop in discrete action spaces using two simple yet principled modifications. Our experiments show that this approach can significantly outperform model-free RL based methods and supervised imitation learners.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 20:38:49 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07177v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mikael henaff", "william f whitney", "yann lecun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07177"}
