To deal with the large label size problem, recent works propose sketch-based methods to approximate the distribution on labels per node thereby achieving a space reduction from $O(m)$ to $O(\\log m)$, under certain conditions. In this paper, we present a novel streaming graph-based SSL approximation that captures the sparsity of the label distribution and ensures the algorithm propagates labels accurately, and further reduces the space complexity per node to $O(1)$. We also provide a distributed version of the algorithm that scales well to large data sizes. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the new method achieves better performance than existing state-of-the-art algorithms with significant reduction in memory footprint. We also study different graph construction mechanisms for natural language applications and propose a robust graph augmentation strategy trained using state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning architectures that yields further significant quality gains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Dec 2015 06:58:57 GMT  (464kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01752v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 16 May 2016 19:40:37 GMT  (461kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01752v2", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["sujith ravi", "qiming diao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01752"}
