The resulting intelligent VNS has been successfully applied to a couple of optimization problems where the solution space consists of the subsets of a finite reference set. These problems are the labelled spanning tree and forest problems that are formulated on an undirected labelled graph; a graph where each edge has a label in a finite set of labels L. The problems consist on selecting the subset of labels such that the subgraph generated by these labels has an optimal spanning tree or forest, respectively. These problems have several applications in the real-world, where one aims to ensure connectivity by means of homogeneous connections.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Sep 2015 22:12:42 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08792v1", "MIC 2015: The XI Metaheuristics International Conference, 3 pages, Agadir, June 7-10, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "MIC 2015: The XI Metaheuristics International Conference, 3 pages, Agadir, June 7-10, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sergio consoli", "jos\\`e", "r\\`es moreno p\\`erez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08792"}
