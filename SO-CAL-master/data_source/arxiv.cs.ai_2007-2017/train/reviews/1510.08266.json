Yet, its precise value has remained unknown for almost 50 years. This paper presents a methodology based on \\emph{abstraction} and \\emph{symmetry breaking} that applies to solve hard graph edge-coloring problems. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by using it to compute the value $R(4,3,3)=30$. Along the way it is required to first compute the previously unknown set ${\\cal R}(3,3,3;13)$ consisting of 78{,}892 Ramsey colorings.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 11:46:46 GMT  (26kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08266v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1409.5189"], ["v2", "Sun, 1 Nov 2015 12:06:17 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08266v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1409.5189"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1409.5189", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["michael codish", "michael frank", "avraham itzhakov", "alice miller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08266"}
