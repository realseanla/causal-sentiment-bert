Input dataset includes 3D post-stacked seismic attributes and six well logs acquired from a hydrocarbon field located in the western coast of India. Presence of thin sand and shale layers in the basin area makes the modeling of reservoir characteristic a challenging task. Though seismic data is helpful in extrapolation of reservoir properties away from boreholes; yet, it could be challenging to delineate thin sand and shale reservoirs using seismic data due to its limited resolvability. Therefore, it is important to develop state-of-art intelligent methods for calibrating a nonlinear mapping between seismic data and target reservoir variables. Neural networks have shown its potential to model such nonlinear mappings; however, uncertainties associated with the model and datasets are still a concern. Hence, introduction of Fuzzy Logic (FL) is beneficial for handling these uncertainties. More specifically, hybrid variants of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and fuzzy logic, i.e., NF methods, are capable for the modeling reservoir characteristics by integrating the explicit knowledge representation power of FL with the learning ability of neural networks. The documented results in this study demonstrate acceptable resemblance between target and predicted variables, and hence, encourage the application of integrated machine learning approaches such as Neuro-Fuzzy in reservoir characterization domain. Furthermore, visualization of the variation of sand probability in the study area would assist in identifying placement of potential wells for future drilling operations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 17:48:24 GMT  (530kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07074v1", "Journal of Applied Geophysics, volume 111, page 141-155"]], "COMMENTS": "Journal of Applied Geophysics, volume 111, page 141-155", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.AI", "authors": ["akhilesh k verma", "soumi chaki", "aurobinda routray", "william k mohanty", "mamata jenamani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.07074"}
