In this light, the issue of infrastructure upgrades to provide telecommunication services is of importance. New antennas can be installed at hot spots of user demand, which will require an investment, and/or the clientele expansion can be carried out in a planned manner to promote the exploitation of the infrastructure in the less loaded geographical zones. In this paper, we explore the second alternative. Informally speaking, the term Infrastructure-Stressing describes a user who stays in the zones of high demand, which are prone to produce service failures, if further loaded. We have studied the Infrastructure-Stressing population in the light of their correlation with geo-demographic segments. This is motivated by the fact that specific geo-demographic segments can be targeted via marketing campaigns. Fuzzy logic is applied to create an interface between big data, numeric methods for processing big data and a manager.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:56:18 GMT  (400kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03940v1", "conference"]], "COMMENTS": "conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["s podapati", "l lundberg", "l skold", "o rosander", "j sidorova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03940"}
