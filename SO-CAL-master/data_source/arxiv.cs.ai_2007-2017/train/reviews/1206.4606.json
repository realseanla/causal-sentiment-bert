Different from previous work that focuses on distilling the true labels from noisy crowdsourcing ratings, we emphasize gaining diagnostic insights into our in-house well-trained judges. We generalize the well-known DawidSkene model (Dawid &amp; Skene, 1979) to a spectrum of probabilistic models under the same \"TrueLabel + Confusion\" paradigm, and show that our proposed hierarchical Bayesian model, called HybridConfusion, consistently outperforms DawidSkene on both synthetic and real-world data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:43:42 GMT  (735kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4606v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["chao liu", "yi-min wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4606"}
