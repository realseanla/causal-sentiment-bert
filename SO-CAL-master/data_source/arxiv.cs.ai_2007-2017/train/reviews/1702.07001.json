One of the problem in this context is the Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP). CTP is a navigation problem where an agent is tasked to travel from source to target in a partially observable weighted graph, whose edge might be blocked with a certain probability and observing such blockage occurs only when reaching upon one of the edges end points. The goal is to find a strategy that minimizes the expected travel cost. The problem is known to be P$\\#$ hard. In this work we study the CTP theoretically and empirically. First, we study the Dep-CTP, a CTP variant we introduce which assumes dependencies between the edges status. We show that Dep-CTP is intractable, and further we analyze two of its subclasses on disjoint paths graph. Second, we develop a general algorithm Gen-PAO that optimally solve the CTP. Gen-PAO is capable of solving two other types of CTP called Sensing-CTP and Expensive-Edges CTP. Since the CTP is intractable, Gen-PAO use some pruning methods to reduce the space search for the optimal solution. We also define some variants of Gen-PAO, compare their performance and show some benefits of Gen-PAO over existing work.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 20:57:29 GMT  (1343kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07001v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["doron zarchy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07001"}
