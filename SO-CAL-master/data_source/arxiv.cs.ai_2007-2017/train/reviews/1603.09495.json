We consider a target decision component that figures out what to do next and an (online) planning capability to compute the plans needed to reach these targets. Our representation allows one to analyze the flow of executing the given reactive policy, and to determine whether it works as expected. Additionally, the flexibility of the representation opens a range of possibilities for designing behaviors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 09:05:28 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09495v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["zeynep g saribatur", "thomas eiter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09495"}
