Most current approaches to plagiarism detection are based on musical similarity measures, which typically ignore the issue of polyphony in music. We present a novel feature space for audio derived from compositional modelling techniques, commonly used in signal separation, that provides a mechanism to account for polyphony without incurring an inordinate amount of computational overhead. We employ this feature representation in conjunction with traditional audio feature representations in a classification framework which uses an ensemble of distance features to characterize pairs of songs as being plagiarized or not. Our experiments on a database of about 3000 musical track pairs show that the new feature space characterization produces significant improvements over standard baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 21:57:16 GMT  (720kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00022v1", "Preprint version"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI cs.MM", "authors": ["soham de", "indradyumna roy", "tarunima prabhakar", "kriti suneja", "sourish chaudhuri", "rita singh", "bhiksha raj"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00022"}
