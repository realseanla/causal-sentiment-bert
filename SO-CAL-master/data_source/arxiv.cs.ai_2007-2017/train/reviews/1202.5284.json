We prove its efficiency theoretically and test it on OneMax function deriving bounds c{\\mu}n log n - O({\\mu} n). This analysis can be generalized to any similar algorithm using variants of tournament selection and genetic operators that flip or swap only 1 bit in each string.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2012 20:21:57 GMT  (16kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5284v1", "accepted to Congress on Evolutionary Computation (WCCI/CEC) 2012"], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 04:55:09 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5284v2", "accepted to Congress on Evolutionary Computation (WCCI/CEC) 2012"], ["v3", "Mon, 2 Apr 2012 04:27:11 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5284v3", "accepted to Congress on Evolutionary Computation (WCCI/CEC) 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to Congress on Evolutionary Computation (WCCI/CEC) 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["aram ter-sarkisov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.5284"}
