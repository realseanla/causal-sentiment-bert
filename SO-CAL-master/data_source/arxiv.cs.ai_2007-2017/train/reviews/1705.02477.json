Tool condition is crucial to ensure the good quality of products: Worn tools affect not only the surface quality but also the dimensional accuracy, which means higher reject rate of the products. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify tool failures before it occurs on the fly. While various versions of intelligent tool condition monitoring have been proposed, most of them suffer from a cognitive nature of traditional machine learning algorithms. They focus on the how to learn process without paying attention to other two crucial issues: what to learn, and when to learn. The what to learn and the when to learn provide self regulating mechanisms to select the training samples and to determine time instants to train a model. A novel tool condition monitoring approach based on a psychologically plausible concept, namely the metacognitive scaffolding theory, is proposed and built upon a recently published algorithm, recurrent classifier (rClass). The learning process consists of three phases: what to learn, how to learn, when to learn and makes use of a generalized recurrent network structure as a cognitive component. Experimental studies with real-world manufacturing data streams were conducted where rClass demonstrated the highest accuracy while retaining the lowest complexity over its counterparts.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 May 2017 12:16:16 GMT  (1001kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02477v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mahardhika pratama", "eric dimla", "chow yin lai", "edwin lughofer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02477"}
