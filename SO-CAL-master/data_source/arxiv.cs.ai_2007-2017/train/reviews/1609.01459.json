{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Sep-2016", "title": "Deviant Learning Algorithm: Learning Sparse Mismatch Representations through Time and Space", "abstract": "Predictive coding (PDC) has recently attracted attention in the neuroscience and computing community as a candidate unifying paradigm for neuronal studies and artificial neural network implementations particularly targeted at unsupervised learning systems. The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) has also recently been studied in relation to PC and found to be a useful ingredient in neural predictive coding systems. Backed by the behavior of living organisms, such networks are particularly useful in forming spatio-temporal transitions and invariant representations of the input world. However, most neural systems still do not account for large number of synapses even though this has been shown by a few machine learning researchers as an effective and very important component of any neural system if such a system is to behave properly. Our major point here is that PDC systems with the MMN effect in addition to a large number of synapses can greatly improve any neural learning system's performance and ability to make decisions in the machine world. In this paper, we propose a novel bio-mimetic computational intelligence algorithm -- the Deviant Learning Algorithm, inspired by these key ideas and functional properties of recent brain-cognitive discoveries and theories. We also show by numerical experiments guided by theoretical insights, how our invented bio-mimetic algorithm can achieve competitive predictions with even with very small problem specific data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 09:35:14 GMT  (270kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01459v1", "Working Paper"], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 09:20:09 GMT  (269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01459v2", "Working Paper"], ["v3", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 18:53:24 GMT  (207kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01459v3", "Working Paper"], ["v4", "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 20:55:33 GMT  (207kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01459v4", "Working Paper"], ["v5", "Sun, 1 Jan 2017 11:26:06 GMT  (207kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01459v5", "Working Paper"], ["v6", "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 02:49:15 GMT  (207kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01459v6", "Working Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Working Paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["emmanuel ndidi osegi", "vincent ike anireh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01459"}
