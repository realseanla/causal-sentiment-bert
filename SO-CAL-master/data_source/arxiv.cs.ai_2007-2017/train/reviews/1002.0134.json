To assess the impact of design decisions, instances of the five problem classes n-Queens, Golomb Ruler, Magic Square, Social Golfers, and Balanced Incomplete Block Design are modelled and solved with each solver. The results of the experiments are not meant to give an indication of the performance of a solver, but rather investigate what influence the choice of algorithms and data structures has.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 Jan 2010 15:36:36 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0134v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PF", "authors": ["lars kotthoff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.0134"}
