We first show that Dekel, Lipman and Rustichini do not establish this claim. We then distinguish three notions of awareness, and argue that although one of them may not be adequately modeled using standard state spaces, there is no reason to think that standard state spaces cannot provide models of the other two notions. In fact, standard space models of these forms of awareness are attractively simple. They allow us to prove completeness and decidability results with ease, to carry over standard techniques from decision theory, and to add propositional quantifiers straightforwardly.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:31:42 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07520v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["peter fritz", "harvey lederman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07520"}
