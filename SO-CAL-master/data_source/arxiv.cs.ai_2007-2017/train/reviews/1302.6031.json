Its primary purpose is for construction of binary discriminators for phonemes based on spectral content. It is optimized for design of non-parametric computational circuits, and makes uses of 4 operations: $\\min$, $\\max$, the difference and generalized additively homogenuous means.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Feb 2013 10:13:09 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6031v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["ondrej such"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6031"}
