Yet, efficient approaches for most of the decision and enumeration problems associated to \\AFname s are missing, thus potentially limiting the efficacy of argumentation-based approaches in real domains. In this paper, we present an algorithm for enumerating the preferred extensions of abstract argumentation frameworks which exploits parallel computation. To this purpose, the SCC-recursive semantics definition schema is adopted, where extensions are defined at the level of specific sub-frameworks. The algorithm shows significant performance improvements in large frameworks, in terms of number of solutions found and speedup.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 13:33:33 GMT  (180kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2800v1", "Technical report of an accepted AAAI-2015 Paper"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:31:12 GMT  (180kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2800v2", "Technical report of an accepted AAAI-2015 Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report of an accepted AAAI-2015 Paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["federico cerutti", "ilias tachmazidis", "mauro vallati", "sotirios batsakis", "massimiliano giacomin", "grigoris antoniou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2800"}
