More sophisticated variants may involve concepts such as transfer-learning which increase this adaptive capability, enhancing the learner's cognitive capacities in a manner that can begin to imitate the open-ended learning capabilities of human beings.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 19:17:49 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02626v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david windridge"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.02626"}
