The system is based on both probability theory and proof theory. The system is derived from Chisholm's epistemology. We concretize Chisholm's system by grounding his undefined and primitive (i.e. foundational) concept of reasonablenes in probability and proof theory. S can be useful in systems that have to interact with humans and provide justifications for their uncertainty. As a demonstration of the system, we apply the system to provide a solution to the lottery paradox. Another advantage of the system is that it can be used to provide uncertainty values for counterfactual statements. Counterfactuals are statements that an agent knows for sure are false. Among other cases, counterfactuals are useful when systems have to explain their actions to users. Uncertainties for counterfactuals fall out naturally from our system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 16:24:18 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10726v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["naveen sundar govindarajulu", "selmer bringsjord"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10726"}
