By expressiveness we mean the ability to encode a desired set of two-valued interpretations over a given propositional signature using only atoms from that signature. While the computational complexity of the two-valued model existence problem for all these languages is (almost) the same, we show that the languages form a neat hierarchy with respect to their expressiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 07:39:50 GMT  (30kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0805v1", "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["hannes strass"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0805"}
