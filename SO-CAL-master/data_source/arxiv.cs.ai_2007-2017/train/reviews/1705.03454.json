However, to progress toward more natural exchanges between humans and these assistants, it is important to understand the way non-imperative utterances can indirectly elicit action of an addressee. In this paper, we investigate command types in the setting of a grounded, collaborative game. We focus on a less understood family of utterances for eliciting agent action, locatives like \\emph{The chair is in the other room}, and demonstrate how these utterances indirectly command in specific game state contexts. Our work shows that models with domain-specific grounding can effectively realize the pragmatic reasoning that is necessary for more robust natural language interaction with robots.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 19:34:23 GMT  (178kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03454v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 19:04:40 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03454v2", "International Conference on Computational Semantics 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["matthew lamm", "mihail eric"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03454"}
