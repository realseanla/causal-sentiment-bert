We conjecture that the main inhibitor for advancing autonomy is lack of trust. Trusted autonomy is the scientific and engineering field to establish the foundations and ground work for developing trusted autonomous systems (robotics and software agents) that can be used in our daily life, and can be integrated with humans seamlessly, naturally and efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Mar 2016 11:00:23 GMT  (595kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00921v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["hussein a abbass", "george leu", "kathryn merrick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00921"}
