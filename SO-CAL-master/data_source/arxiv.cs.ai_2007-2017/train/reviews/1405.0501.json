We introduce exchangeable variable models (EVMs) as a novel class of probabilistic models whose basic building blocks are partially exchangeable sequences, a generalization of exchangeable sequences. We prove that a family of tractable EVMs is optimal under zero-one loss for a large class of functions, including parity and threshold functions, and strictly subsumes existing tractable independence-based model families. Extensive experiments show that EVMs outperform state of the art classifiers such as SVMs and probabilistic models which are solely based on independence assumptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 May 2014 20:13:06 GMT  (248kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0501v1", "ICML 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["mathias niepert", "pedro m domingos"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.0501"}
