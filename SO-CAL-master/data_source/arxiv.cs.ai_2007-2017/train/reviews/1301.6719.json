Building on the recent results of Kearns, Mansour and Ng, we provide a planning algorithm for factored POMDPs that exploits the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff in the belief state simplification introduced by Boyen and Koller.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:38 GMT  (434kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6719v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david a mcallester", "satinder singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6719"}
