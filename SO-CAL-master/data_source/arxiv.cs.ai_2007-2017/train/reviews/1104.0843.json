In this paper, we investigate phase transitions in the knowledge compilation empirically, where DFA, OBDD and d-DNNF are chosen as the target languages to compile random k-SAT instances and industrial-like SAT instances. We perform intensive experiments to analyze the sizes of compilation results and draw the following conclusions: there exists an easy-hard-easy pattern in compilations; the peak point of sizes in the pattern is only related to the ratio of the number of clauses to that of variables when k is fixed, regardless of target languages; most sizes of compilation results increase exponentially with the number of variables growing, but there also exists a phase transition that separates a polynomial-increment region from the exponential-increment region; Moreover, we explain why the phase transition in compilations occurs by analyzing microstructures of DFAs, and conclude that a kind of solution interchangeability with more than 2 variables has a sharp transition near the peak point of the easy-hard-easy pattern, and thus it has great impact on the sizes of DFAs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Apr 2011 13:25:43 GMT  (582kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0843v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 17 Apr 2011 12:41:23 GMT  (582kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0843v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 07:05:11 GMT  (201kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0843v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jian gao", "minghao yin", "ke xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.0843"}
