However, most embedding methods merely concentrate on the triple fitting and ignore the explicit semantic expression, leading to an uninterpretable representation form. Thus, traditional embedding methods do not only degrade the performance, but also restrict many potential applications. For this end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph \\textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in each aspect for every triple. Because both the aspects and categories are semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as the semantic representation of this triple. Extensive experiments justify our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in a substantial extent.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Aug 2016 09:53:38 GMT  (242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07685v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 02:48:01 GMT  (220kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07685v2", "submitting to AAAI.2017"], ["v3", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 02:06:16 GMT  (146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07685v3", "submitting to NIPS.2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["han xiao", "minlie huang", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07685"}
