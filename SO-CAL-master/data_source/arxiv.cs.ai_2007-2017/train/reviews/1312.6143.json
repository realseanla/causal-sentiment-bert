Although this technology was originally devised for dealing with data streams in dynamic environments, like assisted living and cognitive robotics, it can likewise be used to incorporate facts, rules, or queries provided by a user. As a result, we present the design and implementation of a system for interactive query answering with reactive answer set programming. Our system quontroller is based on the reactive solver oclingo and implemented as a dedicated front-end. We describe its functionality and implementation, and we illustrate its features by some selected use cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:24:30 GMT  (10kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6143v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["martin gebser", "philipp obermeier", "torsten schaub"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6143"}
