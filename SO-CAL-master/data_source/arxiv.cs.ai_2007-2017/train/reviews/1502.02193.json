A first study showed that both killifish from a lake with predators and from a lake without predators explore a new environment to the same degree and plotting number of new spaces covered over time generates a hump-shaped curve. However, for the fish from the lake with predators the curve is shifted to the right; they take longer. This pattern was replicated by a computer model of exploratory behavior varying only one parameter, the fear parameter. A second study showed that stories inspired by threatening photographs were rated as more creative than stories inspired by non-threatening photographs. Various explanations for the findings are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Feb 2015 23:27:48 GMT  (477kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02193v1", "4 pages, Psychology Today (online).this https URL(2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, Psychology Today (online).this https URL(2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["liane gabora"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02193"}
