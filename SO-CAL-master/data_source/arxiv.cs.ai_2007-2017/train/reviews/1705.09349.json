Neither does it mean that the coalition knows that such a strategy exists. The article studies an interplay between the distributed knowledge, coalition strategies, and coalition \"know-how\" strategies. The main technical result is a sound and complete trimodal logical system that describes the properties of this interplay.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 20:22:16 GMT  (91kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09349v1", "An extended abstract of this paper will appear in Proceedings of 16th conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK-17), Liverpool, United Kingdom, July 24-26, 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 18:59:15 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09349v2", "An extended abstract of this paper will appear in Proceedings of 16th conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK-17), Liverpool, United Kingdom, July 24-26, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "An extended abstract of this paper will appear in Proceedings of 16th conference on Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge (TARK-17), Liverpool, United Kingdom, July 24-26, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LO cs.MA", "authors": ["pavel naumov", "jia tao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09349"}
