As one of the most widely known and used SLS algorithm,WalkSAT plays a key role in the evolutions of SLS for SAT, and also hold state-ofthe- art performance on random instances. This work proposes a novel implementation forWalkSAT which decreases the redundant calculations leading to a dramatically speeding up, thus dominates the latest version of WalkSAT including its advanced variants.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 08:11:32 GMT  (26kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07217v1", "5 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 03:54:23 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07217v2", "5 pages"], ["v3", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 09:47:18 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07217v3", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sixue liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07217"}
