In this paper, we propose a performance evaluation for educational institutions using rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces with ordering rules and information entropy. In order to measure the performance of educational institutions, we construct an evaluation index system. Rough set on fuzzy approximation spaces with ordering is applied to explore the evaluation index data of each level. Furthermore, the concept of information entropy is used to determine the weighting coefficients of evaluation indexes. Also, we find the most important indexes that influence the weighting coefficients. The proposed approach is validated and shows the practical viability. Moreover, the proposed approach can be applicable to any organizations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Aug 2013 17:14:02 GMT  (574kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0725v1", "18 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["debi prasanna acharjya", "debarati bhattacharjee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0725"}
