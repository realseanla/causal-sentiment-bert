In this work we provide definitions for Recursively Self-Improving software, survey different types of self-improving software, review the relevant literature, analyze limits on computation restricting recursive self-improvement and introduce RSI Convergence Theory which aims to predict general behavior of RSI systems. Finally, we address security implications from self-improving intelligent software.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 17:08:30 GMT  (314kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06512v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["roman v yampolskiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.06512"}
