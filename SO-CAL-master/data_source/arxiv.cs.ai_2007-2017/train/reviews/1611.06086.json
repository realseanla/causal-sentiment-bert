In this work, the MO optimization of the extraction process of bioactive compounds from the Gardenia Jasminoides Ellis fruit was solved. Three swarm-based algorithms have been applied in conjunction with normal-boundary intersection (NBI) method to solve this MO problem. The gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique were implemented in this work. In addition, a novel Hopfield-enhanced particle swarm optimization was developed and applied to the extraction problem. By measuring the levels of dominance, the optimality of the approximate Pareto frontiers produced by all the algorithms were gauged and compared. Besides, by measuring the levels of convergence of the frontier, some understanding regarding the structure of the objective space in terms of its relation to the level of frontier dominance is uncovered. Detail comparative studies were conducted on all the algorithms employed and developed in this work.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 04:18:19 GMT  (670kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["t ganesan", "i elamvazuthi", "p vasant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06086"}
