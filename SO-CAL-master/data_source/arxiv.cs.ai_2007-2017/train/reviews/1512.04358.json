This article presents Cerbere, a production system designed to perform online causal, temporal and epistemic reasoning based on the Event Calculus. The framework implements the declarative semantics of the underlying logic theories in a forward-chaining rule-based reasoning system, coupling the high expressiveness of its formalisms with the efficiency of rule-based systems. To illustrate its applicability, we present both the modeling of benchmark problems in the field, as well as its utilization in the challenging domain of smart spaces. A hybrid framework that combines logic-based with probabilistic reasoning has been developed, that aims to accommodate activity recognition and monitoring tasks in smart spaces.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 15:18:58 GMT  (1164kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04358v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 17:57:42 GMT  (1167kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04358v2", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["theodore patkos", "dimitris plexousakis", "abdelghani chibani", "yacine amirat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04358"}
