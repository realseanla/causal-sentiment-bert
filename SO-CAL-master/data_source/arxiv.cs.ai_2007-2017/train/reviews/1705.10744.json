Most of these introduce novel architectures for relation learning that are evaluated on standard datasets such as FB15k and WN18. This paper shows that the accuracy of almost all models published on the FB15k can be outperformed by an appropriately tuned baseline - our reimplementation of the DistMult model. Our findings cast doubt on the claim that the performance improvements of recent models are due to architectural changes as opposed to hyper-parameter tuning or different training objectives. This should prompt future research to re-consider how the performance of models is evaluated and reported.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 16:54:19 GMT  (43kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10744v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["rudolf kadlec", "ondrej bajgar", "jan kleindienst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10744"}
