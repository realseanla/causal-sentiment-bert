In this paper, we consider a more flexible pricing model for instance reservation, in which a customer can propose the time length and number of resources of her request, while in today's industry, customers can only choose from several predefined reservation packages. Under this model, we design randomized mechanisms for customers coming online to optimize social welfare and providers' revenue.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 16:03:58 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07379v1", "Already accepted by AAAI'17"]], "COMMENTS": "Already accepted by AAAI'17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["jia zhang", "weidong ma", "tao qin", "xiaoming sun", "tie-yan liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.07379"}
