The mass flow is controlled by specialization matrices. New evidence is integrated into the frame of discernment by conditioning or revision (Dempster's rule of conditioning), for which special specialization matrices exist. Even some aspects of non-monotonic reasoning can be represented by certain specialization matrices.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:31:20 GMT  (307kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5726v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rudolf kruse", "detlef nauck", "frank klawonn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5726"}
