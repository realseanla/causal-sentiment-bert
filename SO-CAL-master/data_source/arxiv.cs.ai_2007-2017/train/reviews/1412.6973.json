In this paper, firstly, we present shadowed sets for interpreting and understanding interval fuzzy sets. We also provide an analytic solution to computing the pair of thresholds by searching for a balance of uncertainty in the framework of shadowed sets. Secondly, we construct errors-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. We also provide an alternative decision-theoretic formulation for calculating the pair of thresholds by transforming interval-valued loss functions into single-valued loss functions, in which the required thresholds are computed by minimizing decision costs. Thirdly, we compute errors-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions. Finally, we employ several examples to illustrate that how to take an action for an object with interval-valued membership grade by using interval-valued loss functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 13:34:04 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6973v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guangming lang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6973"}
