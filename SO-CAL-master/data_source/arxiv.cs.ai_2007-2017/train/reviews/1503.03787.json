{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Mar-2015", "title": "Are there intelligent Turing machines?", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new computing model based on the cooperation among Turing machines called orchestrated machines. Like universal Turing machines, orchestrated machines are also designed to simulate Turing machines but they can also modify the original operation of the included Turing machines to create a new layer of some kind of collective behavior. Using this new model we can define some interested notions related to cooperation ability of Turing machines such as the intelligence quotient or the emotional intelligence quotient for Turing machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 16:00:32 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03787v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["norbert b\\'atfai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03787"}
