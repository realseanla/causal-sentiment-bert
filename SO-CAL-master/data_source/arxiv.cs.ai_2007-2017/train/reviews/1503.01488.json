These two mechanisms both have desirable economic and computational properties, but the outcomes they induce can be incomparable in many instances, thus creating challenges in deciding which mechanism to adopt in practice. In this paper we first look at the space of lexicographic preferences and show that, as opposed to the general preference domain, RSD satisfies envyfreeness. Moreover, we show that although under lexicographic preferences PS is strategyproof when the number of objects is less than or equal agents, it is strictly manipulable when there are more objects than agents. In the space of general preferences, we provide empirical results on the (in)comparability of RSD and PS, analyze economic properties, and provide further insights on the applicability of each mechanism in different application domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 22:35:27 GMT  (984kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01488v1", "19 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["hadi hosseini", "kate larson", "robin cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01488"}
