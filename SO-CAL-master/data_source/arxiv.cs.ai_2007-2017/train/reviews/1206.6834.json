Likelihood gambles describe actions in a situation where a decision maker knows multiple probabilistic models and a random sample generated from one of those models but does not know prior probability of models. This new axiom system is inspired by Jensen's axiomatization of probabilistic gambles. Our approach provides a new perspective to the role of data in decision making under ambiguity. It avoids one of the most controversial issue of Bayesian methodology namely the assumption of prior probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:18:21 GMT  (158kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6834v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["phan h giang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6834"}
