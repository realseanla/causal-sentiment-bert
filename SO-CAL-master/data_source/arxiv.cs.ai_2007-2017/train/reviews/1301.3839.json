However, monitoring is generally costly, and some precondition failures have a very small impact on plan quality. We formulate a model for optimal precondition monitoring, using partially-observable Markov decisions processes, and describe methods for solving this model efficitively, though approximately. Specifically, we show that the single-precondition monitoring problem is generally tractable, and the multiple-precondition monitoring policies can be efficitively approximated using single-precondition soultions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:49:07 GMT  (350kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3839v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3839"}
