It writes candidate theories in Julia and then validates: tossing the bad theories and keeping the good theories. Compactness is measured by a metric: such as the number of space-time derivatives. The underlying algorithm is applicable to a wide variety of combinatorics problems and compactness serves to cut down the search space.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 22:57:06 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06975v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mark a stalzer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.06975"}
