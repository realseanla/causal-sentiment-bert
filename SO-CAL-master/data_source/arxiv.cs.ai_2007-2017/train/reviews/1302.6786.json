The class of A-valuations of plausibility is considered where operations based only on information about linear ordering of plausibility values are used. In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonicity of conclusions is introduced.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:13:56 GMT  (522kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6786v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ildar z batyrshin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6786"}
