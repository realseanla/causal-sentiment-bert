Current methods involve changing mouse parts such as adding more buttons or changing the position of the tracking ball. Instead, our method is to use a camera and computer vision technology, such as image segmentation and gesture recognition, to control mouse tasks (left and right clicking, double-clicking, and scrolling) and we show how it can perform everything as current mouse devices can. The software will be developed in JAVA language. Recognition and pose estimation in this system are user independent and robust as we will be using colour tapes on our finger to perform actions. The software can be used as an intuitive input interface to applications that require multi-dimensional control e.g. computer games etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Apr 2012 17:00:47 GMT  (426kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1277v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["vikram kumar", "kamran niyazi", "swapnil mahe", "swapnil vyawahare"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1277"}
