Our bound for learning kernels with a convex combination of p base kernels has only a log(p) dependency on the number of kernels, p, which is considerably more favorable than the previous best bound given for the same problem. We also give a novel bound for learning with a linear combination of p base kernels with an L_2 regularization whose dependency on p is only in p^{1/4}.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Dec 2009 02:29:41 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3309v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["corinna cortes", "mehryar mohri", "afshin rostamizadeh"], "accepted": true, "id": "0912.3309"}
