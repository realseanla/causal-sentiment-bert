In this study, we have presented a conceptual model of Intelligent Agent System for Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA). To achieve this goal, we have introduced several kinds of agents that exhibit intelligent features. These are the Management agent, internal agent, External Agent, Watcher agent and Report agent. Metrics and measurements are suggested for evaluating the performance of Automatic Vehicle Checking Agent (VCA). Calibrate data and test facilities are suggested to facilitate the development of intelligent systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Apr 2011 06:31:24 GMT  (237kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1677v1", "5 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 3 Dec 2011 17:22:50 GMT  (73kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1677v2", "5 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bashir ahmad", "shakeel ahmad", "shahid hussain", "muhammad zaheer aslam", "zafar abbas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.1677"}
