The social cost of a candidate is the sum of its distances to each voter. Some of our work assumes that these points can be modeled on a real line, but other results of ours are more general.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 07:48:16 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05868v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["michal feldman", "amos fiat", "iddan golomb"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05868"}
