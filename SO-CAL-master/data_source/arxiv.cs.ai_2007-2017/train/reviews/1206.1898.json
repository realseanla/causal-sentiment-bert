Previous work has focused on representing possible functions explicitly, which leads to a two-step procedure of first, doing inference over the function space and second, finding the extrema of these functions. Here we skip the representation step and directly model the distribution over extrema. To this end, we devise a non-parametric conjugate prior where the natural parameter corresponds to a given kernel function and the sufficient statistic is composed of the observed function values. The resulting posterior distribution directly captures the uncertainty over the maximum of the unknown function.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Jun 2012 01:57:02 GMT  (391kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1898v1", "8 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 10 Nov 2012 18:09:17 GMT  (977kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1898v2", "9 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["pedro a ortega", "jordi grau-moya", "tim genewein", "david balduzzi", "daniel a braun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.1898"}
