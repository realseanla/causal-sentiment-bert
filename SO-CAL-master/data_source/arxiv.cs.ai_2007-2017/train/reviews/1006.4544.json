Any attempt of developing a web-based expert system dealing with human disease diagnosis has to overcome various difficulties. This paper describes a project work aiming to develop a web-based fuzzy expert system for diagnosing human diseases. Now a days fuzzy systems are being used successfully in an increasing number of application areas; they use linguistic rules to describe systems. This research project focuses on the research and development of a web-based clinical tool designed to improve the quality of the exchange of health information between health care professionals and patients. Practitioners can also use this web-based tool to corroborate diagnosis. The proposed system is experimented on various scenarios in order to evaluate it's performance. In all the cases, proposed system exhibits satisfactory results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 15:02:19 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4544v1", "IEEE Publication Format,this https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE Publication Format,this https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mir anamul hasan", "khaja md sher-e-alam", "ahsan raja chowdhury"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.4544"}
