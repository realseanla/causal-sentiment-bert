This approach recently gained popularity especially for solving combinatoric problems, but optimization applications are still emerging. The COCO platform of the BBOB workshop series is the current standard way to measure performance of continuous black-box optimization algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 13:26:57 GMT  (1127kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3487v1", "POSTER2014. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.5780by other authors without attribution"]], "COMMENTS": "POSTER2014. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.5780by other authors without attribution", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["petr baudi\\v{s}"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3487"}
