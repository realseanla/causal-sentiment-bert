Activities, such as alcohol consumption, may occur at different places and types of places, and it is important not only to detect the local regions where these activities occur, but also to analyze the degree of participation in them by local residents. In this paper, we develop new machine learning based methods for fine-grained localization of activities and home locations from Twitter data. We apply these methods to discover and compare alcohol consumption patterns in a large urban area, New York City, and a more suburban and rural area, Monroe County. We find positive correlations between the rate of alcohol consumption reported among a community's Twitter users and the density of alcohol outlets, demonstrating that the degree of correlation varies significantly between urban and suburban areas. While our experiments are focused on alcohol use, our methods for locating homes and distinguishing temporally-specific self-reports are applicable to a broad range of behaviors and latent states.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 08:32:34 GMT  (7173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03181v1", "12 pages, 7 figures, 4-page poster version accepted at ICWSM 2016, alcohol dataset and keywords available in: cs.rochester.edu/u/nhossain/icwsm-16-data.zip"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 7 figures, 4-page poster version accepted at ICWSM 2016, alcohol dataset and keywords available in: cs.rochester.edu/u/nhossain/icwsm-16-data.zip", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["nabil hossain", "tianran hu", "roghayeh feizi", "ann marie white", "jiebo luo", "henry kautz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03181"}
