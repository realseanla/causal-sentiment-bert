In particular, we show that for each $k$ there is a class of CNFs of treewidth $k \\geq 3$ for which the equivalent $c$-OBDDs are of size $\\Omega(n^{k/(8c-4)})$. Moreover, this lower bound holds if $c$-OBDD is non-deterministic and semantic. Our second result uses the above lower bound to separate the above model from sentential decision diagrams (SDDs). In order to obtain the lower bound, we use a structural graph parameter called matching width. Our third result shows that matching width and pathwidth are linearly related.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 Oct 2015 15:22:32 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02951v1", "Follow-up work of arxiv:1308.3829"]], "COMMENTS": "Follow-up work of arxiv:1308.3829", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI", "authors": ["igor razgon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.02951"}
