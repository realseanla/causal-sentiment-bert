Commitment-based communication, where communicating agents are seen as a debtor agent who is committed to a creditor agent to bring about something (possibly under some conditions) is now very well-established. The approach of DACMAS (Data-Aware Commitment-based MAS) lifts commitment-related approaches proposed in the literature from a propositional to a first-order setting via the adoption the DRL-Lite Description Logic. Notably, DACMASs provide, beyond commitments, simple forms of inter-agent event-based communication. Yet, the aspect is missing of making a MAS able to acquire knowledge from contexts which are not agents and which are external to the MAS. This topic is coped with in Managed MCSs (Managed Multi-Context Systems), where however exchanges are among knowledge bases and not agents. In this paper, we propose the new approach of DACmMCMASs (Data-Aware Commitment-based managed Multi- Context MAS), so as to obtain a commitment-based first-order agent system which is able to interact with heterogeneous external information sources. We show that DACmMCMASs retain the nice formal properties of the original approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 11:11:13 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2063v1", "Draft of a paper submitted to an International Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Draft of a paper submitted to an International Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stefania costantini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.2063"}
