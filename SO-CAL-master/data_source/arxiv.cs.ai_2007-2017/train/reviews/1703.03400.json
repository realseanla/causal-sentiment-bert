{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Mar-2017", "title": "Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks", "abstract": "We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on a few-shot image classification benchmark, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 18:58:03 GMT  (5061kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400v1", "Videos of the reinforcement learning results are at sites.google.com/view/maml"], ["v2", "Tue, 9 May 2017 17:14:08 GMT  (5065kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400v2", "Videos of the reinforcement learning results are atthis https URL"], ["v3", "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 16:45:29 GMT  (5063kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400v3", "ICML 2017.
