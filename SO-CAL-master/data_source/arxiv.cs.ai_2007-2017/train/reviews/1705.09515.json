In this study, the SLU task consists in automatically extracting, from ASR transcriptions , semantic concepts and concept/values pairs in a e.g touristic information system. An approach is proposed for enriching the set of semantic labels with error specific labels and by using a recently proposed neural approach based on word embeddings to compute well calibrated ASR confidence measures. Experimental results are reported showing that it is possible to decrease significantly the Concept/Value Error Rate with a state of the art system, outperforming previously published results performance on the same experimental data. It also shown that combining an SLU approach based on conditional random fields with a neural encoder/decoder attention based architecture , it is possible to effectively identifying confidence islands and uncertain semantic output segments useful for deciding appropriate error handling actions by the dialogue manager strategy .", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 10:34:24 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09515v1", "Interspeech 2017, Aug 2017, Stockholm, Sweden. 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Interspeech 2017, Aug 2017, Stockholm, Sweden. 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["edwin simonnet", "sahar ghannay", "nathalie camelin", "yannick est\\`eve", "renato de mori"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09515"}
