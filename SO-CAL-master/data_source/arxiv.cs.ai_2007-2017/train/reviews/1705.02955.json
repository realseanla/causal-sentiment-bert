{"conference": "nips", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-May-2017", "title": "Safe and Nested Subgame Solving for Imperfect-Information Games", "abstract": "Unlike perfect-information games, imperfect-information games cannot be solved by decomposing the game into subgames that are solved independently. Instead, all decisions must consider the strategy of the game as a whole, and more computationally intensive algorithms are used. While it is not possible to solve an imperfect-information game exactly through decomposition, it is possible to approximate solutions, or improve existing strategies, by solving disjoint subgames. This process is referred to as subgame solving. We introduce subgame solving techniques that outperform prior methods both in theory and practice. We also show how to adapt them, and past subgame solving techniques, to respond to opponent actions that are outside the original action abstraction; this significantly outperforms the prior state-of-the-art approach, action translation. Finally, we show that subgame solving can be repeated as the game progresses down the tree, leading to lower exploitability. Subgame solving is a key component of Libratus, the first AI to defeat top humans in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 16:27:48 GMT  (809kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02955v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 26 May 2017 21:44:39 GMT  (804kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02955v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["noam brown", "tuomas sandholm"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.02955"}
