This ensures that each row of a matrix of decision variables satisfies a Regular constraint, and each column satisfies a Gcc constraint. On the negative side, we prove that propagation is NP-hard even under some strong restrictions (e.g. just 3 values, just 4 states in the automaton, or just 5 columns to the matrix). On the positive side, we identify two cases where propagation is fixed parameter tractable. In addition, we show how to improve propagation over a simple decomposition into separate Regular and Gcc constraints by identifying some necessary but insufficient conditions for a solution. We enforce these conditions with some additional weighted row automata. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of these methods on some standard benchmark problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Jan 2012 03:30:18 GMT  (95kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0564v1", "Submitted to CPAIOR 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to CPAIOR 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ronald de haan", "nina narodytska", "toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.0564"}
