The new architecture is based on previous implementations of AgentSpeak and it is structurally simpler than its predecessors with the aim of facilitating design-time and run-time verification methods. The process of abstracting the LISA system to two different types of discrete probabilistic models (DTMC and MDP) is investigated and illustrated. The LISA system provides a tool for complete modelling of the agent and the environment for probabilistic verification. The agent program can be automatically compiled into a DTMC or a MDP model for verification with Prism. The automatically generated Prism model can be used for both design-time and run-time verification. The run-time verification is investigated and illustrated in the LISA system as an internal modelling mechanism for prediction of future outcomes.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 16:06:31 GMT  (22kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03372v1", "Accepted at IEEE Conf.
