We encode typical properties of systems including perfect recall, synchronicity, no learning, and having a unique initial state in terms of variants of quantified interpreted systems, a first-order extension of interpreted systems. We identify several monodic fragments of first-order temporal-epistemic logic and show their completeness with respect to their corresponding classes of quantified interpreted systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:43:00 GMT  (368kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5849v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["francesco belardinelli", "alessio lomuscio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5849"}
