Also, it was constructed an associated penta valued logic and then using this logic, it was defined for the proposed penta valued structure the following operators: union, intersection, negation, complement and dual. Then, the penta valued representation is extended to a hexa valued one, adding the sixth component, namely the index of ambiguity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 04:18:38 GMT  (441kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03729v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vasile patrascu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03729"}
