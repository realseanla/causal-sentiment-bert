The same result is shown to hold also for multivariate strictly positive normal distributions. Our proof uses a new property of conditional independence that holds for these two classes of probability distributions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:48:48 GMT  (178kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3834v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ann becker", "dan geiger", "christopher meek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3834"}
