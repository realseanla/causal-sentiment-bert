Penalties may be used as a criterion for selecting preferred consistent subsets in an inconsistent knowledge base, thus inducing a non-monotonic inference relation. A precise formalization and the main properties of penalty logic and of its associated non-monotonic inference relation are given in the first part. We also show that penalty logic and Dempster-Shafer theory are related, especially in the infinitesimal case.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:15:44 GMT  (1579kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6804v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florence dupin de saint-cyr", "jerome lang", "thomas schiex"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6804"}
