{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Mar-2017", "title": "A Hypercat-enabled Semantic Internet of Things Data Hub: Technical Report", "abstract": "An increasing amount of information is generated from the rapidly increasing number of sensor networks and smart devices. A wide variety of sources generate and publish information in different formats, thus highlighting interoperability as one of the key prerequisites for the success of Internet of Things (IoT). The BT Hypercat Data Hub provides a focal point for the sharing and consumption of available datasets from a wide range of sources. In this work, we propose a semantic enrichment of the BT Hypercat Data Hub, using well-accepted Semantic Web standards and tools. We propose an ontology that captures the semantics of the imported data and present the BT SPARQL Endpoint by means of a mapping between SPARQL and SQL queries. Furthermore, federated SPARQL queries allow queries over multiple hub-based and external data sources. Finally, we provide two use cases in order to illustrate the advantages afforded by our semantic approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 17:10:27 GMT  (424kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00391v1", "Technical report of an accepted ESWC-2017 paper"], ["v2", "Sun, 12 Mar 2017 13:18:29 GMT  (573kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00391v2", "Technical report of an accepted ESWC-2017 paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report of an accepted ESWC-2017 paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["ilias tachmazidis", "sotiris batsakis", "john davies", "alistair duke", "mauro vallati", "grigoris antoniou", "sandra stincic clarke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00391"}
