The problem is a central issue in many question-and-answer systems, but has received little research attention. Different from most existing studies that focus on expertise matching, we want to further predict the expert's response: given a question, how can we find the expert who is able to provide a quality review and will agree to do it. We formalize the problem as a ranking problem. We first present an embedding-based question-to-expert distance metric for expertise matching and propose a ranking factor graph (RankFG) model to predict expert response. For online evaluation, we developed a Chrome Extension for reviewer recommendation and deployed it in the Google Chrome Web Store, and then collected the reviewers' feedback. We also used the review bidding of a CS conference for evaluation. In the experiments, the proposed method demonstrates its superiority (+6.6-21.2% by MAP) over several state-of-the-art algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 12:46:24 GMT  (657kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04363v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yujie qian", "jie tang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04363"}
