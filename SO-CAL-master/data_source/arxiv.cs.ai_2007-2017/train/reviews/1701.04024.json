In contrast to chatbots, which simply seek to sustain open-ended meaningful discourse, existing task-oriented agents usually explicitly model user intent and belief states. This paper examines bypassing such an explicit representation by depending on a latent neural embedding of state and learning selective attention to dialogue history together with copying to incorporate relevant prior context. We complement recent work by showing the effectiveness of simple sequence-to-sequence neural architectures with a copy mechanism. Our model outperforms more complex memory-augmented models by 7% in per-response generation and is on par with the current state-of-the-art on DSTC2.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 10:38:17 GMT  (221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04024v1", "5 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 4 Feb 2017 09:31:18 GMT  (221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04024v2", "5 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:18:38 GMT  (223kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04024v3", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["mihail eric", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04024"}
