That is, management theories would be implemented as rules within a data analytics engine. We demonstrate a case study development of such an ontology by formally representing an accounting theory in First-Order Logic. Though quite preliminary, the idea that an information technology, namely ontologies, can potentially actualize the academic cliche, \"From Theory to Practice,\" and be applicable to the burgeoning domain of data analytics is novel and exciting.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 19:51:31 GMT  (311kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07846v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["henry m kim", "jackie ho nam cheung", "marek laskowski", "iryna gel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07846"}
