This approach represents human behaviour with probabilistic cause-effect relations based on knowledge, but also with conditional probabilities coming either from knowledge or deduced from observations. This approach has been applied to the co-simulation of the CO2 concentration in an office coupled with human behaviour.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 May 2016 14:16:39 GMT  (1945kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05966v1", "IBPSA India 2015, Dec 2015, Hyderabad, India. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1510.01970"]], "COMMENTS": "IBPSA India 2015, Dec 2015, Hyderabad, India. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1510.01970", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["khadija tijani", "stephane ploix", "benjamin haas", "julie dugdale", "quoc dung ngo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.05966"}
