However, the emergence of \"thinking\" that is a typical higher function is difficult to realize because \"thinking\" needs non fixed-point, flow-type attractors with both convergence and transition dynamics. Furthermore, in order to introduce \"inspiration\" or \"discovery\" in \"thinking\", not completely random but unexpected transition should be also required.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 06:54:04 GMT  (2015kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05551v1", "The Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making (RLDM) 2017, 5 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "The Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making (RLDM) 2017, 5 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["katsunari shibata", "yuki goto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05551"}
