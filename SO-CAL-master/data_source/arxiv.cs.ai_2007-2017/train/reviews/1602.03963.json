In this paper, a simple logistic regression model with pairwise interactions among a set of binary covariates is considered. Modeling the structure of the interactions by a graph, our goal is to recover the interaction graph from independently identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of the covariates and the outcome.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 05:04:21 GMT  (369kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03963v1", "13 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 28 Dec 2016 02:11:04 GMT  (440kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03963v2", "15 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["easton li xu", "xiaoning qian", "tie liu", "shuguang cui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.03963"}
