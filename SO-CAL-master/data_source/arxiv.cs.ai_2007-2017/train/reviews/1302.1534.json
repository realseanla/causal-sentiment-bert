We analyze the approximation for several tasks: finding the most probable explanation, belief updating and finding the maximum a posteriori hypothesis. We identify regions of completeness and provide preliminary empirical evaluation on randomly generated networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:54:58 GMT  (1228kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1534v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rina dechter", "irina rish"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1534"}
