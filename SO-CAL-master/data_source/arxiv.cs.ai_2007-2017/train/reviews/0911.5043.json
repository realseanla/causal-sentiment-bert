It is applicable on symbolic descriptions although it uses a numeric approach for the calculus. Considering that Description Logics stand as the theoretic framework for the ontological knowledge representation and reasoning, the proposed measure can be effectively used for agglomerative and divisional clustering task applied to the semantic web domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2009 10:21:31 GMT  (58kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5043v1", "13 pages, Appeared at CILC 2005, Convegno Italiano di Logica Computazionale also available atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, Appeared at CILC 2005, Convegno Italiano di Logica Computazionale also available atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["claudia d'amato", "nicola fanizzi", "floriana esposito"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.5043"}
