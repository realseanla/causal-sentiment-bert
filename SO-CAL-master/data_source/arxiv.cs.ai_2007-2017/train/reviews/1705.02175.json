The Event Calculus is a temporal logic that has been used as a basis in event recognition applications, providing among others, direct connections to machine learning, via Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). OLED is a recently proposed ILP system that learns event definitions in the form of Event Calculus theories, in a single pass over a data stream. In this work we present a version of OLED that allows for distributed, online learning. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark activity recognition dataset and show that we can significantly reduce training times, exchanging minimal information between processing nodes.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 11:40:11 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02175v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nikos katzouris", "alexander artikis", "georgios paliouras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02175"}
