As the amount of data resulting from a sensitivity analysis of even a moderately-sized network is alreadyoverwhelming, methods for extracting relevant information are called for. One such methodis to study the derivative of the sensitivity functions yielded for a network's parameters. We further propose to build upon the concept of admissible deviation, that is, the extent to which a parameter can deviate from the true value without inducing a change in the most likely outcome. We illustrate these concepts by means of a sensitivity analysis of a real-life probabilistic network in oncology.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:48 GMT  (936kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2314v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["linda c van der gaag", "silja renooij"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2314"}
