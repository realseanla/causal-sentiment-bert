We explore these challenges and potential contributions of knowledge-based tools using as an example the CADET system, a knowledge-based tool capable of producing automatically (or with human guidance) battle plans with realistic degree of detail and complexity. In ongoing experiments, it compared favorably with human planners. Interleaved planning, scheduling, routing, attrition and consumption processes comprise the computational approach of this tool. From the coalition operations perspective, such tools offer an important aid in rapid synchronization of assets and actions of heterogeneous assets belonging to multiple organizations, potentially with distinct doctrine and rules of engagement. In this paper, we discuss the functionality of the tool, provide a brief overview of the technical approach and experimental results, and outline the potential value of such tools.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 16:53:45 GMT  (555kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06069v1", "A version of this paper appeared in proceedings of the 2002 International Conference on Knowledge Systems for Coalition Operations (KSCO)"]], "COMMENTS": "A version of this paper appeared in proceedings of the 2002 International Conference on Knowledge Systems for Coalition Operations (KSCO)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["larry ground", "alexander kott", "ray budd"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06069"}
