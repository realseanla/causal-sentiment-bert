The approach converts the influence diagram into a simpler structure, the LImited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID), where only the requisite information for the computation of optimal policies is depicted. Because the requisite information is explicitly represented in the diagram, the evaluation procedure can take advantage of it. In this paper we show how to convert an influence diagram to a LIMID and describe the procedure for finding an optimal strategy. Our approach can yield significant savings of memory and computational time when compared to traditional methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:54 GMT  (331kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3881v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dennis nilsson", "steffen l lauritzen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3881"}
