While techniques to solve Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are abundant and have matured substantially since the field inception, the number of DCOP realistic applications and benchmark used to asses the performance of DCOP algorithms is lagging behind. To contrast this background we (i) introduce the Smart Home Device Scheduling (SHDS) problem, which describe the problem of coordinating smart devices schedules across multiple homes as a multi-agent system, (ii) detail the physical models adopted to simulate smart sensors, smart actuators, and homes environments, and (iii) introduce a DCOP realistic benchmark for SHDS problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 19:10:30 GMT  (615kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06970v1", "15 pages, OPTMAS17"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, OPTMAS17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["william kluegel", "muhammad aamir iqbal", "ferdinando fioretto", "william yeoh", "enrico pontelli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06970"}
