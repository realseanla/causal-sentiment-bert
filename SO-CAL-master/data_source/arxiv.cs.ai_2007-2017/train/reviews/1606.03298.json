A plethora of inference algorithms have been developed that work well on specific models or only on parts of general models. Consequently, a system that can intelligently apply these inference algorithms to different parts of a model for fast reasoning is highly desirable. We introduce a new framework called structured factored inference (SFI) that provides the foundation for such a system. Using models encoded in a probabilistic programming language, SFI provides a sound means to decompose a model into sub-models, apply an inference algorithm to each sub-model, and combine the resulting information to answer a query. Our results show that SFI is nearly as accurate as exact inference yet retains the benefits of approximate inference methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 12:53:01 GMT  (1033kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03298v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["avi pfeffer", "brian ruttenberg", "william kretschmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03298"}
