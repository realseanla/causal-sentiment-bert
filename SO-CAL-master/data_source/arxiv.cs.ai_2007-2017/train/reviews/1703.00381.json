We develop an un-gated unit, the statistical recurrent unit (SRU), that is able to learn long term dependencies in data by only keeping moving averages of statistics. The SRU's architecture is simple, un-gated, and contains a comparable number of parameters to LSTMs; yet, SRUs perform favorably to more sophisticated LSTM and GRU alternatives, often outperforming one or both in various tasks. We show the efficacy of SRUs as compared to LSTMs and GRUs in an unbiased manner by optimizing respective architectures' hyperparameters in a Bayesian optimization scheme for both synthetic and real-world tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:50:54 GMT  (570kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00381v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["junier b oliva", "barnab\u00e1s p\u00f3czos", "jeff g schneider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.00381"}
