No Bayesian network knowledge is required to use the tool, and troubleshooting information can be specified as natural and intuitive as possible. Probabilities can be specified in the direction that is most natural to the domain expert. Thus, the knowledge acquisition efficiently removes the traditional knowledge acquisition bottleneck of Bayesian networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:52:41 GMT  (412kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3893v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["claus skaanning"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3893"}
