CP systems with finite domain constraints usually employ CSP-based solvers which use local consistency, for example, arc consistency. We introduce a new approach which is based instead on variable substitution. We obtain efficient algorithms for reducing systems involving functional and bi-functional constraints together with other non-functional constraints. It also solves globally any CSP where there exists a variable such that any other variable is reachable from it through a sequence of functional constraints. Our experiments on random problems show that variable elimination can significantly improve the efficiency of solving problems with functional constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jun 2010 13:49:16 GMT  (504kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3215v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.PL", "authors": ["yuanlin zhang", "roland h c yap"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.3215"}
