Based on principles of autocatalysis, endogeny, and reflectivity, the work provides an architectural blueprint for constructing systems with high levels of operational autonomy in underspecified circumstances, starting from a small seed. Through value-driven dynamic priority scheduling controlling the parallel execution of a vast number of reasoning threads, the system achieves recursive self-improvement after it leaves the lab, within the boundaries imposed by its designers. A prototype system has been implemented and demonstrated to learn a complex real-world task, real-time multimodal dialogue with humans, by on-line observation. Our work presents solutions to several challenges that must be solved for achieving artificial general intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 06:17:55 GMT  (1569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6764v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["e nivel", "k r th\\'orisson", "b r steunebrink", "h dindo", "g pezzulo", "m rodriguez", "c hernandez", "d ognibene", "j schmidhuber", "r sanz", "h p helgason", "a chella", "g k jonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6764"}
