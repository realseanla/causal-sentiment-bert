We present a novel methodology for autonomously generating investigation leads that help identify systems faults, and extends our previous work in this area by leveraging Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and contrastive divergence learning to analyse changes in historical feature data. This allows us to heuristically identify the root cause of a fault, and demonstrate an improvement to the state of the art by showing feature data can be predicted heuristically beyond a single instance to include entire sequences of information.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 14:18:25 GMT  (394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01501v1", "Published and presented in the 11th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Engineering of Autonomic and Autonomous Systems (EASe 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Published and presented in the 11th IEEE International Conference and Workshops on Engineering of Autonomic and Autonomous Systems (EASe 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["chris schneider", "adam barker", "simon dobson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.01501"}
