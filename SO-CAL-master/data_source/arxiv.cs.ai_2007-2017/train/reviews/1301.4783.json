This combination allows the detection and the annotation of objects contained in point clouds. The context of the study is the detection of railway objects such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc. Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS systems or an IFC file for architecture purposes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:16:53 GMT  (927kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4783v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CG cs.AI", "authors": ["helmi ben hmida", "christophe cruz", "frank boochs", "christophe nicolle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4783"}
