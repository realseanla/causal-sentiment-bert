We consider the use of what we call preambles, which are sequences of variables with corresponding single-variable assignment actions intended to be used to determine a more suitable initial truth assignment for a given problem instance and a given heuristic. For a number of well established MAX-SAT heuristics and benchmark instances, we demonstrate that preambles can be evolved by a genetic algorithm such that the heuristics are outperformed in a significant fraction of the cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Feb 2011 16:37:59 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3868v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["luis o rigo jr", "valmir c barbosa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.3868"}
