To date, it has been used to embed in it default logic (propositional case), autoepistemic logic, Turner's logic of universal causation, and general logic programming under stable model semantics. Besides showing the generality of GK as a logic for nonmonotonic reasoning, these embeddings shed light on the relationships among these other logics. In this paper, for the first time, we show how the logic of GK can be embedded into disjunctive logic programming in a polynomial but non-modular translation with new variables. The result can then be used to compute the extension/expansion semantics of default logic, autoepistemic logic and Turner's logic of universal causation by disjunctive ASP solvers such as claspD(-2), DLV, GNT and cmodels.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 07:45:30 GMT  (39kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0809v1", "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["jianmin ji", "hannes strass"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0809"}
