We learned the extent of this often-cited observation in the construction of the probabilistic part of a complex influence diagram in the field of cancer treatment. Based upon our negative experiences with existing methods, we designed a new method for probability elicitation from domain experts. The method combines various ideas, among which are the ideas of transcribing probabilities and of using a scale with both numerical and verbal anchors for marking assessments. In the construction of the probabilistic part of our influence diagram, the method proved to allow for the elicitation of many probabilities in little time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:01:22 GMT  (227kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6745v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["linda c van der gaag", "silja renooij", "cilia l m witteman", "berthe m p aleman", "babs g taal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6745"}
