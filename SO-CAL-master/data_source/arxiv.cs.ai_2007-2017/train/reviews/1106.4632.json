While previous work has shown how to extract a planar kinematic model (often represented as a linear chain), such planar models do not apply to 3D objects that are composed of segments often linked to the other segments in cyclic configurations. We present an approach for building a model that captures the relation between the input point cloud features and the object segment as well as the relation between the neighboring object segments. We use a conditional random field that allows us to model the dependencies between different segments of the object. We test our approach on inferring the kinematic structure from partial and noisy point cloud data for a wide variety of boxes including cake boxes, pizza boxes, and cardboard cartons of several sizes. The inferred structure enables our robot to successfully close these boxes by manipulating the flaps.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jun 2011 05:32:39 GMT  (7004kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4632v1", "For: RSS 2011 Workshop on Mobile Manipulation: Learning to Manipulate"]], "COMMENTS": "For: RSS 2011 Workshop on Mobile Manipulation: Learning to Manipulate", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["heran yang", "tiffany low", "matthew cong", "ashutosh saxena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.4632"}
