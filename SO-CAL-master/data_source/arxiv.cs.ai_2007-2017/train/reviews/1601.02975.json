The analysis shows that three relevant hypotheses are largely supported by the data. These hypotheses are: early submission is a good sign, a high level of activity is predictive of good results and evening activity is even better than daytime activity. We highlight some pathological examples where high levels of activity correlates with bad results.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 17:42:24 GMT  (337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02975v1", "Short version"]], "COMMENTS": "Short version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["ewa m{\\l}ynarska", "derek greene", "p\\'adraig cunningham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02975"}
