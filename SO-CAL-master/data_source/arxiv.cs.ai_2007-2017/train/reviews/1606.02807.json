To accomplish this, machines need to learn about their human users' intentions and adapt to their preferences. In most current research, a user has conveyed preferences to a machine using explicit corrective or instructive feedback; explicit feedback imposes a cognitive load on the user and is expensive in terms of human effort. The primary objective of the current work is to demonstrate that a learning agent can reduce the amount of explicit feedback required for adapting to the user's preferences pertaining to a task by learning to perceive a value of its behavior from the human user, particularly from the user's facial expressions---we call this face valuing. We empirically evaluate face valuing on a grip selection task. Our preliminary results suggest that an agent can quickly adapt to a user's changing preferences with minimal explicit feedback by learning a value function that maps facial features extracted from a camera image to expected future reward. We believe that an agent learning to perceive a value from the body language of its human user is complementary to existing interactive machine learning approaches and will help in creating successful human-machine interactive applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 03:06:46 GMT  (4210kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02807v1", "7 pages, 4 figures, IJCAI 2016 - Interactive Machine Learning Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures, IJCAI 2016 - Interactive Machine Learning Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["vivek veeriah", "patrick m pilarski", "richard s sutton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02807"}
