Compared to standard labelings, stratified labelings provide a more fine-grained assessment of the controversiality of arguments using ranks instead of the usual labels in, out, and undecided. We relate the framework of stratified labelings to conditional logic and, in particular, to the System Z ranking functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Aug 2013 13:08:50 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0807v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["matthias thimm", "gabriele kern-isberner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0807"}
