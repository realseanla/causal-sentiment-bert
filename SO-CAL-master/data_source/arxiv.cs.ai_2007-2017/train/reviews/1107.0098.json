This connection suggests the possibility that methods of continuous mathematics can provide crucial insights into the most intriguing open questions in modern complexity theory.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 03:43:19 GMT  (950kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0098v1", "16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jul 2011 01:57:22 GMT  (942kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0098v2", "16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"], ["v3", "Thu, 2 Aug 2012 21:14:17 GMT  (1006kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0098v3", "16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI cs.DM cs.DS", "authors": ["alexander y davydov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0098"}
