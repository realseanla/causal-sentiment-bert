The gains of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller in STATCOM are being optimized by heuristic technique based on Particle swarm optimization (PSO). Further, Bacterial Foraging Optimization (BFO) as an alternative heuristic method is also applied to select optimal gains of PID controller. The performance of STATCOM with the above soft-computing techniques are studied and compared with the conventional PID controller under various scenarios. The simulation results are accompanied with performance indices based quantitative analysis. The analysis clearly signifies the robustness of the new scheme in terms of stability and voltage regulation when compared with conventional PID.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Oct 2016 22:55:32 GMT  (320kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00001v1", "5 pages, 7 figures, 2016 IEEE Students' Technology Symposium (TechSym 2016), At IIT Kharagpur, India"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 7 figures, 2016 IEEE Students' Technology Symposium (TechSym 2016), At IIT Kharagpur, India", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["shiba r paital", "prakash k ray", "asit mohanty", "sandipan patra", "harishchandra dubey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00001"}
