{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Jan-2015", "title": "Long-term Causal Effects via Behavioral Game Theory", "abstract": "Estimation of causal effects of interventions in dynamical systems of interacting agents is under-developed. In this paper, we explore the intricacies of this problem through standard approaches, and demonstrate the need for more appropriate methods. Working under the Neyman-Rubin causal model, we proceed to develop a causal inference method and we explicate the stability assumptions that are necessary for valid causal inference. Our method consists of a behavioral component that models the evolution of agent behaviors over time and informs on the long-term distribution of agent behaviors in the system, and a game-theoretic component that models the observed distribution of agent actions conditional on adopted behaviors. This allows the imputation of long-term estimates of quantities of interest, and thus the estimation of long-term causal effects of interventions. We demonstrate our method on a dataset from behavioral game theory, and discuss open problems to stimulate future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 Jan 2015 07:06:43 GMT  (223kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 03:10:48 GMT  (222kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 20:20:48 GMT  (138kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 16 Oct 2015 17:50:51 GMT  (366kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 17:58:47 GMT  (390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v5", null], ["v6", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 01:08:18 GMT  (390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v6", "Fixed errors with citation style"], ["v7", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 21:26:47 GMT  (137kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v7", "30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS'16)"], ["v8", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 02:18:51 GMT  (137kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02315v8", "30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS'16)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ME cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["panagiotis toulis", "david c parkes"], "accepted": true, "id": "1501.02315"}
