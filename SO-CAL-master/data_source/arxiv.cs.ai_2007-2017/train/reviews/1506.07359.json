The non-dualistic decision theory literature is split between causal decision theory and evidential decision theory. We extend these decision algorithms to the sequential setting where the agent alternates between taking actions and observing their consequences. We find that evidential decision theory has two natural extensions while causal decision theory only has one.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 13:16:16 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07359v1", "ADT 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "ADT 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tom everitt", "jan leike", "marcus hutter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.07359"}
