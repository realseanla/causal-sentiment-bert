An adaptive learning algorithm is proposed that has both tracking and smoothing properties. An ENFN distinctive feature is its computational simplicity compared to other artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:25:38 GMT  (540kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06483v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "daria s kopaliani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06483"}
