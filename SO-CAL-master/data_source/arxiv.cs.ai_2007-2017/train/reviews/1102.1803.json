{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Feb-2011", "title": "Proposing LT based Search in PDM Systems for Better Information Retrieval", "abstract": "PDM Systems contain and manage heavy amount of data but the search mechanism of most of the systems is not intelligent which can process user\"s natural language based queries to extract desired information. Currently available search mechanisms in almost all of the PDM systems are not very efficient and based on old ways of searching information by entering the relevant information to the respective fields of search forms to find out some specific information from attached repositories. Targeting this issue, a thorough research was conducted in fields of PDM Systems and Language Technology. Concerning the PDM System, conducted research provides the information about PDM and PDM Systems in detail. Concerning the field of Language Technology, helps in implementing a search mechanism for PDM Systems to search user\"s needed information by analyzing user\"s natural language based requests. The accomplished goal of this research was to support the field of PDM with a new proposition of a conceptual model for the implementation of natural language based search. The proposed conceptual model is successfully designed and partially implementation in the form of a prototype. Describing the proposition in detail the main concept, implementation designs and developed prototype of proposed approach is discussed in this paper. Implemented prototype is compared with respective functions of existing PDM systems .i.e., Windchill and CIM to evaluate its effectiveness against targeted challenges.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Feb 2011 08:16:50 GMT  (1015kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1803v1", "15 pages, 31 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 31 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["zeeshan ahmed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.1803"}
