So far, the solutions have been primarily manual which elicit human observation of entities to discern the hostility of the situation. To cater to this problem statement, a number of fully automated and partially automated solutions exist. But, these solutions lack the capability of learning from experiences and work in conjunction with human supervision which is extremely prone to error. In this paper, a generalized methodology to predict the hostility of a given object based on its movement patterns is proposed which has the ability to learn and is based upon the mechanism of humans of learning from experiences. The methodology so proposed has been implemented in a computer simulation. The results show that the posited methodology has the potential to be applied in real world tactical scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Jan 2015 09:07:45 GMT  (282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00653v1", "To appear in IEEE Xplore as a part of the proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing, 2014, at Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in IEEE Xplore as a part of the proceedings of the 3rd IEEE International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Grid Computing, 2014, at Jaypee University of Information Technology, Solan", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["souham biswas", "manisha j nene"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00653"}
