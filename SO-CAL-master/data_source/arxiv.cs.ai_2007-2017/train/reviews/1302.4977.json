We establish a graphical criterion for recognizing when the effects of a given plan can be predicted from passive observations on measured variables only. When the criterion is satisfied, a closed-form expression is provided for the probability that the plan will achieve a specified goal.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:09 GMT  (400kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4977v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judea pearl", "james m robins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4977"}
