In this paper we introduce Hyper Temporal Networks (HyTNs), a strict generalization of STNs, to overcome the limitation of considering only conjunctions of constraints but maintaining a practical efficiency in the consistency check of the instances. In a Hyper Temporal Network a single temporal hyperarc constraint may be defined as a set of two or more maximum delay constraints which is satisfied when at least one of these delay constraints is satisfied. HyTNs are meant as a light generalization of STNs offering an interesting compromise. On one side, there exist practical pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for checking consistency and computing feasible schedules for HyTNs. On the other side, HyTNs offer a more powerful model accommodating natural constraints that cannot be expressed by STNs like Trigger off exactly delta min before (after) the occurrence of the first (last) event in a set., which are used to represent synchronization events in some process aware information systems/workflow models proposed in the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 07:44:19 GMT  (71kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03974v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 8 May 2016 17:00:34 GMT  (113kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03974v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:49:44 GMT  (133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03974v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["carlo comin", "roberto posenato", "romeo rizzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03974"}
