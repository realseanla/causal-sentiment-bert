This order metric can be minimized as an ordinal regression problem, leading to a LUPI (Learning Using Privileged Information) application where we take the privileged information as some desired ordering, and construct a faster-converging hypothesis space by empirically restricting some larger hypothesis space according to that ordering. We give a risk analysis of the approach. We discuss the difficulties with model selection and give an innovative technique for selecting multiple model parameters. Finally, we provide some data experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 17:06:30 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09577v1", "10 pages, 1 table, 2 page appendix giving proofs"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 1 table, 2 page appendix giving proofs", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas vacek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09577"}
