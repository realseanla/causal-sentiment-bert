Atari 2600 games, however, do not resemble real-world tasks since they involve non-realistic 2D environments and the third-person perspective. Here, we propose a novel test-bed platform for reinforcement learning research from raw visual information which employs the first-person perspective in a semi-realistic 3D world. The software, called ViZDoom, is based on the classical first-person shooter video game, Doom. It allows developing bots that play the game using the screen buffer. ViZDoom is lightweight, fast, and highly customizable via a convenient mechanism of user scenarios. In the experimental part, we test the environment by trying to learn bots for two scenarios: a basic move-and-shoot task and a more complex maze-navigation problem. Using convolutional deep neural networks with Q-learning and experience replay, for both scenarios, we were able to train competent bots, which exhibit human-like behaviors. The results confirm the utility of ViZDoom as an AI research platform and imply that visual reinforcement learning in 3D realistic first-person perspective environments is feasible.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 20:46:34 GMT  (3644kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02097v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 19:12:49 GMT  (3592kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02097v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["micha{\\l} kempka", "marek wydmuch", "grzegorz runc", "jakub toczek", "wojciech ja\\'skowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02097"}
