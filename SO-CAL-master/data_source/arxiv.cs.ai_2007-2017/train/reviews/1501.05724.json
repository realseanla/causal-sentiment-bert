Perfectible similarity measures, consid-ered as sources of information, are combined to establish these links. The theory of belief functions is a powerful mathematical tool for combining such uncertain information. In this paper, we introduce a decision pro-cess based on a distance measure to identify the best possible matching entities for a given source entity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Jan 2015 07:17:37 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05724v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amira essaid", "arnaud martin", "gr\\'egory smits", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.05724"}
