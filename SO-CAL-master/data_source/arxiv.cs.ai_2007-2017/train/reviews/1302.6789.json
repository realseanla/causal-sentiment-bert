Such a reasoner needs to explore the space of not only those situations that have occurred in the past, but also those that are rationally conceivable. In this paper we present a formalism for exploring the space of conceivable situation-models for those domains in which the knowledge is primarily probabilistic in nature. The formalism seeks to construct consistent, minimal, and desirable situation-descriptions by selecting suitable domain-attributes and dependency relationships from the available domain knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:14:14 GMT  (745kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6789v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["raj bhatnagar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6789"}
