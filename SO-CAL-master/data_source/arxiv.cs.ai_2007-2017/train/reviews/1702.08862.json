We complement our algorithms with lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our results imply that, using space which does not depend on the number of voters it is possible to efficiently identify an approximate representative committee of fixed size over vote streams with huge number of voters.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:57:49 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08862v1", "Accepted as a full paper in AAMAS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a full paper in AAMAS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.CC cs.DS cs.MA", "authors": ["palash dey", "nimrod talmon", "otniel van handel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08862"}
