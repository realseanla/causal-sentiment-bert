We then redefine concept of neutrosophic soft set and their operation based on \\c{C}a\\u{g}man \\cite{cagman-2014} and investigate some properties of these operations. We then construct an decision making method and group decision making which selects an optimum element from the alternatives by using weights of parameters. We finally present an example which shows that the method can be successfully applied to many problems that contain uncertainties", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 May 2014 19:32:36 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7964v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.2724by other authors"], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 21:44:43 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7964v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.2724by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1305.2724by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["faruk karaaslan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7964"}
