This controlled language can be used to write non-monotonic specifications that have the same expressive power as Answer Set Programs. In order to support the writing process of these specifications, the predictive text editor communicates asynchronously with the controlled natural language processor that generates lookahead categories and additional auxiliary information for the author of a specification text. The text editor can display multiple sets of lookahead categories simultaneously for different possible sentence completions, anaphoric expressions, and supports the addition of new content words to the lexicon.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 01:00:59 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0016v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["stephen guy", "rolf schwitter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.0016"}
