We consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sub-linearly with the number of possible classes. This implies that features should be shared by several classes. We describe and analyze the ShareBoost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. We prove that ShareBoost efficiently finds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. We also describe how to use ShareBoost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. In a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the benefits of ShareBoost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Sep 2011 07:52:17 GMT  (156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.0820v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV stat.ML", "authors": ["shai shalev-shwartz", "yonatan wexler", "amnon shashua"], "accepted": true, "id": "1109.0820"}
