{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Jun-2016", "title": "How to advance general game playing artificial intelligence by player modelling", "abstract": "General game playing artificial intelligence has recently seen important advances due to the various techniques known as 'deep learning'. However the advances conceal equally important limitations in their reliance on: massive data sets; fortuitously constructed problems; and absence of any human-level complexity, including other human opponents. On the other hand, deep learning systems which do beat human champions, such as in Go, do not generalise well. The power of deep learning simultaneously exposes its weakness. Given that deep learning is mostly clever reconfigurations of well-established methods, moving beyond the state of art calls for forward-thinking visionary solutions, not just more of the same. I present the argument that general game playing artificial intelligence will require a generalised player model. This is because games are inherently human artefacts which therefore, as a class of problems, contain cases which require a human-style problem solving approach. I relate this argument to the performance of state of art general game playing agents. I then describe a concept for a formal category theoretic basis to a generalised player model. This formal model approach integrates my existing 'Behavlets' method for psychologically-derived player modelling:", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 19:07:48 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00401v1", "Submitted to 2016 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games. 7 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 13:15:53 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00401v2", "Submitted to 2016 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games. 7 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 12:18:24 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00401v3", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to 2016 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence and Games. 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["benjamin ultan cowley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00401"}
