Our model is a hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network, where the layers and the structure of the hierarchy encode our prior knowledge about how pop music is composed. In particular, the bottom layers generate the melody, while the higher levels produce the drums and chords. We conduct several human studies that show strong preference of our generated music over that produced by the recent method by Google. We additionally show two applications of our framework: neural dancing and karaoke, as well as neural story singing.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 20:35:47 GMT  (1278kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03477v1", "under review at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "under review at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI", "authors": ["hang chu", "raquel urtasun", "sanja fidler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03477"}
