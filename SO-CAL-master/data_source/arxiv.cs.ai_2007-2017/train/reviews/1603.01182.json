In this paper, we develop a computational technique of distributed processing elements, which are called particles. We observe the collective dynamics of particles in a complex network for transductive inference on semi-supervised learning problems. Three actions govern the particles' dynamics: walking, absorption, and generation. Labeled vertices generate new particles that compete against rival particles for edge domination. Active particles randomly walk in the network until they are absorbed by either a rival vertex or an edge currently dominated by rival particles. The result from the model simulation consists of sets of edges sorted by the label dominance. Each set tends to form a connected subnetwork to represent a data class. Although the intrinsic dynamics of the model is a stochastic one, we prove there exists a deterministic version with largely reduced computational complexity; specifically, with subquadratic growth. Furthermore, the edge domination process corresponds to an unfolding map. Intuitively, edges \"stretch\" and \"shrink\" according to edge dynamics. Consequently, such effect summarizes the relevant relationships between vertices and uncovered data classes. The proposed model captures important details of connectivity patterns over the edge dynamics evolution, which contrasts with previous approaches focused on vertex dynamics. Computer simulations reveal that our model can identify nonlinear features in both real and artificial data, including boundaries between distinct classes and the overlapping structure of data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 17:11:23 GMT  (1280kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01182v1", "14 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 7 figures, 1 appendix, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["filipe alves neto verri", "paulo roberto urio", "liang zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01182"}
