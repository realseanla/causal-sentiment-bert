Using cognitive mapping concepts for DEM registration, has evolved from this basic idea of using the mapping between the space to objects and defining their relationships to form the basic landmarks that need to be marked, stored and manipulated in and about the environment or other candidate environments, namely, in our case, the DEMs. The progressive two-level encapsulation of methods of geo-spatial cognition includes landmark knowledge and layout knowledge and can be useful for DEM registration. Space-based approach, that emphasizes on explicit extent of the environment under consideration, and object-based approach, that emphasizes on the relationships between objects in the local environment being the two paradigms of cognitive mapping can be methodically integrated in this three-architecture for DEM registration. Initially, P-model based segmentation is performed followed by landmark formation for contextual mapping that uses contextual pyramid formation. Apart from landmarks being used for registration key-point finding, Euclidean distance based deformation calculation has been used for transformation and change detection. Landmarks have been categorized to belong to either being flat-plain areas without much variation in the land heights; peaks that can be found when there is gradual increase in height as compared to the flat areas; valleys, marked with gradual decrease in the height seen in DEM; and finally, ripple areas with very shallow crests and nadirs. Fractal based compression was used for storage of co-registered DEMs. This method may further be extended for DEM-topographic map and DEM-to-remote sensed image registration. Experimental results further cement the fact that DEM registration may be effectively done using the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 May 2014 05:59:01 GMT  (813kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6662v1", "17 pages, 8 tables, and 3 figures; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 10, Issue 3, No 1, May 2013, ISSN (Print): 1694-0814 | ISSN (Online): 1694-0784 (www.IJCSI.org)"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 8 tables, and 3 figures; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 10, Issue 3, No 1, May 2013, ISSN (Print): 1694-0814 | ISSN (Online): 1694-0784 (www.IJCSI.org)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["suma dawn", "vikas saxena", "bhudev sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6662"}
