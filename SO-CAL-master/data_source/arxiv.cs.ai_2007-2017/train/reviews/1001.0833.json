Many large scale problems exist in document clustering. RI K-tree scales well with large inputs due to its low complexity. It also exhibits features that are useful for managing a changing collection. Furthermore, it solves previous issues with sparse document vectors when using K-tree. The algorithms and data structures are defined, explained and motivated. Specific modifications to K-tree are made for use with RI. Experiments have been executed to measure quality. The results indicate that RI K-tree improves document cluster quality over the original K-tree algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 08:03:20 GMT  (154kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0833v1", "8 pages, ADCS 2009"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Feb 2010 02:46:22 GMT  (135kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0833v2", "8 pages, ADCS 2009; Hyperref and cleveref LaTeX packages conflicted.
