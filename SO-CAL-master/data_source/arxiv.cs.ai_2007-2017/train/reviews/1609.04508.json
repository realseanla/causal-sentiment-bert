An important task is collective classification, which is to jointly classify networked objects. While it holds a great promise to produce a better accuracy than non-collective classifiers, collective classification is computational challenging and has not leveraged on the recent breakthroughs of deep learning. We present Column Network (CLN), a novel deep learning model for collective classification in multi-relational domains. CLN has many desirable theoretical properties: (i) it encodes multi-relations between any two instances; (ii) it is deep and compact, allowing complex functions to be approximated at the network level with a small set of free parameters; (iii) local and relational features are learned simultaneously; (iv) long-range, higher-order dependencies between instances are supported naturally; and (v) crucially, learning and inference are efficient, linear in the size of the network and the number of relations. We evaluate CLN on multiple real-world applications: (a) delay prediction in software projects, (b) PubMed Diabetes publication classification and (c) film genre classification. In all applications, CLN demonstrates a higher accuracy than state-of-the-art rivals.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 04:45:11 GMT  (726kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04508v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 03:59:26 GMT  (280kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04508v2", "Accepted at AAAI'17"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["trang pham", "truyen tran 0001", "dinh q phung", "svetha venkatesh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.04508"}
