This is a celebrated problem known as Auto-Regression. Dealing with outlier or missed samples in a time series makes the problem of estimation difficult, so it should be robust against them. Moreover for coding purposes I will show that it is desired the residual of auto-regression be sparse. To these aims, I first assume a multivariate Gaussian prior on the residual and then obtain the estimation. Two simple simulations have been done on spectrum estimation and speech coding.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 07:49:44 GMT  (405kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3317v1", "4 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Aug 2015 16:59:06 GMT  (523kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3317v2", "4 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohsen joneidi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.3317"}
