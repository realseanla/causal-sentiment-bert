The idea is to create an electronic card containing basic information about a person's psychological behavior in order to make it possible to quickly decide about the suitability of one for another. This \"psychological electronics\" approach could be tested via student projects.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Jan 2011 17:30:31 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.3465v1", "This is an unusual work, not easy for classification.
