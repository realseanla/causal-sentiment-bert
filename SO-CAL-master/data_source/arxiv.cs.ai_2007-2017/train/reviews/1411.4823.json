Various kinds of deontic logics are discussed for different application domains like argumentation theory, legal reasoning, and acts in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how standard deontic logic can be stepwise transformed into description logic and DL- clauses, such that it can be processed by Hyper, a high performance theorem prover which uses a hypertableau calculus. Two use cases, one from multi-agent research and one from the development of normative system are investigated.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 12:27:01 GMT  (77kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4823v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ulrich furbach", "claudia schon", "frieder stolzenburg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4823"}
