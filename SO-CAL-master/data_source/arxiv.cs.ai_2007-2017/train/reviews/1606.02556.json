{"conference": "nips", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jun-2016", "title": "DISCO Nets: DISsimilarity COefficient Networks", "abstract": "We present a new type of probabilistic model which we call DISsimilarity COefficient Networks (DISCO Nets). DISCO Nets allow us to efficiently sample from a posterior distribution parametrised by a neural network. During training, DISCO Nets are learned by minimising the dissimilarity coefficient between the true distribution and the estimated distribution. This allows us to tailor the training to the loss related to the task at hand. We empirically show that (i) by modeling uncertainty on the output value, DISCO Nets outperform equivalent non-probabilistic predictive networks and (ii) DISCO Nets accurately model the uncertainty of the output, outperforming existing probabilistic models based on deep neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 13:57:44 GMT  (4407kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02556v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 16:01:04 GMT  (4408kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02556v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 07:45:20 GMT  (4410kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02556v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 15:19:45 GMT  (4410kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02556v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 11:27:45 GMT  (4377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02556v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["diane bouchacourt", "m pawan kumar", "sebastian nowozin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02556"}
