But the truth and knowledge ordering of intervals in bilattice-based triangle can not deal with nonmonotonic reasoning and are not always intuitive. In this work, we construct an alternative algebraic structure, namely poset-based triangle and we provide with proper logical connectives for this. It as an enhancement of the bilattice-based triangle to handle nonmonotonicity in logical reasoning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:28:43 GMT  (558kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05616v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 10:37:58 GMT  (558kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05616v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 12 May 2017 09:04:31 GMT  (588kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05616v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kumar sankar ray", "sandip paul", "diganta saha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05616"}
