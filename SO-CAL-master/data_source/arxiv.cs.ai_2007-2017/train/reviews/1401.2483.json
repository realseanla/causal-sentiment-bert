Sepak takraw is a highly complex net-barrier kicking sport that involves dazzling displays of quick reflexes, acrobatic twists, turns and swerves of the agile human body movement. A Bicycle kick or Scissor kick is a physical move made by throwing the body up into the air, making a shearing movement with the legs to get one leg in front of the other without holding on to the ground. Specifically, this paper considers bicycle kick of sepak takraw game in start kicking of the ball with uncertainty where player has different awareness regarding the contingencies. We have chosen Dempster-Shafer theory because the advantages of the Dempster-Shafer theory which include the ability to model information in a flexible way without requiring a probability to be assigned to each element in a set, providing a convenient and simple mechanism for combining two or more pieces of evidence under certain conditions, it can model ignorance explicitly, rejection of the law of additivity for belief in disjoint propositions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 23:48:40 GMT  (879kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2483v1", "Middle-East Journal of Scientific Research, Vol. 16, No. 7, 2013.
