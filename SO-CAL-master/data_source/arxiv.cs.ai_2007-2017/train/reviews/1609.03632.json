The interpretation of events and entities is highly contextually dependent. Existing work in information extraction typically models events separately from entities, and performs inference at the sentence level, ignoring the rest of the document. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that models the dependencies among variables of events, entities, and their relations, and performs joint inference of these variables across a document. The goal is to enable access to document-level contextual information and facilitate context-aware predictions. We demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for event extraction as well as a strong baseline for entity extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 23:27:37 GMT  (503kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03632v1", "11 pages, 2 figures, published at NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 2 figures, published at NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["bishan yang", "tom m mitchell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.03632"}
