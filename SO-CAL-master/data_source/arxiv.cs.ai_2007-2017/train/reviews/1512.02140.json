Subsequently the concepts were used in the formal framework of rough Y-systems (RYS) for developing on granular correspondences by her. These have since been used for a new approach towards comparison of rough algebraic semantics across different semantic domains by way of correspondences that preserve rough evolution and try to avoid contamination. In this research paper, new methods are proposed and a semantics for handling possibly contaminated operations and structured bigness is developed. These would also be of natural interest for relative consistency of one collection of knowledge relative other.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:50:05 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02140v1", "Preprint of FUZZIEEE'2013 Conference Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint of FUZZIEEE'2013 Conference Paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["a mani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.02140"}
