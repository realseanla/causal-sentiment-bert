Such modifiers are well-known in other research fields: recall dynamic epistemic logic where operators modify possible world accessibilities, or recall side effects and concurrency in programming languages. We consider persuasion in abstract argumentation as undertaking a similar role. We extend Dung's frameworks with acts of persuasion among agents into Abstract Persuasion Argumentation (APA), and set forth properties related to arguments' admissibilities. We show a way of enriching our basic notion of admissibility through CTL (computation tree logic) encoding, which also permits importation of the theoretical results known to the logic into our argumentation frameworks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 06:14:56 GMT  (144kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10044v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 05:37:28 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10044v2", "The definition of defendedness corrected"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ryuta arisaka", "ken satoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10044"}
