Some combination rules mix evidential information where sources are independent; other rules are suited to combine evidential information held by dependent sources. In this paper we have two main contributions: First we suggest a method to quantify sources' degree of independence that may guide the choice of the more appropriate set of combination rules. Second, we propose a new combination rule that takes consideration of sources' degree of independence. The proposed method is illustrated on generated mass functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Mar 2015 14:04:38 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05055v1", "Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mouna chebbah", "arnaud martin", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.05055"}
