{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Apr-2016", "title": "Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control", "abstract": "Recently, researchers have made significant progress combining the advances in deep learning for learning feature representations with reinforcement learning. Some notable examples include training agents to play Atari games based on raw pixel data and to acquire advanced manipulation skills using raw sensory inputs. However, it has been difficult to quantify progress in the domain of continuous control due to the lack of a commonly adopted benchmark. In this work, we present a benchmark suite of continuous control tasks, including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up, tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion, tasks with partial observations, and tasks with hierarchical structure. We report novel findings based on the systematic evaluation of a range of implemented reinforcement learning algorithms. Both the benchmark and reference implementations are released open-source in order to facilitate experimental reproducibility and to encourage adoption by other researchers.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 18:57:24 GMT  (2048kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Apr 2016 06:16:06 GMT  (2046kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778v2", "14 pages, to appear in ICML 2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 27 May 2016 19:25:59 GMT  (2309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06778v3", "14 pages, ICML 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["yan duan", "xi chen", "rein houthooft", "john schulman", "pieter abbeel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.06778"}
