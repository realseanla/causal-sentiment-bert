We propose a novel probabilistic program analysis technique and apply it to quantifying bias in decision-making programs. Specifically, we (i) present a sound and complete automated verification technique for proving quantitative properties of probabilistic programs; (ii) show that certain notions of bias, recently proposed in the fairness literature, can be phrased as quantitative correctness properties; and (iii) present FairSquare, the first verification tool for quantifying program bias, and evaluate it on a range of decision-making programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 17:02:29 GMT  (3758kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05437v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 03:21:07 GMT  (3758kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05437v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["aws albarghouthi", "loris d'antoni", "samuel drews", "aditya nori"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05437"}
