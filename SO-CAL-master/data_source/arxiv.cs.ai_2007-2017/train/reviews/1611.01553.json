{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Nov-2016", "title": "QBF Solving by Counterexample-guided Expansion", "abstract": "We introduce a novel generalization of Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) and instantiate it to yield a novel, competitive algorithm for solving Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF). Current QBF solvers based on counterexample-guided expansion use a recursive approach which scales poorly with the number of quantifier alternations. Our generalization of CEGIS removes the need for this recursive approach, and we instantiate it to yield a simple and efficient algorithm for QBF solving. Lastly, this research is supported by a competitive, though straightforward, implementation of the algorithm, making it possible to study the practical impact of our algorithm design decisions, along with various optimizations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 22:08:40 GMT  (68kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01553v1", "pre-print, submitted at TACAS 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 15:26:12 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01553v2", "pre-print, submitted at TACAS 2017, source code available atthis https URL"], ["v3", "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 17:48:36 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01553v3", "pre-print, submitted at TACAS 2017, source code available atthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "pre-print, submitted at TACAS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["roderick bloem", "nicolas braud-santoni", "vedad hadzic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01553"}
