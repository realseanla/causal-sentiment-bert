In contrast to other graph prob- lems such as community discovery, which finds groups of highly connected nodes, the role discovery problem finds groups of nodes that share similar graph topological structure. However, existing work so far has two severe limitations that prevent its use in some domains. Firstly, it is completely unsupervised which is undesirable for a number of reasons. Secondly, most work is limited to a single relational graph. We address both these lim- itations in an intuitive and easy to implement alternating least squares framework. Our framework allows convex constraints to be placed on the role discovery problem which can provide useful supervision. In par- ticular we explore supervision to enforce i) sparsity, ii) diversity and iii) alternativeness. We then show how to lift this work for multi-relational graphs. A natural representation of a multi-relational graph is an order 3 tensor (rather than a matrix) and that a Tucker decomposition allows us to find complex interactions between collections of entities (E-groups) and the roles they play for a combination of relations (R-groups). Existing Tucker decomposition methods in tensor toolboxes are not suited for our purpose, so we create our own algorithm that we demonstrate is pragmatically useful.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 03:13:55 GMT  (1195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02646v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sean gilpin", "chia-tung kuo", "tina eliassi-rad", "ian davidson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02646"}
