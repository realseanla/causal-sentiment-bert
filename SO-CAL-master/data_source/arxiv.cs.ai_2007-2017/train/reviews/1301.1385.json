{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jan-2013", "title": "Translating NP-SPEC into ASP", "abstract": "NP-SPEC is a language for specifying problems in NP in a declarative way. Despite the fact that the semantics of the language was given by referring to Datalog with circumscription, which is very close to ASP, so far the only existing implementations are by means of ECLiPSe Prolog and via Boolean satisfiability solvers. In this paper, we present translations from NP-SPEC into various forms of ASP and analyze them. We also argue that it might be useful to incorporate certain language constructs of NP-SPEC into mainstream ASP.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:28:49 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1385v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mario alviano", "wolfgang faber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1385"}
