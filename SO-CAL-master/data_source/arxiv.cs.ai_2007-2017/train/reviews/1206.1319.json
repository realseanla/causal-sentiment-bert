This paper deals with different definitions and classifications of uncertainty, sources of uncertainty, and theories and methodologies presented to deal with uncertainty. Fuzzification of crisp certainty degrees to fuzzy variables improves the quality of the network and tends to bring smoothness and robustness in the network performance. The aim is to provide a new approach for decision under uncertainty that combines three methodologies: Bayesian networks certainty distribution and fuzzy logic. Within the framework proposed in this paper, we address the issue of extending the certain networks to a fuzzy certain networks in order to cope with a vagueness and limitations of existing models for decision under imprecise and uncertain knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jun 2012 19:53:43 GMT  (240kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1319v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with1206.0918"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with1206.0918", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["abdelkader heni", "mohamed nazih omri", "adel alimi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1319"}
