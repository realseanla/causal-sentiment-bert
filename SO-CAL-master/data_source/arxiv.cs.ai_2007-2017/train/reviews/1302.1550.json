Where previously knowledge bases containing probabilistic rules were used for this purpose, here a probability distribution over the relations is directly represented by a Bayesian network. By using a powerful way of specifying conditional probability distributions in these networks, the resulting formalism is more expressive than the previous ones. Particularly, it provides for constraints on equalities of events, and it allows to define complex, nested combination functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:57:05 GMT  (744kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1550v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["manfred jaeger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1550"}
