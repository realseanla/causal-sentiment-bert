We propose a randomized algorithm that, with high probability, gives a constant-factor approximation of a general discrete integral defined over an exponentially large set. This algorithm relies on solving only a small number of instances of a discrete combinatorial optimization problem subject to randomly generated parity constraints used as a hash function. As an application, we demonstrate that with a small number of MAP queries we can efficiently approximate the partition function of discrete graphical models, which can in turn be used, for instance, for marginal computation or model selection.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 06:45:28 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6677v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["stefano ermon", "carla p gomes", "ashish sabharwal", "bart selman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.6677"}
