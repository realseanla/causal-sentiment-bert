In this paper, we present a method for determining the fraction of instantiations that has to be considered such that the absolute error in the marginals does not exceed a predefined value. The method is based on extreme value theory. Essentially, the proposed method uses the reversed generalized Pareto distribution to model probabilities of instantiations below a given threshold. Based on this distribution, an estimate of the maximal absolute error if instantiations with probability smaller than u are disregarded can be made.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:22 GMT  (379kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4934v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["enrique f castillo", "remco r bouckaert", "jose m sarabia", "cristina solares"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4934"}
