We seek to automatically answer questions like \"Does this shirt go well with that pair of jeans?\" In order to answer these kinds of questions, we attempt to model human sense of style compatibility in this paper. The basic assumption of our approach is that most of the important attributes for a product in an online store are included in its title description. Therefore it is feasible to learn style compatibility from these descriptions. We design a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network architecture and feed it with title pairs of items, which are either compatible or incompatible. Those pairs will be mapped from the original space of symbolic words into some embedded style space. Our approach takes only words as the input with few preprocessing and there is no laborious and expensive feature engineering.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Aug 2017 06:09:53 GMT  (709kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07938v1", "Workshops at the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "Workshops at the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kui zhao", "xia hu", "jiajun bu", "can wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07938"}
