Experiments on real data from a picker-to-parts order picking process in the warehouse of a European manufacturer show that optimal storage assignments do not necessarily display features presumed in heuristics, such as clustering of positively correlated items or ordering of items by picking frequency.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Mar 2017 14:15:35 GMT  (278kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01049v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander eckrot", "carina geldhauser", "jan jurczyk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01049"}
