The uncertainty in these spaces stems from both probability and metric. To represent both aspect of uncertainty, we choose an expected distance function as a measure of uncertainty. A formal logical system is constructed for the reasoning about expected distance. Soundness and completeness are shown for this logic. For reasoning on product metric space with uncertainty, a new metric is defined and shown to have good properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:26:12 GMT  (157kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6856v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["seunghwan lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6856"}
