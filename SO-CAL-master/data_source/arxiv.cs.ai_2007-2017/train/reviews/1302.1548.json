We dwell on a class of decision problems characterized by the centrality of diagnosing and reacting in a timely manner to pathological processes. We motivate key ideas in the context of trauma-care triage and transportation decisions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:56:24 GMT  (1075kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1548v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric j horvitz", "adam seiver"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1548"}
