Furthermore, a systematic reasoning procedure to solve the syllogism is also proposed, interpreting it as an equivalent mathematical optimization problem, where the premises constitute the constraints of the searching space for the quantifier in the conclusion.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 09:26:14 GMT  (281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7149v1", "22 pages, 6 figures, journal paper"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 6 figures, journal paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m pereira-fari\\~na", "juan c vidal", "f d\\'iaz-hermida", "a bugar\\'in"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.7149"}
