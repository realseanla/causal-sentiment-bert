We have shown in earlier work that deleting edges calls for introducing auxiliary network parameters to compensate for lost dependencies, and proposed intuitive conditions for determining these parameters. We have also shown that our method corresponds to IBP when enough edges are deleted to yield a polytree, and corresponds to some generalizations of IBP when fewer edges are deleted. In this paper, we propose a different criteria for determining auxiliary parameters based on optimizing the KL-divergence between the original and approximate networks. We discuss the relationship between the two methods for selecting parameters, shedding new light on IBP and its generalizations. We also discuss the application of our new method to approximating inference problems which are exponential in constrained treewidth, including MAP and nonmyopic value of information.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:38:46 GMT  (206kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6817v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arthur choi", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6817"}
