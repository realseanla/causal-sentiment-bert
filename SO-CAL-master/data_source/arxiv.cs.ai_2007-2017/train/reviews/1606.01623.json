{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Jun-2016", "title": "Position-Indexed Formulations for Kidney Exchange", "abstract": "A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 06:16:36 GMT  (2675kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01623v1", "Full version of paper to appear at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC-16)"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 22:39:37 GMT  (2683kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01623v2", "Appeared at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC-16)"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of paper to appear at the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC-16)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["john p dickerson", "david f manlove", "benjamin plaut", "tuomas sandholm", "james trimble"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01623"}
