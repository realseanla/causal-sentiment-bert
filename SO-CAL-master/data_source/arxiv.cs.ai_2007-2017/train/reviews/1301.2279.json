We illustrate the approach on the specific task of controlling both general and domain-specific solvers on a hard class of structured constraint satisfaction problems. A successful strategyfor reducing the high (and even infinite) variance in running time typically exhibited by backtracking search algorithms is to cut off and restart the search if a solution is not found within a certainamount of time. Previous work on restart strategies have employed fixed cut off values. We show how to create a dynamic cut off strategy by learning a Bayesian model that predicts the ultimate length of a trial based on observing the early behavior of the search algorithm. Furthermore, we describe the general conditions under which a dynamic restart strategy can outperform the theoretically optimal fixed strategy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:15 GMT  (1182kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2279v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric j horvitz", "yongshao ruan", "carla p gomes", "henry kautz", "bart selman", "david maxwell chickering"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2279"}
