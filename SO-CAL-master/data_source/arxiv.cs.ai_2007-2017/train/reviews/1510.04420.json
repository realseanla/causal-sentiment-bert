This paper discusses the challenges in this context, along with the algorithms used to build such systems. From a systematic study, we can infer that most of the work done in this area is related to statistical data. It was also found that subjective evaluation or contribution of experts is also limited for narration context.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 07:06:39 GMT  (137kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04420v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paramjot kaur sarao", "puneet mittal", "rupinder kaur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04420"}
