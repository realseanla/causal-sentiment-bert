This more general idea is often captured under the term 'self-configuration'. Despite the importance of such capability, research work on this feature appears isolated by technical domains. It is not easy to tell quickly whether the approaches chosen in different technological domains introduce new ideas or whether the differences just reflect domain idiosyncrasies. For the sake of easy identification of key differences between systems with self-configuring capabilities, I will explore higher level concepts for understanding self-configuration, such as the {\\Omega}-units, in order to provide theoretical instruments for connecting different areas of technology and research.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 22:36:38 GMT  (5529kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08906v1", "46 pages, 62 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "46 pages, 62 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aleksander lodwich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08906"}
