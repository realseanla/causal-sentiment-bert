However, tSNE is non-parametric: once visualization is built, tSNE is not designed to incorporate additional data into existing representation. It highly limits the applicability of tSNE to the scenarios where data are added or updated over time (like dashboards or series of data snapshots).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 17:17:56 GMT  (1630kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04983v1", "44 pages, 24 figures, 7 tables, planned for submission"]], "COMMENTS": "44 pages, 24 figures, 7 tables, planned for submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["andrey boytsov", "francois fouquet", "thomas hartmann", "yves letraon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04983"}
