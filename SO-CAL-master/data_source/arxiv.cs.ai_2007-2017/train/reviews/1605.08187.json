{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-May-2016", "title": "The Symbolic Interior Point Method", "abstract": "A recent trend in probabilistic inference emphasizes the codification of models in a formal syntax, with suitable high-level features such as individuals, relations, and connectives, enabling descriptive clarity, succinctness and circumventing the need for the modeler to engineer a custom solver. Unfortunately, bringing these linguistic and pragmatic benefits to numerical optimization has proven surprisingly challenging. In this paper, we turn to these challenges: we introduce a rich modeling language, for which an interior-point method computes approximate solutions in a generic way. While logical features easily complicates the underlying model, often yielding intricate dependencies, we exploit and cache local structure using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). Indeed, standard matrix-vector algebra is efficiently realizable in ADDs, but we argue and show that well-known optimization methods are not ideal for ADDs. Our engine, therefore, invokes a sophisticated matrix-free approach. We demonstrate the flexibility of the resulting symbolic-numeric optimizer on decision making and compressed sensing tasks with millions of non-zero entries.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 May 2016 08:26:34 GMT  (613kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08187v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 28 May 2016 17:11:30 GMT  (745kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08187v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 18:29:14 GMT  (746kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08187v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.SC", "authors": ["martin mladenov", "vaishak belle", "kristian kersting"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.08187"}
