Next it proves some interesting properties of the mind design space such as infinitude of minds, size and representation complexity of minds. A survey of mind design taxonomies is followed by a proposal for a new field of investigation devoted to study of minds, intellectology, a list of open problems for this new field is presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 20:02:05 GMT  (471kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0369v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["roman v yampolskiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0369"}
