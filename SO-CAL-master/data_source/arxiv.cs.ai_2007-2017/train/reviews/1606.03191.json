Factors that could be used as a tool to measure the inequality of development is to look at the average growth and development contribution of each sector of Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) based on the analyzed region and the reference region. This study discusses the development of a model to determine the regional development imbalances using fuzzy approach system, and the rules of typology Klassen. The model is then called fuzzy-Klassen. Implications Product Mamdani fuzzy system is used in the model as an inference engine to generate output after defuzzyfication process. Application of MATLAB is used as a tool of analysis in this study. The test a result of Kota Cilegon is shows that there are significant differences between traditional Klassen typology analyses with the results of the model developed. Fuzzy model-Klassen shows GRDP sector inequality Cilegon City is dominated by Quadrant I (K4), where status is the sector forward and grows exponentially. While the traditional Klassen typology, half of GRDP sector is dominated by Quadrant IV (K4) with a sector that is lagging relative status.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 05:55:56 GMT  (573kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03191v1", "6 Pages, 1 Figures, 5 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 Pages, 1 Figures, 5 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tb ai munandar", "retantyo wardoyo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03191"}
