We demonstrate how this model can execute a range of tasks such as generating analogues to a query structure and generating compounds predicted to be active against a biological target. As a proof of principle, the model is first trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example, the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor D2, the model generates structures of which more than 95% are predicted to be active, including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 06:41:21 GMT  (876kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07555v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 12:31:19 GMT  (984kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07555v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marcus olivecrona", "thomas blaschke", "ola engkvist", "hongming chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07555"}
