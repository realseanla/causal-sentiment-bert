For each technique used for data fusion, the asumption on independance is usually made. We propose in this article an approach to take into acount an independance measure befor to make the combination of information in the context of the theory of belief functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 19:57:59 GMT  (160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05614v1", "in French, appears in Atelier Fouille de donn{\\'e}es complexes, Extraction et Gestion des Connaissances (EGC), Jan 2013, Toulouse, France. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1501.04786"]], "COMMENTS": "in French, appears in Atelier Fouille de donn{\\'e}es complexes, Extraction et Gestion des Connaissances (EGC), Jan 2013, Toulouse, France. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1501.04786", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mouloud kharoune", "arnaud martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.05614"}
