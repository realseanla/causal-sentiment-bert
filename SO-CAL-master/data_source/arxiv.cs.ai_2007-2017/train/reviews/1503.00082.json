We propose to use a group representative to handle the recognition with a varying number of group members, and use an Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model (AHMM) to model the relationship between people. Furthermore, we propose a group activity detection algorithm which can handle both symmetric and asymmetric group activities, and demonstrate that this approach enables the detection of hierarchical interactions between people. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 06:51:39 GMT  (653kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00082v1", "This manuscript is the accepted version for TCSVT (IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology)"]], "COMMENTS": "This manuscript is the accepted version for TCSVT (IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM", "authors": ["weiyao lin", "ming-ting sun", "radha poovendran", "zhengyou zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00082"}
