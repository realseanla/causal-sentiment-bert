This unsupervised data-analysis approach is desirable due to its interpretability, but hard to perform due its NP-hardness. A closely related problem is low-rank Boolean matrix completion from noisy observations. We treat these problems as maximum a posteriori inference problems, and present message passing solutions that scale linearly with the number of observations and factors. Our empirical study demonstrates that message passing is able to recover low-rank Boolean matrices, in the boundaries of theoretically possible recovery and outperform existing techniques in real-world applications, such as large-scale binary valued collaborative filtering tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 23:11:16 GMT  (2232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08535v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 19:27:13 GMT  (2232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08535v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 21:05:32 GMT  (7229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08535v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.ST cs.AI cs.DM stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["siamak ravanbakhsh", "barnab\u00e1s p\u00f3czos", "russell greiner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.08535"}
