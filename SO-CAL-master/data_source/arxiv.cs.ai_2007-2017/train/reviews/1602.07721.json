We present an approach to automatically learn game design knowledge for level design from gameplay videos. We further demonstrate how the acquired design knowledge can be used to generate sections of game levels. Our approach involves parsing video of people playing a game to detect the appearance of patterns of sprites and utilizing machine learning to build a probabilistic model of sprite placement. We show how rich game design information can be automatically parsed from gameplay videos and represented as a set of generative probabilistic models. We use Super Mario Bros. as a proof of concept. We evaluate our approach on a measure of playability and stylistic similarity to the original levels as represented in the gameplay videos.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 02:38:16 GMT  (3902kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07721v1", "8 pages, 10 figures, Procedural Content Generation Workshop 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 10 figures, Procedural Content Generation Workshop 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["matthew guzdial", "mark riedl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07721"}
