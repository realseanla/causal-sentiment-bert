The probabilistic HMMs have been one of the most used techniques based on the Bayesian model. First-order probabilistic HMMs were adapted to the theory of belief functions such that Bayesian probabilities were replaced with mass functions. In this paper, we present a second-order Hidden Markov Model using belief functions. Previous works in belief HMMs have been focused on the first-order HMMs. We extend them to the second-order model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 19:56:34 GMT  (147kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05613v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jungyeul park", "mouna chebbah", "siwar jendoubi", "arnaud martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.05613"}
