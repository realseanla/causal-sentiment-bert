The algorithm forms a compact region graph and establishes a modified version of message passing, which mimics the GBP behavior in a corresponding ground model. The compact graph is obtained by exploiting a graphical representation of clusters, which reduces cluster symmetry detection to isomorphism tests on small local graphs. The framework is thus capable of handling complex models, while remaining domain-size independent.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 16:56:02 GMT  (148kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01525v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["udi apsel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01525"}
