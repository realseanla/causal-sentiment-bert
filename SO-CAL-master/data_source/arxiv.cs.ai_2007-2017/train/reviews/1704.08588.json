Recent developments in diagrammatic modeling have made it possible to examine conceptual representation of events. This paper explores some aspects of the notion of events that are produced by applying a new diagrammatic methodology with a focus on the interaction of events with such concepts as time and space, objects. The proposed description applies to abstract machines where events form the dynamic phases of a system. The results of this nontechnical research can be utilized in many fields where the notion of an event is typically used in interdisciplinary application.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 12:50:51 GMT  (374kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08588v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["sabah al-fedaghi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08588"}
