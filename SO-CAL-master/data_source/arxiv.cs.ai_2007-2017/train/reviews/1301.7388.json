In particular, when following the suggestion of Machina and McClennen of giving up separability (also known as consequentialism), which requires the choice of a substrategy in a subtree to depend only on data relevant to that subtree, one must renounce to the use of dynamic programming, since Bellman's principle is no longer valid. An interpretation of McClennen's resolute choice, based on cooperation between the successive Selves of the decision maker, is proposed. Implementations of resolute choice which prevent Money Pumps negative prices of information or, more generally, choices of dominated strategies, while remaining computationally tractable, are proposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:04:50 GMT  (290kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7388v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-yves jaffray"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7388"}
