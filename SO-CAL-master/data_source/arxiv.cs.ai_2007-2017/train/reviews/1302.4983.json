Given information about conditional independence and dependence relations between measured variables, even when latent variables and selection bias may be present, there are sufficient conditions for reliably concluding that there is a causal path from one variable to another, and sufficient conditions for reliably concluding when no such causal path exists.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:38 GMT  (261kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4983v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter l spirtes", "christopher meek", "thomas s richardson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4983"}
