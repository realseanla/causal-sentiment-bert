The natural starting point for AI researchers interested in MOBAs is to develop an AI to play the game better than a human - but MOBAs have many more challenges besides adversarial AI. In this paper we introduce the reader to the wider context of MOBA culture, propose a range of challenges faced by the community today, and posit concrete AI projects that can be undertaken to begin solving them.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 20:57:18 GMT  (4358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03122v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael cook", "adam summerville", "simon colton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03122"}
