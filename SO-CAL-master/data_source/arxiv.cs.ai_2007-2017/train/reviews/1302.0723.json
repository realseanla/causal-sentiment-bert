This paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ active sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our proposed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and time efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analytically that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms with increasing planning horizon length. We provide theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called transect sampling, which, in particular, can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational time, even when the field conditions are less favorable.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Feb 2013 15:34:12 GMT  (598kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0723v1", "12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013), Extended version with proofs, 15 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 05:50:14 GMT  (598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0723v2", "12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013), Extended version with proofs, 15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2013), Extended version with proofs, 15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["nannan cao", "kian hsiang low", "john m dolan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.0723"}
