We employ natural language processing and reasoning on domain ontologies. The first task is to identify the main characters and the parts of the story where these characters are described or act. We illustrate the system in a scenario in the folktale domain. The system relies on a folktale ontology that we have developed based on Propp's model for folktales morphology.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 08:13:49 GMT  (342kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03012v1", "IEEE 11 International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP2015), Cluj-Napoca, Romania, 3-5 September 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE 11 International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP2015), Cluj-Napoca, Romania, 3-5 September 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["adrian groza", "lidia corde"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03012"}
