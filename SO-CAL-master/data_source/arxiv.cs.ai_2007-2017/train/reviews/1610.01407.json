We extend the IT\\&amp;E algorithm to allow for robots to learn to compensate for damages while executing their task(s). This leads to a semi-episodic learning scheme that increases the robot's lifetime autonomy and adaptivity. Preliminary experiments on a toy simulation and a 6-legged robot locomotion task show promising results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 13:21:43 GMT  (136kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01407v1", "Workshop on AI for Long-Term Autonomy at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), May 2016, Stockholm, Sweden. 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Workshop on AI for Long-Term Autonomy at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), May 2016, Stockholm, Sweden. 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["konstantinos chatzilygeroudis", "antoine cully", "jean-baptiste mouret"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01407"}
