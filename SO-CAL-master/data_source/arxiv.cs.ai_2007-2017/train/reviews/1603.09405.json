However, the quality of matching feature representation may not be satisfied due to complex semantic relations such as entailment or contradiction. To address this challenge, we propose a new deep neural network architecture that jointly leverage pre-trained word embedding and auxiliary character embedding to learn sentence meanings. The two kinds of word sequence representations as inputs into multi-layer bidirectional LSTM to learn enhanced sentence representation. After that, we construct matching features followed by another temporal CNN to learn high-level hidden matching feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the existing methods on standard evaluation datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 22:39:59 GMT  (1224kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09405v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["peng li", "heng huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09405"}
