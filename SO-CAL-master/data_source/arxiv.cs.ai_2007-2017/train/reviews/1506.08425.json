To gain intuition on the chosen features from the CNN model (opposed to a 'black box' solution), a visualisation technique based on the deconvolutional networks (DN) is utilized. It is found that venations of different order have been chosen to uniquely represent each of the plant species. Experimental results using these CNN features with different classifiers show consistency and superiority compared to the state-of-the art solutions which rely on hand-crafted features.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jun 2015 16:58:47 GMT  (4084kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08425v1", "6 pages, 8 figures, accepted as oral presentation in ICIP2015, Qu\\'ebec City, Canada"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 8 figures, accepted as oral presentation in ICIP2015, Qu\\'ebec City, Canada", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["sue han lee", "chee seng chan", "paul wilkin", "paolo remagnino"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08425"}
