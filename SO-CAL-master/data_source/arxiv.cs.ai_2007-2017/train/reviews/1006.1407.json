The most famous ITL studied so far is Halpern and Shoham's HS, which is the logic of the thirteen Allen's interval relations. Unfortunately, HS and most of its fragments have an undecidable satisfiability problem. This discouraged the research in this area until recently, when a number non-trivial decidable ITLs have been discovered.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 00:42:51 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1407v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["davide bresolin", "pietro sala", "guido sciavicco"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.1407"}
