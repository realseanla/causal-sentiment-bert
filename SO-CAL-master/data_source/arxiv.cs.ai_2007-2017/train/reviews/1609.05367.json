We show that, for a naive modeling, state-of-the-art SMT solvers outperform other tools ranging from mathematical programming to constraint programming. We use both real and randomly generated benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 17:17:15 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05367v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["miquel bofill", "v\\'ictor mu\\~noz", "javier murillo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05367"}
