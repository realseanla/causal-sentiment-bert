The best strategy employs the sum of confidences of two statistical classifiers trained on different views of the data. Our experimental results show that, compared to the random selection strategy, this strategy reduces the amount of required labeled training data by over 50% while achieving the same performance. The effect is even more significant when only named mentions are considered: the system achieves the same performance by using only 42% of the training data required by the random selection strategy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Nov 2009 19:52:01 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1965v1", "12 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["nitin madnani", "hongyan jing", "nanda kambhatla", "salim roukos"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.1965"}
