We start from a previously proposed extension of the basic Description Logic ALC (a computationally tractable fragment of First Order Logic, used to represent concept inclusions and ontologies) with a typicality operator T that allows to consistently represent the attribution to classes of individuals of properties with exceptions (as in the classic example (i) typical birds fly, (ii) penguins are birds but (iii) typical penguins don't fly). We then strengthen this extension in order to separately reason about the typicality with respect to different aspects (e.g., flying, having nice feather: in the previous example, penguins may not inherit the property of flying, for which they are exceptional, but can nonetheless inherit other properties, such as having nice feather).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 15:50:24 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00301v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["valentina gliozzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00301"}
