RCM is motivated by Thompson sampling, and is computationally efficient as long as the offline version of the combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently. We establish that RCM is provably statistically efficient in the coherent Gaussian case, by developing a Bayes regret bound that is independent of the problem scale (number of items) and sublinear in time. We also evaluate RCM on a variety of real-world problems with thousands of items. Our experimental results demonstrate that RCM learns two orders of magnitude faster than the best baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Jun 2014 21:50:56 GMT  (51kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7443v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 06:38:56 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7443v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 06:35:54 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7443v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 05:32:13 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7443v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["zheng wen", "branislav kveton", "azin ashkan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.7443"}
