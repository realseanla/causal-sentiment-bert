Much of the work with such data focuses on filtering: predicting unknown ratings for pairs of users and items. In this paper we focus on the problem of visualizing the information. Given all of the ratings, our task is to embed all of the users and items as points in the same Euclidean space. We would like to place users near items that they have rated (or would rate) high, and far away from those they would give a low rating. We pose this problem as a real-valued non-linear Bayesian network and employ Markov chain Monte Carlo and expectation maximization to find an embedding. We present a metric by which to judge the quality of a visualization and compare our results to local linear embedding and Eigentaste on three real-world datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:24:29 GMT  (447kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6850v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GR cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["guobiao mei", "christian r shelton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6850"}
