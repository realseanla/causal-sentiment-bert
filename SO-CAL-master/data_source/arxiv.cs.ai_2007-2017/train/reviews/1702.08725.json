In this paper, we study statistical model checking and runtime verification for systems with this ability. Two challenges arise: (1) Models built from limited runtime data yield uncertainty to be dealt with. (2) There is no definition of satisfaction w.r.t. uncertain hypotheses. We propose such a definition of subjective satisfaction based on recently introduced satisfaction functions. We also propose the BV algorithm as a Bayesian solution to runtime verification of subjective satisfaction under model uncertainty. BV provides user-definable stochastic bounds for type I and II errors. We discuss empirical results from an example application to illustrate our ideas.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 10:14:30 GMT  (408kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08725v1", "Accepted at SEsCPS @ ICSE 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at SEsCPS @ ICSE 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["lenz belzner", "thomas gabor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08725"}
