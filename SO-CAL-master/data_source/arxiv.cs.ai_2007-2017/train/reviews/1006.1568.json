However, artificial immune system models have largely been inspired by adaptive not innate immunity. This paper reviews the biological principles and properties of innate immunity and, adopting a conceptual framework, asks how these can be incorporated into artificial models. The aim is to outline a meta-framework for models of innate immunity.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 14:25:23 GMT  (421kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1568v1", "14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 4th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS 2005)"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables, 4th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS 2005)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["jamie twycross", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.1568"}
