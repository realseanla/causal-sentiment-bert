Here we describe the Places Database, a repository of 10 million scene photographs, labeled with scene semantic categories and attributes, comprising a quasi-exhaustive list of the types of environments encountered in the world. Using state of the art Convolutional Neural Networks, we provide impressive baseline performances at scene classification. With its high-coverage and high-diversity of exemplars, the Places Database offers an ecosystem to guide future progress on currently intractable visual recognition problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 20:14:13 GMT  (3512kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["bolei zhou", "aditya khosla", "agata lapedriza", "antonio torralba", "aude oliva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02055"}
