By explicitly accounting for student learning and employing a structured, multidimensional representation of student proficiencies, the model outperforms standard IRT-based methods on an online response prediction task when applied to real responses collected from students interacting with diverse pools of educational content.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 16:42:49 GMT  (137kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04282v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["chaitanya ekanadham", "yan karklin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04282"}
