However, handling the evolution of rule bases is still a largely open problem. The AGM framework for belief change was shown to give inappropriate results when directly applied to logic programs under a non-monotonic semantics such as the stable models. The approaches to address this issue, developed so far, proposed update semantics based on manipulating the syntactic structure of programs and rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 15:02:11 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3884v1", "38 pages, to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "38 pages, to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["martin slota", "jo\\~ao leite"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.3884"}
