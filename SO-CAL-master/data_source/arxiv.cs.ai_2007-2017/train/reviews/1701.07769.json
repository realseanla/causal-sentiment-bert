As instructors we want to develop curriculum that not only prepares students to be artificial intelligence practitioners, but also to understand the moral, ethical, and philosophical impacts that artificial intelligence will have on society. In this article we provide practical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We also provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a general artificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificial intelligence ethics course.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:52:22 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07769v1", "29 pages including all case studies and links to video media on YouTube"]], "COMMENTS": "29 pages including all case studies and links to video media on YouTube", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.GL", "authors": ["emanuelle burton", "judy goldsmith", "sven koenig", "benjamin kuipers", "nicholas mattei", "toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07769"}
