We detail a compositional distributional framework based on a rich form of word embeddings that aims at facilitating the interactions between words in the context of a sentence. Embeddings and composition layers are jointly learned against a generic objective that enhances the vectors with syntactic information from the surrounding context. Furthermore, each word is associated with a number of senses, the most plausible of which is selected dynamically during the composition process. We evaluate the produced vectors qualitatively and quantitatively with positive results. At the sentence level, the effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on the MSRPar task, for which we report results within the state-of-the-art range.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Aug 2015 19:04:18 GMT  (205kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02354v1", "Accepted for presentation at EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 12:50:43 GMT  (205kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.02354v2", "Accepted for presentation at EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for presentation at EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["jianpeng cheng 0002", "dimitri kartsaklis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.02354"}
