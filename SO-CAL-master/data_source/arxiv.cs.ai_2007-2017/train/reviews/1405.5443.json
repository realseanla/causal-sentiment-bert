This paper is part of a project aimed at investigating how such techniques can be extended to coordinate teams of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic environments. Specifically challenging are real-world environments where UAVs and other network-enabled devices must communicate to coordinate -- and communication actions are neither reliable nor free. Such network-centric environments are common in military, public safety and commercial applications, yet most research (even multi-agent planning) usually takes communications among distributed agents as a given. We address this challenge by developing an agent architecture and reasoning algorithms based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). Although ASP has been used successfully in a number of applications, to the best of our knowledge this is the first practical application of a complete ASP-based agent architecture. It is also the first practical application of ASP involving a combination of centralized reasoning, decentralized reasoning, execution monitoring, and reasoning about network communications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 May 2014 14:55:12 GMT  (3646kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5443v1", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1405.1124"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1405.1124", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["marcello balduccini", "william c regli", "duc n nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5443"}
