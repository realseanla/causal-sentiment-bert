This qualitative counterpart of the POMDP model relies on a possibilistic theory of decision under uncertainty, recently developed. One advantage of such a qualitative framework is its ability to escape from the classical obstacle of stochastic POMDPs, in which even with a finite state space, the obtained belief state space of the POMDP is infinite. Instead, in the possibilistic framework even if exponentially larger than the state space, the belief state space remains finite.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:44 GMT  (330kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6736v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["regis sabbadin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6736"}
