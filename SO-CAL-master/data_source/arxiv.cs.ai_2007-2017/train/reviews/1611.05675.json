Most of the studies are devoted to finding a feature subspace for representing all emotions. However, some studies have indicated that the features associated with different emotions are not exactly the same. Hence, traditional methods may fail to distinguish some of the emotions with just one global feature subspace. In this work, we propose a new divide and conquer idea to solve the problem. First, the feature subspaces are constructed for all the combinations of every two different emotions (emotion-pair). Bi-classifiers are then trained on these feature subspaces respectively. The final emotion recognition result is derived by the voting and competition method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can get better results than the traditional multi-classification method.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 13:32:59 GMT  (527kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05675v1", "5 pages, 4 figures, ICASSP-2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 4 figures, ICASSP-2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["xi ma", "zhiyong wu", "jia jia", "mingxing xu", "helen meng", "lianhong cai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05675"}
