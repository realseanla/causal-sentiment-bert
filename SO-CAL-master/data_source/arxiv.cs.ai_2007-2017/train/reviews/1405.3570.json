It describes a model of cognition that is amenable to computer implementation, paving the way for computational psychology. Its underlying psychological theory has been investigated in many psychological experiments, but ACT-R lacks a formal definition of its underlying concepts from a mathematical-computational point of view. Although the canonical implementation of ACT-R is now modularized, this production rule system is still hard to adapt and extend in central components like the conflict resolution mechanism (which decides which of the applicable rules to apply next).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 16:57:36 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3570v1", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
