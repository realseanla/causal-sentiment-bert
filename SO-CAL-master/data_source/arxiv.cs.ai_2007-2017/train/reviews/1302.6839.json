The noisyMAX, a generalization of the noisy-OR gate, is used to model causal in dependence in a BN with multi-valued variables. We describe the use of leak probabilities to enforce the closed-world assumption in our model. We present Netview, a visualization tool based on causal independence and the use of leak probabilities. The Netview software allows knowledge engineers to dynamically view sub-networks for knowledge engineering, and it provides version control for editing a BN. Netview generates sub-networks in which leak probabilities are dynamically updated to reflect the missing portions of the network.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:10 GMT  (1623kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6839v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["malcolm pradhan", "gregory m provan", "blackford middleton", "max henrion"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6839"}
