In spite of that, novice players may have a hard time when playing certain types of games, such as MOBAs and MMORPGs, due to their steep learning curves and not so friendly online communities. In this paper, we present an approach to help novice players in MOBA games overcome these problems. An artificial intelligence agent plays alongside the player analyzing his/her performance and giving tips about the game. Experiments performed with the game {\\em League of Legends} show the potential of this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 04:33:58 GMT  (409kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02832v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["victor do nascimento silva", "luiz chaimowicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02832"}
