In this paper we describe some of the ideas and tools around the development of our team, Gliders2012. In our description, we focus on the evaluation function as one of our central mechanisms for action selection. We also point to a new framework for watching log files in a web browser that we release for use and further development by the RoboCup community. Finally, we also summarize results of the group and final matches we played during RoboCup 2012, with Gliders2012 finishing 4th out of 19 teams.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Nov 2012 13:20:59 GMT  (121kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3882v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 21 Nov 2012 04:03:21 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3882v2", "10 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["edward moore", "oliver obst", "mikhail prokopenko", "peter wang", "jason held"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.3882"}
