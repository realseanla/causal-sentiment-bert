{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Dec-2016", "title": "Mode Regularized Generative Adversarial Networks", "abstract": "Although Generative Adversarial Networks achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of generative tasks, they are regarded as highly unstable and prone to miss modes. We argue that these bad behaviors of GANs are due to the very particular functional shape of the trained discriminators in high dimensional spaces, which can easily make training stuck or push probability mass in the wrong direction, towards that of higher concentration than that of the data generating distribution.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 07:45:38 GMT  (1133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02136v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 06:08:37 GMT  (1133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02136v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v3", "Sun, 18 Dec 2016 05:55:22 GMT  (1006kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02136v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v4", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 05:01:27 GMT  (1337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02136v4", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v5", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 06:28:13 GMT  (1337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02136v5", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["tong che", "yanran li", "athul paul jacob", "yoshua bengio", "wenjie li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.02136"}
