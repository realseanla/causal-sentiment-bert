If there are N microphones in the array, we track all $N \\choose 2$ delays with a single particle filter over time. Since it is known that tracking in high dimensions is rife with difficulties, we instead integrate into our particle filter a model of the low dimensional manifold that these delays lie on. Our manifold model is based off of work on modeling low dimensional manifolds via random projection trees [1]. In addition, we also introduce a new weighting scheme to our particle filtering algorithm based on recent advancements in online learning. We show that our novel TDOA tracking algorithm that integrates a manifold model can greatly outperform standard particle filters on this audio tracking task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 19:50:38 GMT  (187kb,S)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0659v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 21:40:35 GMT  (187kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0659v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SD", "authors": ["evan ettinger", "yoav freund"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0659"}
