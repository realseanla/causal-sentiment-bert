In this paper, we define a novel entity representation as a mixture of its neighborhood in the knowledge base and apply this technique on TransE-a well-known embedding model for knowledge base completion. Experimental results show that the neighborhood information significantly helps to improve the results of the TransE, leading to better performance than obtained by other state-of-the-art embedding models on three benchmark datasets for triple classification, entity prediction and relation prediction tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 07:54:35 GMT  (46kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06461v1", "To appear in Proceedings of CoNLL 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 16:08:32 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06461v2", "V1: To appear in Proceedings of CoNLL 2016.
