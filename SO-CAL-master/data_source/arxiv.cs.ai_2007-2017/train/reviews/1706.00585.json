When Classical Logic is used, updates are typically performed by manipulating the knowledge base on the model-theoretic level. On the opposite side of the spectrum stand the semantics for updating Answer-Set Programs that need to rely on rule syntax. Yet, a unifying perspective that could embrace both these branches of research is of great importance as it enables a deeper understanding of all involved methods and principles and creates room for their cross-fertilisation, ripening and further development.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 08:31:10 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00585v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["martin slota", "joao leite"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00585"}
