This paper will attempt to give a more unifying definition that can be applied to everything that we know of. The definition would be used more to verify intelligence, where a scale would also be required to measure how much. A version of an accepted result of AI is then put forward as the acid test for Artificial Intelligence itself. Recent work has been more from a direction of mechanical processes, where this paper will not try to refute the idea of intelligence, but only to put it in a more general context.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 11:09:55 GMT  (210kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1076v1", "Pre-print"], ["v2", "Sat, 8 Nov 2014 13:20:49 GMT  (419kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1076v2", "Pre-print"], ["v3", "Tue, 25 Nov 2014 16:19:47 GMT  (426kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1076v3", "Pre-print"], ["v4", "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 17:10:05 GMT  (443kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1076v4", "This new version adds some clarity to the discussion, which has realised a new idea.
