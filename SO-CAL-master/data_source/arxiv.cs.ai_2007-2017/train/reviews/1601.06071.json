The proposed Bitwise Neural Network (BNN) is especially suitable for resource-constrained environments, since it replaces either floating or fixed-point arithmetic with significantly more efficient bitwise operations. Hence, the BNN requires for less spatial complexity, less memory bandwidth, and less power consumption in hardware. In order to design such networks, we propose to add a few training schemes, such as weight compression and noisy backpropagation, which result in a bitwise network that performs almost as well as its corresponding real-valued network. We test the proposed network on the MNIST dataset, represented using binary features, and show that BNNs result in competitive performance while offering dramatic computational savings.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 16:59:01 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06071v1", "This paper was presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Workshop on Resource-Efficient Machine Learning, Lille, France, Jul. 6-11, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper was presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) Workshop on Resource-Efficient Machine Learning, Lille, France, Jul. 6-11, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["minje kim", "paris smaragdis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06071"}
