(1994). It is found that the algorithm is able to answer 420 of the 422 possible zero-observation queries, 94 of 100 randomly generated five-observation queries, 87 of 100 randomly generated ten-observation queries, and 69 of 100 randomly generated twenty-observation queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:24:30 GMT  (264kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4993v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4993"}
