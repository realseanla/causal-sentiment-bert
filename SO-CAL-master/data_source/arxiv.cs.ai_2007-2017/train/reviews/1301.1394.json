The main theorem can be used to characterize, in some cases, the general stable models of a logic program by a first-order formula. The proof uses Truszczynski's stable model semantics of infinitary propositional formulas.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:55 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1394v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["vladimir lifschitz", "fangkai yang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1394"}
