The use of virtual humans is consequently becoming increasingly popular in a wide range of areas where such a natural communication might be beneficial, including entertainment, education, mental health research and beyond. Behind this development lies a series of technological advances in a multitude of disciplines, most notably natural language processing, computer vision, and speech synthesis. In this paper we discuss a Virtual Human Journalist, a project employing a number of novel solutions from these disciplines with the goal to demonstrate their viability by producing a humanoid conversational agent capable of naturally eliciting and reacting to information from a human user. A set of qualitative and quantitative evaluation sessions demonstrated the technical feasibility of the system whilst uncovering a number of deficits in its capacity to engage users in a way that would be perceived as natural and emotionally engaging. We argue that naturalness should not always be seen as a desirable goal and suggest that deliberately suppressing the naturalness of virtual human interactions, such as by altering its personality cues, might in some cases yield more desirable results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 May 2017 17:01:10 GMT  (845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06694v1", "eNTERFACE16 proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "eNTERFACE16 proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.MM", "authors": ["kevin k bowden", "tommy nilsson", "christine p spencer", "kubra cengiz", "alexandru ghitulescu", "jelte b van waterschoot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06694"}
