We implement these algorithms and integrate them in BIOQUERY-ASP. We illustrate the usefulness of these methods with some complex biomedical queries related to drug discovery, over the biomedical knowledge resources PHARMGKB, DRUGBANK, BIOGRID, CTD, SIDER, DISEASE ONTOLOGY and ORPHADATA. To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Sep 2013 19:28:44 GMT  (617kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6297v1", "42 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, online appendix (proofs, 24 pages)"]], "COMMENTS": "42 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, online appendix (proofs, 24 pages)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["esra erdem", "umut oztok"], "accepted": true, "id": "1309.6297"}
