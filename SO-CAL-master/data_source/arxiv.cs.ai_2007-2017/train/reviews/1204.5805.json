Clients are diagnosed with the aid of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packet traces, by (i) observation of anomalous artifacts occurring as a result of each fault and (ii) subsequent use of the inference capabilities of soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The IACD system features a modular design and is extendible to new faults, with detection capability unaffected by the TCP variant used at the client. Experimental evaluation of the IACD system in a controlled environment demonstrated an overall diagnostic accuracy of 98%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 01:49:57 GMT  (1188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5805v1", "2011 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)"]], "COMMENTS": "2011 Fourth IEEE International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["c widanapathirana", "j li", "y a sekercioglu", "m ivanovich", "p fitzpatrick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.5805"}
