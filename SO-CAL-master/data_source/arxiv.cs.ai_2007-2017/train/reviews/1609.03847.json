Addressing the complexity of nonlinear PDDL+ planning as HAs requires both space and time efficient reasoning. Unfortunately, existing solvers either do not address nonlinear dynamics or do not natively support networks of automata.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 14:17:32 GMT  (131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03847v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daniel bryce", "sergiy bogomolov", "alexander heinz", "christian schilling"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03847"}
