We show how drawing a connection to the recent notion of hypertree decompositions allows to exploit determinism in the problem specification and produce tighter bounds. We demonstrate on a variety of practical problem instances that we are often able to improve upon existing bounds by several orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:44:34 GMT  (199kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3284v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["lars otten", "rina dechter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3284"}
