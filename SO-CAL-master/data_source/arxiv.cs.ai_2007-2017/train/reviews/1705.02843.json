We show that straightforward thread-based parallelization techniques which were previously proposed for massively parallel SIMD processors perform poorly due to warp divergence and load imbalance. We propose Block-Parallel IDA* (BPIDA*), which assigns the search of a subtree to a block (a group of threads with access to fast shared memory) rather than a thread. On the 15-puzzle, BPIDA* on a NVIDIA GRID K520 with 1536 CUDA cores achieves a speedup of 4.98 compared to a highly optimized sequential IDA* implementation on a Xeon E5-2670 core.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 12:11:36 GMT  (444kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02843v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["satoru horie", "alex fukunaga"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02843"}
