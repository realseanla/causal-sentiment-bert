Using Bayesian-inspired arguments we build a normative model of fair bets under deductive uncertainty which diverges from probability theory per se but draws on the theory of algorithms. We comment on connections to Zeilberger's notion of \"semi-rigorous proofs\", particularly that inherent subjectivity is an obstacle.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 21:29:05 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09032v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Sep 2017 17:03:21 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09032v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["andrew macfie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09032"}
