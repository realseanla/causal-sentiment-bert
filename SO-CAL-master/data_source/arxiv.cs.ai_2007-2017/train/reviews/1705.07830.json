{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-May-2017", "title": "Ask the Right Questions: Active Question Reformulation with Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We propose an active question answering agent that learns to reformulate questions and combine evidence to improve question answering. The agent sits between the user and a black box question-answering system and learns to optimally probe the system with natural language reformulations of the initial question and to aggregate the evidence to return the best possible answer. The system is trained end-to-end to maximize answer quality using policy gradient. We evaluate on SearchQA, a dataset of complex questions extracted from Jeopardy!. Our agent improves F1 by 11% over a state-of-the-art base model that uses the original question/answer pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 16:19:21 GMT  (71kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07830v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Jul 2017 12:21:14 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07830v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["christian buck", "jannis bulian", "massimiliano ciaramita", "wojciech gajewski", "rea gesmundo", "neil houlsby", "wei wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07830"}
