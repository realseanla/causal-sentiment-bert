We look for a measure of plausibility, with which we can compare different possible explanations, and which can be combined when there are different sets of data. This is contrasted to the conventional measure for probabilities as well as to the proposed measure of possibilities. We define what characteristics this measure of plausibility should have.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Dec 2010 07:14:32 GMT  (104kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5705v1", "6 pages, invited paper presented at the International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems 2010 (ICACSIS2010), Bali, Indonesia, 20-22 November 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, invited paper presented at the International Conference on Advanced Computer Science and Information Systems 2010 (ICACSIS2010), Bali, Indonesia, 20-22 November 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["wan ahmad tajuddin wan abdullah"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.5705"}
