Furthermore, the existing algorithms cannot handle reflexive roles, and they are not practicable. Finally, the problem is tractable for acyclic CQs and $\\mathcal{ELH}$, and NP-complete for unrestricted CQs and $\\mathcal{ELHO}$ KBs. In this paper we complete the complexity landscape of CQ answering for several important cases. In particular, we present a practicable NP algorithm for answering CQs over $\\mathcal{ELHO}^s$ KBs---a logic containing all of OWL 2 EL, but with complex role inclusions restricted to role transitivity. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that the algorithm can be suitable for practical use. Moreover, we show that, even for a restricted class of so-called arborescent acyclic queries, CQ answering over $\\mathcal{EL}$ KBs becomes NP-hard in the presence of either transitive or reflexive roles. Finally, we show that answering arborescent CQs over $\\mathcal{ELHO}$ KBs is tractable, whereas answering acyclic CQs is NP-hard.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 17:50:06 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2516v1", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI-15"], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 15:25:06 GMT  (250kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2516v2", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI-15"], ["v3", "Wed, 13 May 2015 15:30:39 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2516v3", "Extended version of a paper to appear on AAAI-15.
