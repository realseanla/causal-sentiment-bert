Conflict resolution has a restricted resolution inference rule that resembles (a first-order generalization of) unit propagation as well as a rule for assuming decision literals and a rule for deriving new clauses by (a first-order generalization of) conflict-driven clause learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 13:11:57 GMT  (165kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03275v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 09:09:33 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03275v2", "Published at CADE 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.FL", "authors": ["daniyar itegulov", "john slaney", "bruno woltzenlogel paleo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03275"}
