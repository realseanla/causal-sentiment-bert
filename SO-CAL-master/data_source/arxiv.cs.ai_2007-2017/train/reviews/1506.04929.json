We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for non-monotonic spatial reasoning ---a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems-- based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT). ASPMT(QS) consists of a (qualitative) spatial representation module (QS) and a method for turning tight ASPMT instances into Sat Modulo Theories (SMT) instances in order to compute stable models by means of SMT solvers. We formalise and implement concepts of default spatial reasoning and spatial frame axioms using choice formulas. Spatial reasoning is performed by encoding spatial relations as systems of polynomial constraints, and solving via SMT with the theory of real nonlinear arithmetic. We empirically evaluate ASPMT(QS) in comparison with other prominent contemporary spatial reasoning systems. Our results show that ASPMT(QS) is the only existing system that is capable of reasoning about indirect spatial effects (i.e. addressing the ramification problem), and integrating geometric and qualitative spatial information within a non-monotonic spatial reasoning context.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 11:52:50 GMT  (1272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04929v1", "pages 13. accepted for publication at: LPNMR 2015 - Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning, 13th International Conference, LPNMR 2015, LNAI Vol. 9345., Lexington, September 27-30, 2015.
