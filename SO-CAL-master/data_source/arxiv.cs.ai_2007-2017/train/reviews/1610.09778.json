Simple models, such as generalized linear models, have ordinary performance but strong interpretability on a set of simple features. The other series, including tree-based models, organize numerical, categorical and high dimensional features into a comprehensive structure with rich interpretable information in the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 03:43:04 GMT  (7559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09778v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["jingbo shang", "meng jiang", "wenzhu tong", "jinfeng xiao", "jian peng", "jiawei han"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09778"}
