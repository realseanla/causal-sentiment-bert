We show that when a game involves anonymity or context-specific utility independencies, its encoding as a TAGG can be much more compact than its direct encoding as a multiagent influence diagram (MAID).We also show that TAGGs can be understood as indirect MAID encodings in which many deterministic chance nodes are introduced. We provide an algorithm for computing with TAGGs, and show both theoretically and empirically that our approach improves significantly on the previous state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 15:36:06 GMT  (198kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2638v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["albert xin jiang", "kevin leyton-brown", "avi pfeffer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2638"}
