{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-May-2013", "title": "Semantic-based Anomalous Pattern Discovery in Moving Object Trajectories", "abstract": "In this work, we investigate a novel semantic approach for pattern discovery in trajectories that, relying on ontologies, enhances object movement information with event semantics. The approach can be applied to the detection of movement patterns and behaviors whenever the semantics of events occurring along the trajectory is, explicitly or implicitly, available. In particular, we tested it against an exacting case scenario in maritime surveillance, i.e., the discovery of suspicious container transportations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 May 2013 20:14:03 GMT  (1855kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1946v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["elena camossi", "paola villa", "luca mazzola"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1946"}
