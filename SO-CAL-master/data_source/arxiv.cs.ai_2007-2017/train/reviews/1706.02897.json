We demonstrate empirically that the proposed parametric approach can often outperform the baseline Thompson Sampling on a variety of datasets. Moreover, from the behavioral modeling perspective, our parametric framework can be viewed as a first step towards a unifying computational model capturing reward processing abnormalities across multiple mental conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 18:36:12 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02897v1", "Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, AGI-17"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference on Artificial General Intelligence, AGI-17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["djallel bouneffouf", "irina rish", "guillermo a cecchi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02897"}
