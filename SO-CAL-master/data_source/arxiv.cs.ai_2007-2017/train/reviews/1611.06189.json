Finding the \"best\" set of vertices of a tournament is a well studied problem in social choice theory. A {\\em tournament solution} takes a tournament as input and outputs a subset of vertices of the input tournament. However, in many applications, for example, choosing the best set of drugs from a given set of drugs, the edges of the tournament are given only implicitly and knowing the orientation of an edge is costly. In such scenarios, we would like to know the best set of vertices (according to some tournament solution) by \"querying\" as few edges as possible. We, in this paper, precisely study this problem for commonly used tournament solutions: given an oracle access to the edges of a tournament T, find $f(T)$ by querying as few edges as possible, for a tournament solution f. We first show that the set of Condorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying $2n-\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges only and this is tight in the sense that every algorithm for finding the set of Condorcet non-losers needs to query at least $2n-\\lfloor \\log n \\rfloor -2$ edges in the worst case, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the input tournament. We then move on to study other popular tournament solutions and show that any algorithm for finding the Copeland set, the Slater set, the Markov set, the bipartisan set, the uncovered set, the Banks set, and the top cycle must query $\\Omega(n^2)$ edges in the worst case. On the positive side, we are able to circumvent our strong query complexity lower bound results by proving that, if the size of the top cycle of the input tournament is at most $k$, then we can find all the tournament solutions mentioned above by querying $O(nk + \\frac{n\\log n}{\\log(1-\\frac{1}{k})})$ edges only.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 18:19:32 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06189v1", "To appear in AAAI 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 13:26:00 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06189v2", "To appear in AAAI 2017"], ["v3", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 05:45:42 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06189v3", "To appear in AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["palash dey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.06189"}
