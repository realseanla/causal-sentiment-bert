We will see that a reasonable number of them is expressible within such computationally efficient language. We expect that, in a long-term view, a temporalization of description logics, and consequently, of OWL(2), can open new perspectives for the inclusion in this language of a greater number of ontologies of the testbed and, hopefully, of the \"real world\".", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Nov 2012 08:18:54 GMT  (22kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4957v1", "15 pages, 2 sections, 2 appendices, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Nov 2012 09:59:40 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4957v2", "15 pages, 2 sections, 2 appendices, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 2 sections, 2 appendices, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["antonio pisasale", "domenico cantone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.4957"}
