In particular, for ANN-enabled self-driving vehicles it is important to establish properties about the resilience of ANNs to noisy or even maliciously manipulated sensory input. We are addressing these challenges by defining resilience properties of ANN-based classifiers as the maximal amount of input or sensor perturbation which is still tolerated. This problem of computing maximal perturbation bounds for ANNs is then reduced to solving mixed integer optimization problems (MIP). A number of MIP encoding heuristics are developed for drastically reducing MIP-solver runtimes, and using parallelization of MIP-solvers results in an almost linear speed-up in the number (up to a certain limit) of computing cores in our experiments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach by means of computing maximal resilience bounds for a number of ANN benchmark sets ranging from typical image recognition scenarios to the autonomous maneuvering of robots.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 12:04:02 GMT  (466kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01040v1", "Timestamping research work conducted in the project"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Jul 2017 11:27:46 GMT  (525kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01040v2", "Timestamp research work conducted in the project. version 2: fix some typos, rephrase the definition, and add some more existing work"]], "COMMENTS": "Timestamping research work conducted in the project", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.LO cs.SE", "authors": ["chih-hong cheng", "georg n\\\"uhrenberg", "harald ruess"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01040"}
