The parameters are viewed as random variables to quantify uncertainty about their values. Belief nets are used to compute responses to queries; i.e., conditional probabilities of interest. A query is a function of the parameters, hence a random variable. Van Allen et al. (2001, 2008) showed how to quantify uncertainty about a query via a delta method approximation of its variance. We develop more accurate approximations for both query mean and variance. The key idea is to extend the query mean approximation to a \"doubled network\" involving two independent replicates. Our method assumes complete data and can be applied to discrete, continuous, and hybrid networks (provided discrete variables have only discrete parents). We analyze several improvements, and provide empirical studies to demonstrate their effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 15:28:28 GMT  (320kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2642v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter hooper", "yasin abbasi-yadkori", "russell greiner", "bret hoehn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2642"}
