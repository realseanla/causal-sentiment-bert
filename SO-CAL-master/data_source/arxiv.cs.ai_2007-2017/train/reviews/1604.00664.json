{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Apr-2016", "title": "Bicycle-Sharing System Analysis and Trip Prediction", "abstract": "Bicycle-sharing systems, which can provide shared bike usage services for the public, have been launched in many big cities. In bicycle-sharing systems, people can borrow and return bikes at any stations in the service region very conveniently. Therefore, bicycle-sharing systems are normally used as a short-distance trip supplement for private vehicles as well as regular public transportation. Meanwhile, for stations located at different places in the service region, the bike usages can be quite skewed and imbalanced. Some stations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for upcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough bikes for people to check out. Therefore, inferring the potential destinations and arriving time of each individual trip beforehand can effectively help the service providers schedule manual bike re-dispatch in advance. In this paper, we will study the individual trip prediction problem for bicycle-sharing systems. To address the problem, we study a real-world bicycle-sharing system and analyze individuals' bike usage behaviors first. Based on the analysis results, a new trip destination prediction and trip duration inference model will be introduced. Experiments conducted on a real-world bicycle-sharing system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Apr 2016 18:06:36 GMT  (2270kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00664v1", "11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by 2016 IEEE MDM Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 11 figures, accepted by 2016 IEEE MDM Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["jiawei zhang", "xiao pan", "moyin li", "philip s yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00664"}
