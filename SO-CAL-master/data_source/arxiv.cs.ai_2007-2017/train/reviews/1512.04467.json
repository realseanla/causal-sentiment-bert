The issue of confidence in such argumentation is still an open research field. Providing quantitative estimation of confidence is an interesting approach to manage complexity of arguments. This paper explores the main current approaches, and proposes a new model for quantitative confidence estimation based on Belief Theory for its definition, and on Bayesian Belief Networks for its propagation in safety case networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 15:24:22 GMT  (421kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04467v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j\\'er\\'emie guiochet", "quynh anh do hoang", "mohamed kaaniche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04467"}
