Recently a finite population version of Geiringer theorem with nonhomologous recombination has been adopted to the setting of Monte-Carlo tree search to cope with randomness and incomplete information by exploiting the entrinsic similarities within the state space of the problem. The only limitation of the new theorem is that the similarity relation was assumed to be an equivalence relation on the set of states. In the current paper we lift this \"curtain of limitation\" by allowing the similarity relation to be modeled in terms of an arbitrary set cover of the set of state-action pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 11 May 2013 11:42:09 GMT  (683kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2498v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1110.4657"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1110.4657", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["boris mitavskiy", "jun he"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2498"}
