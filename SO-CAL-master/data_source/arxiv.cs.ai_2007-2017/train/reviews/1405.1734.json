{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-May-2014", "title": "Logic and Constraint Logic Programming for Distributed Constraint Optimization", "abstract": "The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) has gained momentum, thanks to its suitability in capturing complex problems (e.g., multi-agent coordination and resource allocation problems) that are naturally distributed and cannot be realistically addressed in a centralized manner. The state-of-the-art in solving DCOPs relies on the use of ad-hoc infrastructures and ad-hoc constraint solving procedures. This paper investigates an infrastructure for solving DCOPs that is completely built on logic programming technologies. In particular, the paper explores the use of a general constraint solver (a constraint logic programming system in this context) to handle the agent-level constraint solving. The preliminary experiments show that logic programming provides benefits over a state-of-the-art DCOP system, in terms of performance and scalability, opening the doors to the use of more advanced technology (e.g., search strategies, complex constraints) for solving DCOPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 May 2014 20:02:09 GMT  (329kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1734v1", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"], ["v2", "Wed, 14 May 2014 22:55:33 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1734v2", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["tiep le", "enrico pontelli", "tran cao son", "william yeoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1734"}
