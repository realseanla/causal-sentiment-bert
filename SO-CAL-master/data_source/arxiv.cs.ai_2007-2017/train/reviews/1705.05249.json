{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-May-2017", "title": "CLBlast: A Tuned OpenCL BLAS Library", "abstract": "This work demonstrates how to accelerate dense linear algebra computations using CLBlast, an open-source OpenCL BLAS library providing optimized routines for a wide variety of devices. It is targeted at machine learning and HPC applications and thus provides a fast matrix-multiplication routine (GEMM) to accelerate the core of many applications (e.g. deep learning, iterative solvers, astrophysics, computational fluid dynamics, quantum chemistry). CLBlast has four main advantages over other BLAS libraries: 1) it is optimized for and tested on a large variety of OpenCL devices including less commonly used devices such as embedded and low-power GPUs, 2) it can be explicitly tuned for specific problem-sizes on specific hardware platforms, 3) it can perform operations in half-precision floating-point FP16 saving precious bandwidth, time and energy, 4) and it can combine multiple operations in a single batched routine, accelerating smaller problems significantly. This paper describes the library and demonstrates the advantages of CLBlast experimentally for different use-cases on a wide variety of OpenCL hardware.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 May 2017 17:16:59 GMT  (486kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05249v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MS cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["cedric nugteren"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05249"}
