Research is focused on developing systems that provide need-based assistance for retention of such residual skills. This paper describes a novel cognitive collaborative control architecture C3A, designed to address the challenges of developing need- based assistance for wheelchair navigation. Organization of C3A is detailed and results from simulation of the proposed architecture is presented. For simulation of our proposed architecture, we have used ROS (Robot Operating System) as a control framework and a 3D robotic simulator called USARSim (Unified System for Automation and Robot Simulation).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 11:53:59 GMT  (1790kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08761v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["rupam bhattacharyya", "adity saikia", "shyamanta m hazarika"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08761"}
