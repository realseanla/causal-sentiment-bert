It provides a mechanism to defend itself from external predates making it consistent systems, capable of adapting itself for survival incase of changes. The human immune system has motivated scientists and engineers for finding powerful information processing algorithms that has solved complex engineering tasks. This paper explores one of the various possibilities for solving problem in a Multiagent scenario wherein multiple robots are deployed to achieve a goal collectively. The final goal is dependent on the performance of individual robot and its survival without having to lose its energy beyond a predetermined threshold value by deploying an evolutionary computational technique otherwise called the artificial immune system that imitates the biological immune system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 09:12:17 GMT  (456kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2091v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tejbanta singh chingtham", "g sahoo", "m k ghose"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.2091"}
