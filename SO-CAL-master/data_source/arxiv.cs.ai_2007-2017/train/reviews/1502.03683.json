{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Feb-2015", "title": "Computing Rational Decisions In Extensive Games With Limited Foresight", "abstract": "We study extensive form games where players might not be able to foresee the possible consequences of their actions and try to exploit the opponents' believed weaknesses in order to improve upon the final outcome. We build upon existing models of games with limited foresight, endowing players with the ability of higher-order reasoning, and proposing a novel solution concept to address intuitions coming from real game play. We analyse the resulting equilibria, devising an effective procedure to compute them.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 14:45:22 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03683v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 10:49:09 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03683v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 10:22:56 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03683v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 11:17:17 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03683v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 10:32:27 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03683v5", null], ["v6", "Sun, 29 May 2016 17:21:44 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03683v6", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LO", "authors": ["paolo turrini"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.03683"}
