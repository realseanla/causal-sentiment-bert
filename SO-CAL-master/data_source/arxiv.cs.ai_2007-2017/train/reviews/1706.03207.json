We consider conditional statements over proportions of the domain and are interested in the probabilistic-logical consequences of these proportions. After introducing some general reasoning problems and analyzing their properties, we present first algorithms and complexity results for reasoning in some fragments of Statistical $\\mathcal{ALC}$.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 09:22:32 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03207v1", "16 pages.
