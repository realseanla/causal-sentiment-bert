This paper describes Hyper Heuristics (HH) method based on Great Deluge (GD) and its variants for solving large, highly constrained timetabling problems from different domains. Generally, in hyper heuristic framework, there are two main stages: heuristic selection and move acceptance. This paper emphasizes on the latter stage to develop Hyper Heuristic (HH) framework. The main contribution of this paper is that Great Deluge (GD) and its variants: Flex Deluge(FD), Non-linear(NLGD), Extended Great Deluge(EGD) are used as move acceptance method in HH by combining Reinforcement learning (RL).These HH methods are tested on exam benchmark timetabling problem and best results and comparison analysis are reported.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 05:51:18 GMT  (567kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.1891v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ei shwe sin", "nang saing moon kham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.1891"}
