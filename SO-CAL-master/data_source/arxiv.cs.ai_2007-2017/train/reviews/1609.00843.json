There are two major categories of classification problems: Single-label classification and Multi-label classification. Traditional binary and multi-class classifications are sub-categories of single-label classification. Several classifiers are developed for binary, multi-class and multi-label classification problems, but there are no classifiers available in the literature capable of performing all three types of classification. In this paper, a novel online universal classifier capable of performing all the three types of classification is proposed. Being a high speed online classifier, the proposed technique can be applied to streaming data applications. The performance of the developed classifier is evaluated using datasets from binary, multi-class and multi-label problems. The results obtained are compared with state-of-the-art techniques from each of the classification types.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Sep 2016 17:03:14 GMT  (845kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00843v1", "6 pages, 6 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 6 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["meng joo er", "rajasekar venkatesan", "ning wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00843"}
