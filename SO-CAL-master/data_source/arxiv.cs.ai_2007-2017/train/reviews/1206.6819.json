In this paper, we discuss the problem of finding robustness conditions of the MPE under single parameter changes. Specifically, we ask the question: How much change in a single network parameter can we afford to apply while keeping the MPE unchanged? We will describe a procedure, which is the first of its kind, that computes this answer for each parameter in the Bayesian network variable in time O(n exp(w)), where n is the number of network variables and w is its treewidth.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:39:15 GMT  (215kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6819v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hei chan", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6819"}
