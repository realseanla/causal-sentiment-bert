It processes input motion fields (e.g., optical flow fields) and produces a coherent motion filed, named as thermal energy field. The thermal energy field is able to capture both motion correlation among particles and the motion trends of individual particles which are helpful to discover coherency among them. We further introduce a two-step clustering process to construct stable semantic regions from the extracted time-varying coherent motions. These semantic regions can be used to recognize pre-defined activities in crowd scenes. Finally, we introduce a cluster-and-merge process which automatically discovers recurrent activities in crowd scenes by clustering and merging the extracted coherent motions. Experiments on various videos demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 06:25:30 GMT  (16211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04921v1", "This manuscript is the accepted version for TIP (IEEE Transactions on Image Processing), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This manuscript is the accepted version for TIP (IEEE Transactions on Image Processing), 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM", "authors": ["weiyao lin", "yang mi", "weiyue wang", "jianxin wu", "jingdong wang", "tao mei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04921"}
