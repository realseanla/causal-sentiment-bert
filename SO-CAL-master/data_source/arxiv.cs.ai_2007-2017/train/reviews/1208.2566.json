We go back and reanalyse their subclasses, but this time using the more modern tool of parameterized complexity analysis. This provides new results that together with the old results give a more detailed picture of the complexity landscape. We demonstrate separation results not possible with standard complexity theory, which contributes to explaining why certain cases of planning have seemed simpler in practice than theory has predicted. In particular, we show that certain restrictions of practical interest are tractable in the parameterized sense of the term, and that a simple heuristic is sufficient to make a well-known partial-order planner exploit this fact.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Aug 2012 12:40:44 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2566v1", "(author's self-archived copy)"]], "COMMENTS": "(author's self-archived copy)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christer b\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m", "yue chen", "peter jonsson", "sebastian ordyniak", "stefan szeider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1208.2566"}
