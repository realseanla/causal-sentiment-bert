This paper applies rational metareasoning to IDA* when several admissible heuristics are available. The obvious basic approach of taking the maximum of the heuristics is improved upon by lazy evaluation of the heuristics, resulting in a variant known as Lazy IDA*. We introduce a rational version of lazy IDA* that decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics or to bypass it, based on a myopic expected regret estimate. Empirical evaluation in several domains supports the theoretical results, and shows that rational lazy IDA* is a state-of-the-art heuristic combination method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 20:04:20 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6593v1", "7 pages, 6 tables, 20 references"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 6 tables, 20 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david tolpin", "oded betzalel", "ariel felner", "solomon eyal shimony"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.6593"}
