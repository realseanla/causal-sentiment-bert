In this paper, we describe how to efficiently compute effective bounds, and we develop a practical implementa- tion of depth-first branch-and-bound search for influence diagram evaluation that outperforms existing methods for solving influence diagrams with multiple stages.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (287kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3531v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["changhe yuan", "xiaojian wu", "eric a hansen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3531"}
