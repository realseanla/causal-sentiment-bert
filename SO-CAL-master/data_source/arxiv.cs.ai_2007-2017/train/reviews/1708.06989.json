This paper presents a novel framework, which shows that a significant improvement can be achieved by combining different existing heterogeneous models in a single architecture. This is done through 1) a feature layer, which separately learns different NN-based models and 2) a mixture layer, which merges the resulting model features. In doing so, this architecture benefits from the learning capabilities of each model with no noticeable increase in the number of model parameters or the training time. Extensive experiments conducted on the Penn Treebank (PTB) and the Large Text Compression Benchmark (LTCB) corpus showed a significant reduction of the perplexity when compared to state-of-the-art feedforward as well as recurrent neural network architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:27:16 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06989v1", "Published at IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1703.08068"]], "COMMENTS": "Published at IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1703.08068", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["youssef oualil", "dietrich klakow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06989"}
