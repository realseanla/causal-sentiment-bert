The former has served as a basis of classical logic based action formalisms, such as the situation calculus, the event calculus and temporal action logics; the latter has served as a basis of a family of action languages, such as language A and several of its descendants. Based on the discovery that circumscription and the stable model semantics coincide on a class of canonical formulas, we reformulate the situation calculus and the event calculus in the general theory of stable models. We also present a translation that turns the reformulations further into answer set programs, so that efficient answer set solvers can be applied to compute the situation calculus and the event calculus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:11:15 GMT  (495kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4607v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["joohyung lee", "ravi palla"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4607"}
