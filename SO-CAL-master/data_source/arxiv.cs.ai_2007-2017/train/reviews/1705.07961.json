From this general result are obtained as particular cases fuzzy versions of some important extension theorems for crisp relations (Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura). Two notions of consistent closure of a fuzzy relation are introduced.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 19:27:19 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07961v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["irina georgescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07961"}
