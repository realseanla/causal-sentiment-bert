These steps are provided in the framework of multi-valued logics using the following logical value: true, false, neutral, unknown and saturated. Also, this approach provides some calculus formulae for the following neutrosophic features: truth, falsity, neutrality, ignorance, under-definedness, over-definedness, saturation and entropy. In addition, it was defined net truth, definedness and neutrosophic score.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 16:07:24 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4802v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vasile patrascu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.4802"}
