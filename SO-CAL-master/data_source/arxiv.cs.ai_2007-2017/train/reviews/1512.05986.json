In medical imaging, there is a huge variety of possible imaging modalities and contrasts, where annotated data is usually very scarce. We present two approaches to deal with this challenge. A network pretrained in a different domain with abundant data is used as a feature extractor, while a subsequent classifier is trained on a small target dataset; and a deep architecture trained with heavy augmentation and equipped with sophisticated regularization methods. We test the approaches on a corpus of X-ray images to design an anatomy detection system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 15:16:31 GMT  (7kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05986v1", "NIPS 2015 Workshop on Machine Learning in Healthcare"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2015 Workshop on Machine Learning in Healthcare", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["vlado menkovski", "zharko aleksovski", "axel saalbach", "hannes nickisch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05986"}
