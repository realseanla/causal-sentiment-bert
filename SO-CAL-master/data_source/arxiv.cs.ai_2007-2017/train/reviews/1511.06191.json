In its basic version the method itself is rather simple and transparent. But when background knowledge and partially described counter-examples are admitted, it gets more difficult. Here we discuss this case in an abstract, somewhat \"axiomatic\" setting, providing a terminology that clarifies the abstract strategy of the method rather than its algorithmic implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 14:59:06 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06191v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daniel borchmann", "bernhard ganter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06191"}
