The formula has a number of theoretical implications on LBP. It is applied to give a sufficient condition that the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive definite, which shows non-convexity for graphs with multiple cycles. The formula clarifies the relation between the local stability of a fixed point of LBP and local minima of the Bethe free energy. We also propose a new approach to the uniqueness of LBP fixed point, and show various conditions of uniqueness.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 17:55:58 GMT  (80kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3307v1", "19 pages, Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2009), together with the supplementary material"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2009), together with the supplementary material", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM math-ph math.MP", "authors": ["yusuke watanabe", "kenji fukumizu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1002.3307"}
