In this paper, we explore the use of agent modelling in the hidden-information, collaborative card game Hanabi. We implement a number of rule-based agents, both from the literature and of our own devising, in addition to an Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (IS-MCTS) agent. We observe poor results from IS-MCTS, so construct a new, predictor version that uses a model of the agents with which it is paired. We observe a significant improvement in game-playing strength from this agent in comparison to IS-MCTS, resulting from its consideration of what the other agents in a game would do. In addition, we create a flawed rule-based agent to highlight the predictor's capabilities with such an agent.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 07:44:10 GMT  (128kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07069v1", "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation (2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation (2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph walton-rivers", "piers r williams", "richard bartle", "diego perez-liebana", "simon m lucas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07069"}
