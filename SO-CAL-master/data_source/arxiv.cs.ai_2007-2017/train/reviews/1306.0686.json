{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jun-2013", "title": "Online Learning under Delayed Feedback", "abstract": "Online learning with delayed feedback has received increasing attention recently due to its several applications in distributed, web-based learning problems. In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze the effect of delay on the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with lower complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Jun 2013 07:39:21 GMT  (56kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0686v1", "Extended version of a paper accepted to ICML-2013"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 01:01:04 GMT  (53kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0686v2", "Extended version of a paper accepted to ICML-2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper accepted to ICML-2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["pooria joulani", "andr\u00e1s gy\u00f6rgy", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.0686"}
