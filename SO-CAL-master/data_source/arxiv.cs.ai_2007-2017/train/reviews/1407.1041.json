We show generalizations of 2-valued Boolean logic to fuzzy logic, also from the Kleene and Lukasiewicz 3-symbol valued logics or Belnap 4-symbol valued logic to the most general n-symbol or numerical valued refined neutrosophic logic. Two classes of neutrosophic norm (n-norm) and neutrosophic conorm (n-conorm) are defined. Examples of applications of neutrosophic logic to physics are listed in the last section. Similar generalizations can be done for n-Valued Refined Neutrosophic Set, and respectively n- Valued Refined Neutrosopjhic Probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 15:25:52 GMT  (378kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1041v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.1041"}
