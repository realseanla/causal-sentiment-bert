As the interconnection of such models is not a trivial task, one of the key elements that may be applied is the description of the urban geometric properties in an \"interoperable\" way. Focusing on air quality as one of the most pronounced urban problems, the geometric aspects of a city may be described by objects such as those defined in CityGML, so that an appropriate air quality model can be applied for estimating the quality of the urban air on the basis of atmospheric flow and chemistry equations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 11:31:50 GMT  (828kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6511v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["claudine m\\'etral", "gilles falquet", "kostas karatzas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.6511"}
