To further increase the number of facts in RDF knowledge bases, logic rules can be used to predict new facts based on the existing ones. Therefore, how to automatically learn reliable rules from large-scale knowledge bases becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we propose a novel rule learning approach named RDF2Rules for RDF knowledge bases. RDF2Rules first mines frequent predicate cycles (FPCs), a kind of interesting frequent patterns in knowledge bases, and then generates rules from the mined FPCs. Because each FPC can produce multiple rules, and effective pruning strategy is used in the process of mining FPCs, RDF2Rules works very efficiently. Another advantage of RDF2Rules is that it uses the entity type information when generates and evaluates rules, which makes the learned rules more accurate. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the compared approach in terms of both efficiency and accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 07:19:01 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07734v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["zhichun wang", "juanzi li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07734"}
