The objective of a good embedding is to preserve the proximity between vertices in the original graph. This way, typical search and mining methods can be applied in the embedded space with the help of off-the-shelf multidimensional indexing approaches. Existing network embedding techniques focus on homogeneous networks, where all vertices are considered to belong to a single class.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 04:00:46 GMT  (4375kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05291v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["zhipeng huang", "nikos mamoulis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.05291"}
