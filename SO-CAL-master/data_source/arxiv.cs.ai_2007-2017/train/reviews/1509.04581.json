However, due to the intrinsic structure design of CNN, for images with complex content, it achieves lim- ited capability on invariance to translation, rotation, and re-sizing changes, which is strongly emphasized in the s- cenario of content-based image retrieval. In this paper, to address this problem, we proposed a new kernelized deep convolutional neural network. We first discuss our motiva- tion by an experimental study to demonstrate the sensitivi- ty of the global CNN feature to the basic geometric trans- formations. Then, we propose to represent visual content with approximate invariance to the above geometric trans- formations from a kernelized perspective. We extract CNN features on the detected object-like patches and aggregate these patch-level CNN features to form a vectorial repre- sentation with the Fisher vector model. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated on image search application with three benchmark datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 14:35:11 GMT  (3687kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04581v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.IR cs.MM", "authors": ["zhen liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04581"}
