Despite the flourishing of different models and theories in both fields, several key questions still remain unanswered. The understanding of how opinions change and the way they are affected by social influence are challenging issues requiring a thorough analysis of opinion per se but also of the way in which they travel between agents' minds and are modulated by these exchanges. To account for the two-faceted nature of opinions, which are mental entities undergoing complex social processes, we outline a preliminary model in which a cognitive theory of opinions is put forward and it is paired with a formal description of them and of their spreading among minds. Furthermore, investigating social influence also implies the necessity to account for the way in which people change their minds, as a consequence of interacting with other people, and the need to explain the higher or lower persistence of such changes.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 14:52:09 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4218v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["francesca giardini", "walter quattrociocchi", "rosaria conte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.4218"}
