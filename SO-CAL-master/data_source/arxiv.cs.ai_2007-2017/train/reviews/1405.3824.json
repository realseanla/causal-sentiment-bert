A single person might not have all the required expertises, and decision support systems featuring optimization components can help to assess policies. Leveraging on previous work on Strategic Environmental Assessment, we developed a fully-fledged system that is able to provide optimal plans with respect to a given objective, to perform multi-objective optimization and provide sets of Pareto optimal plans, and to visually compare them. Each plan is environmentally assessed and its footprint is evaluated. The heart of the system is an application developed in a popular Constraint Logic Programming system on the Reals sort. It has been equipped with a web service module that can be queried through standard interfaces, and an intuitive graphic user interface.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 May 2014 12:48:35 GMT  (948kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3824v1", "Accepted at ICLP2014 Conference as Technical Communication, due to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at ICLP2014 Conference as Technical Communication, due to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco gavanelli", "stefano bragaglia", "michela milano", "federico chesani", "elisa marengo", "paolo cagnoli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3824"}
