This paper proposes activity-based search, the idea of using the activity of variables during propagation to guide the search. Activity-based search was compared experimentally to impact-based search and the WDEG heuristics. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that activity-based search is more robust than other heuristics and may produce significant improvements in performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2011 15:25:33 GMT  (111kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6314v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MS", "authors": ["l michel", "p van hentenryck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.6314"}
