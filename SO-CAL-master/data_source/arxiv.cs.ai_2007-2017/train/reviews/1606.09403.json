However, previous attempts had expensive resource requirements, difficulty incorporating monolingual data or were unable to handle polysemy. We address these drawbacks in our method which takes advantage of a high coverage dictionary in an EM style training algorithm over monolingual corpora in two languages. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on bilingual lexicon induction task exceeding models using large bilingual corpora, and competitive results on the monolingual word similarity and cross-lingual document classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 09:18:53 GMT  (208kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09403v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["long duong", "hiroshi kanayama", "tengfei ma", "steven bird", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.09403"}
