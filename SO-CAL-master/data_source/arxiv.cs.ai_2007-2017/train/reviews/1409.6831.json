This paper addresses the problem of privacy preservation if the query returns the histogram of rankings. The framework of differential privacy is applied to rank aggregation. The error probability of the aggregated ranking is analyzed as a result of noise added in order to achieve differential privacy. Upper bounds on the error rates for any positional ranking rule are derived under the assumption that profiles are uniformly distributed. Simulation results are provided to validate the probabilistic analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 05:19:32 GMT  (123kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6831v1", "Fusion 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Fusion 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR", "authors": ["shang shang", "tiance wang", "paul cuff", "sanjeev kulkarni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.6831"}
