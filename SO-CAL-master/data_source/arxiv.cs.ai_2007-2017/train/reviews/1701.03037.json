In this position paper we first report our proof strategy language based on a meta-tool approach. Then, we propose an AI-based approach to drastically improve proof automation for Isabelle, while identifying three major challenges we plan to address for this objective.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 08:52:31 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03037v1", "Accepted at AITP2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at AITP2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yutaka nagashima"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.03037"}
