Both assume an underlying dag (directed acyclic graph) structure of relations among variables and if Markov condition and faithfulness condition [15] are met, then a causal network is in fact a belief network. The difference comes to appearance when we recover belief network and causal network structure from data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 17:58:13 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10308v1", "A short version of this paper appeared in [Klopotek:94m] M.A. K{\\l}opotek: Learning Belief Network Structure From Data under Causal Insufficiency.
