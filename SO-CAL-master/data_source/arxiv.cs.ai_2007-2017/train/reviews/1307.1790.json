{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Jul-2013", "title": "Lifting Structural Tractability to CSP with Global Constraints", "abstract": "A wide range of problems can be modelled as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), that is, a set of constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously. Constraints can either be represented extensionally, by explicitly listing allowed combinations of values, or implicitly, by special-purpose algorithms provided by a solver. Such implicitly represented constraints, known as global constraints, are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Jul 2013 14:54:18 GMT  (73kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1790v1", "To appear in proceedings of CP'13, LNCS 8124"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of CP'13, LNCS 8124", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["evgenij thorstensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1790"}
