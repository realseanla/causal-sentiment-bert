Under various goodness-of-fit measures, finding an optimal network is NP-hard, even if restricted to polytrees of bounded in-degree. Polynomial-time algorithms are known only for rare special cases, perhaps most notably for branchings, that is, polytrees in which the in-degree of every node is at most one. Here, we study the complexity of finding an optimal polytree that can be turned into a branching by deleting some number of arcs or nodes, treated as a parameter.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Aug 2012 15:32:42 GMT  (18kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1692v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 13:36:15 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.1692v2", "(author's self-archived copy)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["serge gaspers", "mikko koivisto", "mathieu liedloff", "sebastian ordyniak", "stefan szeider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1208.1692"}
