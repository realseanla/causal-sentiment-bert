This solution concept can capture situations in which an agent controls multiple resources-corresponding to the team members-that cannot communicate. It is known that such equilibrium always exists and it is unique (unless degeneracy) and these properties make it a credible solution concept to be used in real-world applications, especially in security scenarios. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the Team-maxmin equilibrium is almost completely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate bounds of (in)efficiency of the Team-maxmin equilibrium w.r.t. the Nash equilibria and w.r.t. the Maxmin equilibrium when the team members can play correlated strategies. Furthermore, we study a number of algorithms to find and/or approximate an equilibrium, discussing their theoretical guarantees and evaluating their performance by using a standard testbed of game instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 15:56:48 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06134v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["nicola basilico", "andrea celli", "giuseppe de nittis", "nicola gatti 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.06134"}
