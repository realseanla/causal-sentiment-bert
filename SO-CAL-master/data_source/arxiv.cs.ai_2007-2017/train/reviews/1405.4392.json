We construct distributional thesauri based networks from data at different time points and cluster each of them separately to obtain word-centric sense clusters corresponding to the different time points. Subsequently, we compare these sense clusters of two different time points to find if (i) there is birth of a new sense or (ii) if an older sense has got split into more than one sense or (iii) if a newer sense has been formed from the joining of older senses or (iv) if a particular sense has died. We conduct a thorough evaluation of the proposed methodology both manually as well as through comparison with WordNet. Manual evaluation indicates that the algorithm could correctly identify 60.4% birth cases from a set of 48 randomly picked samples and 57% split/join cases from a set of 21 randomly picked samples. Remarkably, in 44% cases the birth of a novel sense is attested by WordNet, while in 46% cases and 43% cases split and join are respectively confirmed by WordNet. Our approach can be applied for lexicography, as well as for applications like word sense disambiguation or semantic search.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 May 2014 13:29:13 GMT  (131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4392v1", "10 pages, 2 figures, ACL-2014"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures, ACL-2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["sunny mitra", "ritwik mitra", "martin riedl 0002", "chris biemann", "animesh mukherjee", "pawan goyal"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.4392"}
