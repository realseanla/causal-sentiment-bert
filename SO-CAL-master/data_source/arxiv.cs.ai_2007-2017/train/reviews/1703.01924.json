Exchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables. We show how such assessments are a special indifference assessment, and how that leads to a counterpart of de Finetti's Representation Theorem, both in a finite and a countable context.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 15:34:54 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01924v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arthur van camp", "gert de cooman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01924"}
