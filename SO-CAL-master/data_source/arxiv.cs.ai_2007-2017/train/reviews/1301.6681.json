Such representations of qualitative preference orderings form an importnat component of automated decision tools. We propose a graphical representation of preferences that reflects conditional dependence and independence of preference statements under a ceteris paribus (all else being equal) interpretation. Such a representation is ofetn compact and arguably natural. We describe several search algorithms for dominance testing based on this representation; these algorithms are quite effective, especially in specific network topologies, such as chain-and tree- structured networks, as well as polytrees.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:03 GMT  (460kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6681v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["craig boutilier", "ronen i brafman", "holger h hoos", "david l poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6681"}
