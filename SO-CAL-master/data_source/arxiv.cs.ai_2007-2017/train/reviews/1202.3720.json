For these algorithms, marginal inference of the reward weighted trajectory distribution is required to perform policy updates. We discuss a new exact inference algorithm for these marginals in the finite horizon case that is more efficient than the standard approach based on classical forward-backward recursions. We also provide a principled extension to infinite horizon Markov Decision Problems that explicitly accounts for an infinite horizon. This extension provides a novel algorithm for both policy gradients and Expectation Maximisation in infinite horizon problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (223kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3720v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas furmston", "david barber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3720"}
