{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-May-2016", "title": "Adaptive ADMM with Spectral Penalty Parameter Selection", "abstract": "The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a versatile tool for solving a wide range of constrained optimization problems, with differentiable or non-differentiable objective functions. Unfortunately, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, which makes ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method to adaptively tune the penalty parameters to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 00:48:28 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07246v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 19:21:26 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07246v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 19:51:17 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07246v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 18:49:04 GMT  (403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07246v4", "AISTATS 2017"], ["v5", "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 16:23:11 GMT  (240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07246v5", "AISTATS 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NA", "authors": ["zheng xu", "mario a t figueiredo", "tom goldstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07246"}
