This class is proven to precisely coincide with the class of logically closed languages that may be thought of as functions from expressions to sets of logically equivalent Ty_n terms. For a specific sub-class of logically closed languages that are described by finite sets of rules or rule schemata, we find effective procedures for building a compact Ty_n representation, involving a finite number of axioms or axiom schemata. The proposed formalism is characterized by some useful features unavailable in a two-component architecture of a language model. A further specialization and extension of the formalism with a context type enable effective account of intensional and dynamic semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 08:13:10 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5185v1", "48 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "48 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["victor gluzberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.5185"}
