In this work, we have designed a mathematical model of a simulator system which in turn helps in analyzing the results and finding out the various spaces on which our favorable situation might exist, this is done geometrically. In the mathematical model, we have explained the matrix formation and its significance followed up in dynamic programming approach we explained the possible graph formation which will led improvisation of AI, latter we explained the possible geometrical structure of the matrix operations and its impact on a particular decision, we also explained the conditions under which it tend to fail along with a possible solution in future works.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 May 2014 18:22:59 GMT  (498kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7944v1", "4 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["shruti jadon", "anubhav singhal", "suma dawn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7944"}
