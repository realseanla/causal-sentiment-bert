The main idea of the method is to approximate the optimal value function by a set of basis functions and optimize their weights by linear programming (LP). This paper proposes a new ALP approximation. Comparing to the standard ALP formulation, we decompose the constraint space into a set of low-dimensional spaces. This structure allows for solving the new LP efficiently. In particular, the constraints of the LP can be satisfied in a compact form without an exponential dependence on the treewidth of ALP constraints. We study both practical and theoretical aspects of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate its scale-up potential on an MDP with more than 2^100 states.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:36:14 GMT  (426kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3266v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["branislav kveton", "milos hauskrecht"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3266"}
