In order to provide a mathematical tool for mining tacit knowledge, we establish a concrete model of 6-ary linguistic truth-valued concept lattice and introduce a mining algorithm through the structure consistency. Specifically, we utilize the attributes to depict knowledge, propose the 6-ary linguistic truth-valued attribute extended context and congener context to characterize tacit knowledge, and research the necessary and sufficient conditions of forming tacit knowledge. We respectively give the algorithms of generating the linguistic truth-valued congener context and constructing the linguistic truth-valued concept lattice.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2012 17:33:28 GMT  (216kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3107v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["li yang", "yuhui wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3107"}
