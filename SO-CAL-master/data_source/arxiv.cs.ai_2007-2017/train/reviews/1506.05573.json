To reach this goal, we'll try to use the concepts of adaptation and synchronization to enhance the interactive abilities of our agents and guide the development of our interaction model, and will try to make synchrony emerge from non-verbal dimensions of interaction.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 07:47:49 GMT  (732kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05573v1", "Intelligent Virtual Agents 2015 Doctoral Consortium, Aug 2015, Delft, Netherlands.
