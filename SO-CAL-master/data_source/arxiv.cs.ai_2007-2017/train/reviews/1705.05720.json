Subjective knowledge differs from objective knowledge in that it has no documented or observed ground truth. Instead, the truth relies on people's dominant opinion. Thus, we can use the crowdsourcing technique to get opinion from the crowd. In our work, we propose a system, called crowdsourced subjective knowledge acquisition (CoSKA),for subjective knowledge acquisition powered by crowdsourcing and existing KBs. The acquired knowledge can be used to enrich existing KBs in the subjective dimension which bridges the gap between existing objective knowledge and subjective queries.The main challenge of CoSKA is the conflict between large scale knowledge facts and limited crowdsourcing resource. To address this challenge, in this work, we define knowledge inference rules and then select the seed knowledge judiciously for crowdsourcing to maximize the inference power under the resource constraint. Our experimental results on real knowledge base and crowdsourcing platform verify the effectiveness of CoSKA system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 14:25:02 GMT  (1735kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05720v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["rui meng", "hao xin", "lei chen", "yangqiu song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05720"}
