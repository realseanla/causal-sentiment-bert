This probabilistic approach commits us to planning to meet some specified goal with a probability of success of at least 1-epsilon for some user-supplied epsilon. We describe several algorithms for epsilon-safe planning based on conditional planners. The two conditional planners we discuss are Peot and Smith's nonlinear conditional planner, CNLP, and our own linear conditional planner, PLINTH. We present a straightforward extension to conditional planners for which computing the necessary probabilities is simple, employing a commonly-made but perhaps overly-strong independence assumption. We also discuss a second approach to epsilon-safe planning which relaxes this independence assumption, involving the incremental construction of a probability dependence model in conjunction with the construction of the plan graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:19 GMT  (1531kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6810v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["robert p goldman", "mark s boddy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6810"}
