Managing and maintaining these emerging systems are indispensable parts of these systems. Visualizing the current operations can assist in getting a better grasp on the performance of the system. In this paper, a data mining approach is used to identify and visualize some important factors related to bike-share operations and management. To consolidate the data, we cluster stations that have a similar pickup and drop-off profiles during weekdays and weekends. We provide the temporal profile of the center of each cluster which can be used as a simple and practical approach for approximating the number of pickups and drop-offs of the stations. We also define two indices based on stations' shortages and surpluses that reflect the degree of balancing aid a station needs. These indices can help stakeholders improve the quality of the bike-share user experience in at-least two ways. It can act as a complement to balancing optimization efforts, and it can identify stations that need expansion. We mine the District of Columbia's regional bike-share data and discuss the findings of this data set. We examine the bike-share system during different quarters of the year and during both peak and non-peak hours. Findings reflect that on weekdays most of the pickups and drop-offs happen during the morning and evening peaks whereas on weekends pickups and drop-offs are spread out throughout the day. We also show that throughout the day, more than 40% of the stations are relatively self-balanced. Not worrying about these stations during ordinary days can allow the balancing efforts to focus on a fewer stations and therefore potentially improve the efficiency of the balancing optimization models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 16:16:24 GMT  (1426kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04196v1", "Submitted to TRB2018"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to TRB2018", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kiana roshan zamir", "ali shafahi", "ali haghani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04196"}
