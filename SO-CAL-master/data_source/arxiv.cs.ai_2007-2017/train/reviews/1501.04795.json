Indeed, as users of these networks, we can send messages to other people according to the links connecting us. Moreover, given the large volume of exchanged messages, detecting the true nature of the received message becomes a challenge. For this purpose, it is interesting to consider this new tendency with reasoning under uncertainty by using the theory of belief functions. In this paper, we tried to model a social network as being a network of fusion of information and determine the true nature of the received message in a well-defined node by proposing a new model: the belief social network.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 13:01:01 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04795v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["salma ben dhaou", "mouloud kharoune", "arnaud martin", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04795"}
