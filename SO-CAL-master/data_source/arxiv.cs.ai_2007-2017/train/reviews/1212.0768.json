However, extreme traffic situations might exhibit practical cases in which a vehicle should safely and reasonably relax traffic regulation, e.g., in order not to be indefinitely blocked and to keep circulating. In this paper, we propose a high-level representation of an automated vehicle, other vehicles and their environment, which can assist drivers in taking such \"illegal\" but practical relaxation decisions. This high-level representation (an ontology) includes topological knowledge and inference rules, in order to compute the next high-level motion an automated vehicle should take, as assistance to a driver. Results on practical cases are presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 15:34:10 GMT  (476kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0768v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["philippe morignot", "fawzi nashashibi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.0768"}
