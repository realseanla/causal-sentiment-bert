Time is a key element and a simulator would be able to show how patterns may form and then fire in sequence, as part of a search or thought process. It uses a very simple equation to show how the inhibitors in particular, can switch off certain areas, to allow other areas to become the prominent ones and thereby define the current brain state. This allows for a small amount of control over what appears to be a chaotic structure inside of the brain. It is attractive because it is still mostly mechanical and therefore can be added as an automatic process, or the modelling of that. The paper also describes how the nested pattern structure can be used as a basic counting mechanism. This extended version integrates further with the existing cognitive model and provides new conclusions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 23 Aug 2014 11:05:00 GMT  (1891kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5490v1", "This is an extended version ofarXiv:1403.6274, with a different conclusions section as well"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 19:45:56 GMT  (510kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5490v2", "This is an extended version ofarXiv:1403.6274, with a different conclusions section as well"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version ofarXiv:1403.6274, with a different conclusions section as well", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kieran greer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.5490"}
