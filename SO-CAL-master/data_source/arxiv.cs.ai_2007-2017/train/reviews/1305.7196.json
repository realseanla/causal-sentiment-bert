This article also shows some ways this can be done and hence how research journal/proceeding publishers could allow this. So far, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not proposed simple notations and cooperation protocols - similar to those illustrated or referred to in this article - but it now seems likely that Wikipedia/Wikidata, Google or the W3C will propose them sooner or later. Then, research journal/proceeding publishers and researchers may or may not quickly use this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 18:34:03 GMT  (81kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7196v1", "6 pages, conference"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI", "authors": ["philippe a martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7196"}
