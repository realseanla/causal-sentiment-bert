We will suggest a real-time solution, based on the idea of using some words or groups of words that indicate grammatical category; and some specific endings of some parts of sentence. Our idea is based on some characteristics of the Romanian language, where some prepositions, adverbs or some specific endings can provide a lot of information about the structure of a complex sentence. Such characteristics can be found in other languages, too, such as French. Using a special grammar, we developed a system (DIASEXP) that can perform a dialogue in natural language with assertive and interogative sentences about a \"story\" (a set of sentences describing some events from the real life).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Jan 2013 19:17:31 GMT  (177kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1950v1", "13 pages, 3 figures, DIASEXP, International Journal on Natural Language Computing, 2012, Volume 1, Number 4"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 3 figures, DIASEXP, International Journal on Natural Language Computing, 2012, Volume 1, Number 4", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["bogdan patrut"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1950"}
