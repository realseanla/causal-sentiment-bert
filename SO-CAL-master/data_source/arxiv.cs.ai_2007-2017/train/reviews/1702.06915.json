{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Feb-2017", "title": "Solving DCOPs with Distributed Large Neighborhood Search", "abstract": "The field of Distributed Constraint Optimization has gained momentum in recent years, thanks to its ability to address various applications related to multi-agent cooperation. Nevertheless, solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) optimally is NP-hard. Therefore, in large-scale, complex applications, incomplete DCOP algorithms are necessary. Current incomplete DCOP algorithms suffer of one or more of the following limitations: they (a) find local minima without providing quality guarantees; (b) provide loose quality assessment; or (c) are unable to benefit from the structure of the problem, such as domain-dependent knowledge and hard constraints. Therefore, capitalizing on strategies from the centralized constraint solving community, we propose a Distributed Large Neighborhood Search (D-LNS) framework to solve DCOPs. The proposed framework (with its novel repair phase) provides guarantees on solution quality, refining upper and lower bounds during the iterative process, and can exploit domain-dependent structures. Our experimental results show that D-LNS outperforms other incomplete DCOP algorithms on both structured and unstructured problem instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 17:54:23 GMT  (1654kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06915v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:21:38 GMT  (1654kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06915v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ferdinando fioretto", "agostino dovier", "enrico pontelli", "william yeoh", "roie zivan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06915"}
