Our proposed methodology treats content selection as a multi-label classification (MLC) problem, which takes as input time-series data (students' learning data) and outputs a summary of these data (feedback). Unlike previous work, this method considers all data simultaneously using ensembles of classifiers, and therefore, it achieves higher accuracy and F- score compared to meaningful baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 14:17:06 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02922v1", "3 pages, 2 figures, 1st International Workshop on Data-to-text Generation"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 2 figures, 1st International Workshop on Data-to-text Generation", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["dimitra gkatzia", "helen hastie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02922"}
