Since Ccfomi improvises non-deterministically, there is no control on choices and therefore little control over the sequence variation during the improvisation. To avoid this, we extended Ccfomi using the Probabilistic Non-deterministic Timed Concurrent Constraint calculus. Our extension to Ccfomi does not change the time and space complexity of building the FO, thus making our extension compatible with RT. However, there was not a ntcc interpreter capable of RT to execute Ccfomi. We developed Ntccrt --a RT capable interpreter for ntcc-- and we executed Ccfomi on Ntccrt. In the future, we plan to extend Ntccrt to execute our extension to Ccfomi.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 21:26:53 GMT  (4254kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02169v1", "70 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "70 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mauricio toro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02169"}
