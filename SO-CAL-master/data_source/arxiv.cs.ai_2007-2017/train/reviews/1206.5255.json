Computational feasibility is obtained by exploiting the local GAI structure in the model. Our results provide a practical approach for implementing preference-based constrained configuration optimization as well as effective search in multiattribute product databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 14:57:59 GMT  (220kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5255v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["darius braziunas", "craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.5255"}
