This paper proposes a constructive definition of inter-causal independence, which can be used to further factorize a conditional probability. An inference algorithm is developed, which makes use of both conditional independence and inter-causal independence to reduce inference complexity in Bayesian networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:47 GMT  (1108kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6855v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang", "david l poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6855"}
