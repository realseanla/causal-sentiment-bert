It is clear that the structural equations can have a major impact on the conclusions we draw about causality. In particular, the choice of variables and their values can also have a significant impact on causality. These choices are, to some extent, subjective. We consider what counts as an appropriate choice. More generally, we consider what makes a model an appropriate model, especially if we want to take defaults into account, as was argued is necessary in recent work.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 09:40:55 GMT  (88kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.2652v1", "In &lt;em&gt;Heuristics, Probability and Causality: A Tribute to Judea Pearl&lt;/em&gt; (editors, R.
