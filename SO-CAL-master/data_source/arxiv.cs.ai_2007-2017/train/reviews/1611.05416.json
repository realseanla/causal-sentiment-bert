Based on recent success of long-short term memory (LSTM) on sequence learning, we put forward a novel system to reflect the thinking pattern of a musician. For data representation, we propose a note-level encoding method, which enables our model to simulate how human composes and polishes music phrases. To avoid failure against music theory, we invent a novel method, grammar argumented (GA) method. It can teach machine basic composing principles. In this method, we propose three rules as argumented grammars and three metrics for evaluation of machine-made music. Results show that comparing to basic LSTM, grammar argumented model's compositions have higher contents of diatonic scale notes, short pitch intervals, and chords.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 19:42:40 GMT  (351kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05416v1", "5 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 20:51:36 GMT  (1776kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05416v2", "6 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.SD", "authors": ["zheng sun", "jiaqi liu", "zewang zhang", "jingwen chen", "zhao huo", "ching hua lee", "xiao zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05416"}
