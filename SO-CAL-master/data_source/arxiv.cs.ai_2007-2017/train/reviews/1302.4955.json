A set of intuitive axiomatic requirements is presented, some of their implications are shown, and the proof is given of the minimality of recently proposed measure AU among all measures satisfying the proposed requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:13 GMT  (340kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4955v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david harmanec"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4955"}
