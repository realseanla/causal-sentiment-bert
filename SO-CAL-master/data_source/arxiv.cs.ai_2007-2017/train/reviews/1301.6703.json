It is based on the requirements of consistency and closeness. An optimal approximation is studied. Unfortunately, the computation of the optimal approximation turns out to be intractable. Hence, various heuristic methods are proposed and experimantally evaluated both in terms of their accuracy and in terms of the speed of computation. These methods are compared to the earlier proposed approximations of belief functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:58:34 GMT  (366kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6703v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david harmanec"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6703"}
