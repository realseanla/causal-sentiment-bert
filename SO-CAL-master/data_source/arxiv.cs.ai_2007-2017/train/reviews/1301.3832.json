Formulas are represented by pairs (A, c), where A is a many-valued proposition and c is value in the unit interval [0,1] which denotes a lower bound on the belief on A in terms of necessity measures. Belief states are modeled by possibility distributions on the set of all many-valued interpretations. In this framework, (i) we define a syntax and a semantics of the general underlying uncertainty logic; (ii) we provide a modus ponens-style calculus for a sublanguage of Horn-rules and we prove that it is complete for determining the maximum degree of possibilistic belief with which a fuzzy propositional variable can be entailed from a set of formulas; and finally, (iii) we show how the computation of a partial matching between fuzzy propositional variables, in terms of necessity measures for fuzzy sets, can be included in our logic programming system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:48:38 GMT  (357kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3832v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["teresa alsinet", "lluis godo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3832"}
