We carry out feature based comparisons of different types of evolutionary algorithms such as evolution strategies, differential evolution and particle swarm optimisation for constrained continuous optimisation. In our study, we examine how sets of constraints influence the difficulty of obtaining close to optimal solutions. Using a multi-objective approach, we evolve constrained continuous problems having a set of linear and/or quadratic constraints where the different evolutionary approaches show a significant difference in performance. Afterwards, we discuss the features of the constraints that exhibit a difference in performance of the different evolutionary approaches under consideration.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 04:30:05 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06842v1", "16 Pagesm 2 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 Pagesm 2 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["shayan poursoltan", "frank neumann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06842"}
