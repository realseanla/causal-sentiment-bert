In a sensor network, for example, it is important to select the subset of sensors that is expected to provide the strongest reduction in uncertainty. In medical decision making tasks, one needs to select which tests to administer before deciding on the most effective treatment. It has been general practice to use heuristic-guided procedures for selecting observations. In this paper, we present the first efficient optimal algorithms for selecting observations for a class of probabilistic graphical models. For example, our algorithms allow to optimally label hidden variables in Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). We provide results for both selecting the optimal subset of observations, and for obtaining an optimal conditional observation plan.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:30:52 GMT  (382kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3474v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["andreas krause", "carlos guestrin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3474"}
