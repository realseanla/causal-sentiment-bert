It comprises formal syntax and semantics of a nondeterministic action programming language. The language is interpreted stochastically via Monte Carlo Tree Search. Effectiveness of the approach is shown empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 11:48:50 GMT  (691kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08441v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["lenz belzner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08441"}
