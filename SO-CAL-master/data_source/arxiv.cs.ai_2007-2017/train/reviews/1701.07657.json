Two semantics are presented. First, a hybrid operational semantics that separates the process component, treated with Petri nets, from the constraint/terminological component, treated with Answer Set Programming (ASP). Second, a denotational semantics maps the notation to ASP fully, via Event Calculus. These two alternative specifications enable a preliminary evaluation in terms of reasoning efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 11:21:50 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07657v1", "draft version"]], "COMMENTS": "draft version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["giovanni sileno"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07657"}
