This paper proposes the reconstruction of unobserved actions to tackle this problem. In particular, we formalise the problem of reconstructing unobserved actions, and propose an information model and algorithms for monitoring norms under partial action observability using two different processes for reconstructing unobserved actions. Our evaluation shows that reconstructing unobserved actions increases significantly the number of norm violations and fulfilments detected.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 May 2015 09:16:07 GMT  (106kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03996v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 08:30:04 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03996v2", "Accepted at the IEEE Transaction on Cybernetics"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["natalia criado", "jose m such"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03996"}
