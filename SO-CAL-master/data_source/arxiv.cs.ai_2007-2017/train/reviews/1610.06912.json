Estimating accuracy of such automatically constructed KGs is a challenging problem due to their size and diversity. Even though crowdsourcing is an obvious choice for such evaluation, the standard single-task crowdsourcing, where each predicate in the KG is evaluated independently, is very expensive and especially problematic if the budget available is limited. We show that such approaches are sub-optimal as they ignore dependencies among various predicates and their instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose Relational Crowdsourcing (RelCrowd), where the tasks are created while taking dependencies among predicates and instances into account. We apply this framework in the context of evaluation of large-scale KGs and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on real-world datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Oct 2016 19:49:19 GMT  (1116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06912v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 06:45:34 GMT  (2493kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06912v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["prakhar ojha", "partha talukdar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06912"}
