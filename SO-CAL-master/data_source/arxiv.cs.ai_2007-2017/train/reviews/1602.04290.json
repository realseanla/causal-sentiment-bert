One such vision is that of an intelligent instrument that collects data in an automated fashion, and based on what it learns, decides which new measurements to take. This innovation implements experimental design and unites it with data analysis in such a way that it completes the cycle of learning. This cycle is the basis of the Scientific Method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 06:28:22 GMT  (2684kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04290v1", "9 pages, 2 figures.
