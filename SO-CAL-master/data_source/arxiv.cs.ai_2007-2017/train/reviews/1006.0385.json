This paper discusses why this is crucial to brain-like intelligence (an area funded by NSF) and to many applications, and discusses various possibilities for network design and training. The appendix discusses recent research, relations to work on stochastic optimization in operations research, and relations to engineering-based approaches to understanding neocortex.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Jun 2010 18:16:10 GMT  (159kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0385v1", "Plenary talk at IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computing 1999, extended in 2010 with new appendix"]], "COMMENTS": "Plenary talk at IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computing 1999, extended in 2010 with new appendix", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul j werbos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.0385"}
