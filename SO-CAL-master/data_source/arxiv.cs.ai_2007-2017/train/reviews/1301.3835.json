The fusion of multiple sources information is discussed in this setting. Different classes of merging operators are considered including conjunctive, disjunctive, reinforcement, adaptive and averaging operators. Then we propose to analyse these classes in terms of postulates. This is done by first extending the postulate for merging classical bases to the case where priorites are avaialbe.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:48:52 GMT  (315kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3835v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["salem benferhat", "didier dubois", "souhila kaci", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3835"}
