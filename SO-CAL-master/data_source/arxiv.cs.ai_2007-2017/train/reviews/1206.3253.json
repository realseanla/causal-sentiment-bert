A cluster groups together agents with a similar \"strategic view\" of the game. We learn the clustered approximation from data consisting of strategy profiles and payoffs, which may be obtained from observations of play or access to a simulator. Using our clustering we construct a reduced \"twins\" game in which each cluster is associated with two players of the reduced game. This allows our representation to be individually- responsive because we align the interests of every individual agent with the strategy of its cluster. Our approach provides agents with higher payoffs and lower regret on average than model-free methods as well as previous cluster-based methods, and requires only few observations for learning to be successful. The \"twins\" approach is shown to be an important component of providing these low regret approximations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:12:21 GMT  (174kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3253v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["sevan g ficici", "david c parkes", "avi pfeffer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3253"}
