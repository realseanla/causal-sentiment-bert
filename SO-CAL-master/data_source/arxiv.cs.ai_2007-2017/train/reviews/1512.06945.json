While the usual implication (i.e., the neck of a Horn clause) stands for inferring facts, an embedded implication plays the role of assuming its premise for deriving its consequence. A former work introduced both a formal framework and a goal-oriented tabled implementation, allowing negation in rule bodies. While in that work positive assumptions for both facts and rules can occur in the premise, negative assumptions are not allowed. In this work, we cover this subject by introducing a new concept: a restricted predicate, which allows negative assumptions by pruning the usual semantics of a predicate. This new setting has been implemented in the deductive system DES.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 03:16:55 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06945v1", "In Proceedings PROLE 2015,arXiv:1512.06178"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings PROLE 2015,arXiv:1512.06178", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["fernando s\\'aenz-p\\'erez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06945"}
