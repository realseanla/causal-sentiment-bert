Experiments show that the performance of CDCL solvers can be significantly boosted by embedding domain-specific heuristics, especially on large real-world problems. However, a proper integration of such criteria in off-the-shelf CDCL implementations is not obvious. In this paper, we distill the key ingredients that drive the search of CDCL solvers, and propose a general framework for designing and implementing new heuristics. We implemented our strategy in an ASP solver, and we experimented on two industrial domains. On hard problem instances, state-of-the-art implementations fail to find any solution in acceptable time, whereas our implementation is very successful and finds all solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 09:13:26 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05190v1", "Paper presented at the 1st Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming (TAASP 2016), Klagenfurt, Austria, 26 September 2016, 15 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 1st Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming (TAASP 2016), Klagenfurt, Austria, 26 September 2016, 15 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["carmine dodaro", "philip gasteiger", "nicola leone", "benjamin musitsch", "francesco ricca", "konstantin schekotihin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05190"}
