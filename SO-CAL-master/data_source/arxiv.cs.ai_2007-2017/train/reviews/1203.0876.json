Bangla is the second most popular script and language in the Indian subcontinent and the fifth most popular language in the world. The feature set developed for representing handwritten Bangla numerals here includes 24 shadow features, 16 centroid features and 36 longest-run features. On experimentation with a database of 6000 samples, the technique yields an average recognition rate of 96.67% evaluated after three-fold cross validation of results. It is useful for applications related to OCR of handwritten Bangla Digit and can also be extended to include OCR of handwritten characters of Bangla alphabet.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Mar 2012 12:06:54 GMT  (250kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0876v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["subhadip basu", "nibaran das", "ram sarkar", "mahantapas kundu", "mita nasipuri", "dipak kumar basu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.0876"}
