The method, named EXPected Similarity Estimation (EXPoSE), is kernel-based and able to efficiently compute the similarity between new data points and the distribution of regular data. The estimator is formulated as an inner product with a reproducing kernel Hilbert space embedding and makes no assumption about the type or shape of the underlying data distribution. We show that offline (batch) learning with EXPoSE can be done in linear time and online (incremental) learning takes constant time per instance and model update. Furthermore, EXPoSE can make predictions in constant time, while it requires only constant memory. In addition we propose different methodologies for concept drift adaptation on evolving data streams. On several real datasets we demonstrate that our approach can compete with state of the art algorithms for anomaly detection while being significant faster than techniques with the same discriminant power.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 13:56:59 GMT  (3428kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06602v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Apr 2016 12:37:33 GMT  (3431kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06602v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 13:48:17 GMT  (3431kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06602v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["markus schneider", "wolfgang ertel", "fabio ramos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06602"}
