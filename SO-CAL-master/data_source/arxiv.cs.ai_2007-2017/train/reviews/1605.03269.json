These regulation can be depicted in the Bayesian framework, that is why cognitive agents are able to generate behaviours with subtle differences according to their emotion or recognize the emotion by perception. A novel recurrent neural network called recurrent neural network with parametric bias units (RNNPB) runs in three modes, constructing a two-level emotion regulated learning model, was further applied to testify this theory in two different cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 03:22:13 GMT  (1553kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03269v1", "Accepted at The 5th International Conference on Data-Driven Control and Learning Systems. 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at The 5th International Conference on Data-Driven Control and Learning Systems. 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["junpei zhong", "rony novianto", "mingjun dai", "xinzheng zhang", "angelo cangelosi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.03269"}
