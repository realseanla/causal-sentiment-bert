This issue is particularly challenging for understanding casual and correlational relationships between events. While this topic has received a lot of interest in the NLP community, research has been hindered by the lack of a proper evaluation framework. This paper attempts to address this problem with a new framework for evaluating story understanding and script learning: the 'Story Cloze Test'. This test requires a system to choose the correct ending to a four-sentence story. We created a new corpus of ~50k five-sentence commonsense stories, ROCStories, to enable this evaluation. This corpus is unique in two ways: (1) it captures a rich set of causal and temporal commonsense relations between daily events, and (2) it is a high quality collection of everyday life stories that can also be used for story generation. Experimental evaluation shows that a host of baselines and state-of-the-art models based on shallow language understanding struggle to achieve a high score on the Story Cloze Test. We discuss these implications for script and story learning, and offer suggestions for deeper language understanding.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 17:15:10 GMT  (607kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01696v1", "In Proceedings of the 2016 North American Chapter of the ACL (NAACL HLT), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of the 2016 North American Chapter of the ACL (NAACL HLT), 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["nasrin mostafazadeh", "nathanael chambers", "xiaodong he", "devi parikh", "dhruv batra", "lucy vanderwende", "pushmeet kohli", "james allen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01696"}
