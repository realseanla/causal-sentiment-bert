We assume that users and their seen resources are vectors in the multidimensional space of the categories of the resources. Knowing this space, we propose an algorithm based on a Kalman filter to track users and to predict the best prediction of their future position in the recommendation space.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 11:07:09 GMT  (365kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3280v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["samuel nowakowski", "c\\'edric bernier", "anne boyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.3280"}
