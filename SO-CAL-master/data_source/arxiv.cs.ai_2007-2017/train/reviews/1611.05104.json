In recent years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence models in general, and LSTMs in particular. We propose and analyze a series of architectural modifications for LSTM networks resulting in improved performance for text classification datasets. We observe compounding improvements on traditional LSTMs using Monte Carlo test-time model averaging, deep vector averaging (DVA), and residual connections, along with four other suggested modifications. Our analysis provides a simple, reliable, and high quality baseline model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 00:53:01 GMT  (591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05104v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 17 Dec 2016 06:47:05 GMT  (591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05104v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["shayne longpre", "sabeek pradhan", "caiming xiong", "richard socher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05104"}
