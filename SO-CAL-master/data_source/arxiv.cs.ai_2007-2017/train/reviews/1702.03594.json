In those cases, genetic algorithms present a fast and unsuitable convergence.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Feb 2017 23:23:17 GMT  (177kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03594v1", "27 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["andr\\'es herrera-poyatos", "francisco herrera"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03594"}
