{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-May-2015", "title": "LeoPARD --- A Generic Platform for the Implementation of Higher-Order Reasoners", "abstract": "LeoPARD supports the implementation of knowledge representation and reasoning tools for higher-order logic(s). It combines a sophisticated data structure layer (polymorphically typed {\\lambda}-calculus with nameless spine notation, explicit substitutions, and perfect term sharing) with an ambitious multi-agent blackboard architecture (supporting prover parallelism at the term, clause, and search level). Further features of LeoPARD include a parser for all TPTP dialects, a command line interpreter, and generic means for the integration of external reasoners.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 May 2015 08:54:19 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01629v1", "6 pages, to appear in the proceedings of CICM'2015 conference"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, to appear in the proceedings of CICM'2015 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.MA cs.MS", "authors": ["max wisniewski", "alexander steen", "christoph benzm\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.01629"}
