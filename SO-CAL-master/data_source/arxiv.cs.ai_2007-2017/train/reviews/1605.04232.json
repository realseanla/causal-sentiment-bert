Predictions of prominent AI researchers vary broadly from very pessimistic predictions of Andrew Ng to much more moderate predictions of Geoffrey Hinton and optimistic predictions of Shane Legg, DeepMind cofounder. Given huge rate of progress in recent years and this broad range of predictions of AI experts, AI safety questions are also discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 17:49:24 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04232v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 09:29:12 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04232v2", "version 2 includes grant information"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vladimir shakirov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04232"}
