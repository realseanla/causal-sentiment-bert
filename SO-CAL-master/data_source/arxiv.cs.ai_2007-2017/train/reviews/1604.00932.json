One formulation of the CSP is as the problem of deciding, given a pair (G,H) of relational structures, whether or not there is a homomorphism from the first structure to the second structure. The CSP is in general NP-hard; a common way to restrict this problem is to fix the second structure H, so that each structure H gives rise to a problem CSP(H). The problem family CSP(H) has been studied using an algebraic approach, which links the algorithmic and complexity properties of each problem CSP(H) to a set of operations, the so-called polymorphisms of H. Certain types of polymorphisms are known to imply the polynomial-time tractability of $CSP(H)$, and others are conjectured to do so. This article systematically studies---for various classes of polymorphisms---the computational complexity of deciding whether or not a given structure H admits a polymorphism from the class. Among other results, we prove the NP-completeness of deciding a condition conjectured to characterize the tractable problems CSP(H), as well as the NP-completeness of deciding if CSP(H) has bounded width.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 16:18:16 GMT  (953kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00932v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 6 Jan 2017 02:55:16 GMT  (958kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00932v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI", "authors": ["hubie chen", "benoit larose"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00932"}
