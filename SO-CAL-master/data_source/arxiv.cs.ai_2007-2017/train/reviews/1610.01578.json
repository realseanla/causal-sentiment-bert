There are many effective methods for signature verification taking into account dynamics of a signing process. Methods based on partitioning take a very important place among them. In this paper we propose a new approach to signature partitioning. Its most important feature is the possibility of selecting and processing of hybrid partitions in order to increase a precision of the test signature analysis. Partitions are formed by a combination of vertical and horizontal sections of the signature. Vertical sections correspond to the initial, middle, and final time moments of the signing process. In turn, horizontal sections correspond to the signature areas associated with high and low pen velocity and high and low pen pressure on the surface of a graphics tablet. Our previous research on vertical and horizontal sections of the dynamic signature (created independently) led us to develop the algorithm presented in this paper. Selection of sections, among others, allows us to define the stability of the signing process in the partitions, promoting signature areas of greater stability (and vice versa). In the test of the proposed method two databases were used: public MCYT-100 and paid BioSecure.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 19:32:55 GMT  (591kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01578v1", "34 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "34 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["krzysztof cpalka", "marcin zalasinski", "leszek rutkowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01578"}
