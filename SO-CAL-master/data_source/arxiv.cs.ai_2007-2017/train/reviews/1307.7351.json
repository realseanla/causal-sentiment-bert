One possible way of overcoming this situation and designing \"knowledgeable\" robots is to rely on the interaction with the user. We propose a multi-modal interaction framework that allows to effectively acquire knowledge about the environment where the robot operates. In particular, in this paper we present a rich representation framework that can be automatically built from the metric map annotated with the indications provided by the user. Such a representation, allows then the robot to ground complex referential expressions for motion commands and to devise topological navigation plans to achieve the target locations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jul 2013 10:45:57 GMT  (2012kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7351v1", "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics Workshop at ICLP 2013"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 16:54:15 GMT  (2012kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7351v2", "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics Workshop at ICLP 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics Workshop at ICLP 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["emanuele bastianelli", "domenico bloisi", "roberto capobianco", "guglielmo gemignani", "luca iocchi", "daniele nardi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7351"}
