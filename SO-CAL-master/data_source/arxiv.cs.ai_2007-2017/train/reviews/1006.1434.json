New technology provides opportunities for very-high-speed computation and uncovers problems obstructing the wide-spread use of this new capability. The Computation Modeling community may be able to offer solutions to these cross-boundary research problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 01:17:00 GMT  (119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1434v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["a steven younger", "emmett redd"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.1434"}
