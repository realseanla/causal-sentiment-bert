The proposed model is called Controller-Agents for Constraints Solving (CACS). This model is intended to be used which is an emerged field from the integration between two paradigms of different nature: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the Constraint Satisfaction Problem paradigm (CSP) where all constraints are treated in central manner as a black-box. This model allows grouping constraints to form a subset that will be treated together as a local problem inside the controller. Using this model allows also handling non-binary constraints easily and directly so that no translating of constraints into binary ones is needed. This paper presents the implementation outlines of a prototype of DCSP solver, its usage methodology and overview of the CACS application for timetabling problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 13:40:43 GMT  (396kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0590v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sami al-maqtari", "habib abdulrab", "eduard babkin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0590"}
