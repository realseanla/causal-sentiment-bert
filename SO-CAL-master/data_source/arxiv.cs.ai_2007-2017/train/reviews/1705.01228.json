{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-May-2017", "title": "A Versatile, Sound Tool for Simplifying Definitions", "abstract": "We present a tool, simplify-defun, that transforms the definition of a given function into a simplified definition of a new function, providing a proof checked by ACL2 that the old and new functions are equivalent. When appropriate it also generates termination and guard proofs for the new function. We explain how the tool is engineered so that these proofs will succeed. Examples illustrate its utility, in particular for program transformation in synthesis and verification.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 May 2017 01:49:29 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01228v1", "In Proceedings ACL2Workshop 2017,arXiv:1705.00766"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings ACL2Workshop 2017,arXiv:1705.00766", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["alessandro coglio", "matt kaufmann", "eric w smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01228"}
