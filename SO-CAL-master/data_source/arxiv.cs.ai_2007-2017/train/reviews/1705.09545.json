The use of preprocessing to transform the graph representing the QUBO problem into a smaller equivalent graph is important for improving solution quality and time for both exact and metaheuristic algorithms and is a step towards mapping large scale QUBO to hardware graphs used in quantum annealing computers. In an earlier paper (Lewis and Glover, 2016) a set of rules was introduced that achieved significant QUBO reductions as verified through computational testing. Here this work is extended with additional rules that provide further reductions that succeed in exactly solving 10% of the benchmark QUBO problems. An algorithm and associated data structures to efficiently implement the entire set of rules is detailed and computational experiments are reported that demonstrate their efficacy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 11:59:49 GMT  (702kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09545v1", "30 pages + 6 pages of Appendices"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages + 6 pages of Appendices", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fred glover", "mark lewis", "gary kochenberger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09545"}
