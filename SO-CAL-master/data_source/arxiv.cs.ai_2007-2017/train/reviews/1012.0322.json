The use of decision tree (DT) models assists experts to interpret causal relations and find factors of the uncertainty. Bayesian averaging also allows experts to estimate the uncertainty accurately when a priori information on the favored structure of DTs is available. Then an expert can select a single DT model, typically the Maximum a Posteriori model, for interpretation purposes. Unfortunately, a priori information on favored structure of DTs is not always available. For this reason, we suggest a new prior on DTs for the Bayesian MCMC technique. We also suggest a new procedure of selecting a single DT and describe an application scenario. In our experiments on the Short-Term Conflict Alert data our technique outperforms the existing Bayesian techniques in predictive accuracy of the selected single DTs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 21:08:04 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0322v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vitaly schetinin", "jonathan fieldsend", "derek partridge", "wojtek krzanowski", "richard everson", "trevor bailey", "adolfo hernandez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.0322"}
