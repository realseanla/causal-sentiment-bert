In addition to that, the data used by the applications become richer. They are now represented by a set of complex and structured objects, instead of simple numerical matrixes. The purpose of our algorithm is to do feature selection on rich data, called Boolean Symbolic Objects (BSOs). These objects are described by multivalued features. The BSOs are considered as higher level units which can model complex data, such as cluster of individuals, aggregated data or taxonomies. In this paper we will introduce a new feature selection criterion for BSOs, and we will explain how we improved its complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 May 2014 05:02:53 GMT  (837kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0647v1", "20 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["djamal ziani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0647"}
