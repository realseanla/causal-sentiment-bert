Some studies in psychology and philosophy approach it from an inner perspective in terms of experiences and percepts. Others such as neurobiology or connectionist-machines approach it externally by viewing the mind as complex circuit of neurons where each neuron is a primitive binary circuit. In this paper, we also model the mind as a place where a circuit grows, starting as a collection of primitive components at birth and then builds up incrementally in a bottom up fashion. A new node is formed by a simple composition of prior nodes when we undergo a repeated experience that can be described by that composition. Unlike neural networks, however, these circuits take \"concepts\" or \"percepts\" as inputs and outputs. Thus the growing circuits can be likened to a growing collection of lambda expressions that are built on top of one another in an attempt to compress the sensory input as a heuristic to bound its Kolmogorov Complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 04:20:03 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0088v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 17 Mar 2012 19:32:10 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0088v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.FL", "authors": ["rina panigrahy", "li zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.0088"}
