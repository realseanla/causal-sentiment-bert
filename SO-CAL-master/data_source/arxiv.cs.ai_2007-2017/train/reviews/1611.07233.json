However, we pay for their high compression rate with visual artifacts degrading the user experience. Deep convolutional neural networks have become a widespread tool to address high-level computer vision tasks very successfully. Recently, they have found their way into the areas of low-level computer vision and image processing to solve regression problems mostly with relatively shallow networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 10:11:58 GMT  (4710kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07233v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.GR cs.IR cs.MM", "authors": ["lukas cavigelli", "pascal hager", "luca benini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07233"}
