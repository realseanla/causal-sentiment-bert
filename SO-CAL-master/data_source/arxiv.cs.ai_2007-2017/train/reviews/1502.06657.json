In this paper, we present the efforts at Turn on how to best allocate campaign budget so that the advertiser or campaign-level ROI is maximized. To do this, it is crucial to be able to correctly determine the performance of sub-campaigns. This determination is highly related to the action-attribution problem, i.e. to be able to find out the set of ads, and hence the sub-campaigns that provided them to a user, that an action should be attributed to. For this purpose, we employ both last-touch (last ad gets all credit) and multi-touch (many ads share the credit) attribution methodologies. We present the algorithms deployed at Turn for the attribution problem, as well as their parallel implementation on the large advertiser performance datasets. We conclude the paper with our empirical comparison of last-touch and multi-touch attribution-based budget allocation in a real online advertising setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 00:09:05 GMT  (125kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06657v1", "This paper has been published in ADKDD 2014, August 24, New York City, New York, U.S.A"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper has been published in ADKDD 2014, August 24, New York City, New York, U.S.A", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sahin cem geyik", "abhishek saxena", "ali dasdan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.06657"}
