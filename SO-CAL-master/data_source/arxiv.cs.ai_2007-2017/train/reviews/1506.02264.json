In some cases end-to-end learning of the perceptual and cognitive sub-tasks can be more difficult than learning each sub-task individually. In other cases such end-to-end learning can be very efficient. As end-to-end learning is becoming more prevalent in AI, it is important to understand when this approach can work efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 13:44:15 GMT  (494kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02264v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 12:18:48 GMT  (459kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02264v2", "To appear in AAAI 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["yedid hoshen", "shmuel peleg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02264"}
