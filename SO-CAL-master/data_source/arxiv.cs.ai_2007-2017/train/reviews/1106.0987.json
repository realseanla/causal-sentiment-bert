In this paper, we propose nearest prime simplicial complex approaches (NSC) by utilizing persistent homology to capture such structures. Assuming that each class is represented with a prime simplicial complex, we classify unlabeled samples based on the nearest projection distances from the samples to the simplicial complexes. We also extend the extrapolation ability of these complexes with a projection constraint term. Experiments in simulated and practical datasets indicate that compared with several published algorithms, the proposed NSC approaches achieve promising performance without losing the structure representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Jun 2011 08:32:16 GMT  (2180kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0987v1", "16pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CG cs.CV", "authors": ["junping zhang", "ziyu xie", "stan z li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0987"}
