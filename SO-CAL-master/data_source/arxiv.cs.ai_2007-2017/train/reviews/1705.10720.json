Much work on the AI control problem has been focused on constructing AI goals that are safe even for such AIs. This paper looks at an alternative approach: defining a general concept of `low impact'. The aim is to ensure that a powerful AI which implements low impact will not modify the world extensively, even if it is given a simple or dangerous goal. The paper proposes various ways of defining and grounding low impact, and discusses methods for ensuring that the AI can still be allowed to have a (desired) impact despite the restriction. The end of the paper addresses known issues with this approach and avenues for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 16:15:16 GMT  (1174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10720v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stuart armstrong", "benjamin levinstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10720"}
