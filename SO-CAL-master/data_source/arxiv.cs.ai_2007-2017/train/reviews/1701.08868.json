Unlike (conditional) mutual information, which is always non-negative, interaction information can be negative. We utilize this property to find the direction of causal influences among variables in a triangle topology under some mild assumptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 23:01:15 GMT  (664kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08868v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amiremad ghassami", "negar kiyavash"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08868"}
