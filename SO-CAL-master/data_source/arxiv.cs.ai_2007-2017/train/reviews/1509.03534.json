In this paper, we present an add-on to the HOL4 proof assistant and an adaptation of the HOLyHammer system that provides machine learning-based premise selection and automated reasoning also for HOL4. We efficiently record the HOL4 dependencies and extract features from the theorem statements, which form a basis for premise selection. HOLyHammer transforms the HOL4 statements in the various TPTP-ATP proof formats, which are then processed by the ATPs. We discuss the different evaluation settings: ATPs, accessible lemmas, and premise numbers. We measure the performance of HOLyHammer on the HOL4 standard library. The results are combined accordingly and compared with the HOL Light experiments, showing a comparably high quality of predictions. The system directly benefits HOL4 users by automatically finding proofs dependencies that can be reconstructed by Metis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 14:31:05 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03534v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thibault gauthier", "cezary kaliszyk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03534"}
