The system supports different scenario configurations based on historical data. The responses presented by the Virtual-Suspect are selected based on the psychological state of the suspect, which can be configured as well. Furthermore, each interrogator's statement affects the Virtual-Suspect's current psychological state, which may lead the interrogation in different directions. In addition, the model takes into account the context in which the statements are made. Experiments with 24 subjects demonstrate that the Virtual-Suspect's behavior is similar to that of a human who plays the role of the suspect.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 06:43:51 GMT  (1444kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09505v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["moshe bitan", "galit nahari", "zvi nisin", "ariel roth", "sarit kraus"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.09505"}
