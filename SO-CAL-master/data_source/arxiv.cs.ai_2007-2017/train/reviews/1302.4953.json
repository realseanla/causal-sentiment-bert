Nearly almost all logics of probability that have been proposed in the literature are based on classical two-valued logic. After making clear the differences between fuzzy logic and probability theory, here we propose a {em fuzzy} logic of probability for which completeness results (in a probabilistic sense) are provided. The main idea behind this approach is that probability values of crisp propositions can be understood as truth-values of some suitable fuzzy propositions associated to the crisp ones. Moreover, suggestions and examples of how to extend the formalism to cope with conditional probabilities and with other uncertainty formalisms are also provided.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:03 GMT  (557kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4953v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["petr hajek", "lluis godo", "francesc esteva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4953"}
