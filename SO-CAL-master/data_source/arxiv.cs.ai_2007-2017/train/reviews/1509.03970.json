The subjective perception of pattern complexity is correlated to algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Chaitin) complexity as defined in computer science, but also to the frequency of naturally occurring patterns. However, the possible mediational role of natural frequencies in the perception of algorithmic complexity remains unclear. Here we reanalyze Hsu et al. (2010) through a mediational analysis, and complement their results in a new experiment. We conclude that human perception of complexity seems partly shaped by natural scenes statistics, thereby establishing a link between the perception of complexity and the effect of natural scene statistics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Sep 2015 07:34:46 GMT  (285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03970v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["nicolas gauvrit", "fernando soler-toscano", "hector zenil"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03970"}
