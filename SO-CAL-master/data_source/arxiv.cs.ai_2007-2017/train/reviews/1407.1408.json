GFODDs generalize function-free first order logic and include numerical values and numerical generalizations of existential and universal quantification. Previous work presented heuristic inference algorithms for GFODDs. In this paper, we study the complexity of the evaluation problem, the satisfiability problem, and the equivalence problem for GFODDs under the assumption that the size of the intended model is given with the problem, a restriction that guarantees decidability. Our results provide a complete characterization placing these problems within the polynomial hierarchy. The same characterization applies to the corresponding restriction of problems in first order logic, giving an interesting new avenue for efficient inference when the number of objects is bounded. Our results show that for $\\Sigma_k$ formulas, and for corresponding GFODDs, evaluation and satisfiability are $\\Sigma_k^p$ complete, and equivalence is $\\Pi_{k+1}^p$ complete. For $\\Pi_k$ formulas evaluation is $\\Pi_k^p$ complete, satisfiability is one level higher and is $\\Sigma_{k+1}^p$ complete, and equivalence is $\\Pi_{k+1}^p$ complete.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Jul 2014 14:11:46 GMT  (604kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1408v1", "A short version of this paper appears in AAAI 2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Feb 2015 17:10:55 GMT  (599kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1408v2", "A short version of this paper appears in AAAI 2014.
