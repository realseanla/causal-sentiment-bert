Algebraic properties of these calculi have several implications on reasoning algorithms. But what exactly is a qualitative calculus? And to which extent do the qualitative calculi proposed meet these demands? The literature provides various answers to the first question but only few facts about the second. In this paper we identify the minimal requirements to binary spatio-temporal calculi and we discuss the relevance of the according axioms for representation and reasoning. We also analyze existing qualitative calculi and provide a classification involving different notions of a relation algebra.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 May 2013 10:15:18 GMT  (99kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7345v1", "COSIT 2013 paper including supplementary material"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Sep 2013 11:59:17 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7345v2", "COSIT 2013 paper including supplementary material"]], "COMMENTS": "COSIT 2013 paper including supplementary material", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["frank dylla", "till mossakowski", "thomas schneider", "diedrich wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7345"}
