Various methods have been proposed by Loui and Kyburg to solve this problem in a way that is both intuitively appealing and justifiable within Kyburg's framework. The scheme proposed in this paper leads to stronger statistical assertions without sacrificing too much of the intuitive appeal of Kyburg's latest proposal.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:31:51 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5732v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["b\\\"ulent murtezao\\u{g}lu", "henry e kyburg jr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5732"}
