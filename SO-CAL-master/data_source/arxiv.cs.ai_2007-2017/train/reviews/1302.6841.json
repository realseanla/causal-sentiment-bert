There exists a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (TMSs), which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge, to provide well-founded explanation for their conclusions, and to detect and handle contradictions. TMSs incorporating measure of uncertainty are called Belief Maintenance Systems (BMSs). This paper describes how a BMS based on probabilistic logic can be applied to BBNs, thus introducing a new class of BBNs, called Ignorant Belief Networks, able to incrementally deal with partially specified conditional dependencies, to provide explanations, and to detect and handle contradictions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:22 GMT  (1034kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6841v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco ramoni", "alberto riva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6841"}
