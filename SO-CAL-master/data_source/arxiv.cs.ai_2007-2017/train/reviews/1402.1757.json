The task is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process, and a reinforcement learning solution is developed. Each agent generates its own policy from Markov chains, and policies are exchanged only when agents occupy the same or adjacent nodes. This constraint on policy exchange models sparse communication conditions over large, unstructured environments. Empirical results provide perspectives on convergence properties, agent cooperation, and generalization of learned patrolling policies to new instances of the task. The emergent behavior indicates learned coordination strategies between heterogeneous agents for patrolling large, unstructured regions as well as the ability to generalize to dynamic variation in node visitation requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 20:51:00 GMT  (535kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1757v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["tao mao", "laura ray"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.1757"}
