In this document we introduce the predictron architecture. The predictron consists of a fully abstract model, represented by a Markov reward process, that can be rolled forward multiple \"imagined\" planning steps. Each forward pass of the predictron accumulates internal rewards and values over multiple planning depths. The predictron is trained end-to-end so as to make these accumulated values accurately approximate the true value function. We applied the predictron to procedurally generated random mazes and a simulator for the game of pool. The predictron yielded significantly more accurate predictions than conventional deep neural network architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Dec 2016 06:47:15 GMT  (962kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08810v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 14:57:31 GMT  (1537kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08810v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 09:21:54 GMT  (1303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08810v3", "Camera-ready version, ICML 2017, with supplement"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["david silver", "hado van hasselt", "matteo hessel", "tom schaul", "arthur guez", "tim harley", "gabriel dulac-arnold", "david p reichert", "neil rabinowitz", "andr\u00e9 barreto", "thomas degris"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.08810"}
