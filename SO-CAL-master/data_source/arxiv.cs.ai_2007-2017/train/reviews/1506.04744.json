In this work, we explore linguistic cues that presage such transitions by studying dyadic interactions in an online strategy game where players form alliances and break those alliances through betrayal. We characterize friendships that are unlikely to last and examine temporal patterns that foretell betrayal.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 20:00:29 GMT  (858kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04744v1", "To appear at ACL 2015. 10pp, 4 fig.
