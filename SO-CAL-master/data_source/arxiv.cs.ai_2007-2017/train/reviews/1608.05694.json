The main problem following the discussion is the problem to find and describe a language structure for external and internal flow of information of companies. We anticipate that the language structure of external and internal base flows determine the structure of companies. In the structure modeling of an abstract industrial company an internal base flow of information is constructed as certain flow of words composed on the theoretical parts-processes-actions language. The language of procedures is found for an external base flow of information for an insurance company. The formal stochastic grammar for the language of procedures is found by statistical methods and is used in understanding the tendencies of the health care industry. We present the model of human communications as a random walk on the semantic tree", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 18:50:21 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05694v1", "40 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "40 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vladislav b kovchegov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05694"}
