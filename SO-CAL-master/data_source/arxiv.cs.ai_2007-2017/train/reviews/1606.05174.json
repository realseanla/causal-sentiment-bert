While DRL agents perform well in practice we are still lacking the tools to analayze their performance. In this work we present the Semi-Aggregated MDP (SAMDP) model. A model best suited to describe policies exhibiting both spatial and temporal hierarchies. We describe its advantages for analyzing trained policies over other modeling approaches, and show that under the right state representation, like that of DQN agents, SAMDP can help to identify skills. We detail the automatic process of creating it from recorded trajectories, up to presenting it on t-SNE maps. We explain how to evaluate its fitness and show surprising results indicating high compatibility with the policy at hand. We conclude by showing how using the SAMDP model, an extra performance gain can be squeezed from the agent.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 13:09:16 GMT  (1904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05174v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nir baram", "tom zahavy", "shie mannor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05174"}
