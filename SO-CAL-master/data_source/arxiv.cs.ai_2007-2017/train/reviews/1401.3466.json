Forming effective coalitions is a major research challenge in the field of multi-agent systems. Central to this endeavour is the problem of determining which of the many possible coalitions to form in order to achieve some goal. This usually requires calculating a value for every possible coalition, known as the coalition value, which indicates how beneficial that coalition would be if it was formed. Once these values are calculated, the agents usually need to find a combination of coalitions, in which every agent belongs to exactly one coalition, and by which the overall outcome of the system is maximized. However, this coalition structure generation problem is extremely challenging due to the number of possible solutions that need to be examined, which grows exponentially with the number of agents involved. To date, therefore, many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem using different techniques ranging from dynamic programming, to integer programming, to stochastic search all of which suffer from major limitations relating to execution time, solution quality, and memory requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:23:56 GMT  (3867kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3466v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["talal rahwan", "sarvapali dyanand ramchurn", "nicholas robert jennings", "rea giovannucci"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3466"}
