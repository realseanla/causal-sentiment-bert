In addition to the well-used steepest descent and neighboring search, we perform a chase and escape game on the \"landscape\" of the cost function. We have created a concrete algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem. Our preliminary test indicates a possibility that this new fusion of chases and escapes problem into combinatorial optimization search is fruitful.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 06:47:28 GMT  (363kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2114v1", "3 pages, 4 figures.
