It has become imperative to identify the terms used and defined in a consensual and coherent way while preserving linguistic diversity. To streamline and strengthen the process of acquisition, representation and exploitation of scenarii of train accidents, it is necessary to harmonize and standardize the terminology used by players in the security field. The research aims to significantly improve analytical activities and operations of the various safety studies, by tracking the error in system, hardware, software and human. This paper presents the contribution of ontology to modeling scenarii for rail accidents through a knowledge model based on a generic ontology and domain ontology. After a detailed presentation of the state of the art material, this article presents the first results of the developed model.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Mar 2012 19:45:43 GMT  (877kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1021v1", "7 pages, 9 figures, Journal of Computing (ISSN 2151-9617); Journal of Computing, Volume 3, Issue 7, July 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 9 figures, Journal of Computing (ISSN 2151-9617); Journal of Computing, Volume 3, Issue 7, July 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ahmed maalel", "habib hadj mabrouk", "lassad mejri", "henda hajjami ben ghezela"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.1021"}
