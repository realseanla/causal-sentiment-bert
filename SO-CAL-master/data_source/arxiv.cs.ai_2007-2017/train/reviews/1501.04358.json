If learning about a system reflects a decrease in uncertainty, then a plausible intuition is that learning should be accompanied by a decrease in the entropy of the organism's actions and/or perceptual states. To address whether this intuition is valid, I examined an artificial organism -- a simple robot -- that learned to navigate in an arena and analyzed the entropy of the outcome variables action, state, and reward. Entropy did indeed decrease in the initial stages of learning, but two factors complicated the scenario: (1) the introduction of new options discovered during the learning process and (2) the shifting patterns of perceptual and environmental states resulting from changes to the robot's learned movement strategies. These factors lead to a subsequent increase in entropy as the agent learned. I end with a discussion of the utility of information-based characterizations of learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Jan 2015 21:49:22 GMT  (520kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04358v1", "14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"], ["v2", "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 01:13:52 GMT  (520kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04358v2", "14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"], ["v3", "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 01:16:18 GMT  (520kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04358v3", "14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["paul e smaldino"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04358"}
