To determine a reasonable trade-off between cost and value, we build an empirical model of the value obtained through computation, and apply this model to estimate the value of computation for quite different problems. In particular, we investigate this trade-off for the problem of constructing policies for decision problems represented as influence diagrams. We show how two features of our anytime algorithm provide reasonable estimates of the value of computation in this domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:58:47 GMT  (267kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6706v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael c horsch", "david l poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6706"}
