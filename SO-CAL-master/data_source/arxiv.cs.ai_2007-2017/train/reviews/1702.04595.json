When classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 13:25:26 GMT  (7723kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04595v1", "ICLR2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["luisa m zintgraf", "taco s cohen", "tameem adel", "max welling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.04595"}
