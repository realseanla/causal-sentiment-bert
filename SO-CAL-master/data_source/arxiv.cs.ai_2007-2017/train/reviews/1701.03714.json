In doing so, we consider two possible interpretations of the consequence relation, and describe which axioms are met by ASPIC+ under each of these interpretations. We then consider the links between these axioms and the rationality postulates. Our results indicate that argument based reasoning as characterised by ASPIC+ is - according to the axioms of [9] - non-cumulative and non-monotonic, and therefore weaker than the weakest non-monotonic reasoning systems they considered possible. This weakness underpins ASPIC+'s success in modelling other reasoning systems, and we conclude by considering the relationship between ASPIC+ and other weak logical systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 16:33:52 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03714v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["zimi li", "nir oren", "simon parsons"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.03714"}
