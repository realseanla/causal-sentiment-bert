The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms. Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 14:49:30 GMT  (1688kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.6841v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["percy liang", "michael i jordan", "dan klein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1109.6841"}
