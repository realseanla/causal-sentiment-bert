Recently, different query languages and stream processing/reasoning engines were proposed in different communities. However, due to a lack of theoretical foundations, the expressivity and semantics of these diverse approaches are given only informally. Towards clear specifications and means for analytic study, a formal framework is needed to define their semantics in precise terms. To this end, we present a first step towards an ideal semantics that allows for exact descriptions and comparisons of stream reasoning systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 13:27:23 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05365v1", "International Workshop on Reactive Concepts in Knowledge Representation (ReactKnow 2014), co-located with the 21st European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014).
