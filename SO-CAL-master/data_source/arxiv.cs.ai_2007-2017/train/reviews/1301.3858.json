We argue that a rational decision maker facing an uncertain decision problem in which the uncertainty is expressed qualitatively should behave so as to maximize \"qualitative expected utility.\" Our axiomatization of the qualitative utility is similar to the axiomatization developed by von Neumann and Morgenstern for probabilistic lotteries. We compare our results with other recent results in qualitative decision making.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:50:22 GMT  (362kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3858v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["phan h giang", "prakash p shenoy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3858"}
