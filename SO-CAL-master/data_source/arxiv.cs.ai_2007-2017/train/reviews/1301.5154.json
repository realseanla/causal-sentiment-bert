In this paper, we argue that to apply rationality result of belief dynamics theory to various practical problems, it should be generalized in two respects: first of all, it should allow a certain part of belief to be declared as immutable; and second, the belief state need not be deductively closed. Such a generalization of belief dynamics, referred to as base dynamics, is presented, along with the concept of a generalized revision algorithm for Horn knowledge bases. We show that Horn knowledge base dynamics has interesting connection with kernel change and abduction. Finally, we also show that both variants are rational in the sense that they satisfy certain rationality postulates stemming from philosophical works on belief dynamics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 11:30:37 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.5154v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["radhakrishnan delhibabu", "gerhard lakemeyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.5154"}
