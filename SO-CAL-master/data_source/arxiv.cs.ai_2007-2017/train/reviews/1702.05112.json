These solutions form the basis of a specialized digital ecosystem OntoMath which consists of the ontology of the logical structure of mathematical documents Mocassin and ontology of mathematical knowledge OntoMathPRO, tools of text analysis, recommender system and other applications to manage mathematical knowledge. The studies are in according to the ideas of creating a distributed system of interconnected repositories of digitized versions of mathematical documents and project to create a World Digital Mathematical Library.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 19:14:00 GMT  (356kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05112v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander elizarov", "alexander kirillovich", "evgeny lipachev", "olga nevzorova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05112"}
