{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-May-2014", "title": "An Algebraic Hardness Criterion for Surjective Constraint Satisfaction", "abstract": "The constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) on a relational structure B is to decide, given a set of constraints on variables where the relations come from B, whether or not there is a assignment to the variables satisfying all of the constraints; the surjective CSP is the variant where one decides the existence of a surjective satisfying assignment onto the universe of B. We present an algebraic condition on the polymorphism clone of B and prove that it is sufficient for the hardness of the surjective CSP on a finite structure B, in the sense that this problem admits a reduction from a certain fixed-structure CSP. To our knowledge, this is the first result that allows one to use algebraic information from a relational structure B to infer information on the complexity hardness of surjective constraint satisfaction on B. A corollary of our result is that, on any finite non-trivial structure having only essentially unary polymorphisms, surjective constraint satisfaction is NP-complete.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 23:23:24 GMT  (11kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4917v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 10:29:27 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4917v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["hubie chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4917"}
