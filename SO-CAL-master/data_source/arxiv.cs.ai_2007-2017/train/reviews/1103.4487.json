The most recent substantial improvement by others dates back 7 years (error rate 0.4%) . Recently we were able to significantly improve this result, using graphics cards to greatly speed up training of simple but deep MLPs, which achieved 0.35%, outperforming all the previous more complex methods. Here we report another substantial improvement: 0.31% obtained using a committee of MLPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Mar 2011 10:38:50 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4487v1", "9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["dan c cire\\c{s}an", "ueli meier", "luca m gambardella", "j\\\"urgen schmidhuber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.4487"}
