For example, JSFiddle, IPython Notebook and R-studio. Web technology enables cloud-based solutions, embedding in tutorial web pages, atractive rendering of results, web-scale cooperative development, etc. This article describes SWISH, a web front-end for Prolog. A public website exposes SWI-Prolog using SWISH, which is used to run small Prolog programs for demonstration, experimentation and education. We connected SWISH to the ClioPatria semantic web toolkit, where it allows for collaborative development of programs and queries related to a dataset as well as performing maintenance tasks on the running server and we embedded SWISH in the Learn Prolog Now! online Prolog book.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:16:31 GMT  (751kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00915v1", "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 99-113, August 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 99-113, August 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["jan wielemaker", "torbj\\\"orn lager", "fabrizio riguzzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00915"}
