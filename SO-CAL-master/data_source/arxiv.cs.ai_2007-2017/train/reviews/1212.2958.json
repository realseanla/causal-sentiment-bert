To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to fix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis with tedious computational overhead instead of searching for another distribution. Spikes or action potentials are precisely-timed changes in the ionic transport through synapses adjusting the synaptic weight, successfully modeled and developed as a memristor. Memristance value is multiples of initial resistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We try to quantize potential and resistance, as done with energy. After reviewing Planck curve for blackbody radiation, we propose the quantization equations. We introduce and prove a theorem that quantizes the resistance. Then we define the tyke showing its basic characteristics. Finally we give the basic transformations to model spiking and link an energy quantum to a tyke. Investigation shows how this perfectly models the neuron spiking, with over 97% match.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 18:15:58 GMT  (346kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2958v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Mar 2013 00:13:32 GMT  (347kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2958v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["m a el-dosuky", "m z rashad", "t t hamza", "a h el-bassiouny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.2958"}
