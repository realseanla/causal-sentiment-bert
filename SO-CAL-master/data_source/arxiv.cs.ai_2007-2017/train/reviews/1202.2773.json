For a single-agent system facing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair the failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms of time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication complexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication overhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in decentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint objectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower communication overhead than replanning from scratch.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Feb 2012 15:57:51 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.2773v1", "21 pages, 5 algorithms, 3 figures.
