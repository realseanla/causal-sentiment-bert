ResNet has won the ImageNet ILSVRC 2015 classification task, and achieved state-of-the-art performances in many computer vision tasks. However, the effect of residual learning on noisy natural language processing tasks is still not well understood. In this paper, we design a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning, and investigate its impacts on the task of distantly supervised noisy relation extraction. In contradictory to popular beliefs that ResNet only works well for very deep networks, we found that even with 9 layers of CNNs, using identity mapping could significantly improve the performance for distantly-supervised relation extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 13:56:36 GMT  (244kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08866v1", "Accepted by EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["yi yao huang", "william yang wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.08866"}
