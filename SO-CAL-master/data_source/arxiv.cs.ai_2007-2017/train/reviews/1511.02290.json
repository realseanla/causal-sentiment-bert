Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) learn and predict the tastes and preferences of users by incorporating available contextual information in the recommendation process. One of the major challenges in context-aware recommender systems research is the lack of automatic methods to obtain contextual information for these systems. Considering this scenario, in this paper, we propose to use contextual information from topic hierarchies of the items (web pages) to improve the performance of context-aware recommender systems. The topic hierarchies are constructed by an extension of the LUPI-based Incremental Hierarchical Clustering method that considers three types of information: traditional bag-of-words (technical information), and the combination of named entities (privileged information I) with domain terms (privileged information II). We evaluated the contextual information in four context-aware recommender systems. Different weights were assigned to each type of information. The empirical results demonstrated that topic hierarchies with the combination of the two kinds of privileged information can provide better recommendations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Nov 2015 03:04:02 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02290v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["camila v sundermann", "marcos a domingues", "ricardo m marcacini", "solange o rezende"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02290"}
