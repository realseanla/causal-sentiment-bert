It uses a heuristic estimation of the prior probability of beliefs to choose a bounded number of policy trees: this choice is formulated as a combinatorial optimisation problem minimising the error induced by pruning.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (411kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3474v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gabriel corona", "francois charpillet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3474"}
