We propose a deep network, which not only achieves competitive accuracy for text classification, but also exhibits compositional behavior. That is, while creating hierarchical representations of a piece of text, such as a sentence, the lower layers of the network distribute their layer-specific attention weights to individual words. In contrast, the higher layers compose meaningful phrases and clauses, whose lengths increase as the networks get deeper until fully composing the sentence.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Jul 2017 19:37:23 GMT  (677kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01555v1", "accepted to ACL2017"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted to ACL2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["hongyu guo"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.01555"}
