In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to developing an intelligent tutoring system for teaching textbook-style mathematical proofs. We characterize the particularities of the domain and discuss common ITS design models. Our approach is motivated by phenomena found in a corpus of tutorial dialogs that were collected in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment. We show how an intelligent tutor for textbook-style mathematical proofs can be built on top of an adapted assertion-level proof assistant by reusing representations and proof search strategies originally developed for automated and interactive theorem proving. The resulting prototype was successfully evaluated on a corpus of tutorial dialogs and yields good results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 06:41:20 GMT  (67kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4828v1", "In Proceedings THedu'11,arXiv:1202.4535"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings THedu'11,arXiv:1202.4535", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.MS cs.SC", "authors": ["serge autexier", "bremen", "germany)", "dominik dietrich", "bremen", "germany)", "marvin schiller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.4828"}
