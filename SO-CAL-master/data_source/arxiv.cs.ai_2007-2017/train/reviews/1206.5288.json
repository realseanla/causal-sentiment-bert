At the core of our framework is a black-box optimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidate mechanisms. Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several application domains using various objective functions. By comparing our results with known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best known mechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametric design of indirect mechanisms.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 15:16:48 GMT  (702kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5288v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["yevgeniy vorobeychik", "daniel reeves", "michael p wellman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.5288"}
