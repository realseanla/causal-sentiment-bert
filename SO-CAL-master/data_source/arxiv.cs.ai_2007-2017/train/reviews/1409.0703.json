In this case, however, abstractions are either ideas or depend on ideas in the mind of the person, making them unsuitable for mechanical manipulation. In spite of this, it is possible to define abstractions that can be processed entirely through a mechanical process. In this paper, I introduce these computable abstractions and the mechanical abstractional process that deals with them, opening the possibility for machines to perform intellectual tasks with results that are intuitively comparable to humans results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 18:29:53 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0703v1", "10 pages, submitted to Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Dec 2014 14:50:58 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0703v2", "16 pages, submitted to Theory and Applications of Models of Computation (TAMC); more detailed and straightforward presentation, added 2 examples"], ["v3", "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 13:21:52 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0703v3", "16 pages; more detailed and straightforward presentation, added 2 examples"], ["v4", "Sun, 29 Mar 2015 14:27:16 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0703v4", "17 pages; clearer and more precise motivation; clearer concepts presented; review on related works added"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, submitted to Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alejandro sanchez guinea"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0703"}
