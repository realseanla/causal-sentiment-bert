It has an action language style syntax similar to that of the EC variant Modular-E. Its semantics is given in terms of possible worlds which constitute possible evolutions of the domain, and builds on that of EFEC, an epistemic extension of EC. We also describe an ASP implementation of PEC and show the sense in which this is sound and complete.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 16:03:36 GMT  (38kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06815v1", "Technical report"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 16:17:11 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06815v2", "Technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fabio aurelio d'asaro", "antonis bikakis", "luke dickens", "rob miller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06815"}
