We offer three contributions: (1) an inference mechanism that makes explicit use of asymmetric independence to speed up computations, (2) a simplified definition of similarity networks and extensions of their theory, and (3) a generalized representation scheme that encodes more types of asymmetric independence assertions than do similarity networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:30:42 GMT  (361kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5718v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:56:18 GMT  (292kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5718v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dan geiger", "david heckerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5718"}
