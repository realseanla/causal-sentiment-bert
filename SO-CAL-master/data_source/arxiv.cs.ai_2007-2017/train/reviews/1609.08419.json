For the conventional GMM-UBM architecture, the decision is usually conducted based on the log likelihood ratio of the test utterance against the GMM of the claimed speaker and the UBM. This single-score decision is simple but tends to be sensitive to the complex variations in speech signals (e.g. text content, channel, speaking style, etc.). In this paper, we propose a decision making approach based on multiple scores derived from a set of cohort GMMs (cohort scores). Importantly, these cohort scores are not simply averaged as in conventional cohort methods; instead, we employ a powerful discriminative model as the decision maker. Experimental results show that the proposed method delivers substantial performance improvement over the baseline system, especially when a deep neural network (DNN) is used as the decision maker, and the DNN input involves some statistical features derived from the cohort scores.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 13:29:12 GMT  (1477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08419v1", "APSIPA ASC 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "APSIPA ASC 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["lantian li", "renyu wang", "gang wang", "caixia wang", "thomas fang zheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08419"}
