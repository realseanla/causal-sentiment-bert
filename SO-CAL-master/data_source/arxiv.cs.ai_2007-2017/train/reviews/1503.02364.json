NRM takes the general encoder-decoder framework: it formalizes the generation of response as a decoding process based on the latent representation of the input text, while both encoding and decoding are realized with recurrent neural networks (RNN). The NRM is trained with a large amount of one-round conversation data collected from a microblogging service. Empirical study shows that NRM can generate grammatically correct and content-wise appropriate responses to over 75% of the input text, outperforming state-of-the-arts in the same setting, including retrieval-based and SMT-based models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 02:54:29 GMT  (652kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02364v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 02:28:58 GMT  (652kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02364v2", "accepted as a full paper at ACL 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["lifeng shang", "zhengdong lu", "hang li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.02364"}
