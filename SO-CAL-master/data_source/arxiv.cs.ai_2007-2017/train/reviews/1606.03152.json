First, we show that, on summary state and action spaces, deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) outperforms Gaussian Processes methods. Summary state and action spaces lead to good performance but require pre-engineering effort, RL knowledge, and domain expertise. In order to remove the need to define such summary spaces, we show that deep RL can also be trained efficiently on the original state and action spaces. Dialogue systems based on partially observable Markov decision processes are known to require many dialogues to train, which makes them unappealing for practical deployment. We show that a deep RL method based on an actor-critic architecture can exploit a small amount of data very efficiently. Indeed, with only a few hundred dialogues collected with a handcrafted policy, the actor-critic deep learner is considerably bootstrapped from a combination of supervised and batch RL. In addition, convergence to an optimal policy is significantly sped up compared to other deep RL methods initialized on the data with batch RL. All experiments are performed on a restaurant domain derived from the Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 (DSTC2) dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 01:02:19 GMT  (53kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03152v1", "Submitted to SIGDial -- May 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 19 Jul 2016 16:20:18 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03152v2", "SIGDial 2016 (Submitted: May 2016; Accepted: Jun 30, 2016)"], ["v3", "Sat, 20 Aug 2016 21:20:21 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03152v3", "SIGDial 2016 (Submitted: May 2016; Accepted: Jun 30, 2016)"], ["v4", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 16:23:42 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03152v4", "SIGDial 2016 (Submitted: May 2016; Accepted: Jun 30, 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to SIGDial -- May 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["mehdi fatemi", "layla el asri", "hannes schulz", "jing he", "kaheer suleman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03152"}
