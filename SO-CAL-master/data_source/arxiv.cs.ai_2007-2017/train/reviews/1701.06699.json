Traditional modeling methods have employed simple parametric models and behavioral cloning. This paper adopts a method for overcoming the problem of cascading errors inherent in prior approaches, resulting in realistic behavior that is robust to trajectory perturbations. We extend Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning to the training of recurrent policies, and we demonstrate that our model outperforms rule-based controllers and maximum likelihood models in realistic highway simulations. Our model both reproduces emergent behavior of human drivers, such as lane change rate, while maintaining realistic control over long time horizons.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 00:59:42 GMT  (291kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06699v1", "8 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alex kuefler", "jeremy morton", "tim wheeler", "mykel kochenderfer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.06699"}
