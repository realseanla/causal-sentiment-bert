However, lots of uncertainty and interference exist in practical situation, especially in the battle field. It is still an open issue to model the reliability of sensor reports. Many methods are proposed based on the relationship among collected data. In this letter, we proposed a quantum mechanical approach to evaluate the reliability of sensor reports, which is based on the properties of a sensor itself. The proposed method is used to modify the combining of evidences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 01:22:15 GMT  (561kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01013v1", "13 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.OH cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["zichang he", "wen jiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01013"}
