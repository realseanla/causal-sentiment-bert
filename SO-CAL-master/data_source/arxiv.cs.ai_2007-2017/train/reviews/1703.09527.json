Detecting Humor in Spanish Tweets", "abstract": "While humor has been historically studied from a psychological, cognitive and linguistic standpoint, its study from a computational perspective is an area yet to be explored in Computational Linguistics. There exist some previous works, but a characterization of humor that allows its automatic recognition and generation is far from being specified. In this work we build a crowdsourced corpus of labeled tweets, annotated according to its humor value, letting the annotators subjectively decide which are humorous. A humor classifier for Spanish tweets is assembled based on supervised learning, reaching a precision of 84% and a recall of 69%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 12:08:46 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09527v1", "Preprint version, without referral"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint version, without referral", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["santiago castro", "mat\\'ias cubero", "diego garat", "guillermo moncecchi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09527"}
