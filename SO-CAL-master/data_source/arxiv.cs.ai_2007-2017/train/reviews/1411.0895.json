This allows high dimensional and correlated feature spaces to be used, without requiring the estimation of multiple high dimension covariance matrices. In this letter we extend the recently presented PLDA mixture model for speech recognition through a tied PLDA approach, which is better able to control the model size to avoid overfitting. We carried out experiments using the Switchboard corpus, with both mel frequency cepstral coefficient features and bottleneck feature derived from a deep neural network. Reductions in word error rate were obtained by using tied PLDA, compared with the PLDA mixture model, subspace Gaussian mixture models, and deep neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 13:11:06 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0895v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["liang lu", "steve renals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.0895"}
