A key limitation is data efficiency, with current state-of-the-art approaches requiring millions of training samples. A promising way to tackle this problem is to augment RL with learning from human demonstrations. However, human demonstration data is not yet readily available. This hinders progress in this direction. The present work addresses this problem as follows. We (i) collect and describe a large dataset of human Atari 2600 replays -- the largest and most diverse such data set publicly released to date, (ii) illustrate an example use of this dataset by analyzing the relation between demonstration quality and imitation learning performance, and (iii) outline possible research directions that are opened up by our work.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 09:08:36 GMT  (802kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10998v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vitaly kurin", "sebastian nowozin", "katja hofmann", "lucas beyer", "bastian leibe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10998"}
