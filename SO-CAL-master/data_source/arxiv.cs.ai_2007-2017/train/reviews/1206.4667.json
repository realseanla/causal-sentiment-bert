They are often used analogously to ROC curves and the area under ROC curves. It is known that PR curves vary as class skew changes. What was not recognized before this paper is that there is a region of PR space that is completely unachievable, and the size of this region depends only on the skew. This paper precisely characterizes the size of that region and discusses its implications for empirical evaluation methodology in machine learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:33:05 GMT  (377kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4667v1", "ICML2012"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Jul 2012 18:54:06 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4667v2", "ICML2012, fixed citations to use correct tech report number"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["kendrick boyd", "jesse davis", "david page", "v\u00edtor santos costa"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4667"}
