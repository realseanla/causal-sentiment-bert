{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-May-2014", "title": "Conformant Planning as a Case Study of Incremental QBF Solving", "abstract": "We consider planning with uncertainty in the initial state as a case study of incremental quantified Boolean formula (QBF) solving. We report on experiments with a workflow to incrementally encode a planning instance into a sequence of QBFs. To solve this sequence of incrementally constructed QBFs, we use our general-purpose incremental QBF solver DepQBF. Since the generated QBFs have many clauses and variables in common, our approach avoids redundancy both in the encoding phase and in the solving phase. Experimental results show that incremental QBF solving outperforms non-incremental QBF solving. Our results are the first empirical study of incremental QBF solving in the context of planning. Based on our case study, we argue that incremental QBF solving also has the potential to improve QBF-based workflows in other application domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 May 2014 14:23:50 GMT  (64kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7253v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 12:04:01 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7253v2", "revision (camera-ready, to appear in the proceedings of AISC 2014, volume 8884 of LNAI, Springer)"], ["v3", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 11:06:57 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7253v3", "added reference to extended journal article; revision (camera-ready, to appear in the proceedings of AISC 2014, volume 8884 of LNAI, Springer)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["uwe egly", "martin kronegger", "florian lonsing", "andreas pfandler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7253"}
