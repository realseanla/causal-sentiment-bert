More specifically, we describe a novel reinforcement learning framework for learning multi-hop relational paths: we use a policy-based agent with continuous states based on knowledge graph embeddings, which reasons in a KG vector space by sampling the most promising relation to extend its path. In contrast to prior work, our approach includes a reward function that takes the accuracy, diversity, and efficiency into consideration. Experimentally, we show that our proposed method outperforms a path-ranking based algorithm and knowledge graph embedding methods on Freebase and Never-Ending Language Learning datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 19:39:23 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06690v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["wenhan xiong", "thien hoang", "william yang wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.06690"}
