It is an efficient approximation of the k-means clustering algorithm. Unlike k-means it forms a hierarchy of clusters. It has been extended to address issues with sparse representations. We compare performance and quality to CLUTO using document collections. The K-tree has a low time complexity that is suitable for large document collections. This tree structure allows for efficient disk based implementations where space requirements exceed that of main memory.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 07:43:31 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0830v1", "2 pages, SIGIR 2009"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages, SIGIR 2009", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["christopher m de vries", "shlomo geva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.0830"}
