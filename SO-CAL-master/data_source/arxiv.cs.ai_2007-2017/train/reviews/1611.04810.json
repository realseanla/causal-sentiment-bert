This paper presents NOESIS, an open source framework for network data mining that provides a large collection of network analysis techniques, including the analysis of network structural properties, community detection methods, link scoring, and link prediction, as well as network visualization algorithms. It also features a complete stand-alone graphical user interface that facilitates the use of all these techniques. The NOESIS framework has been designed using solid object-oriented design principles and structured parallel programming. As a lightweight library with minimal external dependencies and a permissive software license, NOESIS can be incorporated into other software projects. Released under a BSD license, it is available from", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 12:55:49 GMT  (1004kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04810v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 14:08:42 GMT  (1004kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04810v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["v\\'ictor mart\\'inez", "fernando berzal", "juan-carlos cubero"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04810"}
