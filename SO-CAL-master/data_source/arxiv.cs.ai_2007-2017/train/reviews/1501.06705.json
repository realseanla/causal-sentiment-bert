Within this paper we will propose and present two forms of inclusion: The strict and the partial one. In order to develop this relation, we will study the case of consonant belief function. To do so, we will simulate normal distributions allowing us to model and analyze these relations. Based on that, we will determine the parameters influencing and characterizing the two forms of inclusion.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 09:23:23 GMT  (217kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06705v1", "International Conference on Information Fusion - (FUSION 2013), Jul 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "International Conference on Information Fusion - (FUSION 2013), Jul 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dorra attiaoui", "pierre-emmanuel dor\\'e", "arnaud martin", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06705"}
