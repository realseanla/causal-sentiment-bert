But most, if not all existing approaches are based on single-objective planners, and use an aggregation of the objectives to remain in the single-objective context. Divide and Evolve (DaE) is an evolutionary planner that won the temporal deterministic satisficing track at the last International Planning Competitions (IPC). Like all Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), it can easily be turned into a Pareto-based Multi-Objective EA. It is however important to validate the resulting algorithm by comparing it with the aggregation approach: this is the goal of this paper. The comparative experiments on a recently proposed benchmark set that are reported here demonstrate the usefulness of going Pareto-based in AI Planning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 May 2013 12:53:25 GMT  (194kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1169v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mostepha redouane khouadjia", "marc schoenauer", "vincent vidal", "johann dr\\'eo", "pierre sav\\'eant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1169"}
