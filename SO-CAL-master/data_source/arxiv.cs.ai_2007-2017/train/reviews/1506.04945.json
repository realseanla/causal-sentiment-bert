One approach for encoding the semantics of spatial relations within a declarative programming framework is by systems of polynomial constraints. However, solving such constraints is computationally intractable in general (i.e. the theory of real-closed fields).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 12:40:30 GMT  (9013kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04945v1", "22 pages.
