In this work we propose a methodology for tracking how ideas flow between participants throughout a debate. We use this approach in a case study of Oxford-style debates---a competitive format where the winner is determined by audience votes---and show how the outcome of a debate depends on aspects of conversational flow. In particular, we find that winners tend to make better use of a debate's interactive component than losers, by actively pursuing their opponents' points rather than promoting their own ideas over the course of the conversation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 20:00:04 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03114v1", "To appear at NAACL 2016. 5 pp, 1 fig.
