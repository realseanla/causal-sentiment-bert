New theories, techniques, algorithms have been rapidly developed. One of the most striking trends in the neutrosophic theory is the hybridization of neutrosophic set with other potential sets such as rough set, bipolar set, soft set, hesitant fuzzy set, etc. The different hybrid structure such as rough neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic rough set, bipolar neutrosophic set, single valued neutrosophic hesitant fuzzy set, etc. are proposed in the literature in a short period of time. Neutrosophic set has been a very important tool in all various areas of data mining, decision making, e-learning, engineering, medicine, social science, and some more. The book New Trends in Neutrosophic Theories and Applications focuses on theories, methods, algorithms for decision making and also applications involving neutrosophic information. Some topics deal with data mining, decision making, e-learning, graph theory, medical diagnosis, probability theory, topology, and some more.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 19:16:49 GMT  (4890kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08555v1", "424 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "424 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache", "surapati pramanik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08555"}
