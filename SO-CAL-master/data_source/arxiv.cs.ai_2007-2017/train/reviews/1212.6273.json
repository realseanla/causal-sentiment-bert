In the same light, humans must also understand the messages that are being communicated by robots, including the non-verbal ones. We conducted a web-based video study wherein participants gave interpretations on the iconic gestures and emblems that were produced by an anthropomorphic robot. Out of the 15 gestures presented, we found 6 robotic gestures that can be accurately recognized by the human observer. These were nodding, clapping, hugging, expressing anger, walking, and flying. We reviewed these gestures for their meaning from literatures in human and animal behavior. We conclude by discussing the possible implications of these gestures for the design of social robots that are aimed to have engaging interactions with humans.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Dec 2012 22:10:14 GMT  (5293kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6273v1", "21 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["john-john cabibihan", "wing-chee so", "soumo pramanik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.6273"}
