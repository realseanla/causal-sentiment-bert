It mainly occurs due to the deterioration of operating system resource, fragmentation and numerical error accumulation. A primitive method to fight against software aging is software rejuvenation. Software rejuvenation is a proactive fault management technique aimed at cleaning up the system internal state to prevent the occurrence of more severe crash failures in the future. It involves occasionally stopping the running software, cleaning its internal state and restarting it. An optimized schedule for performing the software rejuvenation has to be derived in advance because a long running application could not be put down now and then as it may lead to waste of cost. This paper proposes a method to derive an accurate and optimized schedule for rejuvenation of a web server (Apache) by using Radial Basis Function (RBF) based Feed Forward Neural Network, a variant of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Aging indicators are obtained through experimental setup involving Apache web server and clients, which acts as input to the neural network model. This method is better than existing ones because usage of RBF leads to better accuracy and speed in convergence.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Jun 2012 15:52:46 GMT  (252kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1534v1", "11 pages, 8 figures, 1 table; International Journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications (IJAIA), Vol.3, No.3, May 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8 figures, 1 table; International Journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications (IJAIA), Vol.3, No.3, May 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["g sumathi", "r raju"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1534"}
