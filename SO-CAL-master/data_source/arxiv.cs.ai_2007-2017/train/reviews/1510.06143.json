A large amount of effort has been made to develop systems that is able to extend the systems to a large scale, in the hope to make use of them on industry scale data. In this paper, we describe a system that operates at a scale orders of magnitude higher than previous works, and an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art system at the same scale, at the same time showing more robustness and more accurate results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 06:23:55 GMT  (4320kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06143v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 22:39:06 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06143v2", "The paper was uploaded by the lead author without approval by any of the coauthors and without Google's approval"], ["v3", "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 03:37:21 GMT  (4316kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06143v3", "Corrected the list of authors"], ["v4", "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 05:16:06 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06143v4", "arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn due to an irreconcilable author dispute"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["aaron q li", "amr ahmed", "mu li", "vanja josifovski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.06143"}
