The development and analysis of algorithms to find and make use of these properties is thus useful to improve the performance of modern solvers and our general understanding of SAT. In this work we show that, under the assumption that P$\\neq$NP, there are easily-recognizable sets of Boolean formulas for which it is hard to determine whether they have a backbone. We also show that, under the same assumption, there are easily-recognizable families of Boolean formulas with strong backdoors that are easy to find, for which it is hard to determine whether they are satisfiable or not.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 16:46:01 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04582v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 21:45:55 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04582v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 13 Oct 2017 17:54:53 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04582v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 15:51:57 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04582v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.LO", "authors": ["lane a hemaspaandra", "david e narv\\'aez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04582"}
