{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Mar-2017", "title": "Universal Reasoning, Rational Argumentation and Human-Machine Interaction", "abstract": "Classical higher-order logic, when utilized as a meta-logic in which various other (classical and non-classical) logics can be shallowly embedded, is well suited for realising a universal logic reasoning approach. Universal logic reasoning in turn, as envisioned already by Leibniz, may support the rigorous formalisation and deep logical analysis of rational arguments within machines. A respective universal logic reasoning framework is described and a range of exemplary applications are discussed. In the future, universal logic reasoning in combination with appropriate, controlled forms of rational argumentation may serve as a communication layer between humans and intelligent machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 15:00:57 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09620v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christoph benzm\\\"uller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09620"}
