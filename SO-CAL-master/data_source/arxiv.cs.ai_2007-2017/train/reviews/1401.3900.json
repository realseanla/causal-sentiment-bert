The satisfiability problem is shown to be undecidable for this new logic, but we introduce a very general class of schemata, called bound-linear, for which this problem becomes decidable. This result is obtained by reduction to a particular class of schemata called regular, for which we provide a sound and complete terminating proof procedure. This schemata calculus allows one to capture proof patterns corresponding to a large class of problems specified in propositional logic. We also show that the satisfiability problem becomes again undecidable for slight extensions of this class, thus demonstrating that bound-linear schemata represent a good compromise between expressivity and decidability.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:20:30 GMT  (349kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3900v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["vincent aravantinos", "ricardo caferra", "nicolas peltier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3900"}
