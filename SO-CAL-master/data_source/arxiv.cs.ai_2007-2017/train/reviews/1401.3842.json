The configuration of a feature subscription involves choosing and sequencing features from a catalogue and is subject to constraints that prevent undesirable feature interactions at run-time. When the subscription requested by a user is inconsistent, one problem is to find an optimal relaxation, which is a generalisation of the feedback vertex set problem on directed graphs, and thus it is an NP-hard task. We present several constraint programming formulations of the problem. We also present formulations using partial weighted maximum Boolean satisfiability and mixed integer linear programming. We study all these formulations by experimentally comparing them on a variety of randomly generated instances of the feature subscription problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:54:27 GMT  (356kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3842v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david lesaint", "deepak mehta", "barry o'sullivan", "luis quesada", "nic wilson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3842"}
