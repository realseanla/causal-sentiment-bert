We also discuss rapidly advancing areas of machine learning and artificial intelligence that could lead to frighteningly powerful new multi-modal social bots. Our main conclusion is that most commonly known bots are one dimensional (i.e., chatterbot), and far from deceiving serious interrogators. However, using recent advances in machine learning, it is possible to unleash incredibly powerful, human-like armies of social bots, in potentially well coordinated campaigns of deception and influence.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 04:54:47 GMT  (4165kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05143v1", "2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.CY cs.MM", "authors": ["terrence adams"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.05143"}
