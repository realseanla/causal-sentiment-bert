Contraction Hierarchies --- a very successful techniques on road graphs --- are extended in this work to support a three phase workflow by adding a fast weight customization phase and using nested dissection orders. We provide an in-depth experimental analysis on large road and game maps that clearly shows that Customizable Contraction Hierarchies are a very practicable solution even in scenarios where edge weights constantly change. We are able to prove a constant factor approximation bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 15:38:27 GMT  (306kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0402v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 12:29:17 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0402v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 09:37:36 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0402v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 08:18:28 GMT  (304kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0402v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 11:25:25 GMT  (525kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0402v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["julian dibbelt", "ben strasser", "dorothea wagner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0402"}
