A* benefits significantly from parallelism because in many applications, A* is limited by memory usage, so distributed memory implementations of A* that use all of the aggregate memory on the cluster enable problems that can not be solved by serial, single-machine implementations to be solved. We survey approaches to parallel A*, focusing on decentralized approaches to A* which partition the state space among processors. We also survey approaches to parallel, limited-memory variants of A* such as parallel IDA*.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 01:45:40 GMT  (495kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05296v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1201.3204"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1201.3204", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alex fukunaga", "adi botea", "yuu jinnai", "akihiro kishimoto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05296"}
