A relevant set of inference patterns and knowledge types are identified. By comparing the analysis results to existing representations, some insights are gained into a design approach for integrating categorical and uncertain knowledge in a context sensitive manner.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:31:41 GMT  (294kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5730v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tze-yun leong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5730"}
