Our method performs MCTS in batches, explores the Monte Carlo search tree using Thompson sampling and a convolutional network, and evaluates convnet-based rollouts on the GPU. We achieve strong win rates against open source Go programs and attain competitive results against state of the art convolutional net-based Go-playing programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 19:32:48 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03375v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["peter h jin", "kurt keutzer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.03375"}
