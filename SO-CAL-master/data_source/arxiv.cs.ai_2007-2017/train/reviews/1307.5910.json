The solving and optimization of MANET allow assisting the users to efficiently use their devices in order to minimize the batteries power consumption. In this framework, we propose a modelling of the MANET in form of a Constraint Optimization Problem called COMANET. Then, in the objective to minimize the consumption of batteries power, we present an approach based on an adaptation of the A star algorithm to the MANET problem called MANED. Finally, we expose some experimental results showing utility of this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Jul 2013 23:56:38 GMT  (296kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5910v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NI", "authors": ["abdellah idrissi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.5910"}
