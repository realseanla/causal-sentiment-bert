The navigation apps (often called Maps), use a variety of available data sources to calculate and predict the travel time as well as several options for routing in public transportation, car or pedestrian modes. This paper evaluates the pedestrian mode of Maps apps in three major smartphone operating systems (Android, iOS and Windows Phone). In the paper, we will show that the Maps apps on iOS, Android and Windows Phone in pedestrian mode, predict travel time without learning from the individual's movement profile. In addition, we will exemplify that those apps suffer from a specific data quality issue which relates to the absence of information about location and type of pedestrian crossings. Finally, we will illustrate learning from movement profile of individuals using various predictive analytics models to improve the accuracy of travel time estimation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 19:54:19 GMT  (1037kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08509v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pouria amirian", "anahid basiri", "jeremy morley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08509"}
