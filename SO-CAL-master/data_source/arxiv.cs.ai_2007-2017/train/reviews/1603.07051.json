However, many researchers have been solving benchmark problems that have been extensively investigated for the last decades even if they have very few direct applications. The Traveling Thief Problem (TTP) is a NP-hard optimization problem that aims to provide a more realistic model. TTP targets particularly routing problem under packing/loading constraints which can be found in supply chain management and transportation. In this paper, TTP is presented and formulated mathematically. A combined local search algorithm is proposed and compared with Random Local Search (RLS) and Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). The obtained results are quite promising since new better solutions were found.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 02:30:35 GMT  (68kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07051v1", "12th ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (AICCSA) 2015.
