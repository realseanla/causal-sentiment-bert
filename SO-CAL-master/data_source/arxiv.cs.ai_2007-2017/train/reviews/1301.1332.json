This is due to large and complex IT landscapes within and across enterprise boundaries, heterogeneous technology stacks, and fragmented data. To remain competitive, visibility into the enterprise and partner IT networks on different, interrelated abstraction levels is desirable.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Jan 2013 20:52:40 GMT  (850kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1332v1", "15 pages, The 26th Workshop on Logic Programming (WLP), Bonn, 2012"], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 16:24:10 GMT  (436kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1332v2", "15 pages, The 26th Workshop on Logic Programming (WLP), Bonn, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, The 26th Workshop on Logic Programming (WLP), Bonn, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["daniel ritter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1332"}
