The proposed system differs from the well-known cascade systems in its capability to process multidimensional time series in an online mode, which makes it possible to process non-stationary stochastic and chaotic signals with the required accuracy. Compared to conventional analogs, the proposed system provides computational simplicity and possesses both tracking and filtering capabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:27:51 GMT  (328kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06485v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "daria s kopaliani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06485"}
