A central notion in this setting is that of an ontology-mediated query, which is a database query coupled with an ontology. In this paper, we study several classes of ontology-mediated queries, where the database queries are given as some form of conjunctive query and the ontologies are formulated in description logics or other relevant fragments of first-order logic, such as the guarded fragment and the unary-negation fragment. The contributions of the paper are three-fold. First, we characterize the expressive power of ontology-mediated queries in terms of fragments of disjunctive datalog. Second, we establish intimate connections between ontology-mediated queries and constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) and their logical generalization, MMSNP formulas. Third, we exploit these connections to obtain new results regarding (i) first-order rewritability and datalog-rewritability of ontology-mediated queries, (ii) P/NP dichotomies for ontology-mediated queries, and (iii) the query containment problem for ontology-mediated queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Jan 2013 09:11:54 GMT  (113kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6479v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Jun 2013 12:52:59 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6479v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["meghyn bienvenu", "balder ten cate", "carsten lutz", "frank wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6479"}
