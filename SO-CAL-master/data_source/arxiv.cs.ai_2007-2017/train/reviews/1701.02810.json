The toolkit prioritizes efficiency, modularity, and extensibility with the goal of supporting NMT research into model architectures, feature representations, and source modalities, while maintaining competitive performance and reasonable training requirements. The toolkit consists of modeling and translation support, as well as detailed pedagogical documentation about the underlying techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 23:32:43 GMT  (47kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02810v1", "Report forthis http URL"], ["v2", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 15:54:27 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02810v2", "Report forthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Report forthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["guillaume klein", "yoon kim", "yuntian deng", "jean senellart", "alexander m rush"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.02810"}
