This paper focuses on the expressiveness of normal and disjunctive programs under the general stable model semantics. A translation from disjunctive programs to normal programs is proposed for infinite structures. Over finite structures, some disjunctive programs are proved to be intranslatable to normal programs if the arities of auxiliary predicates and functions are bounded in a certain way. The equivalence of the expressiveness of normal programs and disjunctive programs over arbitrary structures is also shown to coincide with that over finite structures, and coincide with whether NP is closed under complement. Moreover, to capture the exact expressiveness, some intertranslatability results between logic program classes and fragments of second-order logic are obtained.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 03:29:20 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0773v1", "Technical report, an extended version ofarXiv:1304.0620"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report, an extended version ofarXiv:1304.0620", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["heng zhang", "yan zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.0773"}
