An external agent-observer monitors a performance of a selected Deep Learning algorithm. The observer learns to model the DL algorithm using a series of random experiments. Consequently, it may be used for predicting a response of the DL algorithm in terms of a selected quality measurement to a set of hyper-parameters. This allows to construct an ensemble composed of a series of evaluators which constitute an observer-assisted architecture. The architecture may be used to gradually iterate towards to the best achievable quality score in tiny steps governed by a unit of progress. The algorithm is stopped when the maximum number of steps is reached or no further progress is made.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 19:37:48 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10328v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["maciej wielgosz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.10328"}
