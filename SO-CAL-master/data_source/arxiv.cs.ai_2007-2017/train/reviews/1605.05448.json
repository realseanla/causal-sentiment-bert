It is adapted from a fairly recent algorithm, the Bees Algorithm, which was developed for continuous optimisation problems. We show that the results obtained by the Enhanced Bees Algorithm are competitive with the best meta-heuristics available for the Vehicle Routing Problem (within 0.5% of the optimal solution for common benchmark problems). We show that the algorithm has good runtime performance, producing results within 2% of the optimal solution within 60 seconds, making it suitable for use within real world dispatch scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 May 2016 05:53:44 GMT  (1214kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05448v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["aish fenton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.05448"}
