We consider the problem of parallel inference on large factor graphs in the distributed memory setting of computer clusters. We develop a new efficient parallel inference algorithm, DBRSplash, which incorporates over-segmented graph partitioning, belief residual scheduling, and uniform work Splash operations. We empirically evaluate the DBRSplash algorithm on a 120 processor cluster and demonstrate linear to super-linear performance gains on large factor graph models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 15:23:28 GMT  (505kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2645v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["joseph e gonzalez", "yucheng low", "carlos e guestrin", "david o'hallaron"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2645"}
