Settings where most agent actions are independent except for few actions that affect the transitions and/or rewards of other agents can be modeled using Event-Driven Interactions with Complex Rewards (EDI-CR). Finding the optimal joint policy can be formulated as an optimization problem. However, existing formulations are too verbose and/or lack optimality guarantees. We propose a compact Mixed Integer Linear Program formulation of EDI-CR instances. The key insight is that most action sequences of a group of agents have the same effect on a given agent. This allows us to treat these sequences similarly and use fewer variables. Experiments show that our formulation is more compact and leads to faster solution times and better solutions than existing formulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (191kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3749v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hala mostafa", "victor lesser"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3749"}
