Optimal generation (generator subset selection) of power requires a careful evaluation of various factors like type of source, generation, transmission &amp; storage capacities, congestion among others which makes this a difficult task. We created a grid to simulate various conditions including stimuli like generator supply, weather and load demand using Siemens PSS/E software and this data is trained using deep learning methods and subsequently tested. The results are highly encouraging. As per our knowledge, this is the first paper to propose a working and scalable deep learning model for this problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 02:54:59 GMT  (283kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02513v1", "6 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.AI", "authors": ["biswarup bhattacharya", "abhishek sinha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02513"}
