Charlin et al. [4] recently showed that the hierarchy discovery problem can be framed as a non-convex optimization problem. However, the inherent computational di culty of solving such an optimization problem makes it hard to scale to realworld problems. In another line of research, Toussaint et al. [18] developed a method to solve planning problems by maximumlikelihood estimation. In this paper, we show how the hierarchy discovery problem in partially observable domains can be tackled using a similar maximum likelihood approach. Our technique rst transforms the problem into a dynamic Bayesian network through which a hierarchical structure can naturally be discovered while optimizing the policy. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach scales better than previous techniques based on non-convex optimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:51:21 GMT  (232kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3291v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marc toussaint", "laurent charlin", "pascal poupart"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3291"}
