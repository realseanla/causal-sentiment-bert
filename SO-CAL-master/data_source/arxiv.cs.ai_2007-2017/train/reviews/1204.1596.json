To make it efficient, the sum of update costs of location database must be minimized. Previous work relying on fixed location databases is unable to fully exploit the knowledge of user mobility patterns in the system so as to achieve this minimization. The study presents an intelligent location management approach which has interacts between intelligent information system and knowledge-base technologies, so we can dynamically change the user patterns and reduce the transition between the VLR and HLR. The study provides algorithms are ability to handle location registration and call delivery", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Apr 2012 05:48:47 GMT  (248kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1596v1", "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications(IJACSA)-IJARAI-2012"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications(IJACSA)-IJARAI-2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["n mallikharjuna rao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1596"}
