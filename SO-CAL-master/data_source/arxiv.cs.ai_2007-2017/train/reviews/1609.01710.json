Such data collection, if done manually, needs tremendous effort and is very time consuming. Though many studies have asserted the possibility of automating this task using video cameras, we found that only a few have demonstrated good performance in very crowded situations or from a top-angled view scene. This paper deals with tracking pedestrian crowd under heavy occlusions from an angular scene. Our automated tracking system consists of two modules that perform sequentially. The first module detects moving objects as blobs. The second module is a tracking system. We employ probability distribution from the detection of each pedestrian and use Bayesian update to track the next position. The result of such tracking is a database of pedestrian trajectories over time and space. With certain prior information, we showed that the system can track a large number of people under occlusion and clutter scene.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 10:36:23 GMT  (124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01710v1", "10 Pages, Saadat, S., and Teknomo, K., Automation of Pedestrian Tracking in a Crowded Situation, the Fifth International Conference on Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics, March 8-10, 2010, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD USA"]], "COMMENTS": "10 Pages, Saadat, S., and Teknomo, K., Automation of Pedestrian Tracking in a Crowded Situation, the Fifth International Conference on Pedestrian and Evacuation Dynamics, March 8-10, 2010, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CY cs.MA", "authors": ["saman saadat", "kardi teknomo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01710"}
