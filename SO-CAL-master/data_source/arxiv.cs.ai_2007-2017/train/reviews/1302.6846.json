We develop a fully probabilistic approach to model based diagnosis and extend it to support hierarchical models. Our scheme translates the functional schematic into a Bayesian network and diagnostic inference takes place in the Bayesian network. A Bayesian network diagnostic inference algorithm is modified to take advantage of the hierarchy to give computational gains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:52 GMT  (949kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6846v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sampath srinivas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6846"}
