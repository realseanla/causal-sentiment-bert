DNA computing has been considered to be quite promising in solving computational and reasoning problems by using DNA strands. Resolution, an important aspect of automated theorem proving and mathematical logic, is a rule of inference which leads to proof by contradiction technique for sentences in propositional logic and first-order logic. This can also be called refutation theorem-proving. In this paper we have shown how the theorem proving with resolution refutation by DNA computation can be represented by the semantics of process calculus and strand graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 11:12:34 GMT  (386kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05383v1", "25 pages,12 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "25 pages,12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kumar s ray", "mandrita mondal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05383"}
