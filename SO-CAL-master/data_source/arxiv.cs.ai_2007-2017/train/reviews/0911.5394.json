Covering rough sets are a natural extension of classical rough sets by relaxing the partitions arising from equivalence relations to covers. Recently, some topological concepts such as neighborhood have been applied to covering rough sets. In this paper, we further investigate the covering rough sets based on neighborhoods by approximation operations. We show that the upper approximation based on neighborhoods can be defined equivalently without using neighborhoods. To analyze the covers themselves, we introduce unary and composition operations on covers. A notion of homomorphism is provided to relate two covering approximation spaces. We also examine the properties of approximations preserved by the operations and homomorphisms, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Nov 2009 11:04:06 GMT  (51kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5394v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 06:34:05 GMT  (62kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5394v2", "13 pages; to appear in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ping zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.5394"}
