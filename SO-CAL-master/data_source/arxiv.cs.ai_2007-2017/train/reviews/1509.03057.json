We are focused only on those fuzzy problems that take series of fuzzy input objects and produce fuzzy values. To solve such problems efficiently, we design fast fuzzy algorithms, which are modeled by polynomial-time deterministic fuzzy Turing machines equipped with read-only auxiliary tapes and write-only output tapes and also modeled by polynomial-size fuzzy circuits composed of fuzzy gates. We also introduce fuzzy proof verification systems to model the fuzzification of nondeterminism. Those models help us identify four complexity classes: Fuzzy-FPA of fuzzy functions, Fuzzy-PA and Fuzzy-NPA of fuzzy decision problems, and Fuzzy-NPAO of fuzzy optimization problems. Based on a relative approximation scheme targeting fuzzy membership degree, we formulate two notions of \"reducibility\" in order to compare the computational complexity of two fuzzy problems. These reducibility notions make it possible to locate the most difficult fuzzy problems in Fuzzy-NPA and in Fuzzy-NPAO.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 09:07:31 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03057v1", "A4, 10pt, 10 pages.
