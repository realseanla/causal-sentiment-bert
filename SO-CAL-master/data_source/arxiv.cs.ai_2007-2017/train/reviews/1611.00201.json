This manuscript surveys recent work in the literature that pertain to applying deep learning systems to the robotics domain, either as means of estimation or as a tool to resolve motor commands directly from raw percepts. These recent advances are only a piece to the puzzle. We suggest that deep learning as a tool alone is insufficient in building a unified framework to acquire general intelligence. For this reason, we complement our survey with insights from cognitive development and refer to ideas from classical control theory, producing an integrated direction for a lifelong learning architecture.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 12:47:50 GMT  (656kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00201v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["jay m wong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00201"}
