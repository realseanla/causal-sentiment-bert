The explosion of massive data sets created by businesses, science and governments necessitates intelligent and more powerful computing paradigms so that users can benefit from this data. Therefore most new-generation database applications demand intelligent information management to enhance efficient interactions between database and the users. Database systems support only a Boolean query model. A selection query on SQL database returns all those tuples that satisfy the conditions in the query.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Dec 2009 17:04:01 GMT  (413kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2282v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["mrs neelu nihalani", "dr sanjay silakari", "dr mahesh motwani"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.2282"}
