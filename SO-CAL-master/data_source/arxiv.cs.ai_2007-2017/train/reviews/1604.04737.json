An agent-based negotiation team is a group of agents that joins together as a party because they share common interests in the negotiation at hand. It is experimentally shown how negotiation environment conditions like the deadline of both parties, the concession speed of the opponent, similarity among team members, and team size affect performance metrics like the minimum utility of team members, the average utility of team members, and the number of negotiation rounds. Our goal is identifying which intra-team strategies work better in different environmental conditions in order to provide useful knowledge for team members to select appropriate intra-team strategies according to environmental conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 12:13:02 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04737v1", "Information Sciences, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Information Sciences, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["victor sanchez-anguix", "vicente julian", "vicente botti", "ana garcia-fornes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04737"}
