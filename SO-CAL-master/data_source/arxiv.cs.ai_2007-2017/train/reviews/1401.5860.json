Some of these encodings first construct a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) for the constraint, and then encode the BDD into a propositional formula. These BDD-based approaches have some important advantages, such as not being dependent on the size of the coefficients, or being able to share the same BDD for representing many constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:48:33 GMT  (634kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5860v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ignasi ab\\'io", "robert nieuwenhuis", "albert oliveras", "enric rodriguez-carbonell", "valentin mayer-eichberger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5860"}
