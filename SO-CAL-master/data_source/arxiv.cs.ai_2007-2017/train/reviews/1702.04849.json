The convergence rates of these methods depend heavily on the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on. We investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form games through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the extensive-form games. By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching factor of the player. This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of $\\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching factor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 03:39:07 GMT  (58kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04849v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 May 2017 02:24:32 GMT  (4893kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04849v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["christian kroer", "kevin waugh", "fatma kilinc-karzan", "tuomas sandholm"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04849"}
