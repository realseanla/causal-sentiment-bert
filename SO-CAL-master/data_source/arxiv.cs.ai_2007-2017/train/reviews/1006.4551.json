The ability to create intelligent machines has intrigued humans since ancient times and today with the advent of the computer and 50 years of research into various programming techniques, the dream of smart machines is becoming a reality. Researchers are creating systems which can mimic human thought, understand speech, beat the best human chessplayer, and countless other feats never before possible. Ability of the human to estimate the information is most brightly shown in using of natural languages. Using words of a natural language for valuation qualitative attributes, for example, the person pawns uncertainty in form of vagueness in itself estimations. Vague sets, vague judgments, vague conclusions takes place there and then, where and when the reasonable subject exists and also is interested in something. The vague sets theory has arisen as the answer to an illegibility of language the reasonable subject speaks. Language of a reasonable subject is generated by vague events which are created by the reason and which are operated by the mind. The theory of vague sets represents an attempt to find such approximation of vague grouping which would be more convenient, than the classical theory of sets in situations where the natural language plays a significant role. Such theory has been offered by known American mathematician Gau and Buehrer .In our paper we are describing how vagueness of linguistic variables can be solved by using the vague set theory.This paper is mainly designed for one of directions of the eventology (the theory of the random vague events), which has arisen within the limits of the probability theory and which pursue the unique purpose to describe eventologically a movement of reason.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 15:09:04 GMT  (380kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4551v1", "IEEE Publication Format,this https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE Publication Format,this https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["supriya raheja", "smita rajpal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.4551"}
