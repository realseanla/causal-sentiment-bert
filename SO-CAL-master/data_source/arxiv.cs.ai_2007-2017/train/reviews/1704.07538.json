For a given discretized environment, robots need to find collision-free paths to a set of specified goal locations. Robots can be fully anonymous, non-anonymous, or organized in groups. Although powerful solvers for this abstract problem exist, they make simplifying assumptions by ignoring kinematic constraints, making it difficult to use the resulting plans on actual robots. In this paper, we present a solution which takes kinematic constraints, such as maximum velocities, into account, while guaranteeing a user-specified minimum safety distance between robots. We demonstrate our approach in simulation and on real robots in 2D and 3D environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 04:52:09 GMT  (492kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07538v1", "Published in Southern California Robotics Symposium 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Southern California Robotics Symposium 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["wolfgang h\\\"onig", "t k satish kumar", "liron cohen", "hang ma", "sven koenig", "nora ayanian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07538"}
