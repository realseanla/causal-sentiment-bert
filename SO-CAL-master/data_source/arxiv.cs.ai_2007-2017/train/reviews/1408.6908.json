We will describe and critically assess the different ways AI systems are evaluated. We first focus on the traditional task-oriented evaluation approach. We see that black-box (behavioural evaluation) is becoming more and more common, as AI systems are becoming more complex and unpredictable. We identify three kinds of evaluation: Human discrimination, problem benchmarks and peer confrontation. We describe the limitations of the many evaluation settings and competitions in these three categories and propose several ideas for a more systematic and robust evaluation. We then focus on a less customary (and challenging) ability-oriented evaluation approach, where a system is characterised by its (cognitive) abilities, rather than by the tasks it is designed to solve. We discuss several possibilities: the adaptation of cognitive tests used for humans and animals, the development of tests derived from algorithmic information theory or more general approaches under the perspective of universal psychometrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 02:44:28 GMT  (560kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6908v1", "29 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Oct 2014 02:16:32 GMT  (568kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6908v2", "34 pages"], ["v3", "Sun, 21 Aug 2016 22:44:31 GMT  (572kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6908v3", "34 pages.
