We use a probabilistic analysis to justify a method for quickly identifying and rejecting useless paths. Using the same analysis, we identify key conditions and assumptions necessary for marker-passing to perform well.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:30:07 GMT  (356kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5711v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["glenn carroll", "eugene charniak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5711"}
