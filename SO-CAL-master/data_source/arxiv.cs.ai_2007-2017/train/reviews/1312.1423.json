This problem has many applications in text-retrieval, web search, computational biology, bioinformatics and others. Similarity between two data objects can be depicted using a similarity measure or a distance metric. There are numerous distance metrics in the literature, some are used for a particular data type, and others are more general. In this paper we present a new distance metric for sequential data which is based on the sum of n-grams. The novelty of our distance is that these n-grams are weighted using artificial bee colony; a recent optimization algorithm based on the collective intelligence of a swarm of bees on their search for nectar. This algorithm has been used in optimizing a large number of numerical problems. We validate the new distance experimentally.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 03:19:51 GMT  (219kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1423v1", "The Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference - AusDM 2012, Sydney, Australia, 5-7 December, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "The Tenth Australasian Data Mining Conference - AusDM 2012, Sydney, Australia, 5-7 December, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["muhammad marwan muhammad fuad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.1423"}
