{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-May-2015", "title": "Best-First and Depth-First Minimax Search in Practice", "abstract": "Most practitioners use a variant of the Alpha-Beta algorithm, a simple depth-first pro- cedure, for searching minimax trees. SSS*, with its best-first search strategy, reportedly offers the potential for more efficient search. However, the complex formulation of the al- gorithm and its alleged excessive memory requirements preclude its use in practice. For two decades, the search efficiency of \"smart\" best-first SSS* has cast doubt on the effectiveness of \"dumb\" depth-first Alpha-Beta. This paper presents a simple framework for calling Alpha-Beta that allows us to create a variety of algorithms, including SSS* and DUAL*. In effect, we formulate a best-first algorithm using depth-first search. Expressed in this framework SSS* is just a special case of Alpha-Beta, solving all of the perceived drawbacks of the algorithm. In practice, Alpha-Beta variants typically evaluate less nodes than SSS*. A new instance of this framework, MTD(f), out-performs SSS* and NegaScout, the Alpha-Beta variant of choice by practitioners.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 May 2015 06:54:26 GMT  (357kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01603v1", "Computer Science in the Netherlands 1995. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1404.1515"]], "COMMENTS": "Computer Science in the Netherlands 1995. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1404.1515", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aske plaat", "jonathan schaeffer", "wim pijls", "arie de bruin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.01603"}
