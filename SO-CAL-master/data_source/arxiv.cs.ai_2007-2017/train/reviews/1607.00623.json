{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Jul-2016", "title": "Visualizing Natural Language Descriptions: A Survey", "abstract": "A natural language interface exploits the conceptual simplicity and naturalness of the language to create a high-level user-friendly communication channel between humans and machines. One of the promising applications of such interfaces is generating visual interpretations of semantic content of a given natural language that can be then visualized either as a static scene or a dynamic animation. This survey discusses requirements and challenges of developing such systems and reports 26 graphical systems that exploit natural language interfaces and addresses both artificial intelligence and visualization aspects. This work serves as a frame of reference to researchers and to enable further advances in the field.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 10:30:40 GMT  (284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00623v1", "Due to copyright most of the figures only appear in the journal version"]], "COMMENTS": "Due to copyright most of the figures only appear in the journal version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV cs.GR cs.HC", "authors": ["kaveh hassani", "won-sook lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00623"}
