However, while specific restart strategies have been developed for specific problems (and specific algorithms), restarts are typically not regarded as a general tool to speed up an optimization algorithm. In fact, many optimization algorithms do not employ restarts at all.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 19:36:45 GMT  (747kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03993v1", "15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["tobias friedrich", "timo k\\\"otzing", "markus wagner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03993"}
