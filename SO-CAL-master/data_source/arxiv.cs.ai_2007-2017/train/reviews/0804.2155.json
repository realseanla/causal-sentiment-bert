This type of convergence is needed for reasoning about security protocols. A complete axiomatization is provided for this semantics, and it is shown how a qualitative proof of the correctness of a security protocol can be automatically converted to a quantitative proof appropriate for reasoning about concrete security.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Apr 2008 12:06:04 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.2155v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["joseph y halpern"], "accepted": true, "id": "0804.2155"}
