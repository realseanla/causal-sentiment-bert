In this model-theoretic semantics, reactive rules are the driving force, and logic programs play only a supporting role.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 15:09:38 GMT  (523kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00529v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 15:06:29 GMT  (523kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00529v2", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["robert kowalski", "fariba sadri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00529"}
