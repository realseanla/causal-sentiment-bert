{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Nov-2014", "title": "Elections with Few Voters: Candidate Control Can Be Easy", "abstract": "We study the computational complexity of candidate control in elections with few voters (that is, we take the number of voters as a parameter). We consider both the standard scenario of adding and deleting candidates, where one asks if a given candidate can become a winner (or, in the destructive case, can be precluded from winning) by adding/deleting some candidates, and a combinatorial scenario where adding/deleting a candidate automatically means adding/deleting a whole group of candidates. Our results show that the parameterized complexity of candidate control (with the number of voters as the parameter) is much more varied than in the setting with many voters.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 11:09:04 GMT  (81kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7812v1", "52 pages. to appear in th\u007fe Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15)"], ["v2", "Sat, 18 Mar 2017 11:32:11 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7812v2", "56 pages, short version presented at AAAI-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "52 pages. to appear in th\u007fe Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["jiehua chen", "piotr faliszewski", "rolf niedermeier", "nimrod talmon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.7812"}
