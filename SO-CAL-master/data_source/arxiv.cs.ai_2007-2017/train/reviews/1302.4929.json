We present a method of revaluating counterfactuals when the underlying causal model is represented by structural models - a nonlinear generalization of the simultaneous equations models commonly used in econometrics and social sciences. This new method provides a coherent means for evaluating policies involving the control of variables which, prior to enacting the policy were influenced by other variables in the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:18:56 GMT  (333kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4929v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander balke", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4929"}
