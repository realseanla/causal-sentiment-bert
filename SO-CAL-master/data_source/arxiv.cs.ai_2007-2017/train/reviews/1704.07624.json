Given an English taxonomy, our approach leverages the interlanguage links of Wikipedia followed by character-level classifiers to induce high-precision, high-coverage taxonomies in other languages. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, heuristics-heavy approaches for six languages. As a consequence of our work, we release presumably the largest and the most accurate multilingual taxonomic resource spanning over 280 languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 10:45:43 GMT  (586kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07624v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 09:23:40 GMT  (1013kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07624v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["amit gupta", "r\\'emi lebret", "hamza harkous", "karl aberer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07624"}
