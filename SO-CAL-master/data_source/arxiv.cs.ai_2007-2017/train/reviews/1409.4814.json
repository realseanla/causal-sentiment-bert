The human teacher guides the machine towards accomplishing the task of interest. The learning machine leverages big data to find examples that maximize the training value of its interaction with the teacher. When the teacher is restricted to labeling examples selected by the machine, this problem is an instance of active learning. When the teacher can provide additional information to the machine (e.g., suggestions on what examples or predictive features should be used) as the learning task progresses, then the problem becomes one of interactive learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Sep 2014 21:45:22 GMT  (874kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4814v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["patrice simard", "david chickering", "aparna lakshmiratan", "denis charles", "leon bottou", "carlos garcia jurado suarez", "david grangier", "saleema amershi", "johan verwey", "jina suh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.4814"}
