This challenge is approached by introducing a constraint for pattern selection. One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset. Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent. However, many other constraints for pattern selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 11:40:44 GMT  (253kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09513v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aleksey buzmakov", "sergei o kuznetsov", "amedeo napoli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09513"}
