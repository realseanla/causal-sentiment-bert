This is faster than the previously best algorithm which runs in O(1.2190n). In order to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, a new principle, i.e. the common literals principle, is addressed to simplify formulae. This allows us to eliminate more common literals. In addition, we firstly inject the resolution principles into solving #XSAT problem, and therefore this further improves the efficiency of the algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 08:16:59 GMT  (580kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4924v1", "submitted to AAAI-10"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to AAAI-10", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["junping zhou", "minghao yin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.4924"}
