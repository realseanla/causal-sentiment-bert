A refinement is like a bisimulation, except that from the three relational requirements only 'atoms' and 'back' need to be satisfied. Our logic contains a new operator 'forall' in additional to the standard modalities 'Box' for each agent. The operator 'forall' acts as a quantifier over the set of all refinements of a given model. We call it the refinement operator. As a variation on a bisimulation quantifier, it can be seen as a refinement quantifier over a variable not occurring in the formula bound by the operator. The logic combines the simplicity of multi-agent modal logic with some powers of monadic second order quantification. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of multiagent refinement modal logic. We also present an extension of the logic to the modal mu-calculus, and an axiomatization for the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and applications are also discussed: to software verification and design (the set of agents can also be seen as a set of actions), and to dynamic epistemic logic. We further give detailed results on the complexity of satisfiability, and on succinctness.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2012 09:13:18 GMT  (60kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3538v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 09:29:30 GMT  (71kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3538v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["laura bozzelli", "hans van ditmarsch", "tim french", "james hales", "sophie pinchinat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3538"}
