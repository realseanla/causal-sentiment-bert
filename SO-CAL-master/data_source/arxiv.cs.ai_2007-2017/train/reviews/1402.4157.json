We propose an approach that allows detection of collisions even between continuous, stochastic trajectories with the only restriction that means and covariances can be computed. To this end, we employ probabilistic bounds to derive criterion functions whose negative sign provably is indicative of probable collisions. For criterion functions that are Lipschitz, an algorithm is provided to rapidly find negative values or prove their absence. We propose an iterative policy-search approach that avoids prior discretisations and yields collision-free trajectories with adjustably high certainty. We test our method with both fixed-priority and auction-based protocols for coordinating the iterative planning process. Results are provided in collision-avoidance simulations of feedback controlled plants.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 21:46:26 GMT  (376kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4157v1", "This preprint is an extended version of a conference paper that is to appear in \\textit{Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2014)}"], ["v2", "Mon, 12 May 2014 15:38:42 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4157v2", "This preprint is an extended version of a conference paper that is to appear in \\textit{Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2014)}"]], "COMMENTS": "This preprint is an extended version of a conference paper that is to appear in \\textit{Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2014)}", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["jan-peter calliess", "michael osborne", "stephen roberts"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4157"}
