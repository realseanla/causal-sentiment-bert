The problem has its application in genome comparison. As it is an NP-hard, discrete combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a metaheuristic technique, namely, MAX-MIN ant system to solve this. The experimental results are found to be promising.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 13:15:30 GMT  (93kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4539v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 21 May 2014 06:35:41 GMT  (128kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4539v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["s m ferdous", "m sohel rahman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4539"}
