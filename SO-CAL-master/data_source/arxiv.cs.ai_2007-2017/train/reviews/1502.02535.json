This paper surveys a selection of {\\em semantically-guided} or {\\em model-based} methods that aim at meeting aspects of this challenge. For first-order logic we touch upon {\\em resolution-based} methods, {\\em tableaux-based} methods, {\\em DPLL-inspired} methods, and we give a preview of a new method called SGGS, for {\\em Semantically-Guided Goal-Sensitive} reasoning. For first-order theories we highlight {\\em hierarchical} and {\\em locality-based} methods, concluding with the recent {\\em Model-Constructing satisfiability calculus}.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 16:14:40 GMT  (24kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02535v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 15:22:17 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02535v2", "To appear in Narciso Marti-Oliet, Peter Olveczky, and Carolyn Talcott (Eds.), \"Logic, Rewriting, and Concurrency: Essays in Honor of Jose Meseguer\" Springer, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, September 2015, 24 pages"], ["v3", "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 21:16:13 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02535v3", "In Narciso Marti-Oliet, Peter Olveczky, and Carolyn Talcott (Eds.), \"Logic, Rewriting, and Concurrency: Essays in Honor of Jose Meseguer\" Springer, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 9200, September 2015, 24 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["maria paola bonacina", "ulrich furbach", "viorica sofronie-stokkermans"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02535"}
