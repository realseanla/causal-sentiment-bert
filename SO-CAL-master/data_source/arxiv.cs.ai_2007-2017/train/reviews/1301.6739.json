In this paper, some simple but powerful extensions to previous algorithms are introduced which allow an efficient value of information calculation on the rooted cluster tree (or strong junction tree) used to solve the original decision problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:56 GMT  (254kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6739v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ross d shachter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6739"}
