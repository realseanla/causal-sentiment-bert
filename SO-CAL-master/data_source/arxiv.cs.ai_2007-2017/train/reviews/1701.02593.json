Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on states of a bidirectional LSTM encoder. The semantic role labeler achieves respectable performance on English even without any kind of syntactic information and only using local inference. However, when automatically predicted part-of-speech tags are provided as input, it substantially outperforms all previous local models and approaches the best reported results on the CoNLL-2009 dataset. Syntactic parsers are unreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e. syntactically-informed) SRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. Our syntax-agnostic model appears more robust, resulting in the best reported results on the standard out-of-domain test set.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 14:01:47 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02593v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 16:47:47 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02593v2", "To appear in CoNLL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["diego marcheggiani", "anton frolov", "ivan titov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02593"}
