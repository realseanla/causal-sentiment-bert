However, they have not been widely adopted by CSP solvers. This is because applying such consistencies can sometimes result in considerably smaller search tree sizes and therefore in important speed-ups, but in other cases the search space reduction may be small, causing severe run time penalties. Taking advantage of recent advances in parallelization, we propose a novel approach for the application of strong local consistencies (SLCs) that can improve their performance by largely preserving the speed-ups they offer in cases where they are successful, and eliminating the run time penalties in cases where they are unsuccessful. This approach is presented in the form of two search algorithms. Both algorithms consist of a master search process, which is a typical CSP solver, and a number of slave processes, with each one implementing a SLC method. The first algorithm runs the different SLCs synchronously at each node of the search tree explored in the master process, while the second one can run them asynchronously at different nodes of the search tree. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 16:28:00 GMT  (1544kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05316v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["minas dasygenis", "kostas stergiou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05316"}
