Recently, a notion of relevance was introduced for this language. This notion determines the set of undecided literals that can still influence the satisfiability of a PC(ID) formula in a given partial assignment. The idea is that the PC(ID) solver can make decisions only on relevant literals without losing soundness and thus safely ignore irrelevant literals.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 14:19:21 GMT  (129kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05609v1", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joachim jansen", "jo devriendt", "bart bogaerts", "gerda janssens", "marc denecker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05609"}
