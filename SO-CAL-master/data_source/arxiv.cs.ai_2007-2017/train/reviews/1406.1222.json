Intuitively, the optimization searches for the simplest set of factors that can explain the correlations in the data as measured by multivariate mutual information. The method is unsupervised, requires no model assumptions, and scales linearly with the number of variables which makes it an attractive approach for very high dimensional systems. We demonstrate that Correlation Explanation (CorEx) automatically discovers meaningful structure for data from diverse sources including personality tests, DNA, and human language.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 21:46:30 GMT  (7891kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1222v1", "15 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 02:43:28 GMT  (7088kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1222v2", "15 pages, 6 figures.
