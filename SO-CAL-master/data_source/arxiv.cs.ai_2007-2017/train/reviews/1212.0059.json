There are number of techniques for image segmentation. Proposed research work uses ANFIS (Artificial Neural Network Fuzzy Inference System) for image classification and then compares the results with FCM (Fuzzy C means) and K-NN (K-nearest neighbor). ANFIS includes benefits of both ANN and the fuzzy logic systems. A comprehensive feature set and fuzzy rules are selected to classify an abnormal image to the corresponding tumor type. Experimental results illustrate promising results in terms of classification accuracy. A comparative analysis is performed with the FCM and K-NN to show the superior nature of ANFIS systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 03:58:09 GMT  (497kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0059v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["minakshi sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.0059"}
