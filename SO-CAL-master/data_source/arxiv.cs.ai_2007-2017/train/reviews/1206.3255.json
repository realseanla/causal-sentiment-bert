Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset. The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories. Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models. We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models. Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:30:30 GMT  (277kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3255v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Jul 2014 08:32:38 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3255v2", "Minor revisions.
