This article surveys algorithms designed for sequential decision-making problems with multiple objectives. Though there is a growing body of literature on this subject, little of it makes explicit under what circumstances special methods are needed to solve multi-objective problems. Therefore, we identify three distinct scenarios in which converting such a problem to a single-objective one is impossible, infeasible, or undesirable. Furthermore, we propose a taxonomy that classifies multi-objective methods according to the applicable scenario, the nature of the scalarization function (which projects multi-objective values to scalar ones), and the type of policies considered. We show how these factors determine the nature of an optimal solution, which can be a single policy, a convex hull, or a Pareto front. Using this taxonomy, we survey the literature on multi-objective methods for planning and learning. Finally, we discuss key applications of such methods and outline opportunities for future work.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:45:08 GMT  (575kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0590v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["diederik marijn roijers", "peter vamplew", "shimon whiteson", "richard dazeley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0590"}
