During the change implementation, business processes are analyzed and improved ensuring that they capture the proposed change and they do not contain any undesired functionalities or change side-effects. This paper presents Business Process Change Management approach for the efficient and effective implementation of change in the business process. The key technology behind our approach is our proposed Business Process Change Management Ontology (BPCMont) which is the main contribution of this paper. BPCMont, as a formalized change specification, helps to revert BP into a consistent state in case of system crash, intermediate conflicting stage or unauthorized change done, aid in change traceability in the new and old versions of business processes, change effects can be seen and estimated effectively, ease for Stakeholders to validate and verify change implementation, etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 20:27:44 GMT  (1079kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04376v1", "5 pages, 7 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 7 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["muhammad fahad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04376"}
