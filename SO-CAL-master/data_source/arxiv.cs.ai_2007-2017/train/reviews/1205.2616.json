Here, we describe lifted inference algorithms that determine symmetries and automatically lift the probabilistic model to speedup inference. In particular, we describe approximate lifted inference techniques that allow the user to trade off inference accuracy for computational efficiency by using a handful of tunable parameters, while keeping the error bounded. Our algorithms are closely related to the graph-theoretic concept of bisimulation. We report experiments on both synthetic and real data to show that in the presence of symmetries, run-times for inference can be improved significantly, with approximate lifted inference providing orders of magnitude speedup over ground inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 18:27:56 GMT  (250kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2616v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["prithviraj sen", "amol deshpande", "lise getoor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2616"}
