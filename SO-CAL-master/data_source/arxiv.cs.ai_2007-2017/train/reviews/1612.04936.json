In this work, we explore this direction by designing a simulator and a set of synthetic tasks in the movie domain that allow the learner to interact with a teacher by both asking and answering questions. We investigate how a learner can benefit from asking questions in both an offline and online reinforcement learning setting. We demonstrate that the learner improves when asking questions. Our work represents a first step in developing end-to-end learned interactive dialogue agents.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Dec 2016 05:46:27 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04936v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 29 Dec 2016 19:47:12 GMT  (356kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04936v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 21:07:04 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04936v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 17:30:42 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04936v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["jiwei li", "alexander h miller", "sumit chopra", "marc'aurelio ranzato", "jason weston"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.04936"}
