The first problem is to reliably mimic the way that users interact with user interfaces. The second problem is to build an instructible agent, i.e. one that can be taught to execute tasks expressed as previously unseen natural language commands. This paper proposes a solution to the second problem, a system we call Helpa. End-users can teach Helpa arbitrary new tasks whose level of complexity is similar to the tasks available from today's most popular virtual assistants. Teaching Helpa does not involve any programming. Instead, users teach Helpa by providing just one example of a command paired with a demonstration of how to execute that command. Helpa does not rely on any pre-existing domain-specific knowledge. It is therefore completely domain-independent. Our usability study showed that end-users can teach Helpa many new tasks in less than a minute each, often much less.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 22:04:26 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00061v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["i dan melamed", "nobal b niraula"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00061"}
