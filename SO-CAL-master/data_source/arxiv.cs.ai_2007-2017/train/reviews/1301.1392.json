Beyond rapid data processing, application areas like ambient assisted living, robotics, or dynamic scheduling involve complex reasoning tasks. We address such scenarios and elaborate upon approaches to knowledge-intense stream reasoning, based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). While traditional ASP methods are devised for singular problem solving, we develop new techniques to formulate and process problems dealing with emerging as well as expiring data in a seamless way.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:44 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1392v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["martin gebser", "torsten grote", "roland kaminski", "philipp obermeier", "orkunt sabuncu", "torsten schaub"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1392"}
