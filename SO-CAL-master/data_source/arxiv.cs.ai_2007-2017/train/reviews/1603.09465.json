In this paper we study belief revision when the underlying logic is non-monotonic instead--an inherently interesting problem that is under explored. In particular, we will focus on the revision of a body of beliefs that is represented as a logic program under the answer set semantics, while the new information is also similarly represented as a logic program. Our approach is driven by the observation that unlike in a monotonic setting where, when necessary, consistency in a revised body of beliefs is maintained by jettisoning some old beliefs, in a non-monotonic setting consistency can be restored by adding new beliefs as well. We will define a syntactic revision function and subsequently provide representation theorem for characterising it.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 06:27:16 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09465v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["zhiqiang zhuang", "james delgrande", "abhaya nayak", "abdul sattar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09465"}
