Such an algorithm optimizes the fine tradeoff between presenting the products that are most likely to be relevant, and learning the preferences of the user so that more relevant recommendations can be made in the future.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 11:02:41 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01910v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["vijay kamble", "nadia fawaz", "fernando silveira"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01910"}
