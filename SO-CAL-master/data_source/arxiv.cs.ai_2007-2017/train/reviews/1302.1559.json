In order to improve the covering of the explored zone, the robots show different behaviours and cooperate by transferring each other the perceived environment when they meet. The returning robots deliver to a host computer their partial maps and the host incrementally generates the map of the environment by means of apossibility/ necessity grid.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:12 GMT  (1120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1559v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["maite lopez-sanchez", "ramon lopez de mantaras", "carles sierra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1559"}
