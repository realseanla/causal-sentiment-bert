{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Nov-2016", "title": "The Data Complexity of Description Logic Ontologies", "abstract": "We analyze the data complexity of ontology-mediated querying where the ontologies are formulated in a description logic (DL) of the ALC family and queries are conjunctive queries, positive existential queries, or acyclic conjunctive queries. Our approach is non-uniform in the sense that we aim to understand the complexity of each single ontology instead of for all ontologies formulated in a certain language. While doing so, we quantify over the queries and are interested, for example, in the question whether all queries can be evaluated in polynomial time w.r.t. a given ontology. Our results include a PTime/coNP-dichotomy for ontologies of depth one in the description logic ALCFI, the equivalence of a PTime/coNP-dichotomy for ALC and ALCI-ontologies of unrestricted depth to the famous dichotomy conjecture for CSPs by Feder and Vardi, and the failure of PTime/coNP-dichotomy theorem for ALCF-ontologies. Regarding the latter DL, we also show that it is undecidable whether a given ontology admits PTime query evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 09:52:54 GMT  (92kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02453v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 09:19:25 GMT  (96kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02453v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["carsten lutz", "frank wolter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02453"}
