Our main theorem is the following: if we fix the number alternatives, generate $n$ votes i.i.d. according to a distribution $\\pi$, and let $n$ go to infinity. Then, for any $\\epsilon &gt;0$, with probability at least $1-\\epsilon$, the minimum number of operations that are necessary for the strategic to achieve her goal falls into one of the following four categories: (1) 0, (2) $\\Theta(\\sqrt n)$, (3) $\\Theta(n)$, and (4) $\\infty$. This theorem holds for any set of vote operations, any individual vote distribution $\\pi$, and any generalized scoring rule, which includes (but not limited to) most commonly studied voting rules, e.g., approval voting, all positional scoring rules (including Borda, plurality, and veto), plurality with runoff, Bucklin, Copeland, maximin, STV, and ranked pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Apr 2012 14:00:21 GMT  (21kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1231v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Apr 2012 21:57:04 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1231v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 14 Aug 2012 02:47:16 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1231v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["lirong xia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1231"}
