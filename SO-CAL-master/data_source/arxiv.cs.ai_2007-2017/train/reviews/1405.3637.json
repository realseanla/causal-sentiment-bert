The goal is to have a language based on simple syntax and clear intuitive and mathematical semantics. We give some properties of $\\mathcal{A}log$, an algorithm for computing its answer sets, and comparison with other approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 19:36:38 GMT  (41kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3637v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 May 2014 02:42:50 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3637v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael gelfond", "yuanlin zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3637"}
