This paper presents a simple and efficient way to connect Choco and Ibex, two CP solvers respectively specialised on finite and continuous domains. This enables to take advantage of the most recent advances of the continuous community within Choco while saving development and maintenance resources, hence ensuring a better software quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 14:21:26 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1361v1", "Presented at Workshop TRICS in conference CP'13"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at Workshop TRICS in conference CP'13", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-guillaume fages", "gilles chabert", "charles prud'homme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.1361"}
