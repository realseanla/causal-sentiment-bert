Time management is crucial for every student. A self realisation of one's daily time expenditure in various domains is therefore essential to maximize one's effective output. This paper presents how a mobile application using Fuzzy Logic and Global Positioning System (GPS) analyzes a student's lifestyle and provides recommendations and suggestions based on the results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 07:14:34 GMT  (545kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03957v1", "Submitting in ICACI 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 17:06:34 GMT  (545kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03957v2", "To appear at ICACI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitting in ICACI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["sourish ghosh", "aaditya sanjay boob", "nishant nikhil", "nayan raju vysyaraju", "ankit kumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03957"}
