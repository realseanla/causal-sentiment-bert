Hartry Field and John MacFarlane covered the classical case. We extend their work, examining what it means for an agent to be obliged to infer a conclusion when faced with uncertain information or reasoning within a non-monotonic, defeasible, logical framework (which allows e. g. for inference to be drawn from premises considered true unless evidence to the contrary is presented).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 17:52:00 GMT  (344kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4741v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["julio lemos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4741"}
