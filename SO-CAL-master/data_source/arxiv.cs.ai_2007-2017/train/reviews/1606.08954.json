It learns a representation of the entire algorithm state, using stack long short-term memories. Our greedy inference algorithm has linear time, including feature extraction. On the CoNLL 2008--9 English shared tasks, we obtain the best published parsing performance among models that jointly learn syntax and semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 05:01:56 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08954v1", "13 pages, 5 figures, accepted to CoNLL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 5 figures, accepted to CoNLL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["swabha swayamdipta", "miguel ballesteros", "chris dyer", "noah a smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08954"}
