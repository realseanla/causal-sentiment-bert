Scheduling is a process which decides order of task from a set of multiple tasks that are ready to execute. There are number of CPU scheduling algorithms available, but it is very difficult task to decide which one is better. This paper discusses the design and implementation of modified fuzzy based CPU scheduling algorithm. This paper present a new set of fuzzy rules. It demonstrates that scheduling done with new priority improves average waiting time and average turnaround time.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 16:39:55 GMT  (569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02621v1", "6 Pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 Pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.OS cs.AI", "authors": ["rajani kumari", "vivek kumar sharma", "sandeep kumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02621"}
