It is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and finding an exact optimal solution is practically impossible. In this work, Site-Dependent Truck and Trailer Routing Problem with hard and soft Time Windows and Split Deliveries is considered (SDTTRPTWSD). In this article, we develop a heuristic with the elements of Tabu Search for solving SDTTRPTWSD. The heuristic uses the concept of neighborhoods and visits infeasible solutions during the search. A greedy heuristic is applied to construct an initial solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 08:37:48 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09253v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ivan s grechikhin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09253"}
