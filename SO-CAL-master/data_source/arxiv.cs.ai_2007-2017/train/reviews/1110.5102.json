{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Oct-2011", "title": "Towards Holistic Scene Understanding: Feedback Enabled Cascaded Classification Models", "abstract": "Scene understanding includes many related sub-tasks, such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection, etc. Each of these sub-tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classifiers already exist for many of them. These classifiers operate on the same raw image and provide correlated outputs. It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring any changes to the inner workings of any classifier.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2011 00:31:00 GMT  (6019kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.5102v1", "14 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["congcong li", "adarsh kowdle", "ashutosh saxena", "tsuhan chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1110.5102"}
