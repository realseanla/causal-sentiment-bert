Using it, we are able to derive the following theorems. (1) It is possible to learn by example all of $\\Sigma^0_1 \\cup \\Pi^0_1$ as well as some supersets; (2) in adversarial learning (which we describe as a pursuit-evasion game), the pursuer has a winning strategy (in other words, $\\Sigma^0_1$ can be learned adversarially, but $\\Pi^0_1$ not); (3) some languages in $\\Pi^0_1$ cannot be approximated by any language in $\\Sigma^0_1$.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 04:17:17 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02743v1", "23 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC cs.FL", "authors": ["michael brand", "david l dowe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02743"}
