In this paper, we focus on the first problem of detection using Bayesian network models, and we briefly discuss the application of a normative expert system for the treatment at the end. We apply Bayesian network models to the problem of fraud/uncollectible debt detection for telecommunication services. In addition to being quite successful at predicting rare event outcomes, it is able to handle a mixture of categorical and continuous data. We present a performance comparison using linear and non-linear discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and Bayesian network models", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:19 GMT  (610kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4945v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kazuo j ezawa", "til schuermann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4945"}
