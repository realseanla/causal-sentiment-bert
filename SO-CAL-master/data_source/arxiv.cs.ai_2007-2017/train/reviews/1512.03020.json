However, not every measure should be added by default (e.g., one might more typically want a mean over the heights of a set of people); similarly, some measures should only be summed within certain constraints (e.g., population measures need not be summed over years). In systems such as Watson Analytics, the exact additive behaviour of a measure is often determined by a human expert. In this work, we propose a small set of features for this issue. We use these features in a case-based reasoning approach, where the system suggests an aggregation behaviour, with 86% accuracy in our collected dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 19:52:55 GMT  (710kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03020v1", "7 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hamidreza chinaei", "mohsen rais-ghasem", "frank rudzicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.03020"}
