In contrast to prior work, the proposed neural model does not utilize domain-specific crafting, learning to translate directly from a parallel corpus. To fully explore the potential of neural models, we propose a methodology for collecting a large corpus of regular expression, natural language pairs. Our resulting model achieves a performance gain of 19.6% over previous state-of-the-art models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 23:05:03 GMT  (1418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03000v1", "to be published in EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "to be published in EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["nicholas locascio", "karthik narasimhan", "eduardo deleon", "nate kushman", "regina barzilay"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.03000"}
