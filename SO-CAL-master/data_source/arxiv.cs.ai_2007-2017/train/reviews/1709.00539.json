These methods use DISC profiling method to classify people into distinct personality types, which are further used to predict if a person may be a possible fit to the organizational culture. This concept is taken further by introducing a novel technique to predict if a particular pair of an incoming worker and the manager being assigned are compatible at a psychological scale. This is done using multilayer perceptron neural network which can be adaptively trained to showcase the true nature of the compatibility index. The proposed prototype model is used to quantify the relevant attributes, use them to train the prediction engine, and to define the data pipeline required for it.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Sep 2017 06:38:12 GMT  (448kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00539v1", "Presented in 6th International Conference on Research Trends in Engineering, Applied Science and Management (ICRTESM-2017).Published in International Journal of Engineering, Technology, Science and Research"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented in 6th International Conference on Research Trends in Engineering, Applied Science and Management (ICRTESM-2017).Published in International Journal of Engineering, Technology, Science and Research", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["chandrasekaran anirudh bhardwaj", "megha mishra", "sweetlin hemalatha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00539"}
