This means that characters have perceivable motivation for the actions they take. I show that this condition can be compiled away (in more ways than one) to produce a classical planning problem that can be solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner, more efficiently than by Riedl and Youngs specialised planner.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:46:00 GMT  (366kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5856v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrik haslum"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5856"}
