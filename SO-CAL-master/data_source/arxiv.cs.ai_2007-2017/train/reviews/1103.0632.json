To compose Web Services semantically, we need an ontology. There are several ways of inserting semantics in Web Services. One of them consists of using description languages like OWL-S. In this paper, we introduce our work which consists in the proposition of a new model and the use of semantic matching technology for semantic and dynamic composition of ebXML business processes.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 09:44:06 GMT  (520kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0632v1", "22 pages, 11 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 11 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hioual ouassila", "boufaida zizette"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.0632"}
