We proposed new techniques for efficient reordering. A slight improvement over the baseline is reported using these techniques. We also show that a simple pre-processing step can improve the quality of the translation significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 11:49:11 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4869v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["taraka rama", "karthik gali", "avinesh pvs"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4869"}
