On the other hand, propositional satisfiability problem (SAT) solvers can handle huge SAT instances. We thus present a technique to declaratively model set constraint problems and to encode them automatically into SAT instances. We apply our technique to the Social Golfer Problem and we also use it to break symmetries of the problem. Our technique is simpler, more declarative, and less error-prone than direct and improved hand modeling. The SAT instances that we automatically generate contain less clauses than improved hand-written instances such as in [20], and with unit propagation they also contain less variables. Moreover, they are well-suited for SAT solvers and they are solved faster as shown when solving difficult instances of the Social Golfer Problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 14:37:12 GMT  (26kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7196v1", "Submitted to Annals of Operations research"], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 19:23:45 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7196v2", "Submitted to Annals of Operations research"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Annals of Operations research", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fr\\'ed\\'eric lardeux", "eric monfroy", "broderick crawford", "ricardo soto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.7196"}
