Epsilon FTSVR is achieved by incorporating trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to epsilon TSVR which takes care of uncertainty existing in forecasting problems. Epsilon FTSVR determines a pair of epsilon insensitive proximal functions by solving two related quadratic programming problems. The structural risk minimization principle is implemented by introducing regularization term in primal problems of epsilon FTSVR. This yields dual stable positive definite problems which improves regression performance. Epsilon FTSVR is then reformulated as epsilon HFTSVR consisting of a set of hierarchical layers each containing epsilon FTSVR. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets reveal that epsilon HFTSVR has remarkable generalization performance with minimum training time.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 17:37:20 GMT  (413kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03247v1", "Research work at Samsung Research and Development Institute Delhi"]], "COMMENTS": "Research work at Samsung Research and Development Institute Delhi", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arindam chaudhuri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03247"}
