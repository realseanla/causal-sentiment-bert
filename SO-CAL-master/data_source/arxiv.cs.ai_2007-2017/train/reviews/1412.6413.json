The same holds true for conceptual knowledge, which holds knowledge about concepts and its association. Conceptual knowledge no matter what format they are represented in, must be consistent, sound and complete in order to realise its practical use. This paper discusses consistency, soundness and completeness in the ambit of conceptual knowledge and the need to consider these factors as fundamental to the development of conceptual knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 14:42:16 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6413v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gowri shankar ramaswamy", "f sagayaraj francis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6413"}
