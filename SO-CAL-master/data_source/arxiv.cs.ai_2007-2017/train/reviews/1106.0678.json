TAC was designed to create a benchmark problem in the complex domain of e-marketplaces and to motivate researchers to apply unique approaches to a common task. This article describes ATTac-2000, the first-place finisher in TAC. ATTac-2000 uses a principled bidding strategy that includes several elements of adaptivity. In addition to the success at the competition, isolated empirical results are presented indicating the robustness and effectiveness of ATTac-2000's adaptive strategy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:55:42 GMT  (75kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0678v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m kearns", "m l littman", "s singh", "p stone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0678"}
