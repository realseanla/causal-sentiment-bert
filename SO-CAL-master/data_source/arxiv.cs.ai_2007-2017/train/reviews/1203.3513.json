We show how even more compact decision circuits can be con- structed for dynamic programming in influ- ence diagrams with separable value functions and conditionally independent subproblems. Once a decision circuit has been constructed based on the diagram's \"global\" graphical structure, it can be compiled to exploit \"lo- cal\" structure for efficient evaluation and sen- sitivity analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (230kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3513v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ross d shachter", "debarun bhattacharjya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3513"}
