We use the stochastic dominance relation between fractional or randomized allocations to systematically define varying notions of proportionality and envy-freeness for discrete assignments. The computational complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied systematically for the fairness notions. We characterize the conditions under which a fair assignment is guaranteed to exist. For a number of fairness concepts, polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment exists or not. Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of variable entitlements of agents. Our NP-hardness result, which holds for several variants of envy-freeness, answers an open problem posed by Bouveret, Endriss, and Lang (ECAI 2010).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 13:37:19 GMT  (43kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6546v1", "18 pages; accepted at AAMAS 2014"], ["v2", "Tue, 16 Sep 2014 03:57:49 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6546v2", "extended version of a paper presented at AAMAS 2014"], ["v3", "Sat, 6 Dec 2014 04:30:06 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6546v3", "extended version of a paper presented at AAMAS 2014"], ["v4", "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 04:25:04 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6546v4", "extended version of a paper presented at AAMAS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages; accepted at AAMAS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["haris aziz", "serge gaspers", "simon mackenzie", "toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6546"}
