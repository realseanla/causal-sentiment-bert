This supports multidirectional information flow between these components allowing object detection to influence tracking and event recognition and event recognition to influence tracking and object detection. The performance of the combination can exceed the performance of the components in isolation. This can be done with linear asymptotic complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 14:47:41 GMT  (2906kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2741v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["andrei barbu", "aaron michaux", "siddharth narayanaswamy", "jeffrey mark siskind"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.2741"}
