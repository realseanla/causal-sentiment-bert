{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jun-2011", "title": "Extensional Higher-Order Logic Programming", "abstract": "We propose a purely extensional semantics for higher-order logic programming. In this semantics program predicates denote sets of ordered tuples, and two predicates are equal iff they are equal as sets. Moreover, every program has a unique minimum Herbrand model which is the greatest lower bound of all Herbrand models of the program and the least fixed-point of an immediate consequence operator. We also propose an SLD-resolution proof procedure which is proven sound and complete with respect to the minimum model semantics. In other words, we provide a purely extensional theoretical framework for higher-order logic programming which generalizes the familiar theory of classical (first-order) logic programming.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2011 12:01:01 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3457v1", "45 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "45 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["a charalambidis", "k handjopoulos", "p rondogiannis", "w w wadge"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.3457"}
