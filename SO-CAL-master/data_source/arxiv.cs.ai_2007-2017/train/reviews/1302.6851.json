In this paper, we are therefore going to look for possible alternatives and extensions. We begin by delimiting the general area of interest, proposing a minimal list of assumptions to be satisfied by any reasonable quasi-probabilistic valuation concept. Within this framework, we investigate two particularly interesting kinds of quasi-measures which are not or much less affected by the traditional problems. * Ranking measures, which generalize Spohn-type and possibility measures. * Cumulative measures, which combine the probabilistic and the ranking philosophy, allowing thereby a fine-grained account of static and dynamic belief.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:23 GMT  (1172kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6851v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["emil weydert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6851"}
