Use of Ontology represents the extracted terms in form of network graph consisting of nodes, edges, index terms etc. The above mentioned IR approaches provide relevance thus satisfying users query. The paper also emphasis on analyzing multimedia documents and performs calculation for extracted terms using different statistical formulas. The proposed model developed reduces semantic gap and satisfies user needs efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:29:05 GMT  (997kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07381v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["gagandeep singh narula", "vishal jain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07381"}
