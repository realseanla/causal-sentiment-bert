We argue that an important barrier for progress in creativity research is the inability of these systems to develop their own notion of value for novelty. We propose a notion of knowledge-driven creativity that circumvent the need for an externally imposed value function, allowing the system to explore based on what it has learned from a set of referential objects. The concept is illustrated by a specific knowledge model provided by a deep generative autoencoder. Using the described system, we train a knowledge model on a set of digit images and we use the same model to build coherent sets of new digits that do not belong to known digit types.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 13:29:13 GMT  (1692kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04345v1", "preprint ICCC'16, International Conference on Computational Creativity"]], "COMMENTS": "preprint ICCC'16, International Conference on Computational Creativity", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ak{\\i}n kazak\\c{c}{\\i}and mehdi cherti", "bal\\'azs k\\'egl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04345"}
