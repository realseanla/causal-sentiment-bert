{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2014", "title": "A Model-Based Active Testing Approach to Sequential Diagnosis", "abstract": "Model-based diagnostic reasoning often leads to a large number of diagnostic hypotheses. The set of diagnoses can be reduced by taking into account extra observations (passive monitoring), measuring additional variables (probing) or executing additional tests (sequential diagnosis/test sequencing). In this paper we combine the above approaches with techniques from Automated Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) and Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) into a framework called FRACTAL (FRamework for ACtive Testing ALgorithms). Apart from the inputs and outputs that connect a system to its environment, in active testing we consider additional input variables to which a sequence of test vectors can be supplied. We address the computationally hard problem of computing optimal control assignments (as defined in FRACTAL) in terms of a greedy approximation algorithm called FRACTAL-G. We compare the decrease in the number of remaining minimal cardinality diagnoses of FRACTAL-G to that of two more FRACTAL algorithms: FRACTAL-ATPG and FRACTAL-P. FRACTAL-ATPG is based on ATPG and sequential diagnosis while FRACTAL-P is based on probing and, although not an active testing algorithm, provides a baseline for comparing the lower bound on the number of reachable diagnoses for the FRACTAL algorithms. We empirically evaluate the trade-offs of the three FRACTAL algorithms by performing extensive experimentation on the ISCAS85/74XXX benchmark of combinational circuits.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:58:46 GMT  (585kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3850v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander feldman", "gregory provan", "arjan van gemund"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3850"}
