{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Feb-2017", "title": "DeepCloak: Masking Deep Neural Network Models for Robustness Against Adversarial Samples", "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that deep neural networks (DNN) are vulnerable to adversarial samples: maliciously-perturbed samples crafted to yield incorrect model outputs. Such attacks can severely undermine DNN systems, particularly in security-sensitive settings. It was observed that an adversary could easily generate adversarial samples by making a small perturbation on irrelevant feature dimensions that are unnecessary for the current classification task. To overcome this problem, we introduce a defensive mechanism called DeepMask. By identifying and removing unnecessary features in a DNN model, DeepMask limits the capacity an attacker can use generating adversarial samples and therefore increase the robustness against such inputs. Comparing with other defensive approaches, DeepMask is easy to implement and computationally efficient. Experimental results show that DeepMask can increase the performance of state-of-the-art DNN models against adversarial samples.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 11:48:35 GMT  (209kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v1", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 05:55:00 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v2", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v3", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 16:42:12 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v3", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v4", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 17:18:19 GMT  (289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v4", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v5", "Fri, 10 Mar 2017 00:02:04 GMT  (329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v5", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v6", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 16:26:33 GMT  (388kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v6", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v7", "Sat, 25 Mar 2017 22:16:05 GMT  (394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v7", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"], ["v8", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 21:54:30 GMT  (395kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06763v8", "adversarial samples, deep neural network"]], "COMMENTS": "adversarial samples, deep neural network", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR", "authors": ["ji gao", "beilun wang", "zeming lin", "weilin xu", "yanjun qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06763"}
