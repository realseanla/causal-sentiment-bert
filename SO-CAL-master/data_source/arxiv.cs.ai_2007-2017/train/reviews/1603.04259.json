{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Mar-2016", "title": "Item2Vec: Neural Item Embedding for Collaborative Filtering", "abstract": "Many Collaborative Filtering (CF) algorithms are item-based in the sense that they analyze item-item relations in order to produce item similarities. Recently, several works in the field of Natural Language Processing suggested to learn a latent representation of words using neural embedding algorithms. Among them, the Skip-gram with Negative Sampling (SGNS), also known as Word2Vec, was shown to provide state-of-the-art results on various linguistics tasks. In this paper, we show that item-based CF can be cast in the same framework of neural word embedding. Inspired by SGNS, we describe a method we name Item2Vec for item-based CF that produces embedding for items in a latent space. The method is capable of inferring item-to-item relations even when user information is not available. We present experimental results on large scale datasets that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show it provides a similarity measure that is competitive with SVD.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 13:37:03 GMT  (988kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04259v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 13:45:53 GMT  (989kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04259v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 20:37:53 GMT  (992kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04259v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["oren barkan", "noam koenigstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04259"}
