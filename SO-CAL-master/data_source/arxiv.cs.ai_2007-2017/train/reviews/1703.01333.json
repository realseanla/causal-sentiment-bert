It is increasingly challenging to motivate domain experts to give timely answers. Recently, payment-based CQA services explore new incentive models to engage real-world experts and celebrities by allowing them to set a price on their answers. In this paper, we perform a data-driven analysis on Fenda, a payment-based CQA service that has gained initial success with this incentive model. Using a large dataset of 220K paid questions (worth 1 million USD) over two months, we examine how monetary incentives affect different players in the system and their over-time engagement. Our study reveals several key findings: while monetary incentive enables quick answers from experts, it also drives certain users to aggressively game the systems for profits. In addition, this incentive model turns CQA service into a supplier-driven marketplace where users need to proactively adjust their price as needed. We find famous people are unwilling to lower their price, which in turn hurts their income and engagement-level over time. Based on our results, we discuss the implications to future payment-based CQA design.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 20:36:38 GMT  (1140kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01333v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 01:48:18 GMT  (1840kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01333v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["steve t k jan", "chun wang", "qing zhang", "gang wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01333"}
