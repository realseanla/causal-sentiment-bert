In the era of cognitive computing, beyond search, they could be handled as hypotheses issued for evaluation. Our vision is to leverage on unstructured data and metadata of the rich user-generated multimedia that is often shared as material evidence in favor or against hypotheses in social media platforms. In this paper we present two preliminary experiments along those lines and discuss challenges for a cognitive computing system that collects material evidence from user-generated multimedia towards aggregating it into some form of collective decision on the hypothesis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 10:46:58 GMT  (300kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03652v1", "6 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables in Proc. of the 1st Workshop on Multimedia Support for Decision-Making Processes, at IEEE Intl.
