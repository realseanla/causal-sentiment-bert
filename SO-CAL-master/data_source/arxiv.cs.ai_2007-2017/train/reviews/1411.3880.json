The optimization objective we study asks to minimize the expected total cost till the target set is reached, while ensuring that the target set is reached almost-surely (with probability 1). We show that for integer costs approximating the optimal cost is undecidable. For positive costs, our results are as follows: (i) we establish matching lower and upper bounds for the optimal cost and the bound is double exponential; (ii) we show that the problem of approximating the optimal cost is decidable and present approximation algorithms developing on the existing algorithms for POMDPs with finite-horizon objectives. While the worst-case running time of our algorithm is double exponential, we also present efficient stopping criteria for the algorithm and show experimentally that it performs well in many examples of interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 12:13:45 GMT  (3791kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3880v1", "Full Version of Optimal Cost Almost-sure Reachability in POMDPs, AAAI 2015. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1207.4166by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "Full Version of Optimal Cost Almost-sure Reachability in POMDPs, AAAI 2015. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1207.4166by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["krishnendu chatterjee", "martin chmelik", "raghav gupta", "ayush kanodia"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.3880"}
