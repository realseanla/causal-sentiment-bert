In particular, CEGIO relies on iterative executions to constrain a verification procedure, in order to perform inductive generalization, based on counterexamples extracted from SMT solvers. CEGIO is able to successfully optimize a wide range of functions, including non-linear and non-convex optimization problems based on SMT solvers, in which data provided by counterexamples are employed to guide the verification engine, thus reducing the optimization domain. The present algorithms are evaluated using a large set of benchmarks typically employed for evaluating optimization techniques. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which find the optimal solution in all evaluated benchmarks, while traditional techniques are usually trapped by local minima.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:33:50 GMT  (151kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03738v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["rodrigo f araujo", "higo f albuquerque", "iury v de bessa", "lucas c cordeiro", "joao edgar c filho"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03738"}
