We address two processes: triangulation and construction of junction trees. In the first part, we give a simple algorithm for constructing an optimal junction tree from a triangulated network. In the second part, we argue that any exact method based on local calculations must either be less efficient than the junction tree method, or it has an optimality problem equivalent to that of triangulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:17:36 GMT  (690kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6823v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["finn verner jensen", "frank jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6823"}
