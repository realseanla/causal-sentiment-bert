In this paper, we explicitly formulate the tree building at each LogitBoost iteration as constrained quadratic optimization. Both LogitBoost and ABC-LogtiBoost adopt approximated solver to such quadratic subproblem. We then propose an intuitively more natural solver, i.e. the block coordinate descent algorithm, and demonstrate that it leads to higher classification accuracy and faster convergence rate on a number of public datasets. This new LogitBoost behaves as if it combines many one-vs-one binary classifiers adaptively, hence the name AOSO-LogitBoost(Adaptive One-vs-One LogitBoost)", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2011 08:26:59 GMT  (209kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3907v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 17 May 2012 19:43:06 GMT  (463kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3907v2", "11 pages.
