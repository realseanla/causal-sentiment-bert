Gelisp has two interfaces, a command-line one for Common Lisp and a graphical one for OpenMusic. Using Gelisp, we solved a problem of automatic music generation proposed by composer Michael Jarrell and we found solutions for the All-interval series.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 21:32:13 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02828v1", "7 pages, 2 figures, not published"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 2 figures, not published", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mauricio toro", "camilo rueda", "carlos ag\\'on", "g\\'erard assayag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.02828"}
