{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jun-2011", "title": "A Knowledge Compilation Map", "abstract": "We propose a perspective on knowledge compilation which calls for analyzing different compilation approaches according to two key dimensions: the succinctness of the target compilation language, and the class of queries and transformations that the language supports in polytime. We then provide a knowledge compilation map, which analyzes a large number of existing target compilation languages according to their succinctness and their polytime transformations and queries. We argue that such analysis is necessary for placing new compilation approaches within the context of existing ones. We also go beyond classical, flat target compilation languages based on CNF and DNF, and consider a richer, nested class based on directed acyclic graphs (such as OBDDs), which we show to include a relatively large number of target compilation languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:56:25 GMT  (385kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1819v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["a darwiche", "p marquis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1819"}
