The collection of unique words characterizes the major signature of the document, and forms the basis for Term-Sentence-Matrix (TSM). The Positive Pointwise Mutual Information, which works well for measuring semantic similarity in the Term-Sentence-Matrix, is used in our method to assign weights for each entry in the Term-Sentence-Matrix. The Sentence-Rank-Matrix generated from this weighted TSM, is then used to extract a summary from the document. Our experiments show that such a method would outperform most of the existing methods in producing summaries from large documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 May 2012 09:19:10 GMT  (232kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1638v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["aji s", "ramachandra kaimal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.1638"}
