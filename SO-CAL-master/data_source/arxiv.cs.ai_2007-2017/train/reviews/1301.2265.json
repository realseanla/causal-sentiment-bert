The motivating tasks are 1. evaluating beliefs networks having a large number of deterministic relationships and2. evaluating probabilities of complex boolean querie over a belief network. We propose a parameterized family of variable elimination algorithms that exploit both types of information, and that allows varying levels of constraint propagation inferences. The complexity of the scheme is controlled by the induced-width of the graph {em augmented} by the dependencies introduced by the boolean constraints. Preliminary empirical evaluation demonstrate the effect of constraint propagation on probabilistic computation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:23:13 GMT  (1290kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2265v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rina dechter", "david ephraim larkin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2265"}
