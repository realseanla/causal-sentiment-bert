In particular, we discuss different types of explicit permissive norms that work as exceptions to opposite obligations. Moreover, we show how strong permissions can be represented both with, and without introducing a new consequence relation for inferring conclusions from explicit permissive norms. Finally, we illustrate how a preference operator applicable to contrary-to-duty obligations can be combined with a new operator representing ordered sequences of strong permissions which derogate from prohibitions. The logical system is studied from a computational standpoint and is shown to have liner computational complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 07:36:46 GMT  (61kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0079v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["guido governatori", "francesco olivieri", "antonino rotolo", "simone scannapieco"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.0079"}
