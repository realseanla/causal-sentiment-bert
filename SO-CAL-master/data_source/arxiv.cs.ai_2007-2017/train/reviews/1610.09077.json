{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Oct-2016", "title": "Integrating Topic Models and Latent Factors for Recommendation", "abstract": "The research of personalized recommendation techniques today has mostly parted into two mainstream directions, i.e., the factorization-based approaches and topic models. Practically, they aim to benefit from the numerical ratings and textual reviews, correspondingly, which compose two major information sources in various real-world systems. However, although the two approaches are supposed to be correlated for their same goal of accurate recommendation, there still lacks a clear theoretical understanding of how their objective functions can be mathematically bridged to leverage the numerical ratings and textual reviews collectively, and why such a bridge is intuitively reasonable to match up their learning procedures for the rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 04:20:54 GMT  (1018kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09077v1", "10 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 20:36:43 GMT  (1047kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09077v2", "11 pages, 3 figures, version 2"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["danis j wilson", "wei zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09077"}
