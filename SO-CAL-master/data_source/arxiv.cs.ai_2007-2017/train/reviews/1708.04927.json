The program is a computational embodiment of the scientific method: observation, consideration of candidate theories, and validation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:06:49 GMT  (128kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04927v1", "8 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1706.06975"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1706.06975", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mark a stalzer", "chao ju"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04927"}
