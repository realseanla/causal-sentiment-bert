Categorization of malware samples on the basis of their behaviors is essential for the computer security community in order to group samples belonging to same family. Microsoft released a malware classification challenge in 2015 with a huge dataset of near 0.5 terabytes of data, containing more than 20K malware samples. The analysis of this dataset inspired the development of a novel paradigm that is effective in categorizing malware variants into their actual family groups. This paradigm is presented and discussed in the present paper, where emphasis has been given to the phases related to the extraction, and selection of a set of novel features for the effective representation of malware samples. Features can be grouped according to different characteristics of malware behavior, and their fusion is performed according to a per-class weighting paradigm. The proposed method achieved a very high accuracy ($\\approx$ 0.998) on the Microsoft Malware Challenge dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 15:33:02 GMT  (6463kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04317v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 10:21:15 GMT  (6794kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04317v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI", "authors": ["mansour ahmadi", "dmitry ulyanov", "stanislav semenov", "mikhail trofimov", "giorgio giacinto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04317"}
