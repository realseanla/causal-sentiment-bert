In particular, we establish desirable properties that ABA+ semantics exhibit. These pave way to the satisfaction by ABA+ of some (arguably) desirable principles of preference handling in argumentation and non-monotonic reasoning, as well as non-monotonic inference properties of ABA+ under various semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 10:37:38 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08714v1", "Presented at the 16th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR'16)"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 15:59:11 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08714v2", "Errata added to the paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the 16th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR'16)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kristijonas cyras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08714"}
