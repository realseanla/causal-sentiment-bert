We argue that such encodings can be more interpretable than those obtained in existing frameworks such as Markov logic networks. Among others, this allows for the use of domain experts to improve learned models by directly removing, adding, or modifying logical formulas.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 17:51:56 GMT  (13kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06174v1", "Presented at NIPS 2016 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Complex Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at NIPS 2016 Workshop on Interpretable Machine Learning in Complex Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ondrej kuzelka", "jesse davis", "steven schockaert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06174"}
