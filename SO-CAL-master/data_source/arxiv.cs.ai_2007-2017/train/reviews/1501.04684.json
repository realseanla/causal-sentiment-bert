This engine is released as part of StocPy, a new Turing-Complete probabilistic programming language, available as a Python library. We present a transdimensional generalisation of slice sampling which is necessary for the inference engine to work on traces with different numbers of random variables. We show that StocPy compares favourably to other PPLs in terms of flexibility and usability, and that slice sampling can outperform previously introduced inference methods. Our experiments include a logistic regression, HMM, and Bayesian Neural Net.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 00:24:14 GMT  (933kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04684v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["razvan ranca", "zoubin ghahramani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04684"}
