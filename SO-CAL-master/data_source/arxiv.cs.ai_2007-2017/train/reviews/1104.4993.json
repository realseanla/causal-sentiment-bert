In this article, we study arc consistency, a heavily investigated inference method, and three extensions thereof from the perspective of constraint languages. We conduct a comparison of the studied methods on the basis of which constraint languages they solve, and we present new polynomial-time tractability results for singleton arc consistency, the most powerful method studied.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 18:52:57 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4993v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.LO", "authors": ["hubie chen", "victor dalmau", "berit gru{\\ss}ien"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.4993"}
