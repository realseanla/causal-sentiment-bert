It continues author's previous work on mining behaviour rules of human subjects from experimental data, where game-theoretic predictions partially fail to work. Game-theoretic predictions aka equilibria only tend to success with experienced subjects on specific games, what is rarely given. Apart from game theory, contemporary experimental economics offers a number of alternative models. In relevant literature, these models are always biased by psychological and near-psychological theories and are claimed to be proven by the data. This work introduces a data mining approach to the problem without using vast psychological background. Apart from determinism, no other biases are regarded. Two datasets from different human subject experiments are taken for evaluation. The first one is a repeated mixed strategy zero sum game and the second - repeated ultimatum game. As result, the way of mining deterministic regularities in human strategic behaviour is described and evaluated. As future work, the design of a new representation formalism is discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Nov 2012 11:27:01 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2399v1", "8 pages, no figures, EEML 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, no figures, EEML 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["rustam tagiew"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.2399"}
