LAREX uses a rule based connected components approach which is very fast, easily comprehensible for the user and allows an intuitive manual correction if necessary. The PageXML format is used to support integration into existing OCR workflows. Evaluations showed that LAREX provides an efficient and flexible way to segment pages of early printed books.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 09:48:59 GMT  (1852kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07396v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["christian reul", "uwe springmann", "frank puppe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07396"}
