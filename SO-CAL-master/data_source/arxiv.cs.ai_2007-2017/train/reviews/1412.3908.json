The issue of belief revision has been studied in various formalisms, in particular, in qualitative algebras (QAs) in which the result is a disjunction of belief bases that is not necessarily repre-sentable in a QA. This motivates the study of belief revision in formalisms extending QAs, namely, their propositional clo-sures: in such a closure, the result of belief revision belongs to the formalism. Moreover, this makes it possible to define a contraction operator thanks to the Harper identity. Belief revision in the propositional closure of QAs is studied, an al-gorithm for a family of revision operators is designed, and an open-source implementation is made freely available on the web.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 07:52:28 GMT  (72kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3908v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["valmi dufour-lussier", "alice hermann", "florence le ber", "jean lieber"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.3908"}
