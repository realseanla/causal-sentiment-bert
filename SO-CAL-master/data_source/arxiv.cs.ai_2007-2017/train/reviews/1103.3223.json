It consists of several modules: an ontology based literature search engine, a rule based decision support system, remote sensors interacting with lifestyle interfaces (PDA, monitor touchscreen) and a machine learning module. All these modules interact each other to allow the monitoring of two types of chronic diseases and to help clinician in taking decision for cure purpose. This paper illustrates how some machine learning algorithms and a rule based decision support system can be used in smart devices, to monitor chronic patient. We will analyse how a set of machine learning algorithms can be used in smart devices to alert the clinician in case of a patient health condition worsening trend.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 16:28:00 GMT  (285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3223v1", "presented at \"The Third International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (eTELEMED 2011)\""]], "COMMENTS": "presented at \"The Third International Conference on eHealth, Telemedicine, and Social Medicine (eTELEMED 2011)\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["piero giacomelli", "giulia munaro", "roberto rosso"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.3223"}
