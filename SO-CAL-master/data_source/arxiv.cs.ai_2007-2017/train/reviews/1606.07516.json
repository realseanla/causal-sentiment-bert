We consider distributed gossip protocols which are expressed by means of epistemic logic. We provide an operational semantics of such protocols and set up an appropriate framework to argue about their correctness. Then we analyze specific protocols for complete graphs and for directed rings.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:30:33 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07516v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC cs.LO cs.MA", "authors": ["krzysztof r apt", "davide grossi", "wiebe van der hoek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07516"}
