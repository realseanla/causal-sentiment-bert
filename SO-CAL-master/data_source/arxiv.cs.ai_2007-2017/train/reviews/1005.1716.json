In both areas, conflict-driven learning and related techniques constitute key features whose application is enabled by conflict analysis. Although various conflict analysis schemes have been proposed, implemented, and studied both theoretically and practically in the SAT area, the heuristic aspects involved in conflict analysis have not yet received much attention. Assuming a fixed conflict analysis scheme, we address the open question of how to identify \"good'' reasons for conflicts, and we investigate several heuristics for conflict analysis in ASP solving. To our knowledge, a systematic study like ours has not yet been performed in the SAT area, thus, it might be beneficial for both the field of ASP as well as the one of SAT solving.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 May 2010 05:32:37 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1716v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["christian drescher", "martin gebser", "benjamin kaufmann", "torsten schaub"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.1716"}
