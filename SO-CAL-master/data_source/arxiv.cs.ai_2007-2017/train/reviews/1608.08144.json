Under this approach, after appending a rule or a small group of rules to the emerging program we include a comment that states what has been \"achieved\" so far. This strategy allows us to set out our understanding of the design of the program by describing the roles of small parts of the program in a mathematically precise way.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:59:43 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08144v1", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vladimir lifschitz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08144"}
