While any legally-valid proof of discrimination requires evidence of causality, the state-of-the-art methods are essentially correlation-based, albeit, as it is well known, correlation does not imply causation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 10:31:29 GMT  (2385kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00552v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 08:38:16 GMT  (2385kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00552v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 21:10:10 GMT  (2385kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00552v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["francesco bonchi", "sara hajian", "bud mishra", "daniele ramazzotti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.00552"}
