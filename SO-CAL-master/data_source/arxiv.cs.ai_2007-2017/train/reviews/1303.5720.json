Determining the next best test to perform, given a state of uncertainty about the world, requires a consideration of the value of making all possible sequences of observations. In practice, decision analysts and expert-system designers have avoided the intractability of exact computation of the value of information by relying on a myopic approximation. Myopic analyses are based on the assumption that only one additional test will be performed, even when there is an opportunity to make a large number of observations. We present a nonmyopic approximation for value of information that bypasses the traditional myopic analyses by exploiting the statistical properties of large samples.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:30:51 GMT  (293kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5720v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:55:05 GMT  (388kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5720v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman", "eric j horvitz", "blackford middleton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5720"}
