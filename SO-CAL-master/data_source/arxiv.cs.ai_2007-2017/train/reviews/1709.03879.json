We explain how to reduce universal agent models to operator induction. We propose a universal measure of operator induction fitness, and show how it can be used in a reinforcement learning model and a homeostasis (self-preserving) agent based on the free energy principle. We show that the action of the homeostasis agent can be explained by the operator induction model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 17:45:30 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03879v1", "Third installation of the Ultimate Intelligence series.
