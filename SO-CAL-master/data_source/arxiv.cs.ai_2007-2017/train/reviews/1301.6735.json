One of the major drawbacks of these qualitative networks is their coarse level of detail, which may lead to unresolved trade-offs during inference. We present an enhanced formalism for qualitative networks with a finer level of detail. An enhanced qualitative probabilistic network differs from a regular qualitative network in that it distinguishes between strong and weak influences. Enhanced qualitative probabilistic networks are purely qualitative in nature, as regular qualitative networks are, yet allow for efficiently resolving trade-offs during inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:40 GMT  (259kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6735v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["silja renooij", "linda c van der gaag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6735"}
