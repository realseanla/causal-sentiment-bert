Previously developed process control technologies which are mostly based on a single controller are not efficient in terms of signal transmission delays, processing power for computational needs and signal to noise ratio. Hybrid controller with efficient system modelling is essential to cope with the current challenges of process control in terms of control performance. This paper presents an optimized mathematical modelling and advance hybrid controller (Fuzzy Logic and PID) design along with practical implementation and validation of pH neutralization pilot plant. This procedure is particularly important for control design and automation of Physico-chemical systems for process control industry.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 May 2013 12:17:55 GMT  (1425kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2752v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["oumair naseer", "atif ali khan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2752"}
