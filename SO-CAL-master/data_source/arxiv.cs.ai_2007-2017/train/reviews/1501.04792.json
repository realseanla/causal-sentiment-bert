Our approach is based on the theory of belief functions, using data which are supplied by reports produced by automatic web content assessors that test the validity of criteria defined by the WCAG 2.0 guidelines proposed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) organization. These tools detect errors with gradual degrees of certainty and their results do not always converge. For these reasons, to fuse information coming from the reports, we choose to use an information fusion framework which can take into account the uncertainty and imprecision of infor-mation as well as divergences between sources. Our accessibility indicator covers four categories of deficiencies. To validate the theoretical approach in this context, we propose an evaluation completed on a corpus of 100 most visited French news websites, and 2 evaluation tools. The results obtained illustrate the interest of our accessibility indicator.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:53:27 GMT  (279kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04792v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-christophe dubois", "yolande le gall", "arnaud martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04792"}
