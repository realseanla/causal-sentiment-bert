These operations are natural extensions of the well-known \"action models\" from Dynamic Epistemic Logic. Our \"temporal action models\" may be used to define a number of informational actions that can modify the \"objective\" temporal structure of a model along with the agents' basic and higher-order knowledge and beliefs about this structure, including their beliefs about the time. In essence, this approach provides one way to extend the domain of action model-style operations from atemporal Kripke models to temporal Kripke models in a manner that allows actions to control the flow of time. We present a number of examples to illustrate the subtleties involved in interpreting the effects of our extended action models on temporal Kripke models. We also study preservation of important epistemic-temporal properties of temporal Kripke models under temporal action model-induced operations, provide complete axiomatizations for two theories of temporal action models, and connect our approach with previous work on time in Dynamic Epistemic Logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 18:33:28 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6279v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["bryan renne", "joshua sack", "audrey yap"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.6279"}
