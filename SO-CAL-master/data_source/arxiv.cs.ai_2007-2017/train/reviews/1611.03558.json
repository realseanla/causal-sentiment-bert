We have built two systems for entity discovery and mention detection (MD): one uses the conditional RNNLM and the other one uses the attention-based encoder-decoder framework. The entity linking (EL) system consists of two modules: a rule based candidate generation and a neural networks probability ranking model. Moreover, some simple string matching rules are used for NIL clustering. At the end, our best system has achieved an F1 score of 0.624 in the end-to-end typed mention ceaf plus metric.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 01:21:20 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03558v1", "9 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["dan liu", "wei lin", "shiliang zhang", "si wei", "hui jiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03558"}
