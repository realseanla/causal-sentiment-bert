{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Dec-2016", "title": "Multi-Agent Path Finding with Delay Probabilities", "abstract": "Several recently developed Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) solvers scale to large MAPF instances by searching for MAPF plans on 2 levels: The high-level search resolves collisions between agents, and the low-level search plans paths for single agents under the constraints imposed by the high-level search. We make the following contributions to solve the MAPF problem with imperfect plan execution with small average makespans: First, we formalize the MAPF Problem with Delay Probabilities (MAPF-DP), define valid MAPF-DP plans and propose the use of robust plan-execution policies for valid MAPF-DP plans to control how each agent proceeds along its path. Second, we discuss 2 classes of decentralized robust plan-execution policies (called Fully Synchronized Policies and Minimal Communication Policies) that prevent collisions during plan execution for valid MAPF-DP plans. Third, we present a 2-level MAPF-DP solver (called Approximate Minimization in Expectation) that generates valid MAPF-DP plans.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Dec 2016 23:33:41 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05309v1", "To appear in AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["hang ma 0001", "t k satish kumar", "sven koenig"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.05309"}
