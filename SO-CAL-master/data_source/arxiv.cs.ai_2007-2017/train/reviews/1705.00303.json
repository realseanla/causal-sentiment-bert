After introducing a novel notion of defenses and defense graphs, we propose a defense semantics together with a new notion of defense equivalence of argument graphs, and compare defense equivalence with standard equivalence and strong equivalence, respectively. Then, based on defense semantics, we define two kinds of reasons for accepting arguments, i.e., direct reasons and root reasons, and a notion of root equivalence of argument graphs. Finally, we show how the notion of root equivalence can be used in argumentation summarization.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 12:06:28 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00303v1", "14 pages, first submitted on April 30, 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 15:46:21 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00303v2", "14 pages, first submitted on April 30, 2017; 16 pages, revised in terms of the comments from MIREL2017 on August 03, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, first submitted on April 30, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["beishui liao", "leendert van der torre"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00303"}
