These observations capture various situations pertinent to people's needs and interests along with all their idiosyncrasies. To support human-centered computing that empower people in making better and timely decisions, we look towards computation that is inspired by human perception and cognition. Toward this goal, we discuss computing paradigms of semantic computing, cognitive computing, and an emerging aspect of computing, which we call perceptual computing. In our view, these offer a continuum to make the most out of vast, growing, and diverse data pertinent to human needs and interests. We propose details of perceptual computing characterized by interpretation and exploration operations comparable to the interleaving of bottom and top brain processing.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 16:57:49 GMT  (1585kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05963v1", "13 pages, 4 Figures, IEEE Computer"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 4 Figures, IEEE Computer", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amit sheth", "pramod anantharam", "cory henson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.05963"}
