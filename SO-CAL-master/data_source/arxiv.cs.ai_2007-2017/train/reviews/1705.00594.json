We believe that AI has matured to the point where it should be an accessible technology for everyone. We present an ongoing project whose ultimate goal is to deliver an open source, user-friendly AI system that is specialized for machine learning analysis of complex data in the biomedical and health care domains. We discuss how genetic programming can aid in this endeavor, and highlight specific examples where genetic programming has automated machine learning analyses in previous projects.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 May 2017 17:11:48 GMT  (2999kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00594v1", "14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Genetic Programming Theory and Practice 2017 workshop"], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 17:14:14 GMT  (2550kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00594v2", "14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Genetic Programming Theory and Practice 2017 workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Genetic Programming Theory and Practice 2017 workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC cs.NE", "authors": ["randal s olson", "moshe sipper", "william la cava", "sharon tartarone", "steven vitale", "weixuan fu", "patryk orzechowski", "ryan j urbanowicz", "john h holmes", "jason h moore"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00594"}
