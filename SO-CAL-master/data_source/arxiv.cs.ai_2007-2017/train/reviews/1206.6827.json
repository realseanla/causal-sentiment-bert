In terms of modeling, separable networks has rendered possible siginificant reduction in complexity, as the state space is only linear in the number of variables on the network, in contrast to a typical state space which is exponential. In this work, We describe the connection between an arbitrary Conditional Probability Table (CPT) and separable systems using linear algebra. We give an alternate proof on the equivalence of sufficiency and separability. We present a computational method for testing whether a given CPT is separable.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:41:47 GMT  (127kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6827v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["chalee asavathiratham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6827"}
