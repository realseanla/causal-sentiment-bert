In structured prediction problems, this becomes a daunting task, as the solution space (image labelings, sentence parses, etc.) is exponentially large. We study greedy algorithms for finding a diverse subset of solutions in structured-output spaces by drawing new connections between submodular functions over combinatorial item sets and High-Order Potentials (HOPs) studied for graphical models. Specifically, we show via examples that when marginal gains of submodular diversity functions allow structured representations, this enables efficient (sub-linear time) approximate maximization by reducing the greedy augmentation step to inference in a factor graph with appropriately constructed HOPs. We discuss benefits, tradeoffs, and show that our constructions lead to significantly better proposals.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 20:07:37 GMT  (9246kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1752v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.IR stat.ML", "authors": ["adarsh prasad", "stefanie jegelka", "dhruv batra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.1752"}
