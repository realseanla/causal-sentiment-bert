We consider several multiwinner rules and observe that they induce apportionment methods that are well-established in the literature on proportional representation. For instance, we show that Proportional Approval Voting induces the D'Hondt method and that Monroe's rule induces the largest reminder method. We also consider properties of apportionment methods and exhibit multiwinner rules that induce apportionment methods satisfying these properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 09:47:07 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08691v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["markus brill", "jean-fran\u00e7ois laslier", "piotr skowron"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.08691"}
