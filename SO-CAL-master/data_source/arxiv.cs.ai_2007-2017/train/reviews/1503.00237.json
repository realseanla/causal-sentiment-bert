The robots should cover this spots as far as possible to do cleaning and sampling actions desirably. It means that they should discover the spots cooperatively and spread proportional to the spots area and avoid from remaining idle. We proposed 4 self-organized distributed methods which are called hybrid methods for coping with this scenario. In two different experiments the performance of the methods is analyzed. We compared them with each other and investigated their scalability and robustness in term of single point of failure.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 08:33:28 GMT  (458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00237v1", "A short version of this paper is accepted by AI2015(conference).
