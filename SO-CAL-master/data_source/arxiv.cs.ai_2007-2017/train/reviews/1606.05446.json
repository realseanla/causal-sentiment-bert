Nonetheless, these tools are often very rigid in dealing with with Event Logs that include incomplete information about the process execution. Thus, while the ability of handling incomplete event data is one of the challenges mentioned in the process mining manifesto, the evaluation of compliance of an execution trace still requires an end-to-end complete trace to be performed.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 08:30:28 GMT  (342kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05446v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["federico chesani", "riccardo de masellis", "chiara di francescomarino", "chiara ghidini", "paola mello", "marco montali", "sergio tessaris"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05446"}
