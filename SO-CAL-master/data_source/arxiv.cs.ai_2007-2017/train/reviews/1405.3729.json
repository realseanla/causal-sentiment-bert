Recently, one of the remarkable facts in higher educational institute is the rapid growth data and this educational data is expanding quickly without any advantage to the educational management. The main aim of the management is to refine the education standard; therefore by applying the various data mining techniques on this data one can get valuable information. This research study proposed the \"classification model for the student's enrollment process in higher educational courses using data mining techniques\". Additionally, this study contributes to finding some patterns that are meaningful to management.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 May 2014 02:53:44 GMT  (3712kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3729v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["priyanka saini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3729"}
