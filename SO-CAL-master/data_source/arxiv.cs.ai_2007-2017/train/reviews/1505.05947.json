With a priori knowledge of the environment, global path planning provides a collision-free route through the workspace. The global path plan can be calculated with a variety of informed search algorithms, most notably the A* search method, guaranteed to deliver a complete and optimal solution that minimizes the path cost. Path planning optimization typically looks to minimize the distance traversed from start to goal, yet many mobile robot applications call for additional path planning objectives, presenting a multiobjective optimization (MOO) problem. Past studies have applied genetic algorithms to MOO path planning problems, but these may have the disadvantages of computational complexity and suboptimal solutions. Alternatively, the algorithm in this paper approaches MOO path planning with the use of Pareto fronts, or finding non-dominated solutions. The algorithm presented incorporates Pareto optimality into every step of A* search, thus it is named A*-PO. Results of simulations show A*-PO outperformed several variations of the standard A* algorithm for MOO path planning. A planetary exploration rover case study was added to demonstrate the viability of A*-PO in a real-world application.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 04:35:12 GMT  (3734kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05947v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["alexander lavin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.05947"}
