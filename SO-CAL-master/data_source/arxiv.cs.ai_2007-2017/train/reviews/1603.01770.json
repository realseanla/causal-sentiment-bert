However, deciding about the importance of property features in the input spaces and evaluating the results of conceptual blending is a nontrivial task. In the specific case of musical harmony, defining the salient features of chord transitions and evaluating invented harmonic spaces requires deep musicological background knowledge. In this paper, we propose a creative tool that helps musicologists to evaluate and to enhance harmonic innovation. This tool allows a music expert to specify arguments over given transition properties. These arguments are then considered by the system when defining combinations of features in an idiom-blending process. A music expert can assess whether the new harmonic idiom makes musicological sense and re-adjust the arguments (selection of features) to explore alternative blends that can potentially produce better harmonic spaces. We conclude with a discussion of future work that would further automate the harmonisation process.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Mar 2016 00:06:09 GMT  (201kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01770v1", "8 pp; submitted to 7th International Conference on Computational Creativity"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pp; submitted to 7th International Conference on Computational Creativity", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI", "authors": ["maximos kaliakatsos-papakostas", "roberto confalonieri", "joseph corneli", "asterios zacharakis", "emilios cambouropoulos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01770"}
