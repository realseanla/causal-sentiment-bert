{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2014", "title": "Interactive Cost Configuration Over Decision Diagrams", "abstract": "In many AI domains such as product configuration, a user should interactively specify a solution that must satisfy a set of constraints. In such scenarios, offline compilation of feasible solutions into a tractable representation is an important approach to delivering efficient backtrack-free user interaction online. In particular,binary decision diagrams (BDDs) have been successfully used as a compilation target for product and service configuration. In this paper we discuss how to extend BDD-based configuration to scenarios involving cost functions which express user preferences.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:48:15 GMT  (426kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3830v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["henrik reif", "ersen", "tarik hadzic", "david pisinger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3830"}
