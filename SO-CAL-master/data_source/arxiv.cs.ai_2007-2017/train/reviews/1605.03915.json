Approaches based on reinforcement learning have been proved to be effective. However, the numerical representation of dialog policy is human-incomprehensible and difficult for dialog system designers to verify or modify, which limits its practical application. In this paper we propose a novel framework for optimizing dialog policies specified in domain language using genetic algorithm. The human-interpretable representation of policy makes the method suitable for practical employment. We present learning algorithms using user simulation and real human-machine dialogs respectively.Empirical experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 18:03:38 GMT  (174kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03915v1", "This technical report is an updated version of the conference paper: H.
