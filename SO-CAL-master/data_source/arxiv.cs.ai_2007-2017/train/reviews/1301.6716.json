In this paper we propose a method for improving the efficiency of algorithms for solving Bayesian decision problems. The method is based on the principle of lazy evaluation - a principle recently shown to improve the efficiency of inference in Bayesian networks. The basic idea is to maintain decompositions of potentials and to postpone computations for as long as possible. The efficiency improvements obtained with the lazy evaluation based method is emphasized through examples. Finally, the lazy evaluation based method is compared with the hugin and valuation-based systems architectures for solving symmetric Bayesian decision problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:26 GMT  (335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6716v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anders l madsen", "finn verner jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6716"}
