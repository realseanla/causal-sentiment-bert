{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Apr-2016", "title": "Spatiotemporal Articulated Models for Dynamic SLAM", "abstract": "We propose an online spatiotemporal articulation model estimation framework that estimates both articulated structure as well as a temporal prediction model solely using passive observations. The resulting model can predict future mo- tions of an articulated object with high confidence because of the spatial and temporal structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the predictive model by incorporating it within a standard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipeline for mapping and robot localization in previously unexplored dynamic environments. Our method is able to localize the robot and map a dynamic scene by explaining the observed motion in the world. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both simulated and real-world dynamic environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 19:00:48 GMT  (942kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03526v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["suren kumar", "vikas dhiman", "madan ravi ganesh", "jason j corso"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03526"}
