This technique is used to solve a variant of the popular collective robots problem called foraging. We show with a simulation study how simple interaction rules based on sensations like hunger and loneliness can lead to globally coherent emergent behavior which allows sensor constrained robots to solve the given problem", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 04:42:03 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03175v1", "2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "2009 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["eshwaran vijaya kumar", "debasish ghose"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03175"}
