We present a method to learn from a search log which types of query modifications have and have not been effective in the past. The method analyses query modifications along two dimensions: a traditional term-based dimension and a semantic dimension, for which queries are enriches with linked data entities. Applying the method to the search logs of two search engines, we identify six opportunities for a query modification assistant to improve search: modification strategies that are commonly used, but that often do not lead to satisfactory results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 10:03:45 GMT  (453kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.0128v1", "1st International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2011) in the 20th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2011), Hyderabad, India, March 28th, 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "1st International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2011) in the 20th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2011), Hyderabad, India, March 28th, 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["vera hollink", "arjen de vries"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.0128"}
