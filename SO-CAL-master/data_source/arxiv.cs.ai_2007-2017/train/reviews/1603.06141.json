Our genetic programming algorithm evolves an expression tree that governs the movements of each dog. The operands of the tree are hand-selected features of the simulation environment that may allow the dogs to herd the sheep effectively. The algorithm uses tournament-style selection, crossover reproduction, and a point mutation. We find that the evolved solutions generalize well and outperform a (naive) human-designed algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 20:36:44 GMT  (321kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06141v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["joshua brul\\'e", "kevin engel", "nick fung", "isaac julien"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06141"}
