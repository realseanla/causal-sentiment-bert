Recently, there is an increasing interest in handling inconsistency in DL-Lite as the constraint imposed by a TBox can be easily violated by assertions in ABox in DL-Lite. In this paper, we present a distance-based paraconsistent semantics based on the notion of feature in DL-Lite, which provides a novel way to rationally draw meaningful conclusions even from an inconsistent knowledge base. Finally, we investigate several important logical properties of this entailment relation based on the new semantics and show its promising advantages in non-monotonic reasoning for DL-Lite.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Jan 2013 23:02:34 GMT  (17kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2005v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 14:57:25 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2005v2", "14 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 07:03:58 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2005v3", "17 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xiaowang zhang", "kewen wang", "zhe wang", "yue ma", "guilin qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2005"}
