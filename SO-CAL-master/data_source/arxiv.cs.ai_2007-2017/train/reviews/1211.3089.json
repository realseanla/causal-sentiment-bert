Given an event and an associated large-scale collection of tweets, there are two fundamental research problems that have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One is to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified framework. We evaluate the proposed model both quantitatively and qualitatively on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 19:46:51 GMT  (807kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3089v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1210.2164"], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 05:50:15 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3089v2", "reference error, delete for now"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1210.2164", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["yuheng hu", "ajita john", "fei wang", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": true, "id": "1211.3089"}
