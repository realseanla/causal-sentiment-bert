Then, based on these results, we propose a new neuro-fuzzy computing system which can effectively be implemented on the memristor-crossbar structure. One important feature of the proposed system is that its hardware can directly be trained using the Hebbian learning rule and without the need to any optimization. The system also has a very good capability to deal with huge number of input-out training data without facing problems like overtraining.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Nov 2012 03:51:44 GMT  (1903kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.6205v1", "16 pages, 11 images, submitted to IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy systems"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 11 images, submitted to IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["farnood merrikh-bayat", "farshad merrikh-bayat", "saeed bagheri shouraki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.6205"}
