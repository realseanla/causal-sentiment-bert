We hypothesize that most poker games can be solved as a pattern matching problem, and propose creating a strong poker playing system based on a unified poker representation. Our poker player learns through iterative self-play, and improves its understanding of the game by training on the results of its previous actions without sophisticated domain knowledge. We evaluate our system on three poker games: single player video poker, two-player Limit Texas Hold'em, and finally two-player 2-7 triple draw poker. We show that our model can quickly learn patterns in these very different poker games while it improves from zero knowledge to a competitive player against human experts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 19:05:39 GMT  (610kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06731v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nikolai yakovenko", "liangliang cao", "colin raffel", "james fan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06731"}
