We show how a simple syntactic condition on the appearance of projections and functional dependencies in a knowledge base makes the language decidable without increasing the computational complexity of the basic DLR language.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 10:11:52 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00799v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alessandro artale", "enrico franconi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00799"}
