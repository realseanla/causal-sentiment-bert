By taking advantage of symmetries in the configuration space of multi-robot teams, our methods can significantly reduce the number of collision checks vs. both [Bialkowski, et al.] and standard collision checking implementations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 May 2013 10:06:17 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2299v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["joshua bialkowski", "michael otte", "emilio frazzoli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2299"}
