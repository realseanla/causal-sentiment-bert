In this paper, after the examination of its technical requirements and issues to model complex but practical situation, we propose a new sequential data model, dubbed Duration and Interval Hidden Markov Model (DI-HMM), that efficiently represents \"state duration\" and \"state interval\" of data events. This has significant implications to play an important role in representing practical time-series sequential data. This eventually provides an efficient and flexible sequential data retrieval. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed DI-HMM.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Aug 2015 09:09:45 GMT  (1420kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04928v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hiromi narimatsu", "hiroyuki kasai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04928"}
