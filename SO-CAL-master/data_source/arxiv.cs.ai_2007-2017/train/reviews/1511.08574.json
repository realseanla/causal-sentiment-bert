However, in many situations optimal solutions are simply infeasible, and thus search algorithms that trade solution quality for speed are desirable. In this paper, we formalize the process of classical search as a metalevel decision problem, the Abstract Search MDP. For any given optimization criterion, this establishes a well-defined notion of the best possible behaviour for a search algorithm and offers a theoretical approach to the design of algorithms for that criterion. We proceed to approximately solve a version of the Abstract Search MDP for anytime algorithms and thus derive a novel search algorithm, Search by Maximizing the Incremental Rate of Improvement (SMIRI). SMIRI is shown to outperform current state-of-the-art anytime search algorithms on a parametrized stochastic tree model for most of the tested parameter values.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 07:34:41 GMT  (239kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08574v1", "Submitted to ICAPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICAPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dimitri klimenko", "hanna kurniawati", "marcus gallagher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08574"}
