In this work, we attempt to build computational models that can produce witty descriptions for a given image. Inspired by a cognitive account of humor appreciation, we employ linguistic wordplay, specifically puns. We compare our approach against meaningful baseline approaches via human studies. In a Turing test style evaluation, people find our model's description for an image to be wittier than a human's witty description 55% of the time!", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:22:53 GMT  (7835kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08224v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["arjun chandrasekaran", "devi parikh", "mohit bansal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08224"}
