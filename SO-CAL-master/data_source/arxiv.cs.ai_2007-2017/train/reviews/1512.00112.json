In this work, we address the problem of inferring the polarity of relationships between people in narrative summaries. We formulate the problem as a joint structured prediction for each narrative, and present a model that combines evidence from linguistic and semantic features, as well as features based on the structure of the social community in the text. We also provide a clustering-based approach that can exploit regularities in narrative types. e.g., learn an affinity for love-triangles in romantic stories. On a dataset of movie summaries from Wikipedia, our structured models provide more than a 30% error-reduction over a competitive baseline that considers pairs of characters in isolation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 01:11:46 GMT  (6578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00112v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["shashank srivastava", "snigdha chaturvedi", "tom m mitchell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.00112"}
