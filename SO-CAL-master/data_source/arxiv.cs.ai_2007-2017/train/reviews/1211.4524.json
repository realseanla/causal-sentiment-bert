In our proposed approach, a color distribution model is used to detect changes of target's model . Our proposed approach controls deformation of target's model. If deformation of target's model is larger than a predetermined threshold, then the model will be updated. Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm is used as data association algorithm. We named our proposed method as Deformation Detection Particle Filter (DDPF) . DDPF approach is compared with basic SIR-PF algorithm on real airshow videos. Comparisons results show that, the basic SIR-PF algorithm is not able to track the manoeuvring targets when the rotation or scaling is occurred in target' s model. However, DDPF approach updates target's model when the rotation or scaling is occurred. Thus, the proposed approach is able to track the manoeuvring targets more efficiently and accurately.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 18:07:44 GMT  (1916kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4524v1", "13 pages, 7 Figures, 1 Table"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 7 Figures, 1 Table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["mohammad javad parseh", "saeid pashazadeh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.4524"}
