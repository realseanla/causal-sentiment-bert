In this work, we propose a new neural model which directly predicts bounding box coordinates. The particularity of our contribution lies in the local computations of predictions with a new form of local parameter sharing which keeps the overall amount of trainable parameters low. Key components of the model are spatial 2D-LSTM recurrent layers which convey contextual information between the regions of the image. We show that this model is more powerful than the state of the art in applications where training data is not as abundant as in the classical configuration of natural images and Imagenet/Pascal VOC tasks. We particularly target the detection of text in document images, but our method is not limited to this setting. The proposed model also facilitates the detection of many objects in a single image and can deal with inputs of variable sizes without resizing.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 12:51:18 GMT  (754kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05664v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["bastien moysset", "christoper kermorvant", "christian wolf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05664"}
