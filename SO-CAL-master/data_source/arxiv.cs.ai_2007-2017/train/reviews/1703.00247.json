Humans have successfully developed laws of physics to abstract and model such mechanical phenomena. In the context of artificial intelligence, a recent line of work has focused on estimating physical parameters based on sensory data and use them in physical simulators to make long-term predictions. In contrast, we investigate the effectiveness of a single neural network for end-to-end long-term prediction of mechanical phenomena. Based on extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that such networks can outperform alternate approaches having even access to ground-truth physical simulators, especially when some physical parameters are unobserved or not known a-priori. Further, our network outputs a distribution of outcomes to capture the inherent uncertainty in the data. Our approach demonstrates for the first time the possibility of making actionable long-term predictions from sensor data without requiring to explicitly model the underlying physical laws.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 11:44:18 GMT  (5705kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00247v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["sebastien ehrhardt", "aron monszpart", "niloy j mitra", "andrea vedaldi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00247"}
