We describe these ideas, the initial set of corpora, and some initial experiments done over them.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 11:01:48 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3451v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DL", "authors": ["cezary kaliszyk", "josef urban", "jiri vyskocil", "herman geuvers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3451"}
