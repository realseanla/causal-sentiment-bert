{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Sep-2015", "title": "On Reasoning with RDF Statements about Statements using Singleton Property Triples", "abstract": "The Singleton Property (SP) approach has been proposed for representing and querying metadata about RDF triples such as provenance, time, location, and evidence. In this approach, one singleton property is created to uniquely represent a relationship in a particular context, and in general, generates a large property hierarchy in the schema. It has become the subject of important questions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize the singleton property triples? And how? If the singleton property triples describe a data triple, then how can a reasoner infer this data triple from the singleton property triples? Or would the large property hierarchy affect the reasoners in some way? We address these questions in this paper and present our study about the reasoning aspects of the singleton properties. We propose a simple mechanism to enable existing reasoners to recognize the singleton property triples, as well as to infer the data triples described by the singleton property triples. We evaluate the effect of the singleton property triples in the reasoning processes by comparing the performance on RDF datasets with and without singleton properties. Our evaluation uses as benchmark the LUBM datasets and the LUBM-SP datasets derived from LUBM with temporal information added through singleton properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 12:10:37 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04513v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["vinh nguyen", "olivier bodenreider", "krishnaprasad thirunarayan", "gang fu", "evan bolton", "n\\'uria queralt rosinach", "laura i furlong", "michel dumontier", "amit sheth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04513"}
