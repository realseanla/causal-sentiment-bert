Because of its unstoppable rise towards the future, there are also some discussions about its ethics and safety. Shaping an AI friendly environment for people and a people friendly environment for AI can be a possible answer for finding a shared context of values for both humans and robots. In this context, objective of this paper is to address the ethical issues of AI and explore the moral dilemmas that arise from ethical algorithms, from pre set or acquired values. In addition, the paper will also focus on the subject of AI safety. As general, the paper will briefly analyze the concerns and potential solutions to solving the ethical issues presented and increase readers awareness on AI safety as another related research interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 20:57:36 GMT  (683kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03021v1", "13 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["alice pavaloiu", "utku kose"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03021"}
