Our approach uses finite truth valued {\\L}ukasiewicz logic, where we take advantage of fact what in this type of logics every connective can be define by a neuron in an artificial network having by activation function the identity truncated to zero and one. This allowed the injection of first-order formulas in a network architecture, and also simplified symbolic rule extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 02:05:21 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02774v1", "24 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["carlos leandro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02774"}
