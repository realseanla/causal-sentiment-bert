The methods are anytime algorithms in the sense of Boddy and Dean 1991. Techniques are presented for use with Frisch and Haddawy's [1992] anytime deduction system, with an anytime adaptation of Nilsson's [1986] probabilistic logic, and with a probabilistic database model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:58 GMT  (747kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6837v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael pittarelli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6837"}
