{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Dec-2014", "title": "A note about the generalisation of the C-tests", "abstract": "In this exploratory note we ask the question of what a measure of performance for all tasks is like if we use a weighting of tasks based on a difficulty function. This difficulty function depends on the complexity of the (acceptable) solution for the task (instead of a universal distribution over tasks or an adaptive test). The resulting aggregations and decompositions are (now retrospectively) seen as the natural (and trivial) interactive generalisation of the $C$-tests.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 01:48:10 GMT  (1072kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8529v1", "15 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 00:27:30 GMT  (2262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8529v2", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.8529"}
