Connections between queryanswer causality, consistency-based diagnosis, database repairs (wrt. integrity constraint violations), abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem have been established. In this work we further investigate connections between query-answer causality and abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem. In this context, we also define and investigate the notion of query-answer causality in the presence of integrity constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 20:57:59 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06458v1", "To appear in Proceedings Flairs, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings Flairs, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["babak salimi", "leopoldo bertossi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06458"}
