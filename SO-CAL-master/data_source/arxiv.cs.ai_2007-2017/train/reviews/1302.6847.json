As a consequence of this result it is shown that every probabilistically sound inference rule for CI-model, having at most two antecedents, is derivable from the semigraphoid inference rules. This justifies the use of semigraphoids as approximations of stochastic CI-models in probabilistic reasoning. The list of all 19 potential dominant elements of the mentioned semigraphoid closure is given as a byproduct.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:58 GMT  (1116kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6847v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["milan studeny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6847"}
