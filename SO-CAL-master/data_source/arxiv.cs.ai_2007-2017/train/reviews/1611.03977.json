During the past decades, significant amount of progresses have been made toward this fundamental data mining paradigm. Recent years, as the availability of abundant large-sized and complex observational data, the constrain-based approaches have gradually attracted a lot of interest and have been widely applied to many diverse real-world problems due to the fast running speed and easy generalizing to the problem of causal insufficiency. In this paper, we aim to review the constraint-based causal discovery algorithms. Firstly, we discuss the learning paradigm of the constraint-based approaches. Secondly and primarily, the state-of-the-art constraint-based casual inference algorithms are surveyed with the detailed analysis. Thirdly, several related open-source software packages and benchmark data repositories are briefly summarized. As a conclusion, some open problems in constraint-based causal discovery are outlined for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Nov 2016 09:25:38 GMT  (241kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03977v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 22:33:25 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03977v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to further improvement"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kui yu", "jiuyong li", "lin liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03977"}
