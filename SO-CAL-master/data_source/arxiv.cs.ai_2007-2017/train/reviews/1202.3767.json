The problem is formulated as a linear programming relaxation over the edges of a graph. The resulting program has a constraint structure that allows application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle. Subprograms are defined over individual edges and can be computed in a distributed manner. This accommodates solutions to graphs whose state space does not fit in memory. The decomposition master program is guaranteed to compute the optimal solution in a finite number of iterations, while the solution converges monotonically with each iteration. Formulating the MAP inference problem as a linear program allows additional (global) constraints to be defined; something not possible with message passing algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithm's solution quality outperforms most current algorithms and it scales well to large problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (418kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3767v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joop van de ven", "fabio ramos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3767"}
