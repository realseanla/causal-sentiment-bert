The first algorithm we introduce is Elementwise Probing Algorithm (EPA) which is very fast under a score which utilizes Frobenius Distance. The second algorithm is Additive Reinforcement Learning Algorithm which combines ideas from perceptron algorithm and reinforcement learning algorithm. This algorithm is significantly slower compared to first one, but less restrictive and generalizes better. We compare computational performance of both algorithms and provide numerical results.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Jan 2017 14:19:25 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06167v1", "9 pages, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["\\c{c}a\\u{g}r{\\i} latifo\\u{g}lu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.06167"}
