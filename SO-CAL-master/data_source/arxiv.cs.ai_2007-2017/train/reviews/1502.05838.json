Various kinds of deontic logics are considered for different application domains like argumentation theory, legal reasoning, and acts in multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how standard deontic logic can be used to model ethical codes for multi-agent systems. Furthermore we show how Hyper, a high performance theorem prover, can be used to prove properties of these ethical codes.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Feb 2015 11:38:58 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05838v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1411.4823"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1411.4823", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["ulrich furbach", "claudia schon", "frieder stolzenburg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05838"}
