Automated Machine Learning (ML) models that are trained on verbal utterances of MCI patients can aid diagnosis. Using a combination of skip-gram features, our model learned several linguistic biomarkers to distinguish between 19 patients with MCI and 19 healthy control individuals from the DementiaBank language transcript clinical dataset. Results show that a model with compound of skip-grams has better AUC and could help ML prediction on small MCI data sample.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Nov 2015 03:45:49 GMT  (27kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02436v1", "Accepted to the 2015 NIPS Workshop on Machine Learning in Healthcare"], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 03:25:54 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02436v2", "Accepted and presented at the 2015 NIPS Workshop on Machine Learning in Healthcare (MLHC), Montreal, Canada"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to the 2015 NIPS Workshop on Machine Learning in Healthcare", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["sylvester olubolu orimaye", "kah yee tai", "jojo sze-meng wong", "chee piau wong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02436"}
