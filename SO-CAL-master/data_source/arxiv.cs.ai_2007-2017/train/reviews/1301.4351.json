Our work consists in applying machine learning techniques in order to adapt the information access provided by ubiquitous systems to users when the system only knows the user social group, without knowing anything about the user interest. The adaptation procedures associate actions to perceived situations of the user. Associations are based on feedback given by the user as a reaction to the behavior of the system. Our method brings a solution to some of the problems concerning the acceptance of the system by users when applying machine learning techniques to systems at the beginning of the interaction between the system and the user.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Jan 2013 11:26:54 GMT  (572kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4351v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["djallel bouneffouf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4351"}
