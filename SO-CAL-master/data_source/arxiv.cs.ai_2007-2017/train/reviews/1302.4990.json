This model provides a unified approach for a variety of applications such as dynamic programming, solving sparse linear equations, and constraint propagation. In this framework, the probability model is represented as a generalized relational database. Subsequent probabilistic requests can be processed as standard relational queries. Conventional database management systems can be easily adopted for implementing such an approximate reasoning system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:24:15 GMT  (382kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4990v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael s k m wong", "c j butz", "yang xiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4990"}
