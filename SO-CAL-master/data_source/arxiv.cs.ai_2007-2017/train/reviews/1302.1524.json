On the basis of two characterizations of decomposable models in terms of independence relationships, we develop an exact algorithm for recovering the chordal graphical representation of any given decomposable model. We also propose an algorithm for learning chordal approximations of dependency models isomorphic to general undirected graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:54:02 GMT  (930kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1524v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["luis m de campos", "juan f huete"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1524"}
