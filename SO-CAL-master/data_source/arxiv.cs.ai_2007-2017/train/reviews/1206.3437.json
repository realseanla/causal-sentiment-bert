We provide a short survey over solving asymmetric TSP with CP. Then, we suggest new implied propagators based on general graph properties. We experimentally show that such implied propagators bring robustness to pathological instances and highlight the fact that graph structure can significantly improve search heuristics behavior. Finally, we show that our approach outperforms current state of the art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jun 2012 12:15:31 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3437v1", "Technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DM cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["jean-guillaume fages", "xavier lorca"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3437"}
