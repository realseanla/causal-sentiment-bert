Although binary codes are motivated by their use as direct indices (addresses) into a hash table, codes longer than 32 bits are not being used as such, as it was thought to be ineffective. We introduce a rigorous way to build multiple hash tables on binary code substrings that enables exact k-nearest neighbor search in Hamming space. The approach is straightforward to implement and storage efficient. Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm exhibits sub-linear run-time behavior for uniformly distributed codes. Empirical results show dramatic speed-ups over a linear scan baseline for datasets of up to one billion codes of 64, 128, or 256 bits.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 05:52:21 GMT  (572kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2982v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 15 Dec 2013 02:36:21 GMT  (303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2982v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 25 Apr 2014 01:31:55 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2982v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.DS cs.IR", "authors": ["mohammad norouzi", "ali punjani", "david j fleet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.2982"}
