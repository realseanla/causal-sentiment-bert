For this purpose, an ATMS shall be used (Zurita 1994). An algorithm obtaining the identification of the structure will be suggested (Castro 1995). The minimal structure of the rule (with respect to the number of variables that must appear in the rule) will be found by this algorithm. Furthermore, the identification parameters shall be obtained simultaneously. The proposed method shall be applied for classification to an example. The {em Iris Plant Database} shall be learnt for all three kinds of plants.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:27 GMT  (230kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4935v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["juan luis castro", "jose manuel zurita"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4935"}
