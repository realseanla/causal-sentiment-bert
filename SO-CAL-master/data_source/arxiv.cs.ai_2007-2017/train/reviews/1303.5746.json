The first structure just partitions the focal elements in a body of evidence by their cardinality. With this structure we are able to reduce the complexity on the calculation of the belief functions Bel, Pl, and Q. The other structure proposed here, the Hierarchical Trees, permits us to reduce the complexity of the calculation of Bel, Pl, and Q, as well as of the Dempster's rule of combination in relation to the brute-force algorithm. Both these structures do not require the generation of all the subsets of the reference domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:33:02 GMT  (334kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5746v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sandra sandri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5746"}
