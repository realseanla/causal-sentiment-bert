We present a novel closed pattern mining algorithm with a well-engineered communication protocol, and generalize it to find statistically significant patterns from personal genome data. For distributing communication evenly, it employs global load balancing with multiple stacks distributed on a set of cores organized as a hypercube with random edges. Our algorithm achieved up to 1175-fold speedup by using 1200 cores for solving a problem with 11,914 items and 697 transactions, while the naive approach of separating the search space failed completely.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 06:59:14 GMT  (416kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07787v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI", "authors": ["kazuki yoshizoe", "aika terada", "koji tsuda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07787"}
