We study schemes to train networks from scratch using reduced-precision activations without hurting the model accuracy. We reduce the precision of activation maps (along with model parameters) using a novel quantization scheme and increase the number of filter maps in a layer, and find that this scheme compensates or surpasses the accuracy of the baseline full-precision network. As a result, one can significantly reduce the dynamic memory footprint, memory bandwidth, computational energy and speed up the training and inference process with appropriate hardware support. We call our scheme WRPN - wide reduced-precision networks. We report results using our proposed schemes and show that our results are better than previously reported accuracies on ILSVRC-12 dataset while being computationally less expensive compared to previously reported reduced-precision networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 22:54:38 GMT  (122kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03079v1", "Under submission to CVPR Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "Under submission to CVPR Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["asit mishra", "jeffrey j cook", "eriko nurvitadhi", "debbie marr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03079"}
