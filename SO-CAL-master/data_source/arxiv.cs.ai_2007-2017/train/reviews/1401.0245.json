Management of uncertainty is an intrinsically important issue in the design of expert systems because much of the information in the knowledge base of a typical expert system is imprecise, incomplete or not totally reliable. In this paper, the author present s the review of past work that has been carried out by various researchers based on development of expert systems for the diagnosis of cardiac disease", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jan 2014 03:59:22 GMT  (269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0245v1", "7 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1006.4544by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1006.4544by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["s j gath", "r v kulkarni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.0245"}
