Through this paper, we show that such representations allow for the inclusion of background knowledge that qualitatively describes a state and can be used to design agents that demonstrate learning behavior in domains with large state and actions spaces such as computer games.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 21:36:22 GMT  (263kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6386v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["shiwali mohan", "john e laird"], "accepted": true, "id": "1202.6386"}
