Given a set of facts, constraints, and conditional obligations, we answer the question whether an unconditional obligation is detachable by considering reasons for and against its detachment. For the evaluation of arguments in favor of detaching obligations we use a Dung-style argumentation-theoretical semantics. We illustrate the modularity of the general framework by considering some extensions, and we compare the framework to some related approaches from the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 16:04:47 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00339v1", "This is our submission to DEON 2016, including the technical appendix"]], "COMMENTS": "This is our submission to DEON 2016, including the technical appendix", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mathieu beirlaen", "christian stra{\\ss}er"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00339"}
