To construct a powerful GA, I use edge swapping(ES) with a local search procedure to determine good combinations of building blocks of parent solutions for generating even better offspring solutions. Experimental results on well studied TSP benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed GA is competitive in finding very high quality solutions on instances with up to 16,862 cities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 15:33:35 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4699v1", "5 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["shujia liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4699"}
