To this aim, we provide a definition of a first-order version of TEL that shares the syntax of first-order Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL) but has a different semantics, selecting some LTL models we call \"temporal stable models\". Then, we consider a subclass of theories (called \"splittable temporal logic programs\") that are close to usual logic programs but allowing a restricted use of temporal operators. In this setting, we provide a syntactic definition of \"safe variables\" that suffices to show the property of \"domain independence\" -- that is, addition of arbitrary elements in the universe does not vary the set of temporal stable models. Finally, we present a method for computing the derivable facts by constructing a non-temporal logic program with variables that is fed to a standard ASP grounder. The information provided by the grounder is then used to generate a subset of ground temporal rules which is equivalent to (and generally smaller than) the full program instantiation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 16:11:49 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05811v1", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["felicidad aguado", "pedro cabalar", "mart\\'in di\\'eguez", "gilberto p\\'erez", "concepci\\'on vidal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05811"}
