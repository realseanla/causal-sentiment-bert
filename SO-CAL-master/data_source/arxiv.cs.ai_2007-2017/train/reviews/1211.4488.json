However for some pair of languages there is a considerable lack of them. The long term goal is to construct a Japanese-Spanish parallel corpus to be used for SMT, whereas, there are a lack of useful Japanese-Spanish parallel Corpus. To address this problem, In this study we proposed a method for extracting Japanese-Spanish Parallel Sentences from Wikipedia using POS tagging and Rule-Based approach. The main focus of this approach is the syntactic features of both languages. Human evaluation was performed over a sample and shows promising results, in comparison with the baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 16:38:32 GMT  (135kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4488v1", "International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol.1, No.3, October 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal on Natural Language Computing (IJNLC) Vol.1, No.3, October 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["jessica c ram\\'irez", "yuji matsumoto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.4488"}
