Our dataset is based on the Descriptive Video Service (DVS) that is now encoded on many digital media products such as DVDs. DVS is an audio narration describing the visual elements and actions in a movie for the visually impaired. It is temporally aligned with the movie and mixed with the original movie soundtrack. We describe an automatic DVS segmentation and alignment method for movies, that enables us to scale up the collection of a DVS-derived dataset with minimal human intervention. Using this method, we have collected the largest DVS-derived dataset for video description of which we are aware. Our dataset currently includes over 84.6 hours of paired video/sentences from 92 DVDs and is growing.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 19:22:01 GMT  (603kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01070v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["atousa torabi", "christopher pal", "hugo larochelle", "aaron courville"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01070"}
