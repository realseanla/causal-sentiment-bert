PL-Resolution is a sound and complete algorithm that can be used to determine satisfiability and unsatisfiability with certainty. WalkSAT can determine satisfiability if it finds a model, but it cannot guarantee to find a model even there exists one. However, WalkSAT is much faster than PL-Resolution, which makes WalkSAT more practical; and we have analysis the performance between these two algorithms, and the performance of WalkSAT is acceptable if the problem is not so hard.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 03:48:49 GMT  (163kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6291v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["xili wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.6291"}
