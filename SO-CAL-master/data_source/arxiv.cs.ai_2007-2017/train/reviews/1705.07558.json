The morphological model is used for a hierarchical requirements system (i.e., system parts, design alternatives for the system parts, ordinal estimates for the alternatives). A set of system changes involves changes of the system structure, component alternatives and their estimates. The composition process of the forecast is based on combinatorial synthesis (knapsack problem, multiple choice problem, hierarchical morphological design). An illustrative numerical example for four-phase evolution and forecasting of requirements to communications is described.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 05:22:53 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07558v1", "8 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["mark sh levin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07558"}
