ULSA is many times faster than the prior state of the art on a widely-studied suite of random CSP benchmarks. Unlike the best previous methods for these benchmarks, ULSA is a simple unweighted method that does not require dynamic adaptation of weights or penalties. ULSA obtains new record best solutions satisfying 99 of 100 variables in the challenging frb100-40 benchmark instance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 06:41:22 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7480v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christopher d rosin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.7480"}
