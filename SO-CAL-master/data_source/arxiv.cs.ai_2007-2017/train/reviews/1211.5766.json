The representation of textual data was carried out by a vector model whose components are derived from the overall balancing of the used corpus, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). The WorldNet thesaurus has been used to address the problem of the lemmatization of the words because the representation used in this study is that of the bags of words. Another independent method of the language was used to represent textual records is that of the n-grams. Several measures of similarity have been tested. To validate the classification we have used two measures of assessment based on the recall and precision (f-measure and entropy). The results are promising and confirm the idea to increase the dimension to the problem of the spatiality of the classes. The results obtained in terms of purity class (i.e. the minimum value of entropy) shows that the number of documents over longer believes the results are better for 3D cellular automata, which was not obvious to the 2D dimension. In terms of spatial navigation, cellular automata provide very good 3D performance visualization than 2D cellular automata.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Nov 2012 14:24:01 GMT  (797kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.5766v1", "10 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["reda mohamed hamou", "abdelmalek amine", "ahmed chaouki lokbani", "michel simonet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.5766"}
