Therefore, the ability to accurately predict future features of running business process instances would be a very helpful aid when managing processes, especially under service level agreement constraints. However, making such accurate forecasts is not easy: many factors may influence the predicted features.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 15:42:06 GMT  (984kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07566v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mirko polato", "alessandro sperduti", "rea burattin", "massimiliano de leoni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07566"}
