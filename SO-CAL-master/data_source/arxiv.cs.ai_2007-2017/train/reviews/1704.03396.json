However, it is not perfect in all aspects. Paraconsistent belief revision, multi-agent belief revision and non-prioritized belief revision are three different extensions to AGM to address three important criticisms applied to it. In this article, we propose a framework based on AGM that takes a position in each of these categories. Also, we discuss some features of our framework and study the satisfiability of AGM postulates in this new context.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 16:20:39 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03396v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 May 2017 08:44:14 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03396v2", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["shahab ebrahimi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03396"}
