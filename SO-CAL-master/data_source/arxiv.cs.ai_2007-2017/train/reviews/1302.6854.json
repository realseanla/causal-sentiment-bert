In this paper, we use conditional belief functions to represent such relations in the network and show some relations of these two kinds of representations. We also present a propagation algorithm for such networks. By analyzing the properties of some special evidential networks with conditional belief functions, we show that the reasoning process can be simplified in such kinds of networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:41 GMT  (1493kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6854v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hong xu", "philippe smets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6854"}
