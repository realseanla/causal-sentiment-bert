For example, the population or sample size might not be exactly determinate because of some individuals that partially belong to the population or sample, and partially they do not belong, or individuals whose appurtenance is completely unknown. Also, there are population or sample individuals whose data could be indeterminate. In this book, we develop the 1995 notion of neutrosophic statistics. We present various practical examples. It is possible to define the neutrosophic statistics in many ways, because there are various types of indeterminacies, depending on the problem to solve.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 16:44:49 GMT  (1610kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2000v1", "122 pages, many geometrical figures, many tables"]], "COMMENTS": "122 pages, many geometrical figures, many tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2000"}
