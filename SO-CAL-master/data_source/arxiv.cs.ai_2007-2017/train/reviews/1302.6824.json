This approach involves a special triangulation of the underlying graph, the construction of a junction tree with special properties, and a message passing algorithm operating on the junction tree for computation of expected utilities and optimal decision policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:17:42 GMT  (823kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6824v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["frank jensen", "finn verner jensen", "soren l dittmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6824"}
