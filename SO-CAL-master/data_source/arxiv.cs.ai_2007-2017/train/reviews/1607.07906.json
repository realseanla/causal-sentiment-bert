{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Jul-2016", "title": "Approximation and Parameterized Complexity of Minimax Approval Voting", "abstract": "We present three results on the complexity of Minimax Approval Voting. First, we study Minimax Approval Voting parameterized by the Hamming distance $d$ from the solution to the votes. We show Minimax Approval Voting admits no algorithm running in time $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(2^{o(d\\log d)})$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. This means that the $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(d^{2d})$ algorithm of Misra et al. [AAMAS 2015] is essentially optimal. Motivated by this, we then show a parameterized approximation scheme, running in time $\\mathcal{O}^\\star(\\left({3}/{\\epsilon}\\right)^{2d})$, which is essentially tight assuming ETH. Finally, we get a new polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme for Minimax Approval Voting, which runs in time $n^{\\mathcal{O}(1/\\epsilon^2 \\cdot \\log(1/\\epsilon))} \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(m)$, almost matching the running time of the fastest known PTAS for Closest String due to Ma and Sun [SIAM J. Comp. 2009].", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Jul 2016 22:06:51 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07906v1", "14 pages, 3 figures, 2 pseudocodes"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 3 figures, 2 pseudocodes", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["marek cygan", "lukasz kowalik", "arkadiusz socala", "krzysztof sornat"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.07906"}
