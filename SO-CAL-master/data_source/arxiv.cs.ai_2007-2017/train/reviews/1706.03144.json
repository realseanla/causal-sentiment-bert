A pruned version of visibility graph based on Candidate Vertices is formulated, followed by a new visibility check technique. Such combination enables us to quickly identify the useful vertices and thus find the optimal path more efficiently. The algorithm proposed is demonstrated on various path-finding cases. The performance of the new technique on visibility graphs is compared to the traditional A* on Grids, Theta* and A* on Visibility Graphs in terms of path length, number of nodes evaluated, as well as computational time. The key algorithmic contribution is that the new approach combines the merits of grid-based method and visibility graph-based method and thus yields better overall performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 22:19:12 GMT  (1804kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03144v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pei cao", "zhaoyan fan", "robert x gao", "jiong tang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03144"}
