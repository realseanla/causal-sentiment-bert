We propose a novel evaluation framework based on the formal notion of MacGyver Test which provides a practical way for assessing the resilience and resourcefulness of artificial agents.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 21:05:27 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08350v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vasanth sarathy", "matthias scheutz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08350"}
