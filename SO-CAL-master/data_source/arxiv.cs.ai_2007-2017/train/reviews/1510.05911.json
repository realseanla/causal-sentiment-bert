It is important and necessary, therefore, to enhance our ability to computationally determine whether some statement of fact is true or false. We view this problem as a link-prediction task in a knowledge graph, and show that a new model of the top discriminative predicate paths is able to understand the meaning of some statement and accurately determine its veracity. We evaluate our approach by examining thousands of claims related to history, geography, biology, and politics using a public, million node knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia and PubMedDB. Not only does our approach significantly outperform related models, we also find that the discriminative predicate path model is easily interpretable and provides sensible reasons for the final determination.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 14:31:31 GMT  (634kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05911v1", "15 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 14:43:30 GMT  (515kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05911v2", "17 pages, 4 Figures.
