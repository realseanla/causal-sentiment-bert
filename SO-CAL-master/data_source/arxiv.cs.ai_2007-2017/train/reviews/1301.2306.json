A graphical model is developed that represents the simultaneous evolution of tempo and rhythm and relates these hidden quantities to observations. The rhythm variables are discrete and the tempo and observation variables are continuous. We show how to compute the globally most likely configuration of the tempo and rhythm variables given an observation of note onset times. Preliminary experiments are presented on a small data set. A generalization to arbitrary conditional Gaussian distributions is outlined.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:12 GMT  (1287kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2306v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SD", "authors": ["christopher s raphael"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2306"}
