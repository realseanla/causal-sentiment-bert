Meanwhile, robotics (among other fields) can often only use a few dozen data points because acquiring them involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming. How can an algorithm learn with only a few data points?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 12:29:05 GMT  (324kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00946v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-baptiste mouret"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00946"}
