Variational methods are deterministic procedures that provide approximations to marginal and conditional probabilities of interest. They provide alternatives to approximate inference methods based on stochastic sampling or search. We describe a variational approach to the problem of diagnostic inference in the `Quick Medical Reference' (QMR) network. The QMR network is a large-scale probabilistic graphical model built on statistical and expert knowledge. Exact probabilistic inference is infeasible in this model for all but a small set of cases. We evaluate our variational inference algorithm on a large set of diagnostic test cases, comparing the algorithm to a state-of-the-art stochastic sampling method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:53:36 GMT  (166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5462v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["t s jaakkola", "m i jordan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5462"}
