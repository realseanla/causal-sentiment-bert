To better understand this issue, we study the problem of learning over a continuum of data, where the model observes, once and one by one, examples concerning an ordered sequence of tasks. First, we propose a set of metrics to evaluate models learning over a continuum of data. These metrics characterize models not only by their test accuracy, but also in terms of their ability to transfer knowledge across tasks. Second, we propose a model to learn over continuums of data, called Gradient of Episodic Memory (GEM), which alleviates forgetting while allowing beneficial transfer of knowledge to previous tasks. Our experiments on variants of the MNIST and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate the strong performance of GEM when compared to the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 14:53:34 GMT  (2190kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08840v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 28 Jun 2017 16:19:12 GMT  (2190kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08840v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 12 Jul 2017 17:14:59 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08840v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 20:37:51 GMT  (1852kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.08840v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["david lopez-paz", "marc'aurelio ranzato"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.08840"}
