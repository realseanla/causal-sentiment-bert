It was shown that SP estimates marginals over covers that represent clusters of solutions. The SP-y algorithm generalizes SP to work on the maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) problem, but the cover interpretation of SP does not generalize to SP-y. In this paper, we formulate the relaxed survey propagation (RSP) algorithm, which extends the SP algorithm to apply to the weighted Max-SAT problem. We show that RSP has an interpretation of estimating marginals over covers violating a set of clauses with minimal weight. This naturally generalizes the cover interpretation of SP. Empirically, we show that RSP outperforms SP-y and other state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers on random Max-SAT instances. RSP also outperforms state-of-the-art weighted Max-SAT solvers on random weighted Max-SAT instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:36:10 GMT  (809kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3483v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hai leong chieu", "wee sun sun lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3483"}
