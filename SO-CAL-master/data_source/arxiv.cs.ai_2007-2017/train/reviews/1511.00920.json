It is finding its way to a larger public but is still facing practical challenges. Adoption of new languages requires a newcomer-friendly way for users to interact with it. Both an online presence to try to convince potential users to download the system and offline availability to develop larger applications are essential. We developed an IDE which can serve both purposes through the use of web technology. It enables us to provide the user with a modern IDE with relatively little effort.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:30:10 GMT  (862kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00920v1", "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 21-32, August 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 21-32, August 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["ingmar dasseville", "gerda janssens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00920"}
