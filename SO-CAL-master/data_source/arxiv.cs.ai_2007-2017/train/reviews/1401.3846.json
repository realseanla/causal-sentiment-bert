However, prior BDD based techniques in- cur the significant overhead of constructing and manipulating graphs during search. We present a set-constraint solver which combines BDD-based set-bounds propagators with the learning abilities of a modern SAT solver. Together with a number of improvements beyond the basic algorithm, this solver is highly competitive with existing propagation based set constraint solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:56:56 GMT  (577kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3846v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["graeme gange", "peter james stuckey", "vitaly lagoon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3846"}
