If the set of constraints is unsatisfiable, one may ask for a minimal description of the reason for this unsatisifi- ability. Minimal unsatisifable subsets (MUSes) and maximal satisifiable subsets (MSSes) are two kinds of such minimal descriptions. The goal of this work is the enumeration of MUSes and MSSes for a given constraint system. As such full enumeration may be intractable in general, we focus on building an online algorithm, which produces MUSes/MSSes in an on-the-fly manner as soon as they are discovered. The problem has been studied before even in its online version. However, our algorithm uses a novel approach that is able to outperform current state-of-the art algorithms for online MUS/MSS enumeration. Moreover, the performance of our algorithm can be adjusted using tunable parameters. We evaluate the algorithm on a set of benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 12:24:35 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03289v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["jaroslav bendik", "nikola benes", "ivana cerna", "jiri barnat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03289"}
