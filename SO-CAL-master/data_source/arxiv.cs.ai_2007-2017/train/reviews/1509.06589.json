Any WL test comprises a relabelling phase of the nodes based on test-specific information extracted from the graph, for example the set of neighbours of a node. We defined a novel relabelling and derived two kernels of the framework from it. The novel kernels are very fast to compute and achieve state-of-the-art results on five real-world datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 13:21:08 GMT  (120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06589v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["giovanni da san martino", "nicol\\`o navarin", "alessandro sperduti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06589"}
