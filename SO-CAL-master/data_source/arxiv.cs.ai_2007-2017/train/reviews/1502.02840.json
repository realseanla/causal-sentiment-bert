Driven by this analysis we define a composition framework by means of integration with fine-grained I/O service discovery that enables the generation of a graph-based composition which contains the set of services that are semantically relevant for an input-output request. The proposed framework also includes an optimal composition search algorithm to extract the best composition from the graph minimising the length and the number of services, and different graph optimisations to improve the scalability of the system. A practical implementation used for the empirical analysis is also provided. This analysis proves the scalability and flexibility of our proposal and provides insights on how integrated composition systems can be designed in order to achieve good performance in real scenarios for the Web.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Feb 2015 10:25:33 GMT  (411kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02840v1", "Accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Services Computing 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["pablo rodriguez-mier", "carlos pedrinaci", "manuel lama", "manuel mucientes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02840"}
