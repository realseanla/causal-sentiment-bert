The adoption of a Vector Symbolic representation ensures a one-layered design for the approach, while maintaining the previously reported properties and performance characteristics of Hierarchical Graph Neuron, and also improving the noise resistance of the architecture. The proposed architecture enables a linear (with respect to the number of stored entries) time search for an arbitrary sub-pattern.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 19:25:32 GMT  (606kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03784v1", "9 pages, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 13 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["denis kleyko", "evgeny osipov", "alexander senior", "asad i khan", "y ahmet \\c{s}ekercio\\u{g}lu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03784"}
