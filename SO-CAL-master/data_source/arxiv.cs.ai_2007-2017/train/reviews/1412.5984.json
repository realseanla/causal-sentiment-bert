Moreover, in the context of pattern set mining, exhaustive search methods are not applicable due to the large search space they have to explore. In this paper, we propose the application of stochastic local search to solve the pattern set mining. Specifically, to the task of concept learning. We applied a number of local search algorithms on a standard benchmark instances for pattern set mining and the results show the potentials for further exploration.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:16:52 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5984v1", "The 8th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "The 8th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["muktadir hossain", "tajkia tasnim", "swakkhar shatabda", "dewan m farid"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5984"}
