In the past two years, we have witnessed an explosion of work that brings together vision and language from images to videos and beyond. The available corpora have played a crucial role in advancing this area of research. In this paper, we propose a set of quality metrics for evaluating and analyzing the vision &amp; language datasets and classify them accordingly. Our analyses show that the most recent datasets have been using more complex language and more abstract concepts, however, there are different strengths and weaknesses in each.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 00:59:27 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06833v1", "In submission to EMNLP 2015 short.
