Although several measures have been proposed throughout the years, no research has been done to validate whether these measures achieve the intended aim of quantifying over-approximation in a consistent way for all models and logs. This paper fills this gap by postulating a number of axioms for quantifying precision consistently for any log and any model. Further, we show through counter-examples that none of the existing measures consistently quantifies precision.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 May 2017 11:50:45 GMT  (24kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03303v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 16 May 2017 18:44:59 GMT  (24kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03303v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.LO cs.SE", "authors": ["niek tax", "xixi lu", "natalia sidorova", "dirk fahland", "wil m p van der aalst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03303"}
