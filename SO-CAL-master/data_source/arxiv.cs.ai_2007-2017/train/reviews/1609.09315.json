{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Sep-2016", "title": "Semantic Parsing with Semi-Supervised Sequential Autoencoders", "abstract": "We present a novel semi-supervised approach for sequence transduction and apply it to semantic parsing. The unsupervised component is based on a generative model in which latent sentences generate the unpaired logical forms. We apply this method to a number of semantic parsing tasks focusing on domains with limited access to labelled training data and extend those datasets with synthetically generated logical forms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 12:20:13 GMT  (807kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09315v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["tom\u00e1s kocisk\u00fd", "g\u00e1bor melis", "edward grefenstette", "chris dyer", "wang ling", "phil blunsom", "karl moritz hermann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.09315"}
