The purpose of ATP is to design a system which can automatically figure out an algorithm either to prove or disprove a mathematical claim, on the basis of a set of given premises, using a set of fundamental postulates and following the method of logical inference. In this paper, we propose GraATP, a generalized framework for automated theorem proving in plane geometry. Our proposed method translates the geometric entities into nodes of a graph and the relations between them as edges of that graph. The automated system searches for different ways to reach the conclusion for a claim via graph traversal by which the validity of the geometric theorem is examined.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 18:10:03 GMT  (151kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5980v1", "The 8th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "The 8th International Conference on Software, Knowledge, Information Management and Applications (SKIMA 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohammad murtaza mahmud", "swakkhar shatabda", "mohammad nurul huda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5980"}
