{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Feb-2015", "title": "Path Finding under Uncertainty through Probabilistic Inference", "abstract": "We introduce a new approach to solving path-finding problems under uncertainty by representing them as probabilistic models and applying domain-independent inference algorithms to the models. This approach separates problem representation from the inference algorithm and provides a framework for efficient learning of path-finding policies. We evaluate the new approach on the Canadian Traveler Problem, which we formulate as a probabilistic model, and show how probabilistic inference allows high performance stochastic policies to be obtained for this problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 19:21:04 GMT  (124kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07314v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 2 May 2015 21:53:39 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07314v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 05:02:53 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07314v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david tolpin", "brooks paige", "jan willem van de meent", "frank wood"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.07314"}
