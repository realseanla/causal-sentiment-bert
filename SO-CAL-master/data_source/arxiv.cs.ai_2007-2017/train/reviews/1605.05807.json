In this work, we show that this formulation subsumes the standard formulation of Plan Recognition over libraries through a compilation of libraries into STRIPS theories. The libraries correspond to AND/OR graphs that may be cyclic and where children of AND nodes may be partially ordered. These libraries include Context-Free Grammars as a special case, where the Plan Recognition problem becomes a parsing with missing tokens problem. Plan Recognition over the standard libraries become", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 May 2016 04:22:35 GMT  (47kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05807v1", "Written: June 2009, Published: May 2016"], ["v2", "Sun, 22 May 2016 23:02:35 GMT  (47kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05807v2", "Written: June 2009, Published: May 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Written: June 2009, Published: May 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["miquel ramirez", "hector geffner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.05807"}
