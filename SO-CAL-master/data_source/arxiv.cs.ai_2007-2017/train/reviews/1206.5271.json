However, these heuristics also restrict the types of relationships that can be learned exclusively from data. They are unable to learn relationships that exhibit \"correlation-immunity\", such as parity. To learn Bayesian networks in the presence of correlation-immune relationships, we extend the Sparse Candidate algorithm with a technique called \"skewing\". This technique uses the observation that relationships that are correlation-immune under a specific input distribution may not be correlation-immune under another, sufficiently different distribution. We show that by extending Sparse Candidate with this technique we are able to discover relationships between random variables that are approximately correlation-immune, with a significantly lower computational cost than the alternative of considering multiple parents of a node at a time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 15:05:10 GMT  (503kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5271v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["eric lantz", "soumya ray", "david page"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.5271"}
