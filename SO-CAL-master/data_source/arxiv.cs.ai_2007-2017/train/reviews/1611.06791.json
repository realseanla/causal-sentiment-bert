Dropout is one such regularizer that is widely used among Deep Learning practitioners. Recent work has shown that Dropout can also be viewed as performing Approximate Bayesian Inference over the network parameters. In this work, we generalize this notion and introduce a rich family of regularizers which we call Generalized Dropout. One set of methods in this family, called Dropout++, is a version of Dropout with trainable parameters. Classical Dropout emerges as a special case of this method. Another member of this family selects the width of neural network layers. Experiments show that these methods help in improving generalization performance over Dropout.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:06:48 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06791v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["suraj srinivas", "r venkatesh babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06791"}
