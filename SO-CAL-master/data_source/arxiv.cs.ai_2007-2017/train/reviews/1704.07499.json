This paper presents a patient based predictive modeling framework (PPMF) to improve the performance of ICU mortality prediction using data collected during the first 48 hours of ICU admission. PPMF consists of three main components verifying three related research hypotheses. The first component captures dynamic changes of patients status in the ICU using their time series data (e.g., vital signs and laboratory tests). The second component is a local approximation algorithm that classifies patients based on their similarities. The third component is a Gradient Decent wrapper that updates feature weights according to the classification feedback. Experiments using data from MIMICIII show that PPMF significantly outperforms: (1) the severity score systems, namely SASP III, APACHE IV, and MPM0III, (2) the aggregation based classifiers that utilize summarized time series, and (3) baseline feature selection methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:27:00 GMT  (318kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07499v1", "10 pages, Healthcare Analytics and Medical Decision Making, INFORMS Workshop.
