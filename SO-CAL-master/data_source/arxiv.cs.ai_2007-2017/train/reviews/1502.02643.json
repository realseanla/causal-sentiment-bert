The problem is known to be solvable in polynomial time, but general purpose algorithms have high running times and are unsuitable for large-scale problems. Recent work have used convex optimization techniques to obtain very practical algorithms for minimizing functions that are sums of ``simple\" functions. In this paper, we use random coordinate descent methods to obtain algorithms with faster linear convergence rates and cheaper iteration costs. Compared to alternating projection methods, our algorithms do not rely on full-dimensional vector operations and they converge in significantly fewer iterations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 20:31:18 GMT  (390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02643v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["alina ene", "huy l nguyen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.02643"}
