Measure-by-measure updating of such a set of measures upon acquiring new information is well-known to suffer from problems; agents are not always able to learn appropriately. To deal with these problems, we propose using weighted sets of probabilities: a representation where each measure is associated with a weight, which denotes its significance. We describe a natural approach to updating in such a situation and a natural approach to determining the weights. We then show how this representation can be used in decision-making, by modifying a standard approach to decision making -- minimizing expected regret -- to obtain minimax weighted expected regret (MWER). We provide an axiomatization that characterizes preferences induced by MWER both in the static and dynamic case.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Feb 2013 20:11:12 GMT  (189kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5681v1", "Full version of an article [arXiv:1210.4853] that appeared in UAI '12"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of an article [arXiv:1210.4853] that appeared in UAI '12", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph y halpern", "samantha leung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.5681"}
