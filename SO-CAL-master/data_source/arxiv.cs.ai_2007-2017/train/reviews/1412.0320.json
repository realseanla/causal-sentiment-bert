In this paper we address the question of whether CP are \\emph{succinctly incomparable} with \\emph{propositional formulas} (PF). Our main result shows that the PARITY problem, which can be polynomially represented in PF but \\emph{only} has exponential representations in CP. In other words, PARITY \\emph{separates} PF from CP. Simply speaking, this means that exponential size blowup is generally inevitable when translating a set of formulas in PF into an equivalent program in CP (without introducing new variables). Furthermore, since it has been shown by Lifschitz and Razborov that there is also a problem that separates CP from PF (assuming $\\mathsf{P}\\nsubseteq \\mathsf{NC^1/poly}$), it follows that CP and PF are indeed succinctly incomparable. From the view of the theory of computation, the above result may also be considered as the separation of two \\emph{models of computation}, i.e., we identify a language in $\\mathsf{NC^1/poly}$ which is not in the set of languages computable by polynomial size CP programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 01:10:30 GMT  (97kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0320v1", "This is an extended version of a conference paper with the same name in KR2014"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Jan 2015 11:47:04 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0320v2", "This is an extended version of a conference paper with the same name in KR2014"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version of a conference paper with the same name in KR2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["yuping shen", "xishun zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.0320"}
