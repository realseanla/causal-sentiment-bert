Knowledge representation is a fundamental field that dedicate to representing information about the world in a form that computer systems can utilize to solve complex tasks. The proposed Neural Knowledge DNA is designed to support discovering, storing, reusing, improving, and sharing knowledge among machines and organisation. It is constructed in a similar fashion of how DNA formed: built up by four essential elements. As the DNA produces phenotypes, the Neural Knowledge DNA carries information and knowledge via its four essential elements, namely, Networks, Experiences, States, and Actions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Feb 2016 08:45:35 GMT  (431kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08571v1", "8 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["haoxi zhang", "cesar sanin", "edward szczerbicki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08571"}
