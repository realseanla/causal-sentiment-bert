We show that the range of compatibility between the classical deductive closure and uncertain reasoning covers precisely the nonmonotonic 'preferential' inference system of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor and nothing else. In terms of uncertain reasoning any possibility or necessity measure gives birth to a structure of accepted beliefs. The classes of probability functions and of Shafer's belief functions which yield belief sets prove to be very special ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:03:26 GMT  (358kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7371v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["didier dubois", "helene fargier", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7371"}
