Our approach is based on an order-of-magnitude approximation of both probabilities and utilities and allows for specifying partially ordered preferences via sets of utility values. We also propose a dedicated variable elimination algorithm that can be applied for solving order-of-magnitude influence diagrams.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (425kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3745v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["radu marinescu", "nic wilson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3745"}
