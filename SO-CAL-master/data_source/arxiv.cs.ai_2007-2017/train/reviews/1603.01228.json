As a result, a number of elementary theorems can be proven by using GeoGebra's intuitive user interface on various computer architectures including native Java and web based systems with JavaScript. We also provide a test suite for benchmarking our results with 200 test cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 19:29:08 GMT  (241kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01228v1", "22 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["zolt\\'an kov\\'acs", "csilla s\\'olyom-gecse"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01228"}
