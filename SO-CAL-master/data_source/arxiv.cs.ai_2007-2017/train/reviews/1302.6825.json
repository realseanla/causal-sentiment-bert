The removal of a small number of links may reduce the computational complexity dramatically, since several fill-ins and moral links may be rendered superfluous by the removal. The method is described in terms of impact on the independence graph, the junction tree, and the potential functions associated with these. An empirical evaluation of the method using large real-world networks demonstrates the applicability of the method. Further, the method, which has been implemented in Hugin, complements the approximation method suggested by Jensen &amp; Andersen (1990).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:17:48 GMT  (949kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6825v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["uffe kj{\\ae}rulff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6825"}
