In this paper, we present \\texttt{VolCE}, a tool for counting the solutions of SMT constraints, or in other words, for computing the volume of the solution space. Its input is essentially a set of Boolean combinations of linear constraints, where the numeric variables are either all integers or all reals, and each variable is bounded. The tool extends SMT solving with integer solution counting and volume computation/estimation for convex polytopes. Effective heuristics are adopted, which enable the tool to deal with high-dimensional problem instances efficiently and accurately.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 08:06:33 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00142v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["cunjing ge", "feifei ma", "jian zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1507.00142"}
