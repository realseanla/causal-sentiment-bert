The system has a critical shortcoming in that it does not sanction inheritance across exceptional subclasses. In this paper we propose an extension to System Z+ that rectifies this shortcoming by extracting additional conditions between worlds from the defaults database. We show that the additional constraints do not change the notion of the consistency of a database. We also make comparisons with competing default reasoning systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:04 GMT  (807kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6848v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sek-wah tan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6848"}
