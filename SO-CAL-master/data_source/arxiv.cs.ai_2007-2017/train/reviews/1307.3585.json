Despite bad worst-case computational complexity results, various MUC- finding approaches that appear tractable for many real-life instances have been proposed. Many of them are based on the successive identification of so-called transition constraints. In this respect, we show how local search can be used to possibly extract additional transition constraints at each main iteration step. The approach is shown to outperform a technique based on a form of model rotation imported from the SAT-related technology and that also exhibits additional transi- tion constraints. Our extensive computational experimentations show that this en- hancement also boosts the performance of state-of-the-art DC(WCORE)-like MUC extractors.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Jul 2013 21:28:05 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3585v1", "17 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms, 33 references"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms, 33 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["\\'eric gr\\'egoire", "jean-marie lagniez", "bertrand mazure"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3585"}
