It concerns about three aspects such as tournament conducting cost, competitiveness development and ranking precision. It then proposes a new method using progress tree to detect potential throwaway matches. The analysis performed using the proposed method reveals the strengths and weaknesses of tournament structures. As a conclusion, single elimination is best if we want to qualify one winner only, all matches conducted are exciting in term of competitiveness. Double elimination with proper seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify more winners. A reasonable number of extra matches need to be conducted in exchange of being able to qualify top four winners. Round-robin gives reliable ranking precision for all participants. However, its conduction cost is very high, and it fails to maintain competitiveness development.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 07:09:16 GMT  (386kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08499v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nhien pham hoang bao", "hiroyuki iida"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08499"}
