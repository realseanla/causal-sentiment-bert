In this paper, I describe the applications of causality to formal verification, namely, explanation of counterexamples, refinement of coverage metrics, and symbolic trajectory evaluation. I also briefly discuss recent applications of causality to legal reasoning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 01:35:46 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07879v1", "In Proceedings CREST 2016,arXiv:1608.07398.
