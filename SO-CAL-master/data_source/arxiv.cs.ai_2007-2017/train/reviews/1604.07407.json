While costly in terms of time and organization effort, group discussions are commonly seen as a way of reaching better decisions compared to solutions that do not require coordination between the individuals (e.g. voting)---through discussion, the sum becomes greater than the parts. However, this assumption is not irrefutable: anecdotal evidence of wasteful discussions abounds, and in our own experiments we find that over 30% of discussions are unproductive.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Apr 2016 20:00:02 GMT  (165kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.07407v1", "To appear at NAACL-HLT 2016. 11pp, 5 fig.
