{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Feb-2013", "title": "Conditioning Methods for Exact and Approximate Inference in Causal Networks", "abstract": "We present two algorithms for exact and approximate inference in causal networks. The first algorithm, dynamic conditioning, is a refinement of cutset conditioning that has linear complexity on some networks for which cutset conditioning is exponential. The second algorithm, B-conditioning, is an algorithm for approximate inference that allows one to trade-off the quality of approximations with the computation time. We also present some experimental results illustrating the properties of the proposed algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:47 GMT  (308kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4939v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["adnan darwiche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4939"}
