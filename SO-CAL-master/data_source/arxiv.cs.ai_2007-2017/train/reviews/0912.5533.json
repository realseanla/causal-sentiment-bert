This work received substantial interest amongst the qualitative spatial reasoning community. However, it turned out to be difficult to establish a sound constraint calculus based on these relations. In this paper, we present the results of a new investigation into dipole constraint calculi which uses algebraic methods to derive sound results on the composition of relations and other properties of dipole calculi. Our results are based on a condensed semantics of the dipole relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 20:38:12 GMT  (2026kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.5533v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["reinhard moratz", "dominik l\\\"ucke", "till mossakowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.5533"}
