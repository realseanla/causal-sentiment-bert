{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Dec-2012", "title": "Compositional Stochastic Modeling and Probabilistic Programming", "abstract": "Probabilistic programming is related to a compositional approach to stochastic modeling by switching from discrete to continuous time dynamics. In continuous time, an operator-algebra semantics is available in which processes proceeding in parallel (and possibly interacting) have summed time-evolution operators. From this foundation, algorithms for simulation, inference and model reduction may be systematically derived. The useful consequences are potentially far-reaching in computational science, machine learning and beyond. Hybrid compositional stochastic modeling/probabilistic programming approaches may also be possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Dec 2012 23:05:30 GMT  (273kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0582v1", "Extended Abstract for the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Workshop on Probabilistic Programming, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended Abstract for the Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) Workshop on Probabilistic Programming, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["eric mjolsness"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.0582"}
