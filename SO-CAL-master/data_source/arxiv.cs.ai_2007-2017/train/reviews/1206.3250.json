We provide an algorithm that computes intervention sets that we believe are optimal for the above task. The algorithm builds on insights gained from the worst case analysis in Eberhardt et al. (2005) for sequences of experiments when all possible directed acyclic graphs over N variables are considered. A simulation suggests that our conjecture is correct. We also show that a generalization of our conjecture to other classes of possible graph hypotheses cannot be given easily, and in what sense the algorithm is then no longer optimal.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:10:21 GMT  (164kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3250v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["frederick eberhardt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3250"}
