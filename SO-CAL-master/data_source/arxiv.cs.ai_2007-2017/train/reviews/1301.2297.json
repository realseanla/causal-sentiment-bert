We present a case study in the construction of a BN in anintelligent tutoring application, specifically decimal misconceptions. Wedescribe the BN construction using expert elicitation and then investigate how certainexisting automated knowledge discovery methods might support the BN knowledge engineering process.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:25:34 GMT  (1123kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2297v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ann nicholson", "tal boneh", "tim wilkin", "kaye stacey", "liz sonenberg", "vicki steinle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2297"}
