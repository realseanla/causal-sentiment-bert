As we know, previous algorithms for solving X3SAT have been analyzed only regarding the number of variables as the parameter. However, the time complexity for solving X3SAT instances depends not only on the number of variables, but also on the number of clauses. Therefore, it is significant to exploit the time complexity from the other point of view, i.e. the number of clauses. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving X3SAT with rigorous complexity analyses using the number of clauses as the parameter. By analyzing the algorithms, we obtain the new worst-case upper bounds O(1.15855m), where m is the number of clauses.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 08:26:15 GMT  (514kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4926v1", "submitted to SAT-11"], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Mar 2011 03:19:01 GMT  (514kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4926v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to SAT-11", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["junping zhou", "minghao yin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.4926"}
