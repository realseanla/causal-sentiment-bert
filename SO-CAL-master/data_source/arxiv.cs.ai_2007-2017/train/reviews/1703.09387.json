These approaches involve either directly computing gradients with respect to the image pixels, or directly solving an optimization on the image pixels. In this work, we present a fundamentally new method for generating adversarial examples that is fast to execute and provides exceptional diversity of output. We efficiently train feed-forward neural networks in a self-supervised manner to generate adversarial examples against a target network or set of networks. We call such a network an Adversarial Transformation Network (ATN). ATNs are trained to generate adversarial examples that minimally modify the classifier's outputs given the original input, while constraining the new classification to match an adversarial target class. We present methods to train ATNs and analyze their effectiveness targeting a variety of MNIST classifiers as well as the latest state-of-the-art ImageNet classifier Inception ResNet v2.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:24:33 GMT  (3353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09387v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["shumeet baluja", "ian fischer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09387"}
