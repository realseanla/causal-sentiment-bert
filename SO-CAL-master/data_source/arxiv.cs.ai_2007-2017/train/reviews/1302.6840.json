To be represented in an influence diagram, an asymmetric decision problem must be symmetrized. A considerable amount of unnecessary computation may be involved when a symmetrized influence diagram is evaluated by conventional algorithms. In this paper we present an approach for avoiding such unnecessary computation in influence diagram evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:19:16 GMT  (1096kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6840v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["runping qi", "nevin lianwen zhang", "david l poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6840"}
