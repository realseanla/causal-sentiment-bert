Some properties of interval-valued overlap functions and the derived interval-valued OWA operators are analysed. We specially focus on the homogeneity and migrativity properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:02:59 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06473v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["benjamin bedregal", "humberto bustince", "eduardo palmeira", "gra\\c{c}aliz pereira dimuro", "javier fernandez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06473"}
