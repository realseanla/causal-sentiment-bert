We propose an algorithm that extracts such rules from numerical datasets using the interval-pattern approach from Kaytoue et al. This algorithm has been implemented and evaluated on real datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:18:58 GMT  (120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03267v1", "International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis, Jun 2017, Rennes, France.
