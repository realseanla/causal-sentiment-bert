The researchers did not pay attention to soft set theory at that time but now the soft set theory has been developed in many areas of mathematics. Algebraic structures using soft set theory are very rapidly developed. In this book we developed soft neutrosophic algebraic structures by using soft sets and neutrosophic algebraic structures. In this book we study soft neutrosophic groups, soft neutrosophic semigroups, soft neutrosophic loops, soft neutrosophic LA-semigroups, and their generalizations respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 23 Aug 2014 15:44:16 GMT  (2340kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5507v1", "264 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "264 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache", "mumtaz ali", "muhammad shabir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.5507"}
