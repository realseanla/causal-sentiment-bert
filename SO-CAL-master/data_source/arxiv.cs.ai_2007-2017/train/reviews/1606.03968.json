Objects are assumed persistent in the scene, and their likelihood computed from intermittent visual data using a convolutional architecture, integrated within a Bayesian filtering framework with inertials and a context model. Our method yields a posterior estimate of geometry (attributed point cloud and associated uncertainty), semantics (identities and co-occurrence), and a point-estimate of topology for a variable number of objects within the scene, implemented causally and in real-time on commodity hardware.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 14:22:10 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03968v1", "preliminary version, no figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 20:25:26 GMT  (4651kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03968v2", "To appear in CVPR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "preliminary version, no figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["jingming dong", "xiaohan fei", "stefano soatto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03968"}
