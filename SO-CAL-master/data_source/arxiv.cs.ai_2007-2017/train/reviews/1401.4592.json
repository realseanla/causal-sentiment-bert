Not so, however, in dynamic, stochastic domains where Markov decision processes are commonly used. Unfortunately these suffer from the curse of dimensionality: if the state space is a Cartesian product of many small sets (dimensions), planning is exponential in the number of those dimensions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:03:58 GMT  (849kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4592v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jiri baum", "ann e nicholson", "trevor i dix"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4592"}
