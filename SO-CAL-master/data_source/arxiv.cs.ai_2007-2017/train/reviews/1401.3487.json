The main aim of this article is to carry out a thorough and systematic investigation of inference in extensions of the original DL-Lite logics along five axes: by (i) adding the Boolean connectives and (ii) number restrictions to concept constructs, (iii) allowing role hierarchies, (iv) allowing role disjointness, symmetry, asymmetry, reflexivity, irreflexivity and transitivity constraints, and (v) adopting or dropping the unique same assumption. We analyze the combined complexity of satisfiability for the resulting logics, as well as the data complexity of instance checking and answering positive existential queries. Our approach is based on embedding DL-Lite logics in suitable fragments of the one-variable first-order logic, which provides useful insights into their properties and, in particular, computational behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:37:57 GMT  (893kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3487v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["alessandro artale", "diego calvanese", "roman kontchakov", "michael zakharyaschev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3487"}
