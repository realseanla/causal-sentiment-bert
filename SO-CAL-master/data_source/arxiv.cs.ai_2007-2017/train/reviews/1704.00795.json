The programmatic infrastructure of the system allows working on a fast, easy-to-use, interactive platform to perform Swarm Intelligence based studies in a more effective, efficient and accurate way. In this sense, the system employs all of the necessary controls for the algorithms and it ensures an interactive platform on which computer users can perform studies on a wide spectrum of solution approaches associated with simple and also more advanced problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 20:17:32 GMT  (231kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00795v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["utku kose"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00795"}
