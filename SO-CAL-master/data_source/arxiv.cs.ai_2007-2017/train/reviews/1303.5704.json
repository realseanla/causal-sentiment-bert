The relation so generated has been termed \"intercausal.\" It is shown by construction that inter-causal independence is possible for binary distributions at one state of evidence. For such \"CICI\" distributions, the two measures of inter-causal effect, \"multiplicative synergy\" and \"additive synergy\" are equal. The well known \"noisy-or\" model is an example of such a distribution. This introduces novel semantics for the noisy-or, as a model of the degree of conflict among competing hypotheses of a common observation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:29:29 GMT  (305kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5704v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["john mark agosta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5704"}
