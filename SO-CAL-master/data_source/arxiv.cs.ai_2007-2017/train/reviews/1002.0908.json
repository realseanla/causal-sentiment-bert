Wang, D. Chen, L. Zhu, Homomorphisms between fuzzy information systems, Applied Mathematics Letters 22 (2009) 1045-1050], where homomorphisms are based upon the concepts of consistent functions and fuzzy relation mappings. In this paper, we classify consistent functions as predecessor-consistent and successor-consistent, and then proceed to present more properties of consistent functions. In addition, we improve some characterizations of fuzzy relation mappings provided by Wang et al.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 07:09:46 GMT  (43kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0908v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ping zhu", "qiaoyan wen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.0908"}
