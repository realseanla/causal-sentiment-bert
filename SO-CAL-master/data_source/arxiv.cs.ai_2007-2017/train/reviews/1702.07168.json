However, giving an achievable framework to the process towards this has been a difficult task. In this work we take the classic data information knowledge wisdom (DIKW) framework to set some achievable goals and sub-goals towards cognitive engineering. A layered framework like DIKW aligns nicely with the layered structure of pre-frontal cortex. And breaking the task into sub-tasks based on the layers also makes it easier to start developmental endeavours towards achieving the final goal of a brain-inspired system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 10:51:32 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07168v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amit kumar mishra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07168"}
