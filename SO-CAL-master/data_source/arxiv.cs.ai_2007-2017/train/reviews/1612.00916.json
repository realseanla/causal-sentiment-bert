{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Dec-2016", "title": "A Matrix Splitting Perspective on Planning with Options", "abstract": "We show that the Bellman operator underlying the options framework leads to a matrix splitting, an approach traditionally used to speed up convergence of iterative solvers for large linear systems of equations. Based on standard comparison theo- rems for matrix splittings, we then show how the asymptotic rate of convergence varies as a function of the inherent timescales of the options. This new perspective highlights a trade-off between asymptotic performance and the cost of computation associated with building a good set of options.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Dec 2016 02:57:36 GMT  (12kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00916v1", "Accepted at the Continual Learning and Deep Networks Workshop, NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 19:28:32 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00916v2", "The results presented in the previous version of this paper were found be applicable only to \"gating execution\" and not \"call-and-return\".
