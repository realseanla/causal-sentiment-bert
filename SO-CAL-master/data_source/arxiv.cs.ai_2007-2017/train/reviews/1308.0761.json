It is based on the observation that for some simple forms of problem partitioning one can use the Monte Carlo approach to estimate the time required to solve an original problem. The method proposed is based on an algorithm for searching for partitioning with an optimal solving time estimation. We applied this method to estimate the time required to perform logical cryptanalysis of the widely known stream ciphers A5/1 and Bivium. The paper also describes a volunteer computing project SAT@home aimed at solving hard combinatorial problems reduced to SAT. In this project during several months there were solved 10 problems of logical cryptanalysis of the A5/1 cipher thatcould not be solved using known rainbow tables.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Aug 2013 00:30:09 GMT  (100kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0761v1", "This paper was submitted to SAT-2013 conference.
