Challenges in handwritten characters recognition wholly lie in the variation and distortion of handwritten characters, since different people may use different style of handwriting, and direction to draw the same shape of the characters of their known script. This paper demonstrates the nature of handwritten characters, conversion of handwritten data into electronic data, and the neural network approach to make machine capable of recognizing hand written characters.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 May 2012 15:50:08 GMT  (181kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3964v1", "4 pages, 1 Figure, ISSN:0975 - 8887"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 1 Figure, ISSN:0975 - 8887", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yusuf perwej", "ashish chaturvedi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.3964"}
