It offers a more flexible formalism than the equivalent CSTP model of Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack, from which it was derived mainly as a sound formalization. Three notions of consistency arise for CSTNs and CSTPs: weak, strong, and dynamic. Dynamic consistency is the most interesting notion, but it is also the most challenging and it was conjectured to be hard to assess. Tsamardinos, Vidal and Pollack gave a doubly-exponential time algorithm for deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent and to produce, in the positive case, a dynamic execution strategy of exponential size. In the present work we offer a proof that deciding whether a CSTN is dynamically-consistent is coNP-hard and provide the first singly-exponential time algorithm for this problem, also producing a dynamic execution strategy whenever the input CSTN is dynamically-consistent. The algorithm is based on a novel connection with Mean Payoff Games, a family of two-player combinatorial games on graphs well known for having applications in model-checking and formal verification. The presentation of such connection is mediated by the Hyper Temporal Network model, a tractable generalization of Simple Temporal Networks whose consistency checking is equivalent to determining Mean Payoff Games. In order to analyze the algorithm we introduce a refined notion of dynamic-consistency, named \\epsilon-dynamic-consistency, and present a sharp lower bounding analysis on the critical value of the reaction time \\hat{\\varepsilon} where the CSTN transits from being, to not being, dynamically-consistent. The proof technique introduced in this analysis of \\hat{\\varepsilon} is applicable more in general when dealing with linear difference constraints which include strict inequalities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 May 2015 22:14:28 GMT  (56kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 8 May 2015 09:48:07 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 08:16:45 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 17 Jul 2015 15:42:23 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00828v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["carlo comin", "romeo rizzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00828"}
