In this paper, we classify HPPs into three classes called HPP_1,HPP_2 and HPP_r,r&gt;= 3. For these classes, we provide three types of results for HPPs. First, we develop algorithms to compute the set of all ground consequences of an HPP. Then we provide algorithms and complexity results for the problems of entailment (\"Given an HPP P and a query Q as input, is Q a logical consequence of P?\") and consistency (\"Given an HPP P as input, is P consistent?\"). Our results provide a fine characterization of when polynomial algorithms exist for the above problems, and when these problems become intractable.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:57:43 GMT  (569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6691v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael i dekhtyar", "alex dekhtyar", "v s subrahmanian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6691"}
