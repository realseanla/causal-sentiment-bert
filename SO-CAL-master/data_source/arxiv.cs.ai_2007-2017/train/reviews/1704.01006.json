{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Mar-2017", "title": "Ontology based Scene Creation for the Development of Automated Vehicles", "abstract": "The introduction of automated vehicles without permanent human supervision demands a functional system description including functional system boundaries and a comprehensive safety analysis. These inputs to the technical development can be identified and analyzed by a scenario-based approach. Experts are doing well to identify scenarios that are difficult to handle or unlikely to happen. To establish an economical test and release process, a large number of scenarios must be identified to enable an execution of test-cases in simulation environments. Expert knowledge modeled for computer aided processing may help for the purpose of providing a wide range of scenarios. This contribution reviews the use of ontologies as knowledge-based systems in the field of automated vehicles, and proposes a modeling concept for traffic scenes. Afterwards, a process to create scenes from the gathered knowledge is introduced and the utilization of ontologies in the given problem statement is evaluated using criteria from literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 20:02:39 GMT  (549kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01006v1", "Submitted for review to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2017), 7 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:22:17 GMT  (617kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01006v2", "Declines at IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2017), will be updated in near future 7 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted for review to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2017), 7 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["gerrit bagschik", "till menzel", "markus maurer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01006"}
