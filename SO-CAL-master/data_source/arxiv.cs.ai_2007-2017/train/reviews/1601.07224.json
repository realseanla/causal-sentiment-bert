The thesis gives a brief overview to the already existing probabilistic programming languages: Church, Venture, and Anglican. It also describes the results of the first experiments on the automatic induction of probabilistic programs. The thesis was submitted, in June 2014, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Siberian Federal University, Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The work, which is described in this thesis, has been performing in 2012-2014 in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in the University of Oxford by the colleagues of the author and by himself.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 23:31:05 GMT  (1813kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07224v1", "49 pages, in Russian"]], "COMMENTS": "49 pages, in Russian", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["yura n perov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.07224"}
