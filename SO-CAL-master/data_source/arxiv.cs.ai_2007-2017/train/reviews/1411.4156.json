{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Nov-2014", "title": "Using Description Logics for RDF Constraint Checking and Closed-World Recognition", "abstract": "RDF and Description Logics work in an open-world setting where absence of information is not information about absence. Nevertheless, Description Logic axioms can be interpreted in a closed-world setting and in this setting they can be used for both constraint checking and closed-world recognition against information sources. When the information sources are expressed in well-behaved RDF or RDFS (i.e., RDF graphs interpreted in the RDF or RDFS semantics) this constraint checking and closed-world recognition is simple to describe. Further this constraint checking can be implemented as SPARQL querying and thus effectively performed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 15:33:38 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4156v1", "Extended version of a paper of the same name that will appear in AAAI-2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 21:09:56 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4156v2", "Extended version of a paper of the same name that will appear in AAAI-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper of the same name that will appear in AAAI-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter f patel-schneider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.4156"}
