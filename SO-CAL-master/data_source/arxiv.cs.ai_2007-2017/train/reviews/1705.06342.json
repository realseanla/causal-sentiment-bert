The identification of objectives is achieved using an online and unsupervised adaptive clustering algorithm. The identified objectives are learned (at least partially) in parallel using Q-learning. Using a simulated agent and environment, it is shown that the converged or partially converged value function weights resulting from off-policy learning can be used to accumulate knowledge about multiple objectives without any additional exploration. We claim that the proposed approach could be useful in scenarios where the objectives are initially unknown or in real world scenarios where exploration is typically a time and energy intensive process. The implications and possible extensions of this work are also briefly discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 20:55:15 GMT  (601kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06342v1", "Accepted in Neurocomputing: Special Issue on Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Applications, 24 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in Neurocomputing: Special Issue on Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning: Theory and Applications, 24 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thommen george karimpanal", "erik wilhelm"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06342"}
