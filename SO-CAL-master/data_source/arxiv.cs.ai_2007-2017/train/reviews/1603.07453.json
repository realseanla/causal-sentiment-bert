The logic is modal and higher-order: modalities annotated by actions are used to express possibility and necessity of propositions in the next states resulting from the actions, and a higher-order function is needed to express the probability operator. The proposed logic is shown to be an adequate extension of classical mathematical probability theory, and its expressiveness is illustrated through the formalization of the Monty Hall problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 07:00:33 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07453v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Oct 2017 02:02:49 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07453v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["bruno woltzenlogel paleo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07453"}
