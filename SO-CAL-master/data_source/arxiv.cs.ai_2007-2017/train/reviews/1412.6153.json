Stereo vision, while still being a rapidly developing technique in the field of autonomous mobile robots, are currently less preferable due to its high implementation cost. This paper aims at describing an experimental approach for the building of a stereo vision system that helps the robots to avoid obstacles and navigate through indoor environments and at the same time remaining very much cost effective. This paper discusses the fusion techniques of stereo vision and ultrasound sensors which helps in the successful navigation through different types of complex environments. The data from the sensor enables the robot to create the two dimensional topological map of unknown environments and stereo vision systems models the three dimension model of the same environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Sep 2014 20:01:45 GMT  (632kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6153v1", "9 pages, SIPIJ August 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, SIPIJ August 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["arjun b krishnan", "jayaram kollipara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6153"}
