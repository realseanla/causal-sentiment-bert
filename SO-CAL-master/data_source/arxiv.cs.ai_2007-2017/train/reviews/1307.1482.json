We believe that this approach facilitates a more principled interface to symbolic planning, while also leaving more room for the geometric planner to make independent decisions. We show how the two planners could be interfaced, and how their planning and backtracking could be interleaved. We also provide insights for a methodology for using the combined system, and experimental results to use as a benchmark with future extensions to both the combined system, as well as to the geometric task planner.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 20:28:40 GMT  (3183kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1482v1", "RSS Workshop on Combined Robot Motion Planning and AI Planning for Practical Applications, June 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "RSS Workshop on Combined Robot Motion Planning and AI Planning for Practical Applications, June 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["lavindra de silva", "amit kumar pandey", "mamoun gharbi", "rachid alami"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1482"}
