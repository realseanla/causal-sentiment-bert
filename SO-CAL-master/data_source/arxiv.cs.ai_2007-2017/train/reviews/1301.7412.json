In particular, statements of conditional irrelevance (or independence) can be verified in time linear in the size of the graph. To resolve a particular inference query or decision problem, only some of the possible states and probability distributions must be specified, the \"requisite information.\"", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:06:48 GMT  (339kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7412v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ross d shachter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7412"}
