For the latter claim, two paradigmatic examples are presented: Logic Programming with Kleene semantics for modelling reasoning from information in a discourse, to an interpretation of the state of affairs of the intended model, and a neural-symbolic implementation of Input/Output logic for dealing with uncertainty in dynamic normative contexts.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 20:38:55 GMT  (350kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05226v1", "Submitted to the Special Issue \"Reasoning with Imperfect Information and Knowledge\" of Minds and Machines (2017)"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 15:36:37 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.05226v2", "Forthcoming with DOI 10.1007/s11023-017-9428-3 in the Special Issue \"Reasoning with Imperfect Information and Knowledge\" of Minds and Machines (2017).
