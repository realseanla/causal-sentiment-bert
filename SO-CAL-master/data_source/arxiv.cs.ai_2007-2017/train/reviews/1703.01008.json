The system is able to interface with a structured database, and interact with users for assisting them to access information and complete tasks such as booking movie tickets. Our experiments in a movie-ticket booking domain show the proposed system outperforms a modular-based dialogue system and is more robust to noise produced by other components in the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 01:29:11 GMT  (1081kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01008v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 05:50:21 GMT  (1079kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01008v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 19 Sep 2017 17:47:23 GMT  (1233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01008v3", "11 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1703.07055"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["xiujun li", "yun-nung chen", "lihong li", "jianfeng gao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01008"}
