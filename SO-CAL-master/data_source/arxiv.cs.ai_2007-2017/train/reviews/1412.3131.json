In this paper our contribution is to propose a new tool for implementation of a domain model based on fuzzy relationships among concepts. This tool allows the experts and teachers to find the best parameters in order to adapt the learners's differences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Dec 2014 18:28:01 GMT  (1002kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3131v1", "61-65"]], "COMMENTS": "61-65", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["ali aajli", "karim afdel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.3131"}
