We argue that this architecture, inspired by AI research on autonomous agents and robots, can offer a number of benefits in the form of abstraction, modularity, re-usability and higher degrees of personalization for the behavior of each NPC. We also show how this architecture can be used to tackle a simple scenario related to the navigation of NPCs under incomplete information about the obstacles that may obstruct the various way-points in the game, in a simple and effective way.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 17:38:24 GMT  (609kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3195v1", "7 pages, for associated code repositories seethis https URLandthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, for associated code repositories seethis https URLandthis https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["davide aversa", "stavros vassos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3195"}
