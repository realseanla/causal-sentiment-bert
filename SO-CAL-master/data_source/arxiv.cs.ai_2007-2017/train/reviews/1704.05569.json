In illicit domains with unusual language models, like human trafficking, extracting geotags with both high precision and recall is a challenging problem. In this paper, we describe a geotag extraction framework in which context, constraints and the openly available Geonames knowledge base work in tandem in an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to achieve good performance. In preliminary empirical investigations, the framework improves precision by 28.57% and F-measure by 36.9% on a difficult human trafficking geotagging task compared to a machine learning-based baseline. The method is already being integrated into an existing knowledge base construction system widely used by US law enforcement agencies to combat human trafficking.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 00:52:02 GMT  (929kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05569v1", "6 pages, GeoRich 2017 workshop at ACM SIGMOD conference"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, GeoRich 2017 workshop at ACM SIGMOD conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rahul kapoor", "mayank kejriwal", "pedro szekely"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05569"}
