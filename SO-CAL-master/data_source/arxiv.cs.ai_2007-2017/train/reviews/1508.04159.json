In this work we have extended the language in two directions. First, we have implemented hierarchical queries; second, we improve efficiency enabling manual design space exploration on different \"search\" strategies. As depicted in the teaser above, we demonstrate the applicability of such extensions in two application problems; the basic language concepts are explained by solving the classical problem of the Towers of Hanoi and then a common path planning problem in a complex 3D environment is implemented.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 21:26:39 GMT  (3475kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04159v1", "14 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Oct 2015 15:53:29 GMT  (1408kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04159v2", "15 pages, 7 figures, 6th International Workshop on Domain-Specific Languages and models for ROBotic systems (DSLRob-15)"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI cs.DB cs.RO", "authors": ["andr\\'e dietrich", "sebastian zug", "luigi nardi", "j\\\"org kaiser"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04159"}
