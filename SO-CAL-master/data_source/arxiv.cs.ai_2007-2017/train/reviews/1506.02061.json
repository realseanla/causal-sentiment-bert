This representation is related to a five-valued logic that uses the following values: true, false, inconsistent, incomplete and ambiguous. In the framework of five-valued representation, formulae for similarity, entropy and syntropy of bifuzzy sets are constructed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 09:36:49 GMT  (451kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02061v1", "9 pages.
