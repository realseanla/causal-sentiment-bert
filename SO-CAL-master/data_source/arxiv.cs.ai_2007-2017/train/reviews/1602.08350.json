Detecting NTLs requires costly on-site inspections. Accurate prediction of NTLs for customers using machine learning is therefore crucial. To date, related research largely ignore that the two classes of regular and non-regular customers are highly imbalanced, that NTL proportions may change and mostly consider small data sets, often not allowing to deploy the results in production. In this paper, we present a comprehensive approach to assess three NTL detection models for different NTL proportions in large real world data sets of 100Ks of customers: Boolean rules, fuzzy logic and Support Vector Machine. This work has resulted in appreciable results that are about to be deployed in a leading industry solution. We believe that the considerations and observations made in this contribution are necessary for future smart meter research in order to report their effectiveness on imbalanced and large real world data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:49:29 GMT  (108kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08350v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 04:44:12 GMT  (108kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08350v2", "Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE Conference on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies (ISGT 2016)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick o glauner", "re boechat", "lautaro dolberg", "radu state", "franck bettinger", "yves rangoni", "diogo duarte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08350"}
