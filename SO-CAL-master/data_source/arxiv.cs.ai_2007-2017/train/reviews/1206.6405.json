When the agent is bounded by information-processing constraints, it can only keep an approximation of the belief. We present a variational principle for the problem of maintaining the information which is most useful for minimizing the cost, and introduce an efficient and simple algorithm for finding an optimum.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (899kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6405v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["roy fox", "naftali tishby"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6405"}
