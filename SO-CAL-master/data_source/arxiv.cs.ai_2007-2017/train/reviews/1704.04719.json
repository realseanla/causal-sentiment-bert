The knowledge base and rule base of FML assessment engine are constructed by referring the information from the darkforest Go engine located in NUTN and OPU, for example, the number of MCTS simulations and winning rate prediction. The proposed robotic prediction agent first retrieves the database of Go competition website, and then the FML assessment engine infers the winning possibility based on the information generated by darkforest Go engine. The FML-based decision support engine computes the winning possibility based on the partial game situation inferred by FML assessment engine. Finally, the robot engine combines with the human-friendly robot partner PALRO, produced by Fujisoft incorporated, to report the game situation to human Go players. Experimental results show that the FML-based prediction agent can work effectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Apr 2017 04:19:36 GMT  (1068kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04719v1", "6 pages, 12 figures, Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (IFSA-SCIS 2017), Otsu, Japan, Jun. 27-30, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 12 figures, Joint 17th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association and 9th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (IFSA-SCIS 2017), Otsu, Japan, Jun. 27-30, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["chang-shing lee", "mei-hui wang", "chia-hsiu kao", "sheng-chi yang", "yusuke nojima", "ryosuke saga", "nan shuo", "naoyuki kubota"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04719"}
