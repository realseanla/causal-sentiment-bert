The data bank was provided by the meteorological station located at the University of Isthmus, Tehuantepec campus, and this data bank covers the period from 2008 to 2011. Three data models were constructed to carry out 16, 24 and 48 hours forecasts using the following variables: wind velocity, temperature, barometric pressure, and date. The performance measure for the three models is the mean standard error (MSE). In this work, performance analysis in short-term prediction is presented, because it is essential in order to define an adequate wind speed model for eolian parks, where a right planning provide economic benefits.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Dec 2012 22:48:36 GMT  (796kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2671v1", "9 pages, 11 figures, 1 table; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 9, Issue 5, No 3, September 2012.
