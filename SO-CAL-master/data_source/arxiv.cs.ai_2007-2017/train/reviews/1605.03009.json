Since Husserl, many philosophers have accepted that consciousness consists of a stream of logical connections between an ego and external objects. These connections are called \"intentions.\" Pattern recognition systems are achievable technical artifacts. The proof links a respected philosophical theory of consciousness with technical art, and may therefore enable a theoretically-grounded form of artificial intelligence called a \"synthetic intentionality,\" a being able to synthesize, generalize, select and repeat a stream of intentions. If the pattern recognition is reflexive, able to operate on the stream of intentions, and flexible, able to find new types of connections, perhaps by evolutionary programming, an SI may be a particularly strong form of AI. The article then addresses some conventional problems: Searles' Chinese room, and how an SI could \"understand\" \"meanings\" and \"be creative.\"", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 May 2016 20:19:05 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03009v1", "7 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 20:44:09 GMT  (165kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03009v2", "8 pages; Now describes the utility of the proof.
