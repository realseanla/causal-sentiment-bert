The reasons to employ an agent-based negotiation team may vary: (i) more computation and parallelization capabilities, (ii) unite agents with different expertise and skills whose joint work makes it possible to tackle complex negotiation domains, (iii) the necessity to represent different stakeholders or different preferences in the same party (e.g., organizations, countries, and married couple). The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas. The analysis aims to identify special challenges that may arise due to the particularities of agent-based negotiation teams.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 11:37:50 GMT  (485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04727v1", "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["victor sanchez-anguix", "vicente julian", "vicente botti", "ana garcia-fornes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04727"}
