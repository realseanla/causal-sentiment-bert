To provide good performance guarantees, existing methods must assume that the real system is in the class of models considered during learning. We present an iterative method with strong guarantees even in the agnostic case where the system is not in the class. In particular, we show that any no-regret online learning algorithm can be used to obtain a near-optimal policy, provided some model achieves low training error and access to a good exploration distribution. Our approach applies to both discrete and continuous domains. We demonstrate its efficacy and scalability on a challenging helicopter domain from the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Mar 2012 18:58:49 GMT  (149kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1007v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 13:48:40 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1007v2", "8 pages, published in ICML 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.SY stat.ML", "authors": ["st\u00e9phane ross", "drew bagnell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1203.1007"}
