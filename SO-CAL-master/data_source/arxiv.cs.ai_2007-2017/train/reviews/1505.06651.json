We first define a modal language to express \"I know how to guarantee phi given psi\" with a semantics not based on standard epistemic models but labelled transition systems that represent the agent's knowledge of his own abilities. A sound and complete proof system is given to capture the valid reasoning patterns about \"knowing how\" where the most important axiom suggests its compositional nature. Surprisingly, this simple language is powerful enough to express a version of \"knowing that\" and its interactions with \"knowing how\".", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 May 2015 14:43:55 GMT  (35kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06651v1", "Under submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 08:36:47 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06651v2", "Under submission.
