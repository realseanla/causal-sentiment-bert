The algorithm is based on information theoretic principles. The algorithm reduces the search space by many orders of magnitude over what was previously thought possible. We compare the algorithm with some existing induction techniques for finite state automata and show that the algorithm is much superior in both run time and quality of inductions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:54:36 GMT  (1009kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1530v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.FL", "authors": ["matthew s collins", "jonathan oliver"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1530"}
