The method assumes Beta priors and can be used to learn maximum likelihood parameters when the priors are uninformative. EDML exhibits interesting behaviors, especially when compared to EM. We introduce EDML, explain its origin, and study some of its properties both analytically and empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (1779kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3709v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arthur choi", "khaled s refaat", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3709"}
