The words of the document will be formed by the joining of the correct positional glyphs representing corresponding presentational forms of the characters. A set of rules defines the joining of the glyphs. As usual, these rules vary from language to language and are subject to interpretation by the software developers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 May 2015 16:03:02 GMT  (209kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01757v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["kazem taghva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.01757"}
