An important characteristic of this paradigm is that it preserves all the well-known properties of traditional logic programming. In this paper we consider the semantics of negation in the context of the new paradigm. Using some recent results from non-monotonic fixed-point theory, we demonstrate that every higher-order logic program with negation has a unique minimum infinite-valued model. In this way we obtain the first purely model-theoretic semantics for negation in extensional higher-order logic programming. Using our approach, we resolve an old paradox that was introduced by W. W. Wadge in order to demonstrate the semantic difficulties of higher-order logic programming.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 May 2014 10:37:42 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3792v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["angelos charalambidis", "zolt\\'an \\'esik", "panos rondogiannis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3792"}
