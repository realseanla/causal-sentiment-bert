A lot of works have been presented for it. In the transferable belief model (TBM), pignistic probabilities based on the basic probability as- signments are used for decision making. In this paper, multiscale probability transformation of basic probability assignment based on the belief function and the plausibility function is proposed, which is a generalization of the pignistic probability transformation. In the multiscale probability function, a factor q based on the Tsallis entropy is used to make the multiscale prob- abilities diversified. An example is shown that the multiscale probability transformation is more reasonable in the decision making.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Jun 2014 14:38:29 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1697v1", "22 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["meizhu li", "qi zhang", "yong deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1697"}
