It is an instance of the scattering transform, a generic operator which cascades wavelet convolutions and modulus nonlinearities. It is derived from the pitch spiral, in that convolutions are successively performed in time, log-frequency, and octave index. We give a closed-form approximation of spiral scattering coefficients for a nonstationary generalization of the harmonic source-filter model.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Jan 2016 12:30:38 GMT  (1164kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00287v1", "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx-15), Trondheim, Norway, Nov 30 - Dec 3, 2015, pp. 429--432. 4 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Digital Audio Effects (DAFx-15), Trondheim, Norway, Nov 30 - Dec 3, 2015, pp. 429--432. 4 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI", "authors": ["vincent lostanlen", "st\\'ephane mallat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00287"}
