Inspired by how the human visual cortex employs spatial attention and separate \"where\" and \"what\" processing pathways to actively suppress irrelevant visual features, this work develops a hierarchical attentive recurrent model for single object tracking in videos. The first layer of attention discards the majority of background by selecting a region containing the object of interest, while the subsequent layers tune in on visual features particular to the tracked object. This framework is fully differentiable and can be trained in a purely data driven fashion by gradient methods. To improve training convergence, we augment the loss function with terms for a number of auxiliary tasks relevant for tracking. Evaluation of the proposed model is performed on two datasets of increasing difficulty: pedestrian tracking on the KTH activity recognition dataset and the KITTI object tracking dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Jun 2017 13:00:14 GMT  (7743kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09262v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2017.
