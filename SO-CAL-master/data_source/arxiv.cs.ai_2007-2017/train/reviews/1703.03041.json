Inferring or reverseengineering such networks can be defined as the process of identifying gene/protein interactions from experimental data through computational analysis. However, this task is typically complicated by the enormously large scale of the unknowns in a rather small sample size. Furthermore, when the goal is to study causal relationships within the network, tools capable of overcoming the limitations of correlation networks are required. In this work, we make use of Bayesian Graphical Models to attach this problem and, specifically, we perform a comparative study of different state-of-the-art heuristics, analyzing their performance in inferring the structure of the Bayesian Network from breast cancer data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 21:36:01 GMT  (362kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03041v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["stefano beretta", "mauro castelli", "ivo goncalves", "ivan merelli", "daniele ramazzotti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.03041"}
