We introduce semantic entailment of the formulas, show its fixed-point characterization, investigate closure properties of model classes, present an axiomatization and prove its completeness, and investigate alternative axiomatizations and normalized proofs. We investigate decidability and complexity issues of the logic and prove NP-hardness of the entailment problem. We show that by restricting to predictive formulas, the entailment problem is decidable in pseudo-linear time.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Dec 2014 12:41:51 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3633v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 4 May 2015 08:01:28 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3633v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["jan triska", "vilem vychodil"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.3633"}
