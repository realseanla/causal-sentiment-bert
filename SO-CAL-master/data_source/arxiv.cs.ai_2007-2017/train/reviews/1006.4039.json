However, the sequential nature of online learning requires a centralized learner to store data and update parameters. In this paper, we consider a fully decentralized setting, cooperative autonomous online learning, with a distributed data source. The learners perform learning with local parameters while periodically communicating with a small subset of neighbors to exchange information. We define the regret in terms of an implicit aggregated parameter of the learners for such a setting and prove regret bounds similar to the classical sequential online learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 11:30:06 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4039v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Feb 2011 03:16:12 GMT  (74kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4039v2", "24 pages, 2 figures"], ["v3", "Fri, 4 Feb 2011 16:06:35 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4039v3", "25 pages, 2 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["feng yan", "shreyas sundaram", "s v n vishwanathan", "yuan qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.4039"}
