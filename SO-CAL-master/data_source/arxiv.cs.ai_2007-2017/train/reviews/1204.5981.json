Their complexity is often studied when parameterised by a fixed model, the so-called template.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 16:46:25 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5981v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["florent madelaine", "barnaby martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.5981"}
