Without these assumptions the sequences of operations that achieve the goals depend on the initial state and the outcomes of nondeterministic changes in the system. This setting raises the questions of how to represent the plans and how to perform plan search. The answers are quite different from those in the simpler classical framework. In this paper, we approach conditional planning from a new viewpoint that is motivated by the use of satisfiability algorithms in classical planning. Translating conditional planning to formulae in the propositional logic is not feasible because of inherent computational limitations. Instead, we translate conditional planning to quantified Boolean formulae. We discuss three formalizations of conditional planning as quantified Boolean formulae, and present experimental results obtained with a theorem-prover.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:54:30 GMT  (124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5465v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j rintanen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5465"}
