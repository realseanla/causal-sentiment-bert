For such Bayesian networks deterministic part of the model can be represented as a Boolean function, and a central part of belief updating reduces to the task of calculating the number of satisfying configurations in a Boolean function. In this paper we explore how advances in the calculation of Boolean functions can be adopted for belief updating, in particular within the context of troubleshooting. We present experimental results indicating a substantial speed-up compared to traditional junction tree propagation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:50 GMT  (379kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3880v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas d nielsen", "pierre-henri wuillemin", "finn verner jensen", "uffe kj{\\ae}rulff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3880"}
