However, the impact of the choice of the underlying scalarizing function(s) is still far from being well understood. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of different scalarizing functions and their parameters. We thereby abstract firstly from any specific algorithm and only consider the difficulty of the single scalarized problems in terms of the search ability of a (1+lambda)-EA on biobjective NK-landscapes. Secondly, combining the outcomes of independent single-objective runs allows for more general statements on set-based performance measures. Finally, we investigate the correlation between the opening angle of the scalarizing function's underlying contour lines and the position of the final solution in the objective space. Our analysis is of fundamental nature and sheds more light on the key characteristics of multiobjective scalarizing functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 18:41:36 GMT  (237kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5752v1", "appears in Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN XIII, Ljubljana : Slovenia (2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "appears in Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN XIII, Ljubljana : Slovenia (2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bilel derbel", "dimo brockhoff", "arnaud liefooghe", "s\\'ebastien verel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5752"}
