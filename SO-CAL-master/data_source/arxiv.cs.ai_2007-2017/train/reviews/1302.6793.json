Experiments have shown that likelihood weighting is one of the most promising simulation schemes. In this paper, we present a new simulation scheme that generates samples more evenly spread in the sample space than the likelihood weighting scheme. We show both theoretically and experimentally that the stratified scheme outperforms likelihood weighting in average runtime and error in estimates of beliefs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:14:37 GMT  (1004kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6793v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["remco r bouckaert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6793"}
