Decision support systems are a suitable solution for such issues, they are indeed able to help emergency managers to prevent and to manage crisis in emergency situations. However, they should be enough flexible and adaptive in order to be reliable to solve complex problems that are plunged in dynamic and unpredictable environments. The approach we propose in this paper addresses this challenge. We expose here a modelling of information for an emergency environment and an architecture of a multiagent decision support system that deals with these information in order to prevent and to manage the occur of a crisis in emergency situations. We focus on the first level of the system mechanism which intends to perceive and to reflect the evolution of the current situation. The general approach and experimentations are provided here.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 31 May 2014 09:57:02 GMT  (1045kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0062v1", "14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:0907.0499"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:0907.0499", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fahem kebair", "fr\\'ed\\'eric serin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.0062"}
