In this paper, we present a new method of materializing Datalog inferences, which combines a column-based memory layout with novel optimization methods that avoid redundant inferences at runtime. The pro-active caching of certain subqueries further increases efficiency. Our empirical evaluation shows that this approach can often match or even surpass the performance of state-of-the-art systems, especially under restricted resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Nov 2015 17:16:55 GMT  (46kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08915v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 16:12:55 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08915v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["jacopo urbani", "ceriel jacobs", "markus kr\\\"otzsch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08915"}
