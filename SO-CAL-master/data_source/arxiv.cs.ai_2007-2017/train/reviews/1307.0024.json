These schedules prove quite robust: delays of some tasks do not necessarily lead to delays of subsequent tasks. The number of tasks that finish late depends, among others, on the way of distributing flexibility.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Jun 2013 20:20:27 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0024v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["daan wilmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.0024"}
