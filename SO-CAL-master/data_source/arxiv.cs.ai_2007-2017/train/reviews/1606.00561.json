Due to the huge number of included classes, reusing and understanding large APIs is a complex task. Otherwise, software components are admitted to be more reusable and understandable entities than object-oriented ones. Thus, in this paper, we propose an approach for reengineering object-oriented APIs into component-based ones. We mine components as a group of classes based on the frequency they are used together and their ability to form a quality-centric component. To validate our approach, we experimented on 100 Java applications that used Android APIs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 07:08:01 GMT  (615kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00561v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["anas shatnawi", "abdelhak seriai", "houari sahraoui", "zakarea al-shara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00561"}
