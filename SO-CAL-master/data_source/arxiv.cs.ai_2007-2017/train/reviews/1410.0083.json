With incomplete information on the dynamic environment, reactive controller synthesis amounts to solving a two-player game with partial observations, which has impractically computational complexity. To alleviate the high computational burden, online replanning via sensing actions avoids solving the strategy in the reactive system under partial observations. Instead, we only solve for a strategy that ensures a given temporal logic specification can be satisfied had the system have complete observations of its environment. Such a strategy is then transformed into one which makes control decisions based on the observed sequence of states (of the interacting system and its environment). When the system encounters a belief---a set including all possible hypotheses the system has for the current state---for which the observation-based strategy is undefined, a sequence of sensing actions are triggered, chosen by an active sensing strategy, to reduce the uncertainty in the system's belief. We show that by alternating between the observation-based strategy and the active sensing strategy, under a mild technical assumption of the set of sensors in the system, the given temporal logic specification can be satisfied with probability 1.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 01:05:01 GMT  (189kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0083v1", "7 pages, 2 figures, submitted to American Control Conference 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 2 figures, submitted to American Control Conference 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["jie fu", "ufuk topcu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0083"}
