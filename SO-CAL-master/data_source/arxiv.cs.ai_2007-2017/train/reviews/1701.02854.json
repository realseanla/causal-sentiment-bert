{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Jan-2017", "title": "Towards Decoding as Continuous Optimization in Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "In this work, we propose a novel decoding approach for neural machine translation (NMT) based on continuous optimisation. The resulting optimisation problem can then be tackled using a whole range of continuous optimisation algorithms which have been developed and used in the literature mainly for training. Our approach is general and can be applied to other sequence-to-sequence neural models as well. We make use of this powerful decoding approach to intersect an underlying NMT with a language model, to intersect left-to-right and right-to-left NMT models, and to decode with soft constraints involving coverage and fertility of the source sentence words. The experimental results show the promise of the proposed framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 06:02:44 GMT  (30kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02854v1", "v1 with preliminary results"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 00:15:08 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02854v2", "v2 with more results"], ["v3", "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 09:26:30 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02854v3", "v2a with supplementary material"], ["v4", "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 16:35:43 GMT  (98kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02854v4", "EMNLP 2017 Camera Ready Paper"]], "COMMENTS": "v1 with preliminary results", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["cong duy vu hoang", "gholamreza haffari", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.02854"}
