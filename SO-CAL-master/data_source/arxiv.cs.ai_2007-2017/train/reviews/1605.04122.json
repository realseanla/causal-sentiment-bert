It does not contain a new model or new results in the formal semantics of natural language: it is rather a computational analysis of the logical models and algorithms currently used in natural language semantics, defined as the mapping of a statement to logical formulas - formulas, because a statement can be ambiguous. We argue that as long as possible world semantics is left out, one can compute the semantic representation(s) of a given statement, including aspects of lexical meaning. We also discuss the algorithmic complexity of this process.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 May 2016 10:46:22 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04122v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["richard moot", "christian retor\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04122"}
