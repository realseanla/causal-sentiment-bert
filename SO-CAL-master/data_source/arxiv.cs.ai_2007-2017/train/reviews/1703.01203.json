We study random $N$-element sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ for large $n$ and demonstrate that for $N&lt;a\\exp(b{n})$ they are linearly separable with probability $p$, $p&gt;1-\\vartheta$, for a given (small) $\\vartheta&gt;0$. Constants $a,b&gt;0$ depend on the probability distribution and the constant $\\vartheta$. The results are important for machine learning in high dimension, especially for correction of unavoidable mistakes of legacy Artificial Intelligence systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 15:27:38 GMT  (390kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01203v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 16:47:51 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01203v2", "5 pages, added numerical experiments, extended bibliography, corrected misprints"], ["v3", "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 17:37:06 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01203v3", "6 pages, accepted for publication in Neural Networks (Letter section)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["a n gorban", "i y tyukin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01203"}
