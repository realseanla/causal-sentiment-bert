In detail, we show genetic programming (GP) can evolve models of aspects of BLAST's output when it is used to map Solexa Next-Gen DNA sequences to the human genome.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 16:35:37 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5667v1", "As UCL computer science Technical Report RN/13/12"]], "COMMENTS": "As UCL computer science Technical Report RN/13/12", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["w b langdon", "m harman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.5667"}
