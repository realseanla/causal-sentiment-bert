It has many industrial applications. In order to improve performance, some tools allow preprocessing of the model, verifying on-line a set of properties reusing the same compiled model; we prove that the complexity of the Model Checking problem, without any preprocessing or preprocessing the model or the formula in a polynomial data structure, is the same. As a result preprocessing does not always exponentially improve performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Dec 2010 13:18:44 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3018v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.DS cs.LO", "authors": ["paolo liberatore", "marco schaerf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.3018"}
