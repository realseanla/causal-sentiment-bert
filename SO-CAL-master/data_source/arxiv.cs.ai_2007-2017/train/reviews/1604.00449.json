The network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data. Our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid. Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 01:28:27 GMT  (8149kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00449v1", "Appendix can be found atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Appendix can be found atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["christopher b choy", "danfei xu", "junyoung gwak", "kevin chen", "silvio savarese"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00449"}
