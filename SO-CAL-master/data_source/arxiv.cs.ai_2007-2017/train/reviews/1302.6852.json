Since these conditions are arguably more intuitive than some of the graphoid properties, they can be viewed as explanations why probability and certain other formalisms generate graphoids. The conditions include a sufficient condition for the Intersection property which can still apply even if there is a strong logical relations hip between the variables. We indicate how these results can be used to produce theories of qualitative conditional probability which are semi-graphoids and graphoids.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:29 GMT  (1170kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6852v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nic wilson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6852"}
