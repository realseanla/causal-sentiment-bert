Our hypothesis is that ontologies along with their reasoning capabilities can have significant impact on improving various aspects of the Cloud computing phenomena. Ontologies can promote intelligent decision support mechanisms for various Cloud based services. They can also provide effective interoperability among the Cloud based systems and resources. This survey can promote a comprehensive understanding on the roles and significance of ontologies within the overall domain of Cloud Computing. Also, this project can potentially form the basis of new research area and possibilities for both ontology and Cloud computing communities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 05:39:37 GMT  (1378kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02333v1", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI", "authors": ["fahim t imam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02333"}
