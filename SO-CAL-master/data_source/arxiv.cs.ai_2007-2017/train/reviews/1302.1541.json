The runtime of such procedures is characterized by a random variable. Different algorithms give rise to different probability distributions. One can take advantage of such differences by combining several algorithms into a portfolio, and running them in parallel or interleaving them on a single processor. We provide a detailed evaluation of the portfolio approach on distributions of hard combinatorial search problems. We show under what conditions the protfolio approach can have a dramatic computational advantage over the best traditional methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:55:37 GMT  (1057kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1541v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["carla p gomes", "bart selman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1541"}
