A risk assessment method was then used to identify the flood risk in each community using the following risk factors: the area's urbanized area ratio, literacy rate, mortality rate, poverty incidence, radio/TV penetration, and state of structural and non-structural measures. Vulnerability is defined as a weighted-sum of these components. A penalty was imposed for reduced vulnerability. Optimization comparison was done with MatLab's Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing; results showed 'extreme' solutions and realistic designs, for simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 22:59:01 GMT  (269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6375v1", "UP ICE Centennial Conference Harmonizing Infrastructure with the Environment November 12, 2010 in Manila, Philippines 8th National conference on Information Technology Education (NCITE 2010) October 20-23, 2010 in Boracay, Philippines"]], "COMMENTS": "UP ICE Centennial Conference Harmonizing Infrastructure with the Environment November 12, 2010 in Manila, Philippines 8th National conference on Information Technology Education (NCITE 2010) October 20-23, 2010 in Boracay, Philippines", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vena pearl bongolan", "florencio c ballesteros", "jr", "joyce anne m banting", "aina marie q olaes", "charlymagne r aquino"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.6375"}
