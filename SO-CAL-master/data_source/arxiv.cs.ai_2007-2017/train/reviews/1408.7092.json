The approaches introduced here rely on graph-oriented knowledge representation, reasoning and operationalization to model and support actors, actions and interactions in web-based epistemic communities. The re-search results are applied to support and foster interactions in online communities and manage their resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 18:17:30 GMT  (184kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.7092v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["fabien lucien gandon", "michel buffa", "elena cabrio", "catherine faron-zucker", "alain giboin", "nhan le thanh", "isabelle mirbel", "peter sander", "rea g b tettamanzi", "serena villata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.7092"}
