{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Jun-2016", "title": "Clique-Width and Directed Width Measures for Answer-Set Programming", "abstract": "Disjunctive Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful declarative programming paradigm whose main decision problems are located on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Identifying tractable fragments and developing efficient algorithms for such fragments are thus important objectives in order to complement the sophisticated ASP systems available to date. Hard problems can become tractable if some problem parameter is bounded by a fixed constant; such problems are then called fixed-parameter tractable (FPT). While several FPT results for ASP exist, parameters that relate to directed or signed graphs representing the program at hand have been neglected so far. In this paper, we first give some negative observations showing that directed width measures on the dependency graph of a program do not lead to FPT results. We then consider the graph parameter of signed clique-width and present a novel dynamic programming algorithm that is FPT w.r.t. this parameter. Clique-width is more general than the well-known treewidth, and, to the best of our knowledge, ours is the first FPT algorithm for bounded clique-width for reasoning problems beyond SAT.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 12:14:33 GMT  (40kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09449v1", "A short version of this paper has been accepted to ECAI 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 12:00:28 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09449v2", "A short version of this paper has been accepted to ECAI 2016 and TAASP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "A short version of this paper has been accepted to ECAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.DS", "authors": ["bernhard bliem", "sebastian ordyniak", "stefan woltran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09449"}
