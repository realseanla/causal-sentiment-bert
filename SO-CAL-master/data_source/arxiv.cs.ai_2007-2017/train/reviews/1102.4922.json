In this paper, we follow this line of research by considering the problem of counting solutions of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (#CSP). We consider the random model, i.e. RB model. We prove that phase transition of #CSP does exist as the number of variables approaches infinity and the critical values where phase transitions occur are precisely located. Preliminary experimental results also show that the critical point coincides with the theoretical derivation. Moreover, we propose an approximate algorithm to estimate the expectation value of the solutions number of a given CSP instance of RB model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 08:07:54 GMT  (436kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4922v1", "submitted to AAAI-11"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to AAAI-11", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["minghao yin", "ping huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.4922"}
