Many exact solvers for MaxSAT have been developed during recent years, and many of them were presented in the well-known SAT conference. Algorithms for MaxSAT generally fall into two categories: (1) branch and bound algorithms and (2) algorithms that use successive calls to a SAT solver (SAT- based), which this paper in on. In practical problems, SAT-based algorithms have been shown to be more efficient. This paper provides an experimental investigation to compare the performance of recent SAT-based and branch and bound algorithms on the benchmarks of the MaxSAT Evaluations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 22:54:28 GMT  (198kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03814v1", "Survey, 46 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Survey, 46 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.LO", "authors": ["mohamed el halaby"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03814"}
