Practical nonlinear probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video sequences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jul 2011 15:54:05 GMT  (7958kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.4985v1", "16 pages, 19 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 19 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.CV math.PR", "authors": ["andreas c damianou", "michalis k titsias", "neil d lawrence"], "accepted": true, "id": "1107.4985"}
