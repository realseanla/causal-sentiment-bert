We present the ideas behind a new algorithm for detecting the coincidence of eventualities xp and yq within a cycle of the double recurrence of x and y. The algorithm is based on the novel concept of gcd partitions that requires the partitioning of each of the incidences of both x and y into eventuality sequences each of which components have a duration that is equal to the greatest common divisor of the durations of x and y. The worst case running time of the partitioning algorithm is linear in the maximum of the duration of x and that of y, while the worst case running time of an algorithm exploring a complete cycle is quadratic in the durations of x and y. Hence the partitioning algorithm works faster than the cyclical exploration in the worst case.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 16:31:58 GMT  (299kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00211v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["b o akinkunmi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00211"}
