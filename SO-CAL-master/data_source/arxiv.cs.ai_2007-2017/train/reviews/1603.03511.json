While the syntax of an application domain is captured by set theoretic constructs including individuals, concepts and operators, knowledge is formalized by equality assertions. We first present a primitive form that uses minimal assumed knowledge and constructs. Then, assuming naive set theory, we extend it by definitions, which are special kinds of knowledge. Interestingly, we show that the primitive form is expressive enough to define logic operators, not only propositional connectives but also quantifiers.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 03:22:12 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03511v1", "This paper targets an ambitious goal to rebuild a foundation of knowledge representation based on set theory rather than classical logic.
