In most cases, agents work under complete information, building complete knowledge bases. The present article introduces a general-purpose MAP framework designed to tackle problems of any coupling levels under incomplete information. Agents in our MAP model are partially unaware of the information managed by the rest of agents and share only the critical information that affects other agents, thus maintaining a distributed vision of the task.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 11:56:41 GMT  (700kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07423v1", "40 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "40 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alejandro torre\\~no", "eva onaindia", "\\'oscar sapena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07423"}
