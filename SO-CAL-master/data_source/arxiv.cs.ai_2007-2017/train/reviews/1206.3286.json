In our view, the problem has both a scheduling aspect and a machine learning aspect. Prior work has largely addressed one of the two aspects in isolation. Building on recent work on the scheduling aspect of the problem, we present a technique that addresses both aspects simultaneously and has attractive theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, we show that this technique can be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms for Boolean satisfiability, zero-one integer programming, and A.I. planning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:45:20 GMT  (295kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3286v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["matthew streeter", "stephen f smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3286"}
