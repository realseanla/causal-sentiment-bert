These decisions affect the performance of the finished solver significantly. Once a design decision has been made, it cannot easily be reversed, although a different decision may be more appropriate for a particular problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 May 2010 17:53:43 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.3502v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["lars kotthoff", "ian gent", "ian miguel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.3502"}
