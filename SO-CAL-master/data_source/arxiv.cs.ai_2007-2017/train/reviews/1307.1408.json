This paper aims to investigate this problem in detail in order to analyse when a type-2 controller will improve upon type-1 performance. A robotic sailing boat is subjected to several experiments in which the uncertainty and difficulty of the sailing problem is increased in order to observe the effects on measured performance. Improved performance is observed but not in every case. The size of the FOU is shown to be have a large effect on performance with potentially severe performance penalties for incorrectly sized footprints.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 16:57:37 GMT  (643kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1408v1", "2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), pp 1-8, 2012"], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 13:44:11 GMT  (191kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1408v2", "2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), pp 1-8, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "2012 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), pp 1-8, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["naisan benatar", "uwe aickelin", "jonathan m garibaldi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1408"}
