In order to find a configuration a solver has to instantiate a number of components of a some type and each of these components can be used in a relation defined for a type. Therefore, many solutions of a configuration problem have symmetric ones which can be obtained by replacing some component of a solution by another one of the same type. These symmetric solutions decrease performance of optimization algorithms because of two reasons: a) they satisfy all requirements and cannot be pruned out from the search space; and b) existence of symmetric optimal solutions does not allow to prove the optimum in a feasible time.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Dec 2012 21:47:26 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2657v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anna ryabokon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.2657"}
