A more general concept of continuous function which is defined between two domain-free continuous information algebras is presented. It is shown that, with the operations combination and focusing, the set of all continuous functions between two domain-free s-continuous information algebras forms a new s-continuous information algebra. By studying the relationship between domain-free information algebras and labeled information algebras, it is demonstrated that they do correspond to each other on s-compactness.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Jan 2012 02:40:12 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0414v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xuechong guan", "yongming li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.0414"}
