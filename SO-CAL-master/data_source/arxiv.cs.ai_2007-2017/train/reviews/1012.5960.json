This method is similar to the concept of extending points with an internal reference direction to get oriented points which are the basic entities in the OPRAm calculus. Even if the spatial objects are from a geometrical point of view infinitesimal small points locally available reference measures are attached. In the case of OPRAm, a reference direction is attached. The same principle works also with local reference distances which are called elevations. The principle of attaching references features to a point is called hidden feature attachment.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 15:29:33 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5960v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["reinhard moratz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.5960"}
