This work introduces SkILL, a Stochastic Inductive Logic Learner, which takes probabilistic annotated data and produces First Order Logic theories. Data in several domains such as medicine and bioinformatics have an inherent degree of uncer- tainty, that can be used to produce models closer to reality. SkILL can not only use this type of probabilistic data to extract non-trivial knowl- edge from databases, but it also addresses efficiency issues by introducing a novel, efficient and effective search strategy to guide the search in PILP environments. The capabilities of SkILL are demonstrated in three dif- ferent datasets: (i) a synthetic toy example used to validate the system, (ii) a probabilistic adaptation of a well-known biological metabolism ap- plication, and (iii) a real world medical dataset in the breast cancer domain. Results show that SkILL can perform as well as a deterministic ILP learner, while also being able to incorporate probabilistic knowledge that would otherwise not be considered.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 14:10:02 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00893v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joana c\\^orte-real", "theofrastos mantadelis", "in\\^es dutra", "ricardo rocha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00893"}
