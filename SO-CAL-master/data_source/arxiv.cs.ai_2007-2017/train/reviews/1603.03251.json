It is necessary to use an adapted model to simulate the human behavior in a domestic space to monitor the patient harmonically and to intervene in the necessary time. In this paper, we tackle this problem using the hierarchical hidden Markov model for representing and recognizing complex indoor activities. We propose a new grammar, called \"Home By Room Activities Language\", to facilitate the complexity of human scenarios and consider the abnormal activities.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 13:09:57 GMT  (394kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03251v1", "The International Conference on Sensor Networks (SENSORNETS'16), Feb 2016, rome, Italy.
