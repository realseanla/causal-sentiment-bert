In particular, deliberation leads to the formation of intentions, i.e., plans of action that the agent is committed to achieving. In this paper, we present a branching time possible-worlds model for representing and reasoning about, beliefs, goals, intentions, time, actions, probabilities, and payoffs. We compare this possible-worlds approach with the more traditional decision tree representation and provide a transformation from decision trees to possible worlds. Finally, we illustrate how an agent can perform deliberation using a decision-tree representation and then use a possible-worlds model to form and reason about his intentions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:32:42 GMT  (362kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5742v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anand s rao", "michael p georgeff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5742"}
