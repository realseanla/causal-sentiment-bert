Evolutionary algorithms provide a technique to discover such networks automatically. Despite significant computational requirements, we show that evolving models that rival large, hand-designed architectures is possible today. We employ simple evolutionary techniques at unprecedented scales to discover models for the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, starting from trivial initial conditions. To do this, we use novel and intuitive mutation operators that navigate large search spaces. We stress that no human participation is required once evolution starts and that the output is a fully-trained model. Throughout this work, we place special emphasis on the repeatability of results, the variability in the outcomes and the computational requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 05:41:30 GMT  (3033kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01041v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 11 Jun 2017 08:42:28 GMT  (3143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01041v2", "Accepted for publication at ICML 2017 (34th International Conference on Machine Learning)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV cs.DC", "authors": ["esteban real", "sherry moore", "andrew selle", "saurabh saxena", "yutaka leon suematsu", "jie tan", "quoc v le", "alexey kurakin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.01041"}
