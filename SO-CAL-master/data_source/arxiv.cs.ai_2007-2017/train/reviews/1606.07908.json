Given a set of class labels, a category taxonomy is automatically learned by collectively optimizing a clustering of the labels into multiple meta-classes in a tree structure. An acoustic scene instance is then embedded into a low-dimensional feature representation which consists of the likelihoods that it belongs to the meta-classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on two different datasets for the acoustic scene classification task, including the DCASE 2013 and LITIS Rouen datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Jun 2016 12:57:44 GMT  (151kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07908v1", "to appear in the Proceedings of ACM Multimedia 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 26 Jul 2016 11:42:20 GMT  (156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07908v2", "to appear in the Proceedings of ACM Multimedia 2016 (ACMMM 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear in the Proceedings of ACM Multimedia 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.AI cs.SD", "authors": ["huy phan", "lars hertel", "marco maass", "philipp koch", "alfred mertins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07908"}
