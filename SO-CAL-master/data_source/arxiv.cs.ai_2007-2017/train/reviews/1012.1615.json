However, the databases that republish the experimental information are often both incomplete and inconsistent. This paper examines a system, Argudas, designed to help tackle these issues. Argudas is an evolution of an existing system, and so that system is reviewed as a means of both explaining and justifying the behaviour of Argudas. Throughout the discussion of Argudas a number of issues will be raised including the appropriateness of argumentation in biology and the challenges faced when integrating apparently similar online biological databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 21:34:26 GMT  (5656kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1615v1", "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.
