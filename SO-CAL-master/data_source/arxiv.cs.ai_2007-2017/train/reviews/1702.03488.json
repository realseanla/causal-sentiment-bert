Previous agents have focused on cost-quality, or cost-time tradeoffs, limiting their real-world applicability. As a step towards this goal we present Octopus, the first AI agent that jointly manages all three objectives in tandem. Octopus is based on a computationally tractable, multi-agent formulation consisting of three components; one that sets the price per ballot to adjust the rate of completion of tasks, another that optimizes each task for quality and a third that performs task selection. We demonstrate that Octopus outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in simulation and experiments with real data, demonstrating its superior performance. We also deploy Octopus on Amazon Mechanical Turk to establish its ability to manage tasks in a real-world, dynamic setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Feb 2017 04:53:25 GMT  (1478kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03488v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 09:14:08 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03488v2", "10 pages, to appear in HCOMP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC cs.MA", "authors": ["karan goel", "shreya rajpal", "mausam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03488"}
