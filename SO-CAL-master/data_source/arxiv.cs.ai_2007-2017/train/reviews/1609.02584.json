The most essential benefit of such logical KBs is the opportunity to perform automatic reasoning which however requires a KB to meet some minimal quality criteria such as consistency. Without adequate tool assistance, the task of resolving such violated quality criteria in a KB can be extremely hard, especially when the problematic KB is large and complex. To this end, interactive KB debuggers have been introduced which ask a user queries whether certain statements must or must not hold in the intended domain. The given answers help to gradually restrict the search space for KB repairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 20:48:32 GMT  (493kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02584v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 30 May 2017 09:57:45 GMT  (525kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02584v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick rodler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02584"}
