These properties are used to recognise an image or an object. Then this process could be taken as a model to develop computer algorithms for images identification. This paper proposes the idea of applying the simplified firefly algorithm to search for key-areas in 2D images. For a set of input test images the proposed version of firefly algorithm has been examined. Research results are presented and discussed to show the efficiency of this evolutionary computation method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 18:00:11 GMT  (7329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6464v1", "Published version on: 2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Human-like Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "Published version on: 2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Human-like Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["christian napoli", "giuseppe pappalardo", "emiliano tramontana", "zbigniew marsza{\\l}ek", "dawid po{\\l}ap", "marcin wo\\'zniak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6464"}
