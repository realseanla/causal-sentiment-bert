However, it turns out that the inconsistencies introduced when different graph instances have different edge sets pose a serious challenge. In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding maximum weighted cliques.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:24:31 GMT  (851kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4652v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["novi quadrianto", "chao chen", "christoph h lampert"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4652"}
