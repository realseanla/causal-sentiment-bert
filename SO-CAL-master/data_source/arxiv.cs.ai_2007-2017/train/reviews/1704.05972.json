Even Oxford Dictionaries named \"post-truth\" as the word of 2016. This makes it more important than ever to build systems that can identify the veracity of a story, and the kind of discourse there is around it. RumourEval is a SemEval shared task that aims to identify and handle rumours and reactions to them, in text. We present an annotation scheme, a large dataset covering multiple topics - each having their own families of claims and replies - and use these to pose two concrete challenges as well as the results achieved by participants on these challenges.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Apr 2017 01:21:20 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05972v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["leon derczynski", "kalina bontcheva", "maria liakata", "rob procter", "geraldine wong sak hoi", "arkaitz zubiaga"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05972"}
