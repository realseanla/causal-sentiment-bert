In this context, the envisaged paradigmatic extensions to contemporary foundational GIS technology raises fundamental questions concerning the ontological, formal representational, and (analytical) computational methods that would underlie their spatial information theoretic underpinnings.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Jul 2013 18:54:29 GMT  (23008kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2541v1", "Draft version of article in review at: ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information (ISSN 2220-9964); Special Issue on: Geospatial Monitoring and Modelling of Environmental Change}.
