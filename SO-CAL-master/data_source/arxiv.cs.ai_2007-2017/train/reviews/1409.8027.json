{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Sep-2014", "title": "Autonomous robots and the SP theory of intelligence", "abstract": "This article is about how the \"SP theory of intelligence\" and its realisation in the \"SP machine\" (both outlined in the article) may help to solve computer-related problems in the design of autonomous robots, meaning robots that do not depend on external intelligence or power supplies, are mobile, and are designed to exhibit as much human-like intelligence as possible. The article is about: how to increase the computational and energy efficiency of computers and reduce their bulk; how to achieve human-like versatility in intelligence; and likewise for human-like adaptability in intelligence. The SP system has potential for substantial gains in computational and energy efficiency and reductions in the bulkiness of computers: by reducing the size of data to be processed; by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers; and via an updated version of Donald Hebb's concept of a \"cell assembly\". Towards human-like versatility in intelligence, the SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, and more, with seamless integration amongst structures and functions. The SP system's strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help to achieve human-like adaptability in intelligence via: the learning of natural language; learning to see; building 3D models of objects and of a robot's surroundings; learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot's environment; exploration and play; learning major skills; and secondary forms of learning. Also discussed are: how the SP system may process parallel streams of information; generalisation of knowledge, correction of over-generalisations, and learning from dirty data; how to cut the cost of learning; and reinforcements, motivations, goals, and demonstration.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 08:41:01 GMT  (78kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8027v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Jan 2015 08:47:02 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8027v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j gerard wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8027"}
