The basic idea of this approach is to tune both synaptic weights and membership functions with the help of the supervised learning and self-learning paradigms. The approach to solving the problem has to do with evolving online neuro-fuzzy systems that can process data under uncertainty conditions. The results prove the effectiveness of the developed architecture and the learning procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:29:40 GMT  (335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06488v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "anastasiia o deineko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06488"}
