In this paper we define the term 'PCG-based game', and explain how this concept follows on from the idea of an AI-based game. We look at existing examples of games which foreground their AI, put forward a methodology for designing PCG-based games, describe some example case study designs for PCG-based games, and describe lessons learned during this process of sketching and developing ideas.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 00:23:09 GMT  (1465kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03138v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["michael cook", "mirjam eladhari", "y nealen", "mike treanor", "eddy boxerman", "alex jaffe", "paul sottosanti", "steve swink"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03138"}
