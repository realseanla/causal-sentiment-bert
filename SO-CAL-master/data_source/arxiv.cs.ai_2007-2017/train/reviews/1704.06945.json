In this paper, we propose for the first time a screen capture learning agent for General Video Game AI framework. A Deep Q-Network algorithm was applied and improved to develop an agent capable of learning to play different games in the framework. After testing this algorithm using various games of different categories and difficulty levels, the results suggest that our proposed screen capture learning agent has the potential to learn many different games using only a single learning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 16:08:06 GMT  (1372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06945v1", "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Evolutionary Computation 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kamolwan kunanusont", "simon m lucas", "diego perez-liebana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.06945"}
