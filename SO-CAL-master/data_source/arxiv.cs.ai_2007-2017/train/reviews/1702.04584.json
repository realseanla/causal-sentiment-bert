Developed within the MODEUS project (Making Open Data Effectively Usable), this study originates from the following key ideas of MODEUS: to require Open Data to be expressed in terms of an ontology, and to include such an ontology as a documentation of the data themselves. Thus, Open Data are naturally linked by means of the ontology, which meets the requirements of the Linked Open Data vision.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 12:58:39 GMT  (1548kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04584v1", "in Italian"]], "COMMENTS": "in Italian", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DL", "authors": ["lina antonietta coppola"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04584"}
