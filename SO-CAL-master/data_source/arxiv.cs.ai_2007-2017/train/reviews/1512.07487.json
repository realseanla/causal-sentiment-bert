This is an important problem with many relevant applications, for example in networked recommendation systems. The core of the algorithms is that objects are distributed to crowd workers, who return a noisy evaluation. All received evaluations are then combined, to identify the top-quality object. We first present a simple probabilistic model for the system under investigation. Then, we devise and study a class of efficient adaptive algorithms to assign in an effective way objects to workers. We compare the performance of several algorithms, which correspond to different choices of the design parameters/metrics. We finally compare our approach based on scoring object qualities against traditional proposals based on comparisons and tournaments.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 14:23:15 GMT  (98kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07487v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 08:50:48 GMT  (102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07487v2", "To be published, ACM TOMPECS 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI", "authors": ["alessandro nordio", "alberto tarable", "emilio leonardi", "marco ajmone marsan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07487"}
