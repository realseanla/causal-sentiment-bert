{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-May-2011", "title": "Ontology Alignment at the Instance and Schema Level", "abstract": "We present PARIS, an approach for the automatic alignment of ontologies. PARIS aligns not only instances, but also relations and classes. Alignments at the instance-level cross-fertilize with alignments at the schema-level. Thereby, our system provides a truly holistic solution to the problem of ontology alignment. The heart of the approach is probabilistic. This allows PARIS to run without any parameter tuning. We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm and its precision through extensive experiments. In particular, we obtain a precision of around 80% in experiments with two of the world's largest ontologies.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 10:18:08 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5516v1", "Technical Report at INRIA RT-0408"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Jun 2011 12:38:05 GMT  (246kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5516v2", "Technical Report at INRIA RT-0408; N&amp;deg; RT-0408 (2011)"], ["v3", "Thu, 18 Aug 2011 13:00:27 GMT  (216kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5516v3", "Technical Report at INRIA RT-0408"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report at INRIA RT-0408", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fabian suchanek", "serge abiteboul", "pierre senellart"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5516"}
