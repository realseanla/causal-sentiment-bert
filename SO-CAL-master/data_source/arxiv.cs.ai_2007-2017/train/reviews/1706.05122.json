Based on this model, we present a novel search system that shows the relationships among the elements in the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus. The evaluation results show that our model can achieve a high prediction ability and produce reasonable search results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 00:53:28 GMT  (630kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05122v1", "EACL2017 extended version"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 16:33:20 GMT  (1107kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05122v2", "EACL2017 extended version.
