Correlating references to entities across systems that use different identifiers or names for them is a widespread problem. In this paper, we show how shared knowledge between systems can be used to solve this problem. We present \"reference by description\", a formal model for resolving references. We provide some results on the conditions under which a randomly chosen entity in one system can, with high probability, be mapped to the same entity in a different system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 18:25:53 GMT  (303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6973v1", "18 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["r v guha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6973"}
