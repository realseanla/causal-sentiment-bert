{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Dec-2014", "title": "RoboBrain: Large-Scale Knowledge Engine for Robots", "abstract": "In this paper we introduce a knowledge engine, which learns and shares knowledge representations, for robots to carry out a variety of tasks. Building such an engine brings with it the challenge of dealing with multiple data modalities including symbols, natural language, haptic senses, robot trajectories, visual features and many others. The knowledge stored in the engine comes from multiple sources including physical interactions that robots have while performing tasks (perception, planning and control), knowledge bases from WWW and learned representations from leading robotics research groups.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 21:22:46 GMT  (7935kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0691v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 12 Apr 2015 06:16:39 GMT  (3064kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0691v2", "10 pages, 9 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["ashutosh saxena", "ashesh jain", "ozan sener", "aditya jami", "dipendra k misra", "hema s koppula"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.0691"}
