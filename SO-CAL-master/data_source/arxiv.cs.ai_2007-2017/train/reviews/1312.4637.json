However, different LP relaxations often have different objective functions and variables of differing dimensions, which presents a barrier to effective comparison and analysis. In addition, the computational complexity of LP relaxation-based methods grows quickly with the number of constraints. Reducing the number of constraints without sacrificing the quality of the solutions is thus desirable.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 04:44:04 GMT  (16118kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4637v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Apr 2014 09:30:20 GMT  (12599kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4637v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["zhen zhang", "qinfeng shi", "yanning zhang", "chunhua shen", "anton van den hengel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4637"}
