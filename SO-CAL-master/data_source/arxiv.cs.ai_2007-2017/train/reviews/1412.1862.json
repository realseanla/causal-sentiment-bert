We argue that one can legitimately answer positively or negatively, depending on how the notion of justification is understood. To facilitate our argument, we introduce a simple propositional logic of reason-based belief. We show that this logic is sufficiently flexible to accommodate various useful features, including quantification over reasons. We use our framework to contrast two notions of JTB: one internalist, the other externalist. We argue that Gettier cases essentially challenge the internalist notion but not the externalist one. In particular, we may equate knowledge and JTB if the latter is grounded in what we call \"adequate\" reasons.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 23:21:12 GMT  (37kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1862v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 05:05:05 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1862v2", "v2 fixes omission in v1 of (MA) in axiomatization of RBB_sigma"], ["v3", "Wed, 20 May 2015 13:54:36 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1862v3", "v3 edits acknowledgments"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["paul egr\\'e", "paul marty", "bryan renne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.1862"}
