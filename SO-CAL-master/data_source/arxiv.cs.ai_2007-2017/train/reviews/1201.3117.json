These scripts have usually associated some well-known problems (e.g., predictability, non-rationality, repetitive behaviors, and sensation of artificial stupidity among others). This paper describes a method for the automatic generation of virtual players that adapt to the player skills; this is done by building initially a model of the player behavior in real time during the game, and further evolving the virtual player via this model in-between two games. The paper also shows preliminary results obtained on a one player wRTS game constructed specifically for experimentation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2012 20:06:07 GMT  (642kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3117v1", "IWINAC International Work-conference on the Interplay between Natural and Artificial Computation 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "IWINAC International Work-conference on the Interplay between Natural and Artificial Computation 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["jos\\'e a garc\\'ia guti\\'errez", "carlos cotta", "antonio j fern\\'andez-leiva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3117"}
