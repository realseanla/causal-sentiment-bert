We describe a flexible grammar-based black-box ASP fuzz testing tool which is able to reveal various defects such as unsound and incomplete behavior, i.e. invalid answer sets and inability to find existing solutions, in state-of-the-art answer set solver implementations. Moreover, we develop delta debugging techniques for shrinking failure-inducing inputs on which solvers exhibit defective behavior. In particular, we develop a delta debugging algorithm in the context of answer set solving, and evaluate two different elimination strategies for the algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Jul 2010 17:51:54 GMT  (46kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.3223v1", "18 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["robert brummayer", "matti j\\\"arvisalo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1007.3223"}
