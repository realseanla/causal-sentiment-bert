Although SMP can be solved in polynomial time, SMP-C is NP-Complete. Hence, it is not clear which, if any, of the theoretical results surrounding the canonical SMP problem apply in this setting. In this paper, we use a recently-developed SAT encoding to solve SMP-C exactly. This allows us to enumerate all stable matchings for any given instance of SMP-C. With this tool, we empirically evaluate some of the properties that have been hypothesized to hold for SMP-C.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 May 2015 17:25:56 GMT  (555kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03463v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["andrew perrault", "joanna drummond", "fahiem bacchus"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03463"}
