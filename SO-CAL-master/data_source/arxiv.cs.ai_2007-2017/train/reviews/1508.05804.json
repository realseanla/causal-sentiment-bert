We show that Simon's classical algorithm to infer causal ordering is NP-Hard---an intractability previously guessed by Nayak but not yet proven. We present then a detailed account based on Nayak's suggested algorithmic solution (the best available), which is dominated by computing transitive closure---bounded in time by $O(|\\mathcal S|^3)$, where $\\mathcal S(\\mathcal E, \\mathcal V)$ is the input system structure composed of a set $\\mathcal E$ of equations over a set $\\mathcal V$ of variables with density $|\\mathcal S|$. We also comment on the potential of causal ordering for emerging applications in large-scale hypothesis management and predictive analytics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 13:56:32 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05804v1", "17 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 02:54:54 GMT  (48kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05804v2", "25 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bernardo gon\\c{c}alves", "fabio porto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.05804"}
