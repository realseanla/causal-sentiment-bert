Prior work indicates that majority voting is effective for low difficulty tasks, but has limitations for harder tasks. This paper explores two methods of addressing this problem: tournament selection and elimination selection, which exploit 2-, 3- and 4-way comparisons between different answers to human computation tasks. Our experimental results and statistical analyses show that both methods produce the correct answer in noisy human computation environment more often than majority voting. Furthermore, we find that the use of 4-way comparisons can significantly reduce the cost of quality assurance relative to the use of 2-way comparisons.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 15:12:22 GMT  (383kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3516v1", "Presented at Collective Intelligence conference, 2012 (arXiv:1204.2991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at Collective Intelligence conference, 2012 (arXiv:1204.2991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI", "authors": ["yu-an sun", "christopher dance"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3516"}
