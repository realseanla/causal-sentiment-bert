However this method is sometimes shown to be too restrictive and unable to adapt in the presence of uncertainty. In this paper we compare type-1 fuzzy control with several other fuzzy approaches under a range of uncertain conditions. Interval type-2 and non-stationary fuzzy controllers are compared, along with 'dual surface' type-2 control, named due to utilising both the lower and upper values produced from standard interval type-2 systems. We tune a type-1 controller, then derive the membership functions and footprints of uncertainty from the type-1 system and evaluate them using a simulated autonomous sailing problem with varying amounts of environmental uncertainty. We show that while these more sophisticated controllers can produce better performance than the type-1 controller, this is not guaranteed and that selection of Footprint of Uncertainty (FOU) size has a large effect on this relative performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jul 2013 16:34:00 GMT  (1269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1070v1", "2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp 1193-1200"]], "COMMENTS": "2011 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, pp 1193-1200", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["naisan benatar", "uwe aickelin", "jonathan m garibaldi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1070"}
