In contrast, the image subcategory of freehand sketches has not received as much attention for such studies. In this paper, we analyze the results of a free-viewing gaze fixation study conducted on 3904 freehand sketches distributed across 160 object categories. Our analysis shows that fixation sequences exhibit marked consistency within a sketch, across sketches of a category and even across suitably grouped sets of categories. This multi-level consistency is remarkable given the variability in depiction and extreme image content sparsity that characterizes hand-drawn object sketches. In our paper, we show that the multi-level consistency in the fixation data can be exploited to (a) predict a test sketch's category given only its fixation sequence and (b) build a computational model which predicts part-labels underlying fixations on objects. We hope that our findings motivate the community to deem sketch-like representations worthy of gaze-based studies vis-a-vis photographic images.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 01:13:33 GMT  (734kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06554v1", "Accepted for publication in Transactions on Image Processing (this http URL)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication in Transactions on Image Processing (this http URL)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["ravi kiran sarvadevabhatla", "sudharshan suresh", "r venkatesh babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06554"}
