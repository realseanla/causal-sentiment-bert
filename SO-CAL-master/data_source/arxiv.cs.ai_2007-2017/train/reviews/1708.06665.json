{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Aug-2017", "title": "Software engineering and the SP theory of intelligence", "abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach to software engineering derived from the \"SP theory of intelligence\" and its realisation in the \"SP computer model\". These are the bases of a projected industrial-strength \"SP machine\" which, when mature, is anticipated to be the vehicle for software engineering as described in this paper. Potential benefits of this new approach to software engineering include: the automation of semi-automation of software development, with non-automatic programming of the SP system where necessary; allowing programmers to concentrate on 'real-world' parallelism, without worries about parallelism to speed up processing; the ambitious long-term goal of programming the SP system via written or spoken natural language; reducing or eliminating the distinction between 'design' and 'implementation'; reducing or eliminating operations like compiling or interpretation; reducing or eliminating the need for verification of software; reducing the need for an explicit process of validation of software; no formal distinction between program and database; potential for substantial reductions in the number of types of data file and the number of computer languages; benefits for version control; and reducing technical debt.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 19:27:49 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06665v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["j gerard wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06665"}
