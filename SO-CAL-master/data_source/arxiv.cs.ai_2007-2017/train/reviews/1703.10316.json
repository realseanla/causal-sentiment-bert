Translating embedding methods regard relations as the translation from head entities to tail entities, which achieve the state-of-the-art results among knowledge graph embedding methods. However, a major limitation of these methods is the time consuming training process, which may take several days or even weeks for large knowledge graphs, and result in great difficulty in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallel framework for translating embedding methods, called ParTrans-X, which enables the methods to be paralleled without locks by utilizing the distinguished structures of knowledge graphs. Experiments on two datasets with three typical translating embedding methods, i.e., TransE [3], TransH [17], and a more efficient variant TransE- AdaGrad [10] validate that ParTrans-X can speed up the training process by more than an order of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 05:20:18 GMT  (145kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10316v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 10:52:29 GMT  (585kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10316v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["denghui zhang", "manling li", "yantao jia", "yuanzhuo wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10316"}
