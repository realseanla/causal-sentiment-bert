We define a generic model where transitions are labeled by elements of a finite partition of the alphabet. We then extend Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular languages from examples for such automata. We have implemented this algorithm and we demonstrate its behavior where the alphabet is a subset of the natural or real numbers. We sketch the extension of the algorithm to a class of languages over partially ordered alphabets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 13:12:54 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00482v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Sep 2015 19:04:30 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00482v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.FL", "authors": ["irini-eleftheria mens", "oded maler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00482"}
