The skeletal animation approach is adapted to make use of a deformable rig controlled by tongue motion capture data obtained with electromagnetic articulography (EMA), while the tongue surface is extracted from volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Initial results are shown and future work outlined.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Jan 2012 15:29:56 GMT  (883kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4080v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ingmar steiner", "slim ouni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.4080"}
