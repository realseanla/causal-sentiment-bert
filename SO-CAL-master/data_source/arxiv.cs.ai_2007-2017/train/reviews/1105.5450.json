The counterexample also suggests that Cox's assumptions are insufficient to prove the result even in infinite domains. The same counterexample is used to disprove a result of Fine on comparative conditional probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:49:04 GMT  (107kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5450v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j y halpern"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5450"}
