Recent Constraint Programming (CP) approaches for declarative itemset mining have proven their usefulness and flexibility. But the wide use of reified constraints in current CP approaches raises many difficulties to cope with high dimensional datasets. This paper proposes CLOSED PATTERN global constraint which does not require any reified constraints nor any extra variables to encode efficiently the Closed Frequent Pattern Mining (CFPM) constraint. CLOSED-PATTERN captures the particular semantics of the CFPM problem in order to ensure a polynomial pruning algorithm ensuring domain consistency. The computational properties of our constraint are analyzed and their practical effectiveness is experimentally evaluated.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 Apr 2016 16:32:27 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04894v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["mehdi maamar", "nadjib lazaar", "samir loudni", "yahia lebbah"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04894"}
