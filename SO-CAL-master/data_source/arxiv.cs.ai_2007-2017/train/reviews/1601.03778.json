Link prediction, or predicting the likelihood of a link in a knowledge graph based on prior state is a key research direction within this area. We propose a Latent Feature Embedding based link recommendation model for prediction task and utilize Bayesian Personalized Ranking based optimization technique for learning models for each predicate. Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2 show that our approach achieves substantially higher performance than several state-of-art approaches. Furthermore, we also study the performance of the link prediction algorithm in terms of topological properties of the Knowledge Graph and present a linear regression model to reason about its expected level of accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Jan 2016 23:13:00 GMT  (63kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03778v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 05:12:32 GMT  (64kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03778v2", "SDM Workshop on Mining Networks and Graphs (MNG 2016), Miami, FL"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["baichuan zhang", "sutanay choudhury", "mohammad al hasan", "xia ning", "khushbu agarwal", "sumit purohit", "paola pesntez cabrera"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.03778"}
