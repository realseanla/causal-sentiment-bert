Such uses are made possible by using semantically enriched 3D city models and by presenting such enriched 3D city models in a way that allows decision-making processes to be carried out from the best choices among sets of objectives, and across issues and scales. In order to help in such a decision-making process we have defined a framework to find the best visualization technique(s) for a set of potentially heterogeneous data that have to be visualized within the same 3D city model, in order to perform a given task in a specific context. We have chosen an ontology-based approach. This approach and the specification and use of the resulting ontology of 3D visualization techniques are described in this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 17:15:53 GMT  (2139kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6609v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 13:33:10 GMT  (2145kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6609v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GR cs.HC", "authors": ["claudine m\\'etral", "nizar ghoula", "gilles falquet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.6609"}
