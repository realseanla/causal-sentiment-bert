We suggest that the fundamental difference between human and machine intelligence comes down to \\emph{embodiment factors}. We define embodiment factors as the ratio between an entity's ability to communicate information vs compute information. We speculate on the role of embodiment factors in driving our own intelligence and consciousness. We briefly review dual process models of cognition and cast machine intelligence within that framework, characterising it as a dominant System Zero, which can drive behaviour through interfacing with us subconsciously. Driven by concerns about the consequence of such a system we suggest prophylactic courses of action that could be considered. Our main conclusion is that it is \\emph{not} sentient intelligence we should fear but \\emph{non-sentient} intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 20:49:43 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07996v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["neil d lawrence"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07996"}
