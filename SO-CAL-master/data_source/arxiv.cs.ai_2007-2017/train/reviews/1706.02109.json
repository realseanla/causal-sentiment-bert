Recent development in process mining allow for the discovery of such models. However, the focus is often on the representation of the individual artifacts rather than their interactions. Based on event data we can automatically discover composite state machines representing artifact-centric processes. Moreover, we provide ways of visualizing and quantifying interactions among different artifacts. For example, we are able to highlight strongly correlated behaviours in different artifacts. The approach has been fully implemented as a ProM plug-in; the CSM Miner provides an interactive artifact-centric process discovery tool focussing on interactions. The approach has been evaluated using real life data sets, including the personal loan and overdraft process of a Dutch financial institution.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 09:55:48 GMT  (2954kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02109v1", "10 pages, 4 figures, to be published in proceedings of the 19th IEEE Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 4 figures, to be published in proceedings of the 19th IEEE Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["maikel l van eck", "natalia sidorova", "wil m p van der aalst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02109"}
