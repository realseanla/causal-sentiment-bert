However, they neglect the fact that pedestrians possess no or only parts of information about their position relative to final exits and possible routes leading to them. To get a more realistic description we introduce the systematics of gathering and using spatial knowledge. A new wayfinding model for pedestrian dynamics is proposed. The model defines for every pedestrian an individual knowledge representation implying inaccuracies and uncertainties. In addition, knowledge-driven search strategies are introduced. The presented concept is tested on a fictive example scenario.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 10:25:15 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01971v1", "8 pages, 3 figures, TGF'15 Conference, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures, TGF'15 Conference, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["erik", "resen", "david haensel", "mohcine chraibi", "armin seyfried"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01971"}
