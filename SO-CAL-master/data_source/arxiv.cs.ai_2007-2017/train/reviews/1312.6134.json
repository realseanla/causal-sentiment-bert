The main contribution of this paper is that we capture justifications into an algebra of truth values with three internal operations: an addition '+' representing alternative justifications for a formula, a commutative product '*' representing joint interaction of causes and a non-commutative product '.' acting as a concatenation or proof constructor. Using this multi-valued semantics, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between the syntactic proof tree of a standard (non-causal) logic program and the interpretation of each true atom in a model. Furthermore, thanks to this algebraic characterization we can detect semantic properties like redundancy and relevance of the obtained justifications. We also identify a lattice-based characterization of this algebra, defining a direct consequences operator, proving its continuity and that its least fix point can be computed after a finite number of iterations. Finally, we define the concept of causal stable model by introducing an analogous transformation to Gelfond and Lifschitz's program reduct.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:07:19 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6134v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pedro cabalar", "jorge fandinno"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6134"}
