In this work, we focus on hardware implementation of brain-like learning in a brain-inspired architecture. We demonstrate, in hardware, that 2-D crossbar arrays of phase change synaptic devices can achieve associative learning and perform pattern recognition. Device and array-level studies using an experimental 10x10 array of phase change synaptic devices have shown that pattern recognition is robust against synaptic resistance variations and large variations can be tolerated by increasing the number of training iterations. Our measurements show that increase in initial variation from 9 % to 60 % causes required training iterations to increase from 1 to 11.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 May 2014 20:22:00 GMT  (1389kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7716v1", "IEDM 2013"], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Jun 2014 05:45:54 GMT  (4626kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7716v2", "IEDM 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "IEDM 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["s burc eryilmaz", "duygu kuzum", "rakesh g d jeyasingh", "sangbum kim", "matthew brightsky", "chung lam", "h -s philip wong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7716"}
