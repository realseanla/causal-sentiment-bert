Unlike previous works, we consider the general setting where the cost is a set function on sets of decisions. For this setting, we investigate the near-optimality of greedy policies when the utility function satisfies a novel property called pointwise cost-sensitive submodularity. This property is an extension of cost-sensitive submodularity, which in turn is a generalization of submodularity to general cost functions. We prove that two simple greedy policies for the problem are not near-optimal but the best between them is near-optimal. With this result, we propose a combined policy that is near-optimal with respect to the optimal worst-case policy that uses half of the budget. We discuss applications of our theoretical results and also report experimental results comparing the greedy policies on the active learning problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 03:27:41 GMT  (147kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09029v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 22 May 2017 21:08:53 GMT  (447kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09029v2", "This paper was published at the 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["nguyen cuong", "huan xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.09029"}
