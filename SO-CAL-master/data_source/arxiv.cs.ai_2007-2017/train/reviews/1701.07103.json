An analysis of current approaches to autonomous control is provided followed by an exploration of how these techniques can be extended and enriched with AI techniques including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Ensembling and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to evolve control strategies for UCAVs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 23:11:15 GMT  (271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07103v1", "12 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 3 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["amir husain", "bruce porter sparkcognition inc department of computer science", "university of texas at austin)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07103"}
