It works for any set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of homogeneous linear equations. A degree of consistency (and implicitly a degree of inconsistency) of a decision-making problem are defined. \\alpha-D MCDM is then generalized to a set of preferences that can be transformed into a system of linear and/or non-linear equations and/or inequalities. Many consistent, weak inconsistent, and strong inconsistent examples are given.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 Jan 2010 02:38:07 GMT  (267kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0102v1", "24 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 03:44:43 GMT  (264kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0102v2", "24 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 10 Feb 2010 18:58:01 GMT  (297kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0102v3", "26 pages"], ["v4", "Fri, 2 Dec 2011 20:08:40 GMT  (750kb,AD)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0102v4", "27 pages"], ["v5", "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 19:09:38 GMT  (1321kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0102v5", "62 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.0102"}
