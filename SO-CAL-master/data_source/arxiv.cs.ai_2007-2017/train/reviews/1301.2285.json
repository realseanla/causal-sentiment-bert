The availableinformation, consisting of a set of pointwise observations,is extrapolated to neighbour points. We make use of belief functions to represent the influence of the knowledge at a given point to another point; the quantitative strength of this influence decreases when the distance between both points increases. These influences arethen aggregated using a variant of Dempster's rule of combination which takes into account the relative dependence between observations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:24:41 GMT  (1013kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2285v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jerome lang", "philippe muller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2285"}
