This constraint acts between two sets of integer variables where the domains of those variables represent preferences. Our constraint enforces stability and disallows bigamy. For a stable marriage instance with $n$ men and $n$ women we require only one of these constraints, and the complexity of enforcing arc-consistency is $O(n^2)$ which is optimal in the size of input. Our computational studies show that our n-ary constraint is significantly faster and more space efficient than the encodings presented in \\cite{cp01}. We also introduce a new problem to the constraint community, the sex-equal stable marriage problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 12:56:47 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0183v1", "7 pages.
