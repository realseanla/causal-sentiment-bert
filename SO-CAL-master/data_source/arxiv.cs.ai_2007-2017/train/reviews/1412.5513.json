A case study of Photo-Z redshift reconstruction", "abstract": "The choice of architecture of artificial neuron network (ANN) is still a challenging task that users face every time. It greatly affects the accuracy of the built network. In fact there is no optimal method that is applicable to various implementations at the same time. In this paper we propose a method to construct ANN based on clustering, that resolves the problems of random and ad hoc approaches for multilayer ANN architecture. Our method can be applied to regression problems. Experimental results obtained with different datasets, reveals the efficiency of our method.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 18:36:23 GMT  (300kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5513v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["cyrine arouri", "engelbert mephu nguifo", "sabeur aridhi", "c\\'ecile roucelle", "gaelle bonnet-loosli", "norbert tsopz\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5513"}
