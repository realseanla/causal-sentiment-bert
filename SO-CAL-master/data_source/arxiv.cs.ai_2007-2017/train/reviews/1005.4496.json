The proposed algorithm also addresses some difficulties of data mining such as handling continuous attribute, dealing with missing attribute values, and reducing noise in training data. Due to the large volumes of security audit data as well as the complex and dynamic properties of intrusion behaviours, several data miningbased intrusion detection techniques have been applied to network-based traffic data and host-based data in the last decades. However, there remain various issues needed to be examined towards current intrusion detection systems (IDS). We tested the performance of our proposed algorithm with existing learning algorithms by employing on the KDD99 benchmark intrusion detection dataset. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm achieved high detection rates (DR) and significant reduce false positives (FP) for different types of network intrusions using limited computational resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 May 2010 07:47:00 GMT  (477kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4496v1", "14 Pages, IJNSA"]], "COMMENTS": "14 Pages, IJNSA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dewan md farid", "nouria harbi", "mohammad zahidur rahman", "university lumiere lyon 2 - france", "jahangirnagar university", "bangladesh)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.4496"}
