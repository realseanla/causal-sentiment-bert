Many of them, such as conformance checking, process alignment, mining and enhancement, rely on complete observation of past (tracked and logged) executions. In many real cases, however, the lack of human or IT-support on all the steps of process execution, as well as information hiding and abstraction of model and data, result in incomplete log information of both data and activities. This paper tackles the issue of automatically repairing traces with missing information by notably considering not only activities but also data manipulated by them. Our technique recasts such a problem in a reachability problem and provides an encoding in an action language which allows to virtually use any state-of-the-art planning to return solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 15:46:47 GMT  (222kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00356v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["riccardo de masellis", "chiara di francescomarino", "chiara ghidini", "sergio tessaris"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00356"}
