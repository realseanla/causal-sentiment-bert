In this paper we aim to reduce the time spent on computing heuristics. We discuss Lazy A*, a variant of A* where heuristics are evaluated lazily: only when they are essential to a decision to be made in the A* search process. We present a new rational meta-reasoning based scheme, rational lazy A*, which decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics at all, based on a myopic value of information estimate. Both methods are examined theoretically. Empirical evaluation on several domains supports the theoretical results, and shows that lazy A* and rational lazy A* are state-of-the-art heuristic combination methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 May 2013 06:41:00 GMT  (522kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5030v1", "7 pages, IJCAI 2013, to appear"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, IJCAI 2013, to appear", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david tolpin", "tal beja", "solomon eyal shimony", "ariel felner", "erez karpas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.5030"}
