Our approach computes valuable meta information such as the total number of valid configurations or the relative frequency of components. This information can be used to assess the severity of documentation errors or to measure documentation quality. As an application example we show how we apply these methods to product documentation formulas of the Mercedes-Benz line of vehicles. In order to process these large formulas we developed and implemented a new model counter for non-CNF formulas. Our model counter can process formulas, whose CNF representations could not be processed up till now.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jul 2010 00:13:11 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1024v1", "In Proceedings LoCoCo 2010,arXiv:1007.0831"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings LoCoCo 2010,arXiv:1007.0831", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.SC", "authors": ["andreas k\\\"ubler", "christoph zengler", "wolfgang k\\\"uchlin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1007.1024"}
