We discuss issues that arise when generalizing MAPF methods to real-world scenarios and four research directions that address them. We emphasize the importance of addressing these issues as opposed to developing faster methods for the standard formulation of the MAPF problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 20:39:38 GMT  (547kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05515v1", "In IJCAI-16 Workshop on Multi-Agent Path Finding"]], "COMMENTS": "In IJCAI-16 Workshop on Multi-Agent Path Finding", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["hang ma", "sven koenig", "nora ayanian", "liron cohen", "wolfgang hoenig", "t k satish kumar", "tansel uras", "hong xu", "craig tovey", "guni sharon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05515"}
