In another direction, historical research perceives that the performance of heuristic search algorithms, such as A* and IDA*, can be improved by requiring the heuristics to be consistent -- a property satisfied by any perfect heuristic. However, a few recent studies show that inconsistent heuristics can also be used to achieve a large improvement in these heuristic search algorithms. These results leave us a natural question: which property of heuristics, accuracy or consistency/inconsistency, should we focus on when building heuristics? While there are studies on the heuristic accuracy with the assumption of consistency, no studies on both the inconsistency and the accuracy of heuristics are known to our knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 18:53:07 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2200v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hang dinh", "hieu dinh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.2200"}
