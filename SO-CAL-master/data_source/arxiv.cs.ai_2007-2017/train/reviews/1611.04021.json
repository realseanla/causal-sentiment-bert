{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Nov-2016", "title": "Leveraging Video Descriptions to Learn Video Question Answering", "abstract": "We propose a scalable approach to learn video-based question answering (QA): answer a \"free-form natural language question\" about a video content. Our approach automatically harvests a large number of videos and descriptions freely available online. Then, a large number of candidate QA pairs are automatically generated from descriptions rather than manually annotated. Next, we use these candidate QA pairs to train a number of video-based QA methods extended fromMN (Sukhbaatar et al. 2015), VQA (Antol et al. 2015), SA (Yao et al. 2015), SS (Venugopalan et al. 2015). In order to handle non-perfect candidate QA pairs, we propose a self-paced learning procedure to iteratively identify them and mitigate their effects in training. Finally, we evaluate performance on manually generated video-based QA pairs. The results show that our self-paced learning procedure is effective, and the extended SS model outperforms various baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Nov 2016 17:15:57 GMT  (1315kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04021v1", "7 pages, 5 figures.
