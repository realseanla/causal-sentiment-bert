We study and compare several pseudorehearsal approaches for Q-learning with function approximation in a pole balancing task. We have found that pseudorehearsal seems to assist learning even in such very simple problems, given proper initialization of the rehearsal parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 07:09:27 GMT  (2120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07075v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vladimir marochko", "leonard johard", "manuel mazzara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07075"}
