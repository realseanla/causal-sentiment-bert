Gibbs sampling is the main technique used to perform diagnostic reasoning in large richly interconnected Bayesian networks. Unfortunately Gibbs sampling can take an excessive time to generate a representative sample. In this paper we describe and test a number of heuristic strategies for improving sampling in noisy-or Bayesian networks. The strategies include Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling techniques other than Gibbs sampling. Emphasis is put on strategies that can be implemented in distributed systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:44 GMT  (402kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4961v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mark hulme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4961"}
