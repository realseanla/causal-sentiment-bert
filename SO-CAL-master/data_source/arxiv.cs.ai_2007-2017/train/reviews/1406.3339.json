{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Jun-2014", "title": "Algorithms for CVaR Optimization in MDPs", "abstract": "In many sequential decision-making problems we may want to manage risk by minimizing some measure of variability in costs in addition to minimizing a standard criterion. Conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is a relatively new risk measure that addresses some of the shortcomings of the well-known variance-related risk measures, and because of its computational efficiencies has gained popularity in finance and operations research. In this paper, we consider the mean-CVaR optimization problem in MDPs. We first derive a formula for computing the gradient of this risk-sensitive objective function. We then devise policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms that each uses a specific method to estimate this gradient and updates the policy parameters in the descent direction. We establish the convergence of our algorithms to locally risk-sensitive optimal policies. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithms in an optimal stopping problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Jun 2014 19:56:16 GMT  (94kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3339v1", "Submitted to NIPS 14"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 18:05:38 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3339v2", "Submitted to NIPS 14"], ["v3", "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 21:59:26 GMT  (99kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3339v3", "Submitted to NIPS 14"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 14", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI math.OC", "authors": ["yinlam chow", "mohammad ghavamzadeh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3339"}
