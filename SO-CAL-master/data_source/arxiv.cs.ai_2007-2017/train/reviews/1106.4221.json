A cognitive and formal account", "abstract": "The study of opinions, their formation and change, is one of the defining topics addressed by social psychology, but in recent years other disciplines, as computer science and complexity, have addressed this challenge. Despite the flourishing of different models and theories in both fields, several key questions still remain unanswered. The aim of this paper is to challenge the current theories on opinion by putting forward a cognitively grounded model where opinions are described as specific mental representations whose main properties are put forward. A comparison with reputation will be also presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 15:00:33 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4221v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["francesca giardini", "walter quattrociocchi", "rosaria conte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.4221"}
