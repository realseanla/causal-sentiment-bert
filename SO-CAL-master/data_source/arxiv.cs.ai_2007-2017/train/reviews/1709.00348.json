We analyze a dataset of detailed device network activity obtained from 240 subscriber homes of a large European ISP and extract a number of traffic and spatial fingerprints for individual devices. We develop a two level taxonomy to describe devices onto which we map individual devices using a number of heuristics. We leverage the heuristically derived labels to train classifiers that distinguish device classes based on the traffic and spatial fingerprints of a device. Our results show an accuracy level up to 91% for the coarse level category and up to 84% for the fine grained category. By incorporating information from other sources (e.g., MAC OUI), we are able to further improve accuracy to above 97% and 92%, respectively. Finally, we also extract a set of simple and human-readable rules that concisely capture the behaviour of these distinct device categories.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 14:47:23 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00348v1", "14 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["kyumars sheykh esmaili", "jaideep chandrashekar", "pascal le guyadec"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00348"}
