An embedding is more informative than a bigraph matching, since it keeps track of the correspondence between the various components of the redex (guest) within the agent (host). In this paper, we present an algorithm for computing embeddings based on a reduction to a constraint satisfaction problem. This algorithm, that we prove to be sound and complete, has been successfully implemented in LibBig, a library for manipulating bigraphical reactive systems. This library can be used for implementing a wide range of tools, and it can be adapted to various extensions of bigraphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 08:52:16 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1042v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["marino miculan", "marco peressotti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.1042"}
