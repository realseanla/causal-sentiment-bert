We propose a novel method to learn a neural program operating a domain-specific non-differentiable machine, and demonstrate that this method can be applied to learn programs that are significantly more complex than the ones synthesized before: programming language parsers from input-output pairs without knowing the underlying grammar. The main challenge is to train the neural program without supervision on execution traces. To tackle it, we propose: (1) LL machines and neural programs operating them to effectively regularize the space of the learned programs; and (2) a two-phase reinforcement learning-based search technique to train the model. Our evaluation demonstrates that our approach can successfully learn to parse programs in both an imperative language and a functional language, and achieve 100% test accuracy, while existing approaches' accuracies are almost 0%. This is the first successful demonstration of applying reinforcement learning to train a neural program operating a non-differentiable machine that can fully generalize to test sets on a non-trivial task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 11:44:35 GMT  (1127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01284v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["xinyun chen", "chang liu", "dawn song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01284"}
