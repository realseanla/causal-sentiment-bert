In some cases the simple set of values used by these systems make it impossible to predict how a probability will change or which hypothesis is most likely given certain evidence. This paper concentrates on such situations, and suggests a number of ways in which they may be resolved by refining the representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:22:58 GMT  (454kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4975v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["simon parsons"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4975"}
