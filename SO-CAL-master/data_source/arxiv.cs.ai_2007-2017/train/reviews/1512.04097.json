The main issue with their introduction is that the evaluation of a program might not terminate and checking whether it terminates or not is undecidable. To cope with this problem, several classes of logic programs have been proposed where the use of function symbols is restricted but the program evaluation termination is guaranteed. Despite the significant body of work in this area, current approaches do not include many simple practical programs whose evaluation terminates. In this paper, we present the novel classes of rule-bounded and cycle-bounded programs, which overcome different limitations of current approaches by performing a more global analysis of how terms are propagated from the body to the head of rules. Results on the correctness, the complexity, and the expressivity of the proposed approach are provided.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 13 Dec 2015 18:36:54 GMT  (56kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04097v1", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming"], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 13:15:04 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04097v2", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco calautti", "sergio greco", "cristian molinaro", "irina trubitsyna"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04097"}
