The in-credible pace at which technology is advancing pushes the boundaries of what is achievable in cognitive engineering. There are also differing approaches to cognitive engineering brought about from the multi-disciplinary nature of the field and the vastness of possible applications. Thus research communities require more frequent reviews to keep up to date with the latest trends. In this paper we shall dis-cuss some of the approaches to cognitive engineering holistically to clarify the reasoning behind the different approaches and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. We shall then show how developments from seemingly disjointed views could be integrated to achieve the same goal of creating cognitive machines. By reviewing the major contributions in the different fields and showing the potential for a combined approach, this work intends to assist the research community in devising more unified methods and techniques for developing cognitive machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 11:58:29 GMT  (845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09882v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["jarryd son", "amit kumar mishra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09882"}
