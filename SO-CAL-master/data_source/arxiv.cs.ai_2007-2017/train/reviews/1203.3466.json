While such an extension is important from an application point of view, existing semantics are not well-motivated, and do not always yield intuitive results. To develop a more suitable semantics, we first introduce a characterization of answer sets of classical ASP programs in terms of possibilistic logic where an ASP program specifies a set of constraints on possibility distributions. This characterization is then naturally generalized to define answer sets of PASP programs. We furthermore provide a syntactic counterpart, leading to a possibilistic generalization of the well-known Gelfond-Lifschitz reduct, and we show how our framework can readily be implemented using standard ASP solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (252kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3466v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kim bauters", "steven schockaert", "martine de cock", "dirk vermeir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3466"}
