Firstly, we present the model. This is a way to measure the relevance between events and roles in collaborative environments. With this method, we can share the most appropriate event information for each role instead of sharing all information to all roles in a collaborative work environment. Then, we apply and verify this method in our project with Google App supported e-learning collaborative environment. During this experiment, we compared DSC method measured relevance of events and roles to manual measured relevance. And we describe the favorable points from this comparison and our finding. Finally, we discuss our future research of a hybrid DSC method to make dynamical information shared more effective in a collaborative work environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jan 2012 19:14:30 GMT  (266kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3883v1", "9 pages; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7, Issue 5, September 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7, Issue 5, September 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["jing peng", "alain-j\\'er\\^ome foug\\`eres", "samuel deniaud", "michel ferney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3883"}
