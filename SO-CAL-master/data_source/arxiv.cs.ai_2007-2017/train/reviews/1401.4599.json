ARPlace represents robot base locations not as a single position, but rather as a collection of positions, each with an associated probability that the manipulation action will succeed when located there. ARPlaces are generated using a predictive model that is acquired through experience-based learning, and take into account the uncertainty the robot has about its own location and the location of the object to be manipulated.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Jan 2014 21:08:22 GMT  (4047kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4599v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["freek stulp", "reas fedrizzi", "lorenz m\\\"osenlechner", "michael beetz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.4599"}
