However, most multimedia ontologies are not exhaustive in terms of role definitions, and do not incorporate complex role inclusions and role interdependencies. In fact, most multimedia ontologies do not have a role box at all, and implement only a basic subset of the available logical constructors. Consequently, their application in multimedia reasoning is limited. To address the above issues, VidOnt, the very first multimedia ontology with SROIQ(D) expressivity and a DL-safe ruleset has been introduced for next-generation multimedia reasoning. In contrast to the common practice, the formal grounding has been set in one of the most expressive description logics, and the ontology validated with industry-leading reasoners, namely HermiT and FaCT++. This paper also presents best practices for developing multimedia ontologies, based on my ontology engineering approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Aug 2016 05:53:07 GMT  (342kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08072v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["leslie f sikos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08072"}
