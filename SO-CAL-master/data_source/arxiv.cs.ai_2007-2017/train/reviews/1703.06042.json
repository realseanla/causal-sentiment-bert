This paper promotes the usage of performance profiles as a standard practice to visualize and analyze experimental results. It introduces a Web tool to construct and export performance profiles as SVG or HTML files. In addition, the application relies on a methodology to estimate the benefit of hypothetical solver improvements. Therefore, the tool allows one to employ what-if analysis to screen possible research directions, and identify those having the best potential. The approach is showcased on two Operation Research technologies: Constraint Programming and Mixed Integer Linear Programming.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 12:53:52 GMT  (673kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06042v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PF", "authors": ["sascha van cauwelaert", "michele lombardi", "pierre schaus"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06042"}
