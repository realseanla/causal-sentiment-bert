This method has several essential properties: The degree of sparsity is continuous -- a parameter controls the rate of sparsification from no sparsification to total sparsification. The approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular $L_1$-regularization method in the batch setting. We prove that small rates of sparsification result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online learning guarantees. The approach works well empirically. We apply the approach to several datasets and find that for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Jun 2008 14:19:50 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4686v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Jul 2008 01:58:32 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.4686v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["john langford", "lihong li", "tong zhang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "0806.4686"}
