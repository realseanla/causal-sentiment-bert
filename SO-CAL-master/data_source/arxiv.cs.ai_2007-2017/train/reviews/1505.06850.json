Feedback and learning from experience are key aspects of the creative process. Here we investigate how we could implement feedback in creative systems using a social model. From the field of creative writing we borrow the concept of a Writers Workshop as a model for learning through feedback. The Writers Workshop encourages examination, discussion and debates of a piece of creative work using a prescribed format of activities. We propose a computational model of the Writers Workshop as a roadmap for incorporation of feedback in artificial creativity systems. We argue that the Writers Workshop setting describes the anatomy of the creative process. We support our claim with a case study that describes how to implement the Writers Workshop model in a computational creativity system. We present this work using patterns other people can follow to implement similar designs in their own systems. We conclude by discussing the broader relevance of this model to other aspects of AI.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 May 2015 08:38:57 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06850v1", "8 pp., submitted to IJCAI 2015 Workshop 42, \"AI and Feedback\""]], "COMMENTS": "8 pp., submitted to IJCAI 2015 Workshop 42, \"AI and Feedback\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph corneli", "anna jordanous"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06850"}
