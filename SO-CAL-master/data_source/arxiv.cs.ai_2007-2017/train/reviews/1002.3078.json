User-understandable models are defined during the modeling phase but rewriting or tuning them is manda- tory to get solving-efficient models. We propose a new architecture al- lowing to define bridges between any (modeling or solver) languages and to implement model optimizations. This architecture follows a model- driven approach where the constraint modeling process is seen as a set of model transformations. Among others, an interesting feature is the def- inition of transformations as concept-oriented rules, i.e. based on types of model elements where the types are organized into a hierarchy called a metamodel.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2010 13:09:07 GMT  (807kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3078v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["raphael chenouard", "laurent granvilliers", "ricardo soto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.3078"}
