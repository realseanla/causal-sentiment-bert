It examined trust for international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic. Based on an observation in the literature, we found no literature discussing the calculus method for the international relations. To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be identified as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 10:13:26 GMT  (1008kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02239v1", "keywords: Relation Algebra, International Relations, Defense, Relation Calculus, Foreign Policy, Politics Economy, Dempster-Shafer, Subjective Logic, Common Criteria. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1604.00980"]], "COMMENTS": "keywords: Relation Algebra, International Relations, Defense, Relation Calculus, Foreign Policy, Politics Economy, Dempster-Shafer, Subjective Logic, Common Criteria. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1604.00980", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI", "authors": ["mohd anuar mat isa", "ramlan mahmod", "nur izura udzir", "jamalul-lail ab manan", "audun j{\\o}sang", "ali dehghan tanha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02239"}
