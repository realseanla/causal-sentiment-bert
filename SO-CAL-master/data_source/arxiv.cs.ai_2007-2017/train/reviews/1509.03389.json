{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Sep-2015", "title": "Multi-Attribute Proportional Representation", "abstract": "We consider the following problem in which a given number of items has to be chosen from a predefined set. Each item is described by a vector of attributes and for each attribute there is a desired distribution that the selected set should have. We look for a set that fits as much as possible the desired distributions on all attributes. Examples of applications include choosing members of a representative committee, where candidates are described by attributes such as sex, age and profession, and where we look for a committee that for each attribute offers a certain representation, i.e., a single committee that contains a certain number of young and old people, certain number of men and women, certain number of people with different professions, etc. With a single attribute the problem collapses to the apportionment problem for party-list proportional representation systems (in such case the value of the single attribute would be a political affiliation of a candidate). We study the properties of the associated subset selection rules, as well as their computation complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 05:01:17 GMT  (188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03389v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS cs.GT", "authors": ["j\u00e9r\u00f4me lang", "piotr krzysztof skowron"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.03389"}
