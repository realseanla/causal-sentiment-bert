{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-May-2011", "title": "Parameterized Complexity of Problems in Coalitional Resource Games", "abstract": "Coalition formation is a key topic in multi-agent systems. Coalitions enable agents to achieve goals that they may not have been able to achieve on their own. Previous work has shown problems in coalitional games to be computationally hard. Wooldridge and Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 2006) studied the classical computational complexity of several natural decision problems in Coalitional Resource Games (CRG) - games in which each agent is endowed with a set of resources and coalitions can bring about a set of goals if they are collectively endowed with the necessary amount of resources. The input of coalitional resource games bundles together several elements, e.g., the agent set Ag, the goal set G, the resource set R, etc. Shrot, Aumann and Kraus (AAMAS 2009) examine coalition formation problems in the CRG model using the theory of Parameterized Complexity. Their refined analysis shows that not all parts of input act equal - some instances of the problem are indeed tractable while others still remain intractable.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 May 2011 23:03:52 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0707v1", "This is the full version of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "This is the full version of a paper that will appear in the proceedings of AAAI 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.GT", "authors": ["rajesh hemant chitnis", "mohammadtaghi hajiaghayi", "vahid liaghat"], "accepted": true, "id": "1105.0707"}
