Parallel dictionaries constructed by humans are a widely-available resource, but they are limited and do not provide enough coverage for good quality translation purposes, due to out-of-vocabulary words and neologisms. This motivates the use of statistical translation systems, which are unfortunately dependent on the quantity and quality of training data. Such has a very limited availability especially for some languages and very narrow text domains. Is this research we present our improvements to Yalign mining methodology by reimplementing the comparison algorithm, introducing a tuning scripts and by improving performance using GPU computing acceleration. The experiments are conducted on various text domains and bi-data is extracted from the Wikipedia dumps.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 08:44:14 GMT  (768kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08639v1", "Machine translation, comparable corpora, Machine learning, NLP, Knowledge-free learning, Unsupervised bi-lingual data mining"]], "COMMENTS": "Machine translation, comparable corpora, Machine learning, NLP, Knowledge-free learning, Unsupervised bi-lingual data mining", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["krzysztof wo{\\l}k", "krzysztof marasek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08639"}
