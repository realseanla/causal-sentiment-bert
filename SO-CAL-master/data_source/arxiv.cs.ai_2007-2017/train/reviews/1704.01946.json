The calculation of an indicator values has challenges as the calculation may need to combine some aspects of quality while addressing different levels of abstraction. Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been used successfully to support flexible representation, which can support improved understanding and data analysis in similar settings. This paper presents an operational description for a city KG, an indicator ontology that support indicator discovery and data visualization and an application capable of performing metadata analysis to automatically build and display dashboards according to discovered indicators. We describe our implementation in an urban mobility setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 17:29:16 GMT  (824kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01946v1", "Accepted at the 14th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at the 14th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["henrique santos", "victor dantas", "vasco furtado", "paulo pinheiro", "deborah l mcguinness"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01946"}
