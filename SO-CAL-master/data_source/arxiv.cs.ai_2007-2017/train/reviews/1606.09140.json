{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Jun-2016", "title": "Algebraic foundations for qualitative calculi and networks", "abstract": "A qualitative representation $\\phi$ is like an ordinary representation of a relation algebra, but instead of requiring $(a; b)^\\phi = a^\\phi | b^\\phi$, as we do for ordinary representations, we only require that $c^\\phi\\supseteq a^\\phi | b^\\phi \\iff c\\geq a ; b$, for each $c$ in the algebra. A constraint network is qualitatively satisfiable if its nodes can be mapped to elements of a qualitative representation, preserving the constraints. If a constraint network is satisfiable then it is clearly qualitatively satisfiable, but the converse can fail. However, for a wide range of relation algebras including the point algebra, the Allen Interval Algebra, RCC8 and many others, a network is satisfiable if and only if it is qualitatively satisfiable.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 15:00:48 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09140v1", "22 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 11:44:51 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09140v2", "22 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 16:33:39 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09140v3", "22 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["robin hirsch", "marcel jackson", "tomasz kowalski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09140"}
