In this paper, we provide a principled approach to handling selection biases, adapting models and estimation techniques from causal inference. The approach leads to unbiased performance estimators despite biased data, and to a matrix factorization method that provides substantially improved prediction performance on real-world data. We theoretically and empirically characterize the robustness of the approach, finding that it is highly practical and scalable.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 09:58:25 GMT  (1111kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05352v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 May 2016 03:18:59 GMT  (1178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05352v2", "10 pages in ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["tobias schnabel", "adith swaminathan", "ashudeep singh", "navin chandak", "thorsten joachims"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.05352"}
