RTEC is an Event Calculus dialect with novel implementation and 'windowing' techniques that allow for efficient event recognition, scalable to large data streams. RTEC can deal with applications where event data arrive with a (variable) delay from, and are revised by, the underlying sources. RTEC can update already recognised events and recognise new events when data arrive with a delay or following data revision. Our evaluation shows that RTEC can support real-time event recognition and is capable of meeting the performance requirements identified in a recent survey of event processing use cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 13:26:36 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05364v1", "International Workshop on Reactive Concepts in Knowledge Representation (ReactKnow 2014), co-located with the 21st European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014).
