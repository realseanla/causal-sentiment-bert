Despite much encouraging empirical evidence that shows benefits of transfer, there has been very little theoretical analysis. In this paper, we study a class of lifelong reinforcement-learning problems: the agent solves a sequence of tasks modeled as finite Markov decision processes (MDPs), each of which is from a finite set of MDPs with the same state/action spaces and different transition/reward functions. Inspired by the need for cross-task exploration in lifelong learning, we formulate a novel online discovery problem and give an optimal learning algorithm to solve it. Such results allow us to develop a new lifelong reinforcement-learning algorithm, whose overall sample complexity in a sequence of tasks is much smaller than that of single-task learning, with high probability, even if the sequence of tasks is generated by an adversary. Benefits of the algorithm are demonstrated in a simulated problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 16:23:29 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03379v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 22:55:59 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03379v2", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["emma brunskill", "lihong li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03379"}
