This article does not describe a new semantics for integration but the problem of obtaining the reliability of the sources given the result of a previous merging. As an example, the relative reliability of two sensors can be assessed given some certain observation, and allows for subsequent mergings of data coming from them.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Sep 2014 15:31:03 GMT  (56kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5340v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paolo liberatore"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5340"}
