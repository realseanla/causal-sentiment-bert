Based on the established -neuroscientifically sound- concepts of brainwave frequency bands, activation asymmetry index and cross-frequency-coupling (CFC), we introduce a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system that automatically assigns a rating score to the listened song. Our research operated in two distinct stages: i) a generic feature engineering stage, in which features from signal-analytics were ranked and selected based on their ability to associate music induced perturbations in brainwaves with listener's appraisal of music. ii) a personalization stage, during which the efficiency of ex- treme learning machines (ELMs) is exploited so as to translate the derived pat- terns into a listener's score. Encouraging experimental results, from a pragmatic use of the system, are presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 22:29:02 GMT  (547kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06374v1", "12th IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference and Workshops, AIAI 2016, Thessaloniki, Greece, September 16-18, 2016, Proceedings"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 11:06:37 GMT  (468kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06374v2", "12th IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference and Workshops, AIAI 2016, Thessaloniki, Greece, September 16-18, 2016, Proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "12th IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference and Workshops, AIAI 2016, Thessaloniki, Greece, September 16-18, 2016, Proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.HC cs.MM cs.NE", "authors": ["fotis kalaganis", "dimitrios a adamos", "nikos laskaris aiia lab", "department of informatics", "aristotle university of thessaloniki", "school of music studies", "aristotle university of thessaloniki", "neuroinformatics group", "aristotle university of thessaloniki)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06374"}
