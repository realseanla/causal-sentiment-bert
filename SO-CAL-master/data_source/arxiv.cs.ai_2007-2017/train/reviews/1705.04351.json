This perspective offers a way to unify previous theories of curiosity into a single framework. Experimental results confirm our model's predictions, showing how the relationship between curiosity and confidence can change significantly depending on the nature of the environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 May 2017 18:54:10 GMT  (570kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04351v1", "Conference paper in CogSci 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference paper in CogSci 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rachit dubey", "thomas l griffiths"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04351"}
