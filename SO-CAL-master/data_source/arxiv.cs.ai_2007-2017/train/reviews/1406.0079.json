In the legal domain we face a similar problem. Formal representation languages, such as OASIS LegalRuleML and legal ontologies (LKIF, legal OWL2 ontologies etc.) support the technical knowledge engineer and the automated reasoning. But, they can be hardly used directly by the legal domain experts who do not have a computer science background. In this paper we adapt the SBVR Structured English approach for the legal domain and implement a proof-of-concept, called KR4IPLaw, which enables legal domain experts to represent their knowledge in Structured English in a computational independent and hence, for them, more usable way. The benefit of this approach is that the underlying pre-defined semantics of the Structured English approach makes transformations into formal languages such as OASIS LegalRuleML and OWL2 ontologies possible. We exemplify our approach in the domain of patent law.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 31 May 2014 14:16:30 GMT  (868kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.0079v1", "published in proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Value Modeling and Business Ontology, VMBO, Berlin, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "published in proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Value Modeling and Business Ontology, VMBO, Berlin, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["shashishekar ramakrishna", "adrian paschke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.0079"}
