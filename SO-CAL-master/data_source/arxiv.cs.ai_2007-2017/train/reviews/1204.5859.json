The complexity of finding/verifying optimal solutions is already known. In this paper we consider the computational complexity of finding second-best solutions. We consider different orderings, and consider also different possible definitions of what a second-best solution is.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 08:18:38 GMT  (12kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5859v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 24 Apr 2014 17:15:55 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5859v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 14 May 2015 13:11:02 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5859v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["paolo liberatore", "marco schaerf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.5859"}
