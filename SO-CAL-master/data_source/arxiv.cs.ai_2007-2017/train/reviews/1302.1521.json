An efficient and incremental implementation is outlined which depends on cost functions satisfying certain criteria. Possibilistic logic and probability theory (as it is used in the applications targetted) satisfy these criteria.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:53:45 GMT  (1137kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1521v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["john bigham"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1521"}
