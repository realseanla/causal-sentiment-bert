The backbone of our system consists of several deep convolutional neural networks that are not only computationally inexpensive, but also provide state-of-the-art results on several competitive benchmarks. To power our novel deep networks, we collected large labeled datasets through a semi-supervised pipeline to reduce the annotation effort/time. We tested our system on several public benchmarks and report outstanding results. Our age, gender and emotion recognition models are available to developers through the Sighthound Cloud API at", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 16:34:05 GMT  (9242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04280v1", "10 Pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 4 Mar 2017 01:43:04 GMT  (9242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04280v2", "10 Pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 Pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["afshin dehghan", "enrique g ortiz", "guang shu", "syed zain masood"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04280"}
