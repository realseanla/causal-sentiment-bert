This paper presents a decentralized data fusion and active sensing (D2FAS) algorithm for mobile sensors to actively explore the road network to gather and assimilate the most informative data for predicting the traffic phenomenon. We analyze the time and communication complexity of D2FAS and demonstrate that it can scale well with a large number of observations and sensors. We provide a theoretical guarantee on its predictive performance to be equivalent to that of a sophisticated centralized sparse approximation for the Gaussian process (GP) model: The computation of such a sparse approximate GP model can thus be parallelized and distributed among the mobile sensors (in a Google-like MapReduce paradigm), thereby achieving efficient and scalable prediction. We also theoretically guarantee its active sensing performance that improves under various practical environmental conditions. Empirical evaluation on real-world urban road network data shows that our D2FAS algorithm is significantly more time-efficient and scalable than state-of-the-art centralized algorithms while achieving comparable predictive performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 11:11:55 GMT  (184kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6230v1", "28th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2012), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Jun 2012 04:21:18 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6230v2", "28th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2012), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "28th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2012), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC cs.MA cs.RO", "authors": ["jie chen", "kian hsiang low", "colin keng-yan tan", "ali oran", "patrick jaillet", "john m dolan", "gaurav s sukhatme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6230"}
