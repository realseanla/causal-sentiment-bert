We propose to learn high level functional programs in order to represent abstract models which capture the invariant structure in the observed data. We introduce the $\\pi$-machine (program-induction machine) -- an architecture able to induce interpretable LISP-like programs from observed data traces. We propose an optimisation procedure for program learning based on backpropagation, gradient descent and A* search. We apply the proposed method to three problems: system identification of dynamical systems, explaining the behaviour of a DQN agent and learning by demonstration in a human-robot interaction scenario. Our experimental results show that the $\\pi$-machine can efficiently induce interpretable programs from individual data traces.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 14:38:28 GMT  (876kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08320v1", "submitted to Neural Information Processing Systems 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to Neural Information Processing Systems 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["svetlin penkov", "subramanian ramamoorthy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08320"}
