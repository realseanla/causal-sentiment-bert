However, this criterion may not always be suitable, we consider an alternative criterion based on the notion of quantiles. In the case of episodic reinforcement learning problems, we propose an algorithm based on stochastic approximation with two timescales. We evaluate our proposition on a simple model of the TV show, Who wants to be a millionaire.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 02:28:53 GMT  (252kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00862v1", "AWRL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "AWRL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["hugo gilbert", "paul weng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00862"}
