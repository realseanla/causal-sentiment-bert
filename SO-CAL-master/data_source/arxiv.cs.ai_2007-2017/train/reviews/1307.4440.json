Researchers have been investing significant efforts to develop heuristics or restrictions to make planning practically feasible. Case-based planning is a heuristic approach where one tries to reuse previous experience when solving similar problems in order to avoid some of the planning effort. Plan reuse may offer an interesting alternative to plan generation in some settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jul 2013 22:35:15 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4440v1", "Proceedings of AAAI 2013, pp. 224-231, AAAI Press, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of AAAI 2013, pp. 224-231, AAAI Press, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["ronald de haan", "anna roub\u00edckov\u00e1", "stefan szeider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.4440"}
