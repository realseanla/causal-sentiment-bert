While approaches with separate classifiers for different error types have high precision, they do not flexibly handle errors such as redundancy or non-idiomatic phrasing. On the other hand, word and phrase-based machine translation methods are not designed to cope with orthographic errors, and have recently been outpaced by neural models. Motivated by these issues, we present a neural network-based approach to language correction. The core component of our method is an encoder-decoder recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism. By operating at the character level, the network avoids the problem of out-of-vocabulary words. We illustrate the flexibility of our approach on dataset of noisy, user-generated text collected from an English learner forum. When combined with a language model, our method achieves a state-of-the-art $F_{0.5}$-score on the CoNLL 2014 Shared Task. We further demonstrate that training the network on additional data with synthesized errors can improve performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 19:16:54 GMT  (191kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09727v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["ziang xie", "anand avati", "naveen arivazhagan", "dan jurafsky", "rew y ng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09727"}
