There will be two basic ideas for independence. The first is irrelevance. Two variables are independent when a change on the knowledge about one variable does not affect the other. The second one is factorization. Two variables are independent when the joint convex set of probabilities can be decomposed on the product of marginal convex sets. In the case of the Theory of Probability, these two starting points give rise to the same definition. In the case of convex sets of probabilities, the resulting concepts will be strongly related, but they will not be equivalent. As application of the concept of independence, we shall consider the problem of building a global convex set from marginal convex sets of probabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:52 GMT  (304kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4940v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["luis m de campos", "serafin moral"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4940"}
