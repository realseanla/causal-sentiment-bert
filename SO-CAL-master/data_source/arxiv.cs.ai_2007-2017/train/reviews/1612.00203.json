In particular, the analysis focuses on the attitude of the different Internet users in easily solving four different types of image-based CAPTCHAs which include facial expressions like: animated character, old woman, surprised face, worried face. To pursue this goal, an experiment is realized involving 100 Internet users in solving the four types of CAPTCHAs, differentiated by age, Internet experience, and education level. The response times are collected for each user. Then, association rules are extracted from user data, for evaluating the dependence of the response time in solving the CAPTCHA from age, education level and experience in internet usage by statistical analysis. The results implicitly capture the users' psychological states showing in what states the users are more sensible. It reveals to be a novelty and a meaningful analysis in the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 11:24:09 GMT  (345kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00203v1", "13 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables, 5th International Workshop on Symbiotic Interaction (Symbiotic), Padua, Italy, 29-30 September 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 12:52:21 GMT  (345kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00203v2", "13 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables, 5th International Workshop on Symbiotic Interaction (Symbiotic), Padua, Italy, 29-30 September 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables, 5th International Workshop on Symbiotic Interaction (Symbiotic), Padua, Italy, 29-30 September 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["darko brodi\\'c", "alessia amelio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00203"}
