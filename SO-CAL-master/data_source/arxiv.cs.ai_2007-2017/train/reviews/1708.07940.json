However, web 2.0 sites such as social networks, e-commerce portals etc. are making the understanding of the content structure in a web site increasingly difficult. Dynamic and personalized elements such as top stories, recommended list in a webpage are vital to the understanding of the dynamic nature of web 2.0 sites. To better understand the content structure in web 2.0 sites, in this paper we propose a new extraction method for navigation objects in a webpage. Our method will extract not only the static navigation menus, but also the dynamic and personalized page-specific navigation lists. Since the navigation objects in a webpage naturally come in blocks, we first cluster hyperlinks into different blocks by exploiting spatial locations of hyperlinks, the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree and the hyperlink density. Then we identify navigation objects from those blocks using the SVM classifier with novel features such as anchor text lengths etc. Experiments on real-world data sets with webpages from various domains and styles verified the effectiveness of our method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Aug 2017 06:59:24 GMT  (943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07940v1", "2017 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI)"]], "COMMENTS": "2017 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence (WI)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["kui zhao", "bangpeng li", "zilun peng", "jiajun bu", "can wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07940"}
