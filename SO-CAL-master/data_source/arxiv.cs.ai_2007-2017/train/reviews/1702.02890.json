In this paper, we apply this idea to the field of answer set programming (ASP). To this end, we propose two kinds of graph representations of programs to exploit their treewidth as a parameter. Treewidth roughly measures to which extent the internal structure of a program resembles a tree. Our main contribution is the design of parameterized dynamic programming algorithms, which run in linear time if the treewidth and weights of the given program are bounded. Compared to previous work, our algorithms handle the full syntax of ASP. Finally, we report on an empirical evaluation that shows good runtime behaviour for benchmark instances of low treewidth, especially for counting answer sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 16:50:23 GMT  (564kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02890v1", "This paper extends and updates a paper that has been presented on the workshop TAASP'16 (arXiv:1612.07601).
