It is an instance of a more general method for learning max-weight matching predictors in bipartite graphs, which has applications beyond ranking. The method consists of performing maximum a posteriori estimation in exponential families with suitable sufficient statistics. We apply the method to a standard benchmark dataset for learning web page ranking, obtaining state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Apr 2009 03:48:02 GMT  (51kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2623v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 5 Jun 2009 03:54:58 GMT  (459kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2623v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["james petterson", "tib\u00e9rio s caetano", "julian john mcauley", "jin yu"], "accepted": true, "id": "0904.2623"}
