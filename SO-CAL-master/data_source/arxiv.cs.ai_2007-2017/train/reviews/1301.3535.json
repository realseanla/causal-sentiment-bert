Efficient and robust tools to handle airport operations are needed along with a better understanding of passengers' interests and concerns. Among various airport operations, this paper studies airport gate scheduling for improved passengers' experience. Three objectives accounting for passengers, aircraft, and operation are presented. Trade-offs between these objectives are analyzed, and a balancing objective function is proposed. The results show that the balanced objective can improve the efficiency of traffic flow in passenger terminals and on ramps, as well as the robustness of gate operations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 00:28:26 GMT  (410kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3535v1", "This paper is submitted to the tenth USA/Europe ATM 2013 seminar"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper is submitted to the tenth USA/Europe ATM 2013 seminar", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["sang hyun kim", "eric feron", "john-paul clarke", "aude marzuoli", "daniel delahaye"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3535"}
