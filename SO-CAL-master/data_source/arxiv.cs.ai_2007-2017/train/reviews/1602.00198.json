A learning machine is a system that realizes mechanical learning. Importantly, we emphasis that it is based on a set of simple and fixed rules, contrasting to often called machine learning that is sophisticated software based on very complicated mathematical theory, and often needs human intervene for software fine tune and manual adjustments. Here, we discuss some basic facts and principles of such system, and try to lay down a framework for further study. We propose 2 directions to approach mechanical learning, just like Church-Turing pair: one is trying to realize a learning machine, another is trying to well describe the mechanical learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 Jan 2016 04:05:50 GMT  (191kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00198v1", "11 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["chuyu xiong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00198"}
