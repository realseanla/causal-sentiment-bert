This paper introduces a novel algorithm, which combines an effective constraint-based tabu search procedure and two dedicated graph reduction techniques. We verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on 30 classical random benchmark graphs and 25 very large real-life sparse graphs from the popular Koblenz Network Collection (KONECT). The results show that the algorithm improves the best-known results (new lower bounds) for 10 classical benchmarks and obtains the optimal solutions for 14 KONECT instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 May 2017 17:47:31 GMT  (109kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07339v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yi zhou", "jin-kao hao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07339"}
