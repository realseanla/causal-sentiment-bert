The remote module has a GPS mounted on the moving vehicle to identify its current position, and to be transferred by GSM with other parameters acquired by the automobile's data port as an SMS to a recipient station. The received GPS coordinates are filtered using a Kalman filter to enhance the accuracy of measured position. After data processing, Google Earth application is used to view the current location and status of each vehicle. This goal of this system is to manage fleet, police automobiles distribution and car theft cautions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 17:54:00 GMT  (1969kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2630v1", "11 pages, 11 figures, 23 references"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 11 figures, 23 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["mohammad a al-khedher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2630"}
