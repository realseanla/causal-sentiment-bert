There are also a number of different techniques for converting SAT problems into CSPs. In this paper, we leverage advances in both areas and present a novel hierarchical portfolio-based approach to CSP solving that does not rely purely on CSP solvers, but may convert a problem to SAT choosing a conversion technique and the accommodating SAT solver. Our experimental evaluation relies on competition CSP instances and uses eight CSP solvers, three SAT encodings and eighteen SAT solvers. We demonstrate that significant performance improvements can be obtained by considering alternative view-points of a combinatorial problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 13:11:54 GMT  (188kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5606v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 12:26:45 GMT  (123kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5606v2", "11th International Conference on Integration of AI and OR Techniques in Constraint Programming for Combinatorial Optimization Problems.
