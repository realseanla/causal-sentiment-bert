While other distributed multi-agent collision avoidance systems exist, these systems require online geometric optimization where tedious parameter tuning and perfect sensing are necessary.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 07:05:56 GMT  (2126kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06838v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Jul 2017 07:41:45 GMT  (2244kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06838v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV cs.RO", "authors": ["pinxin long", "wenxi liu", "jia pan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06838"}
