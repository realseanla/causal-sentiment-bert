Recent work has achieved efficient and accurate inference on such problems using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques with customized proposal distributions. Currently, implementing such a system requires coding MCMC state representations and acceptance probability calculations that are specific to a particular application. An alternative approach, which we pursue in this paper, is to use a general-purpose probabilistic modeling language (such as BLOG) and a generic Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm that supports user-supplied proposal distributions. Our algorithm gains flexibility by using MCMC states that are only partial descriptions of possible worlds; we provide conditions under which MCMC over partial worlds yields correct answers to queries. We also show how to use a context-specific Bayes net to identify the factors in the acceptance probability that need to be computed for a given proposed move. Experimental results on a citation matching task show that our general-purpose MCMC engine compares favorably with an application-specific system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:24:15 GMT  (135kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6849v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["brian milch", "stuart russell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6849"}
