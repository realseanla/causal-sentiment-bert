The approach learns a function approximator online to estimate the regret for choosing a particular action. A no-regret algorithm uses these estimates in place of the true regrets to define a sequence of policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 18:45:50 GMT  (292kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7974v1", "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 31 Dec 2014 23:45:22 GMT  (113kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7974v2", "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["kevin waugh", "dustin morrill", "james andrew bagnell", "michael h bowling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.7974"}
