{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-May-2017", "title": "Asynchronous Announcements", "abstract": "We propose a logic of asynchronous announcements, where truthful announcements are publicly sent but individually received by agents. Additional to epistemic modalities, the logic therefore contains two types of dynamic modalities, for sending messages and for receiving messages. The semantics defines truth relative to the current state of reception of messages for all agents. This means that knowledge need not be truthful, because some messages may not have been received by the knowing agent. Messages that are announcements may also result in partial synchronization, namely when an agent learns from receiving an announcement that other announcements must already have been received by other agents. We give detailed examples of the semantics, and prove several semantic results, including that: after an announcement an agent knows that a proposition is true, if and only if on condition of the truth of that announcement, the agent knows that after that announcement and after any number of other agents also receiving it, the proposition is true. We show that on multi-agent epistemic models, each formula in asynchronous announcement logic is equivalent to a formula in epistemic logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 15:30:47 GMT  (19kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03392v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 13 May 2017 14:23:20 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03392v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC cs.LO", "authors": ["hans van ditmarsch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03392"}
