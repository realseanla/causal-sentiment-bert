Experimental evaluation against a benchmark set of human similarity judgments demonstrates that the measure performs better than the traditional edge-counting approach. The article presents algorithms that take advantage of taxonomic similarity in resolving syntactic and semantic ambiguity, along with experimental results demonstrating their effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:46:05 GMT  (108kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5444v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["p resnik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5444"}
