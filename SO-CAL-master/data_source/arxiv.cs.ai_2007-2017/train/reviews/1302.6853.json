As a demonstration of the usefulness of this preliminary investigation, an alternate proof is presented for refuting the conjecture suggested by Pearl and Paz that probabilistic conditional independencies have a complete axiomatization.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:20:35 GMT  (758kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6853v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael s k m wong", "z w wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6853"}
