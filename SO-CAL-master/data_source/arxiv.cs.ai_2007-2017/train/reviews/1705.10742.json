{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-May-2017", "title": "Generating Steganographic Text with LSTMs", "abstract": "Motivated by concerns for user privacy, we design a steganographic system (\"stegosystem\") that enables two users to exchange encrypted messages without an adversary detecting that such an exchange is taking place. We propose a new linguistic stegosystem based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. We demonstrate our approach on the Twitter and Enron email datasets and show that it yields high-quality steganographic text while significantly improving capacity (encrypted bits per word) relative to the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 16:52:48 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10742v1", "ACL 2017 Student Research Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017 Student Research Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.MM", "authors": ["tina fang", "martin jaggi", "katerina argyraki"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.10742"}
