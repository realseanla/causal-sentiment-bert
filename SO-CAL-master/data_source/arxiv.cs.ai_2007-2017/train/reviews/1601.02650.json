Our formalization is based on Notation 3 Logic, which extended RDF by logical symbols and created Semantic Web logic for deductive RDF graph stores. We also propose OWL-P that is a lightweight formalism of OWL and supports soft inferences by omitting complex language constructs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 21:18:59 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02650v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["dominik tomaszuk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02650"}
