We study the problem of almost-sure reachability, where given a set of target states, the question is to decide whether there is a policy to ensure that the target set is reached with probability 1 (almost-surely). While in general the problem is EXPTIME-complete, in many practical cases policies with a small amount of memory suffice. Moreover, the existing solution to the problem is explicit, which first requires to construct explicitly an exponential reduction to a belief-support MDP. In this work, we first study the existence of observation-stationary strategies, which is NP-complete, and then small-memory strategies. We present a symbolic algorithm by an efficient encoding to SAT and using a SAT solver for the problem. We report experimental results demonstrating the scalability of our symbolic (SAT-based) approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 17:33:05 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08456v1", "Full version of \"A Symbolic SAT-based Algorithm for Almost-sure Reachability with Small Strategies in POMDPs\" AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of \"A Symbolic SAT-based Algorithm for Almost-sure Reachability with Small Strategies in POMDPs\" AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["krishnendu chatterjee", "martin chmelik", "jessica davies"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.08456"}
