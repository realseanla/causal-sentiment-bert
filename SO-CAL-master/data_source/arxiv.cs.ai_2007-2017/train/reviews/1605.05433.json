We focus experiments on one previous classifier which was shown to only learn to detect prototypicality of a word pair. Analysis shows that the model single-mindedly learns to detect Hearst Patterns, which are well known to be predictive of lexical relations. We present a new model which exploits this Hearst Detector functionality, matching or outperforming prior work on multiple data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 May 2016 04:10:41 GMT  (70kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05433v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Sep 2016 20:31:51 GMT  (72kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05433v2", "EMNLP 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["stephen roller", "katrin erk"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.05433"}
