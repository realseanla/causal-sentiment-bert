We seek a formal definition satisfying a list of desiderata. Our proposed definition of happiness is the temporal difference error, i.e. the difference between the value of the obtained reward and observation and the agent's expectation of this value. This definition satisfies most of our desiderata and is compatible with empirical research on humans. We state several implications and discuss examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 May 2015 03:14:39 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04497v1", "AGI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "AGI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mayank daswani", "jan leike"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04497"}
