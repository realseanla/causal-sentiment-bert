The model is based on representation of objects via their properties and methods. It gives us a possibility to classify the objects and, in a sense, to build hierarchy of their types. Furthermore, it enables to represent relation of modification between concepts, to build new classes of objects based on existing classes and to create sets and multisets of concepts. OODN can be represented as a connected and directed graph, where nodes are concepts and edges are relations between them. Using such model of knowledge representation, we can consider modifications of knowledge and movement through the graph of network as a process of logical reasoning or finding the right solutions or creativity, etc. The proposed approach gives us an opportunity to model some aspects of human knowledge system and main mechanisms of human thought, in particular getting a new experience and knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 16:39:30 GMT  (664kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04194v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1510.04183"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1510.04183", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dmytro terletskyi", "alexandr provotar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04194"}
