Reasoning in BKBs requires finding the most probable inferences consistent with the evidence. The cost-sharing heuristic for finding least-cost explanations in WAODAGs was presented and shown to be effective by Charniak and Husain. However, the cycles in BKBs would make the definition of cost-sharing cyclic as well, if applied directly to BKBs. By treating the defining equations of cost-sharing as a system of equations, one can properly define an admissible cost-sharing heuristic for BKBs. Empirical evaluation shows that cost-sharing improves performance significantly when applied to BKBs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:57 GMT  (916kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1567v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["solomon eyal shimony", "carmel domshlak", "eugene santos jr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1567"}
