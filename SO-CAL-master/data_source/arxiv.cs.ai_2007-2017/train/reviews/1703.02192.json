Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has been shown to provide a very natural and expressive framework for epistemic planning. In this paper, we aim to give an accessible introduction to DEL-based epistemic planning. The paper starts with the most classical framework for planning, STRIPS, and then moves towards epistemic planning in a number of smaller steps, where each step is motivated by the need to be able to model more complex planning scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 03:15:08 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02192v1", "In Proceedings M4M9 2017,arXiv:1703.01736"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings M4M9 2017,arXiv:1703.01736", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.MA", "authors": ["thomas bolander"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02192"}
