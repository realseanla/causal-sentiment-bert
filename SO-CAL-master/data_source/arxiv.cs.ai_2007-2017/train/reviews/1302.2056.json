The performance results for a population of policies leads to a distribution that is examined in terms of policy complexity and analysed through several diagrams and indicators. The notion of environment response curve is also introduced, by inverting the performance results into an ability scale. We apply all these concepts, diagrams and indicators to a minimalistic environment class, agent-populated elementary cellular automata, showing how the difficulty, discriminating power and ranges (previous to normalisation) may vary for several environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 15:01:20 GMT  (725kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2056v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.2056"}
