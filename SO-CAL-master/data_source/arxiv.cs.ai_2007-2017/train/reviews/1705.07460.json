However, in real world, rewards are emergent phenomena from the complex interactions between agents and environments. In this paper, we propose an implicit generic reward model for reinforcement learning. Unlike those rewards that are manually defined for specific tasks, such implicit reward is task independent. It only comes from the deviation from the agents' previous experiences.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 May 2017 15:19:20 GMT  (76kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07460v1", "4 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["min xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07460"}
