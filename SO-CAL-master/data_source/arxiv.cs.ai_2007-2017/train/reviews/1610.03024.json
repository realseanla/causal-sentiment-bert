In ABA+, preference information given over assumptions is incorporated directly into the attack relation, thus resulting in attack reversal. ABA+ conservatively extends ABA and exhibits various desirable features regarding relationship among argumentation semantics as well as preference handling. We also introduce Weak Contraposition, a principle concerning reasoning with rules and preferences that relaxes the standard principle of contraposition, while guaranteeing additional desirable features for ABA+.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 18:45:41 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03024v1", "Manuscript under review"], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 17:40:10 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03024v2", "This is a preprint of a manuscript under review"]], "COMMENTS": "Manuscript under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kristijonas \\v{c}yras", "francesca toni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03024"}
