This newly developed learning technique is independent of the number of class constraints and it can learn new classes while still retaining the knowledge of previous classes. Whenever a new class (non-native to the knowledge learnt thus far) is encountered, the neural network structure gets remodeled automatically by facilitating new neurons and interconnections, and the parameters are calculated in such a way that it retains the knowledge learnt thus far. This technique is suitable for real-world applications where the number of classes is often unknown and online learning from real-time data is required. The consistency and the complexity of the progressive learning technique are analyzed. Several standard datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the developed technique. A comparative study shows that the developed technique is superior.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 01:50:18 GMT  (1032kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00085v1", "23 pages, 13 tables, 11 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 22 Jan 2017 09:52:06 GMT  (1342kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00085v2", "23 pages, 13 tables, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 13 tables, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["rajasekar venkatesan", "meng joo er"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00085"}
