The theory is outlined in an appendix. The distinctive features and advantages are summarised: simplification and integration of observations and concepts, and of structures and processes in computing systems; the SP theory is itself a theory of computing; a central role for information compression via the matching and unification of patterns, and for multiple alignment; transparency in the representation and processing of knowledge; the discovery of 'natural' structures via information compression (DONSVIC); interpretation of aspects of mathematics; interpretation of phenomena in human perception and cognition; realisation of abstract concepts in terms of neurons and their inter-connections (\"SP-neural\"). Distinctive features and advantages of the SP system compared with alternatives in: minimum length encoding and related concepts; deep learning in neural networks; universal search; Bayesian networks and other models for AI; analysis and production of natural language; learning natural language; exact and inexact reasoning; representation and processing of diverse forms of knowledge; IBM's Watson; problems associated with big data, and in the development of intelligence in autonomous robots. In conclusion, a major strength of SP system is that it can provide a firm foundation for the long-term development of AI and, at the same time, it may deliver some benefits and applications on relatively short timescales. It is envisaged that a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine will be created, hosted on an existing high-performance computer and derived from the existing SP computer model. This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system, and to create new versions of it.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 17:15:13 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04087v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 08:48:08 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04087v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 17 Sep 2015 10:16:04 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04087v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 17:59:52 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04087v4", null], ["v5", "Sun, 20 Dec 2015 12:05:50 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04087v5", null], ["v6", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 16:09:02 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04087v6", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j g wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04087"}
