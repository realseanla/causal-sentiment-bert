This is achieved by combining a Laplace Mechanism with EXP3. We show that though EXP3 is already differentially private, it leaks a linear amount of information in $T$. However, we can improve this privacy by relying on its intrinsic exponential mechanism for selecting actions. This allows us to reach $\\mathcal{O}{(\\sqrt{\\ln T})}$-DP, with a regret of $\\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3})}$ that holds against an adaptive adversary, an improvement from the best known of $\\mathcal{O}{(T^{3/4})}$. This is done by using an algorithm that run EXP3 in a mini-batch loop. Finally, we run experiments that clearly demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Jan 2017 10:04:05 GMT  (442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04222v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR", "authors": ["aristide charles yedia tossou", "christos dimitrakakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.04222"}
