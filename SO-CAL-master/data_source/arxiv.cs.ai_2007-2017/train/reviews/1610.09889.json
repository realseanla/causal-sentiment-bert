In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage poetry generating method which first plans the sub-topics of the poem according to the user's writing intent, and then generates each line of the poem sequentially, using a modified recurrent neural network encoder-decoder framework. The proposed planning-based method can ensure that the generated poem is coherent and semantically consistent with the user's intent. A comprehensive evaluation with human judgments demonstrates that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art poetry generating methods and the poem quality is somehow comparable to human poets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 12:16:39 GMT  (250kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09889v1", "Accepted at COLING 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 03:56:19 GMT  (262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09889v2", "Accepted paper at COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["zhe wang", "wei he", "hua wu", "haiyang wu", "wei li", "haifeng wang", "enhong chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09889"}
