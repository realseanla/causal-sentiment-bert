One problem with this method is that such priors are almost never directly available. One of the reasons is that the prior probability estimates include an implicit notion of a time interval over which they are specified -- for example, if the probability of failure of a component is 0.05, is this over the period of a day or is this over a week? A second problem facing probabilistic model-based diagnosis is the modeling of persistence. Say we have an observation about a system at time t_1 and then another observation at a later time t_2. To compute posterior probabilities that take into account both the observations, we need some model of how the state of the system changes from time t_1 to t_2. In this paper, we address these problems using techniques from Reliability theory. We show how to compute the failure prior of a component from an empirical measure of its reliability -- the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF). We also develop a scheme to model persistence when handling multiple time tagged observations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:43 GMT  (280kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4984v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sampath srinivas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4984"}
