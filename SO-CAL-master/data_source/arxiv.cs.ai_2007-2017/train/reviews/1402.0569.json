We resort to a variant of DL-Lite where the unique name assumption is not enforced and where equality between objects may be asserted and inferred. Actions are specified as sets of conditional effects, where conditions are based on epistemic queries over the knowledge base (TBox and ABox), and effects are expressed in terms of new ABoxes. In this setting, we address verification of temporal properties expressed in a variant of first-order mu-calculus with quantification across states. Notably, we show decidability of verification, under a suitable restriction inspired by the notion of weak acyclicity in data exchange.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:36:58 GMT  (391kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0569v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["babak bagheri hariri", "diego calvanese", "marco montali", "giuseppe de giacomo", "riccardo de masellis", "paolo felli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0569"}
