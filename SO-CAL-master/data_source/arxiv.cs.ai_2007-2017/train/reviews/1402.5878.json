Nonetheless, most approaches focus on enhancing privacy in Social Networks through improved privacy settings, neglecting the fact that privacy awareness is a prerequisite for privacy control. Social Network users first need to know about privacy issues before being able to make adjustments. In this paper, we introduce Friend Inspector, a serious game that allows its users to playfully increase their privacy awareness on Facebook. Since its launch, Friend Inspector has attracted a significant number of visitors, emphasising the need for better tools to understand privacy settings on Social Networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 15:26:15 GMT  (5122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5878v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["alexandra cetto", "michael netter", "g\\\"unther pernul", "christian richthammer", "moritz riesner", "christian roth", "johannes s\\\"anger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5878"}
