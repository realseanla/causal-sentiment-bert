They are completely counter-intuitive with many bizarre behaviors. However, this paper shows that they may make sense from the perspective of a general decision-optimization principle for cooperation. This principle also offers a generalization of Nash equilibrium, a key concept in game theory, for better payoffs and stability of game playing.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Nov 2009 16:43:52 GMT  (4kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5548v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Dec 2009 16:58:11 GMT  (4kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5548v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["xiaofei huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.5548"}
