It provides a platform for multiple criteria decision analysis in six aspects including (1) decision environment, (2) decision problem, (3) decision group, (4) decision conflict, (5) decision schemes and (6) group negotiation. Based on multiple artificial intelligent technologies, this framework provides reliable support for the comprehensive manipulation of applications and advanced decision approaches through the design of an integrated multi-agents architecture.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 00:40:34 GMT  (440kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0089v1", "Accepted paper in IEEE-ICDM2010; Print ISBN: 978-1-4244-9244-2"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted paper in IEEE-ICDM2010; Print ISBN: 978-1-4244-9244-2", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["junyi chai", "james n k liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0089"}
