This approach combines a classical dynamic modeling with an inverse kinematics' solver based on particle swarm optimization, PSO. First, an inverted pendulum, IP, is used to obtain a simplified dynamic model of the robot and to compute the target position of a key point in biped locomotion, the Centre Of Mass, COM. The proposed algorithm, called IK-PSO, Inverse Kinematics PSO, returns and inverse kinematics solution corresponding to that COM respecting the joints constraints. In This paper the inertia weight PSO variant is used to generate a possible solution according to the stability based fitness function and a set of joints motions constraints. The method is applied with success to a leg motion generation. Since based on a pre-calculated COM, that satisfied the biped stability, the proposal allowed also to plan a walk with application on a small size biped robot.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Dec 2012 14:45:54 GMT  (718kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1798v1", "7 pages, 7 figures, \"Published with International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA)\""]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 7 figures, \"Published with International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA)\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["nizar rokbani", "adel m alimi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.1798"}
