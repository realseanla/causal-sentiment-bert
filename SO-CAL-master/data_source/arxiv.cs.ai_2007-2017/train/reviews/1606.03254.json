We present a comparison of different information presentations for uncertain data and, for the first time, measure their effects on human decision-making. We show that the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) improves decision-making under uncertainty, compared to state-of-the-art graphical-based representation methods. In a task-based study with 442 adults, we found that presentations using NLG lead to 24% better decision-making on average than the graphical presentations, and to 44% better decision-making when NLG is combined with graphics. We also show that women achieve significantly better results when presented with NLG output (an 87% increase on average compared to graphical presentations).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 10:12:13 GMT  (432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03254v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 10:11:49 GMT  (432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03254v2", "54th annual meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Berlin 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["dimitra gkatzia", "oliver lemon", "verena rieser"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.03254"}
