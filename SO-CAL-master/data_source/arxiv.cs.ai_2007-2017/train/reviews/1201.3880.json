So the design of systems such as simulation systems, cooperative systems or assistance systems includes a very accurate modelling of interactional and communicational levels. The agent-based approach provides an adapted abstraction level for this problem. After having studied the organizational context and communicative capacities of agentbased systems, to simulate the reorganization of a flexible manufacturing, to regulate an urban transport system, and to simulate an epidemic detection system, our thoughts on the interactional level were inspired by human-machine interface models, especially those in \"cognitive engineering\". To provide a general framework for agent-based complex systems modelling, we then proposed a scale of four behaviours that agents may adopt in their complex systems (reactive, routine, cognitive, and collective). To complete the description of multi-level agent models, which is the focus of this paper, we illustrate our modelling and discuss our ongoing work on each level.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jan 2012 19:02:11 GMT  (851kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3880v1", "10 pages; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 6, No 1, November 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages; IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8, Issue 6, No 1, November 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["alain-j\\'er\\^ome foug\\`eres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3880"}
