Most previous work has tackled the problem via joint sequence models that require explicit alignments for training. In contrast, the attention-enabled encoder-decoder model allows for jointly learning to align and convert characters to phonemes. We explore different types of attention models, including global and local attention, and our best models achieve state-of-the-art results on three standard data sets (CMUDict, Pronlex, and NetTalk).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 19:00:48 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06540v1", "Accepted in SLT 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in SLT 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["shubham toshniwal", "karen livescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06540"}
