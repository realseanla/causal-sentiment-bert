It is a vital component of the way in which we as human beings operate on a day to day basis. Given a particular situation, decisions are made and actions undertaken in response to that situation based on our memory of related prior events and experiences. By utilising our memory we can anticipate the outcome of our chosen actions to avoid unexpected or unwanted events. In addition, as we subtly alter our actions and recognise altered outcomes we learn and create new memories, enabling us to improve the efficiency of our actions over time. However, as this process occurs so naturally in the subconscious its importance is often overlooked.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 15:05:10 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7130v1", "University of Nottingham, 2005"]], "COMMENTS": "University of Nottingham, 2005", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["william wilson", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7130"}
