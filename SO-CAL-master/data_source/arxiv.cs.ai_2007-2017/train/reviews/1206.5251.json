{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Jun-2012", "title": "Node Splitting: A Scheme for Generating Upper Bounds in Bayesian Networks", "abstract": "We formulate in this paper the mini-bucket algorithm for approximate inference in terms of exact inference on an approximate model produced by splitting nodes in a Bayesian network. The new formulation leads to a number of theoretical and practical implications. First, we show that branchand- bound search algorithms that use minibucket bounds may operate in a drastically reduced search space. Second, we show that the proposed formulation inspires new minibucket heuristics and allows us to analyze existing heuristics from a new perspective. Finally, we show that this new formulation allows mini-bucket approximations to benefit from recent advances in exact inference, allowing one to significantly increase the reach of these approximations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 14:56:19 GMT  (214kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5251v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2007)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arthur choi", "mark chavira", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.5251"}
