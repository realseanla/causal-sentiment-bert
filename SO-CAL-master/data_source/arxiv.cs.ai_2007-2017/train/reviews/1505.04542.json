Our parallelization scheme consists of homogeneous worker solvers, each of which runs on an available core and communicates with others via the global load balancing (GLB) method. The parallel solver is implemented with X10 that provides an implementation of GLB as a library. In experiments, several NCSPs from the literature were solved and attained up to 516-fold speedup using 600 cores of the TSUBAME2.5 supercomputer.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 May 2015 08:04:45 GMT  (2489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04542v1", "To be presented at X10'15 Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "To be presented at X10'15 Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI", "authors": ["daisuke ishii", "kazuki yoshizoe", "toyotaro suzumura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04542"}
