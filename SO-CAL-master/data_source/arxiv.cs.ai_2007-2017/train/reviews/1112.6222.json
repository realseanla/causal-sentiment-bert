Recently, focuses in this domain shifted from traditional vector based document similarity for clustering to suffix tree based document similarity, as it offers more semantic representation of the text present in the document. In this paper, we compare and contrast two recently introduced approaches to document clustering based on suffix tree data model. The first is an Efficient Phrase based document clustering, which extracts phrases from documents to form compact document representation and uses a similarity measure based on common suffix tree to cluster the documents. The second approach is a frequent word/word meaning sequence based document clustering, it similarly extracts the common word sequence from the document and uses the common sequence/ common word meaning sequence to perform the compact representation, and finally, it uses document clustering approach to cluster the compact documents. These algorithms are using agglomerative hierarchical document clustering to perform the actual clustering step, the difference in these approaches are mainly based on extraction of phrases, model representation as a compact document, and the similarity measures used for clustering. This paper investigates the computational aspect of the two algorithms, and the quality of results they produced.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 04:25:10 GMT  (235kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6222v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:40:29 GMT  (235kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6222v2", "Information and Emerging Technologies (ICIET), 2010 International Conference"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["muhammad rafi", "m maujood", "m m fazal", "s m ali"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.6222"}
