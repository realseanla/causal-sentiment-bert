Based on a logical framework extended by qualitative and quantitative temporal constraints we show how to describe behavioral models (both consistency- and abductive-based), discuss how to use abstract observations and show how abstract temporal diagnoses are computed. This yields an expressive framework, which allows the representation of complex temporal behavior allowing us to represent temporal uncertainty. Due to its abstraction capabilities computation is made independent of the number of observations and time points in a temporal setting. An example of hepatitis diagnosis is used throughout the paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:29 GMT  (1128kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6832v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["wolfgang nejdl", "johann gamper"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6832"}
