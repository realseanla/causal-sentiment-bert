MEP uses a linear solution representation. Each MEP individual is a string encoding complex expressions (computer programs). A MEP individual may encode multiple solutions of the current problem. In this paper MEP is used for evolving a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) heuristic for graphs satisfying triangle inequality. Evolved MEP heuristic is compared with Nearest Neighbor Heuristic (NN) and Minimum Spanning Tree Heuristic (MST) on some difficult problems in TSPLIB. For most of the considered problems the evolved MEP heuristic outperforms NN and MST. The obtained algorithm was tested against some problems in TSPLIB. The results emphasizes that evolved MEP heuristic is a powerful tool for solving difficult TSP instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 17:37:01 GMT  (73kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02459v1", "International Conference on Computational Sciences, ICCS'04, 6-9 June, Krakow, Poland, Edited by M.
