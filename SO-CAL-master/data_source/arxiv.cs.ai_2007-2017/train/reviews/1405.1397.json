Knowledge must be accessible to everyone regardless of their native languages. Universal Networking Language (UNL) is a declarative formal language and a generalized form of human language in a machine independent digital platform for defining, recapitulating, amending, storing and dissipating knowledge among people of different affiliations. UNL extracts semantic data from a native language for Interlingua machine translation. This paper presents the development of a graphical tool that incorporates UNL to provide a visual mean to represent the semantic data available in a native text. UNL represents the semantics of a sentence as a conceptual hyper-graph. We translate this information into XML format and create a graph from XML, representing the actual concepts available in the native language", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 May 2014 19:50:49 GMT  (478kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1397v1", "8 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:cs/0404030by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 5 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:cs/0404030by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["shamim ripon", "aoyan barua", "mohammad salah uddin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1397"}
