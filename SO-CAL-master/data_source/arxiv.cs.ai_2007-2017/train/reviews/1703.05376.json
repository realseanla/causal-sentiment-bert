In such methods, the iterates consist of two parts that are updated using different stepsizes. We develop the first convergence rate result for these algorithms; in particular, we provide a general methodology for analyzing two-timescale linear SA. We apply our methodology to two-timescale RL algorithms such as GTD(0), GTD2, and TDC.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 20:23:45 GMT  (42kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05376v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 16:35:17 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05376v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 07:12:14 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05376v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gal dalal", "balazs szorenyi", "gugan thoppe", "shie mannor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05376"}
