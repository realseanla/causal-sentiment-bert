Besides knowing the importance of testing, only limited time is allocated for teaching it. It will be more efficient if testing is taught simultaneously with programming foundations. This integrated learning of testing techniques and programming allows the programmers to perform in a better way and this leads to the improvement of the performance of the industry progress. In this paper, a technique named ontology is introduced, it first defines the various testing process in hierarchy and define relationships among them, to share and reuse the knowledge that is captured, secondly metadata is created by natural language processing and finally, the application use ontologies to support test management, it act as knowledge base for multiple environment with the integrated teaching of programming foundation and testing concepts. Keywords: Meta Data, Ontology, Software Testing, Integration, Programming Foundations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Feb 2013 08:45:49 GMT  (110kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5215v1", "International Journal of Communication, Computation and Innovation. / Volume 2, Issue 2, 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Communication, Computation and Innovation. / Volume 2, Issue 2, 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["a anandaraj", "p kalaivani", "v rameshkumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.5215"}
