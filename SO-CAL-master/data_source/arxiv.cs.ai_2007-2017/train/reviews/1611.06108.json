Such algorithm helps to automatize the elaboration of maps for commercial navigation systems. Our solution is based on simulating navigation along the road network, determining at each point of interest the visibility of the signs and their effect on the roads. We test our approach in a small urban network and discuss various ways to generalize it to support more complex environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 18:39:44 GMT  (294kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06108v1", "This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk{\\l}odowska-Curie Actions H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015 BIRDS GA No. 690941. in PACIS 2016 Online Proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "This research has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sk{\\l}odowska-Curie Actions H2020-MSCA-RISE-2015 BIRDS GA No. 690941. in PACIS 2016 Online Proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daniil galaktionov", "miguel r luaces", "\\'angeles s places"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06108"}
