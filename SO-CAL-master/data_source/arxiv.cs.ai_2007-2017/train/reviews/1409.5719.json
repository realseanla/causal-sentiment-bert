Such local search algorithms typically return a set of mutually nondominated Pareto local optimal (PLO) solutions, that is, a PLO-set. This paper investigates two aspects of PLO-sets by means of experiments with Pareto local search (PLS). First, we examine the impact of several problem characteristics on the properties of PLO-sets for multi-objective NK-landscapes with correlated objectives. In particular, we report that either increasing the number of objectives or decreasing the correlation between objectives leads to an exponential increment on the size of PLO-sets, whereas the variable correlation has only a minor effect. Second, we study the running time and the quality reached when using bounding archiving methods to limit the size of the archive handled by PLS, and thus, the maximum size of the PLO-set found. We argue that there is a clear relationship between the running time of PLS and the difficulty of a problem instance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 16:44:40 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5719v1", "appears in Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN XIII, Ljubljana : Slovenia (2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "appears in Parallel Problem Solving from Nature - PPSN XIII, Ljubljana : Slovenia (2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["manuel l\\'opez-ib\\'a\\~nez", "arnaud liefooghe", "s\\'ebastien verel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5719"}
