The present work is based on the assumption that common classification-based approaches to time series interpretation suffer from a set of inherent weaknesses whose ultimate cause lies in the monotonic nature of the deductive reasoning paradigm. In this document we propose a new approach to this problem based on the initial hypothesis that abductive reasoning properly accounts for the human ability to identify and characterize patterns appearing in a time series. The result of the interpretation is a set of conjectures in the form of observations, organized into an abstraction hierarchy, and explaining what has been observed. A knowledge-based framework and a set of algorithms for the interpretation task are provided, implementing a hypothesize-and-test cycle guided by an attentional mechanism. As a promising application domain, the interpretation of the electrocardiogram allows us to highlight the strengths of the present approach in comparison with traditional classification-based approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 08:31:18 GMT  (1362kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05632v1", "40 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "40 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tom\\'as teijeiro", "paulo f\\'elix"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05632"}
