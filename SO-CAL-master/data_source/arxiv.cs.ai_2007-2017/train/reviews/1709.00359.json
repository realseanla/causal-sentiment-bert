The main contribution consists of a framework in which dynamic epistemic logic satisfies the requirements for being a topological dynamical system thus interfacing discrete dynamic logics with continuous mappings of dynamical systems. The setting is based on a notion of logical convergence, demonstratively equivalent with convergence in Stone topology. Presented is a flexible, parametrized family of metrics inducing the latter, used as an analytical aid. We show maps induced by action model transformations continuous with respect to the Stone topology and present results on the recurrent behavior of said maps.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 15:08:36 GMT  (21kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00359v1", "As appearing in \"Logic, Rationality, and Interaction (LORI 2017, Sapporo, Japan)\", LNCS, Springer 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "As appearing in \"Logic, Rationality, and Interaction (LORI 2017, Sapporo, Japan)\", LNCS, Springer 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["dominik klein", "rasmus k rendsvig"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00359"}
