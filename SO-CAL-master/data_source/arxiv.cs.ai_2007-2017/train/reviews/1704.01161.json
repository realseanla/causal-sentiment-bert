Despite this, there is no existing finite sample analysis for TD(0) with function approximation, even for the linear case. Our work is the first to provide such a result. Works that managed to obtain concentration bounds for online Temporal Difference (TD) methods analyzed modified versions of them, carefully crafted for the analyses to hold. These modifications include projections and step-sizes dependent on unknown problem parameters. Our analysis obviates these artificial alterations by exploiting strong properties of TD(0) and tailor-made stochastic approximation tools.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 19:47:52 GMT  (133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01161v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 2 Jul 2017 10:28:28 GMT  (63kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01161v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gal dalal", "bal\\'azs sz\\\"or\\'enyi", "gugan thoppe", "shie mannor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01161"}
