We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for non-monotonic spatial reasoning --- a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems --- based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Jun 2016 01:02:30 GMT  (2414kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07860v1", "22 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 18:21:10 GMT  (2407kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07860v2", "22 pages, 6 figures, Under consideration for publication in TPLP"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["przemys{\\l}aw", "rzej wa{\\l}\\k{e}ga", "carl schultz", "mehul bhatt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07860"}
