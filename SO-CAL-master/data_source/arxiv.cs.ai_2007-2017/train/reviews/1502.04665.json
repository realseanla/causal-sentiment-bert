{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Feb-2015", "title": "Optimizations for Decision Making and Planning in Description Logic Dynamic Knowledge Bases", "abstract": "Artifact-centric models for business processes recently raised a lot of attention as they manage to combine structural (i.e. data related) with dynamical (i.e. process related) aspects in a seamless way. This developed in parallel with declarative approaches for modelling processes, where activities are not burdened by over-specified constrains like in traditional process-centric approaches, but try to adapt the internal system to the humans involved and the input they receive. In this paper, we try to merge these two aspects by proposing a framework aimed at describing rich business domains through Description Logic-based ontologies, and where a set of actions allows the system to evolve by modifying such ontologies. We then propose an evolution of such framework which represents a viable and formal environment to develop decision making and planning techniques for DL-based artifact-centric business domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 19:06:25 GMT  (87kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v1", "7 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 22:17:37 GMT  (597kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v2", "14 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 16:44:12 GMT  (235kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v3", "14 pages"], ["v4", "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 17:24:55 GMT  (73kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v4", "14 pages"], ["v5", "Fri, 3 Apr 2015 11:52:17 GMT  (71kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v5", "14 pages"], ["v6", "Wed, 29 Apr 2015 16:56:58 GMT  (273kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v6", "17 pages, extended version"], ["v7", "Mon, 4 May 2015 16:05:29 GMT  (260kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04665v7", "16 pages, extended version"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michele stawowy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.04665"}
