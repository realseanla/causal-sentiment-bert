We define an algebraic interpretation function, I_B, that maps a concept definition to a unique string ({\\omega}_B) called bit-code) over an alphabet {\\Sigma}_B of 11 symbols belonging to L_B - the language over P B. IB has semantic correspondence with conventional model-theoretic interpretation of DL. We then define {\\sigma}_BS on L_B. A detailed analysis of I_B and {\\sigma}_BS has been given.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 08:05:03 GMT  (344kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05667v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sourish dasgupta", "gaurav maheshwari", "priyansh trivedi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.05667"}
