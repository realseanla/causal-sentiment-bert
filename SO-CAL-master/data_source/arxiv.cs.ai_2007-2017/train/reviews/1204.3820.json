Moreover, we show that the algorithm also provides a tight convergence time guarantee (time optimality and distance optimality cannot be simultaneously satisfied). Our generic graph formulation allows the algorithm to be applied to scenarios such as grids with holes (modeling obstacles) in arbitrary dimensions. Simulations, available online, confirm our theoretical developments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Apr 2012 15:58:57 GMT  (2548kb,S)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3820v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Jul 2012 16:13:40 GMT  (2550kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3820v2", "Accepted to CDC 2012, this is the updated version"], ["v3", "Thu, 6 Sep 2012 17:25:27 GMT  (2549kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3820v3", "Brought to be in-sync with final version submitted to CDC 2012 with only minor updates"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["jingjin yu", "steven m lavalle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3820"}
