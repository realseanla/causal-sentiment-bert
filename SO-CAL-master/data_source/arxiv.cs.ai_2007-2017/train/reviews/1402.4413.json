A few years ago, most state-of-the-art solvers restarted on average after a few thousands of backtracks. Currently, restarting after a dozen backtracks results in much better performance. The main reason for this trend is that heuristics and data structures have become more restart-friendly. We expect further continuation of this trend, so future SAT solvers will restart even more rapidly. Additionally, we present experimental results to support our observations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 17:39:39 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4413v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["shai haim", "marijn heule"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4413"}
