We demonstrate this observation on the well-known class of random 3-SAT formulae. First, a new branching heuristic is presented, which generalizes existing work on this class. Much smaller search trees can be constructed by using this heuristic. Second, we introduce a variant of discrepancy search, called ALDS. Theoretical and practical evidence support that ALDS traverses the search tree in a near-optimal order when combined with the new heuristic. Both techniques, search and heuristic, have been implemented in the look-ahead solver march. The SAT 2009 competition results show that march is by far the strongest complete solver on random k-SAT formulae.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 19:59:58 GMT  (258kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4455v1", "Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Logic and Search (LaSh 2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the Third International Workshop on Logic and Search (LaSh 2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["sid mijnders", "boris de wilde", "marijn heule"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4455"}
