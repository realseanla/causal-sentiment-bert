We prove that any set of $n$ points in $d$ dimensions (rows in a matrix $A \\in \\RR^{n \\times d}$) can be projected into $t = \\Omega(k / \\eps^2)$ dimensions, for any $\\eps \\in (0,1/3)$, in $O(n d \\lceil \\eps^{-2} k/ \\log(d) \\rceil )$ time, such that with constant probability the optimal $k$-partition of the point set is preserved within a factor of $2+\\eps$. The projection is done by post-multiplying $A$ with a $d \\times t$ random matrix $R$ having entries $+1/\\sqrt{t}$ or $-1/\\sqrt{t}$ with equal probability. A numerical implementation of our technique and experiments on a large face images dataset verify the speed and the accuracy of our theoretical results.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 Nov 2010 02:37:10 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.4632v1", "Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["christos boutsidis", "anastasios zouzias", "petros drineas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1011.4632"}
