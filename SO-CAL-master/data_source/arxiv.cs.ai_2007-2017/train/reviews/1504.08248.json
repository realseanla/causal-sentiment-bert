However, bribery with money is often illegal in elections. Motivated by this, we introduce the notion of frugal bribery and formulate two new pertinent computational problems which we call Frugal-bribery and Frugal- $bribery to capture bribery without money in elections. In the proposed model, the briber is frugal in nature and this is captured by her inability to bribe votes of a certain kind, namely, non-vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-bribery problem, the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only vulnerable votes. In the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem, the vulnerable votes have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint of the briber. We further formulate two natural variants of the Frugal-{dollar}bribery problem namely Uniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery and Nonuniform-frugal-{dollar}bribery where the prices of the vulnerable votes are, respectively, all the same or different.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 14:42:34 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08248v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 16:39:10 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08248v2", "Fixed one proof and added more explanations to the proofs"], ["v3", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 16:51:02 GMT  (53kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08248v3", "Full version has been accepted in Theoretical Computer Science"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["palash dey", "neeldhara misra", "y narahari"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.08248"}
