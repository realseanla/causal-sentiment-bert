Current tools for constraint solving typically detect such properties efficiently by means of incomplete yet effective algorithms, and use them to reduce the search space and boost search.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:47:30 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3430v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["lucas bordeaux", "marco cadoli", "toni mancini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3430"}
