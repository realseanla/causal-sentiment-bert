The main objective of this scientific project is to provide any emerging collaborative situation with methods and tools to deploy a Mediation Information System (MIS). MISE 2.0 aims at defining and designing a service-based platform, dedicated to initiating and supporting the interoperability of collaborative situations among potential partners. This MISE 2.0 platform implements a model-driven engineering approach to the design of a service-oriented MIS dedicated to supporting the collaborative situation. This approach is structured in three layers, each providing their own key innovative points: (i) the gathering of individual and collaborative knowledge to provide appropriate collaborative business behaviour (key point: knowledge management, including semantics, exploitation and capitalization), (ii) deployment of a mediation information system able to computerize the previously deduced collaborative processes (key point: the automatic generation of collaborative workflows, including connection with existing devices or services) (iii) the management of the agility of the obtained collaborative network of organizations (key point: supervision of collaborative situations and relevant exploitation of the gathered data). MISE covers business issues (through BPM), technical issues (through an SOA) and agility issues of collaborative situations (through EDA).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 12:35:39 GMT  (2642kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09152v1", "\\&amp;lt;10.1080/17517575.2014.928949\\&amp;gt"]], "COMMENTS": "\\&amp;lt;10.1080/17517575.2014.928949\\&amp;gt", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["frederick benaben", "wenxin mu", "nicolas boissel-dallier", "anne-marie barthe-delano\\\"e", "sarah zribi", "herve pingaud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.09152"}
