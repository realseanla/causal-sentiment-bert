To address this challenge, a number of knowledge graph completion methods have been developed using low-dimensional graph embeddings. Although researchers continue to improve these models using an increasingly complex feature space, we show that simple changes in the architecture of the underlying model can outperform state-of-the-art models without the need for complex feature engineering. In this work, we present a shared variable neural network model called ProjE that fills-in missing information in a knowledge graph by learning joint embeddings of the knowledge graph's entities and edges, and through subtle, but important, changes to the standard loss function. In doing so, ProjE has a parameter size that is smaller than 11 out of 15 existing methods while performing $37\\%$ better than the current-best method on standard datasets. We also show, via a new fact checking task, that ProjE is capable of accurately determining the veracity of many declarative statements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 20:09:08 GMT  (1337kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05425v1", "14 pages, Accepted to AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, Accepted to AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["baoxu shi", "tim weninger"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.05425"}
