A new theoretical and technological system of imprecise-information processing has been founded in Principles of Imprecise-Information Processing: A New Theoretical and Technological System[1] which is different from fuzzy technology. The system has clear hierarchy and rigorous structure, which results from the formation principle of imprecise information and has solid mathematical and logical bases, and which has many advantages beyond fuzzy technology. The system provides a technological platform for relevant applications and lays a theoretical foundation for further research.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 02:14:16 GMT  (405kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02751v1", "14 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["shiyou lian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02751"}
