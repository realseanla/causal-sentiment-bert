The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that move in an undirected graph shared by both teams. Agents are placed in vertices of the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into adjacent vertices in a conflict free way. Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by attackers by occupying selected vertices. The team of defenders need to maintain connectivity of vertices occupied by its own agents in a visibility graph. The visibility graph models possibility of communication between pairs of vertices.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 07:38:17 GMT  (633kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01070v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1708.07285"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1708.07285", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["marika ivanov\\'a", "pavel surynek", "diep thi ngoc nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01070"}
