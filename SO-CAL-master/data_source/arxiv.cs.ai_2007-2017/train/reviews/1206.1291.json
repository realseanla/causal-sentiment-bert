This paper presents a feature weighting method for Document Image Retrieval System (DIRS) based on keyword spotting. In this method, we weight the feature using coefficient of multiple correlations. Coefficient of multiple correlations can be used to describe the synthesized effects and correlation of each feature. The aim of this paper is to show that feature weighting increases the performance of DIRS. After applying the feature weighting method to DIRS the average precision is 93.23% and average recall become 98.66% respectively", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jun 2012 18:20:27 GMT  (334kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1291v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohammadreza keyvanpour", "reza tavoli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1291"}
