It is designed to find paths in high-dimensional continuous spaces and applies to robots with many degrees of freedom in static, as well as dynamic environments - ones where obstacles may move. The Ariadne's clew algorithm comprises two sub-algorithms, called Search and Explore, applied in an interleaved manner. Explore builds a representation of the accessible space while Search looks for the target. Both are posed as optimization problems. We describe a real implementation of the algorithm to plan paths for a six degrees of freedom arm in a dynamic environment where another six degrees of freedom arm is used as a moving obstacle. Experimental results show that a path is found in about one second without any pre-processing.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:44:34 GMT  (198kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5440v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j m ahuactzin", "p bessiere", "e mazer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5440"}
