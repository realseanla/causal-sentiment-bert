We introduce separators associated with the Minkowski sum and the Minkowski difference in order to facilitate the resolution. A test-case is given in order to illustrate the principle of the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:56:51 GMT  (588kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03103v1", "In Proceedings SNR 2017,arXiv:1704.02421"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings SNR 2017,arXiv:1704.02421", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CG cs.SY", "authors": ["benoit desrochers", "luc jaulin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03103"}
