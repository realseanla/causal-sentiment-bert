Agents are commonly defined as entities that act, perceive, and are goal-directed. In a multivariate Markov chain (e.g. a cellular automaton) the transition matrix completely determines the dynamics. This seems to contradict the possibility of acting entities within such a system. Here we present definitions of actions and perceptions within multivariate Markov chains based on entity-sets. Entity-sets represent a largely independent choice of a set of spatiotemporal patterns that are considered as all the entities within the Markov chain. For example, the entity-set can be chosen according to operational closure conditions or complete specific integration. Importantly, the perception-action loop also induces an entity-set and is a multivariate Markov chain. We then show that our definition of actions leads to non-heteronomy and that of perceptions specialize to the usual concept of perception in the perception-action loop.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 11:44:24 GMT  (64kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03576v1", "8 pages, 2 figures, accepted at the European Conference on Artificial Life 2017, Lyon, France"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 2 figures, accepted at the European Conference on Artificial Life 2017, Lyon, France", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["martin biehl", "daniel polani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03576"}
