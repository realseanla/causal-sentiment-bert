It is argued that building a general data compression algorithm solving all problems up to a complexity threshold should be the main thrust of research. A measure for partial progress in AGI is suggested. Although the details are far from being clear, some general properties for a general compression algorithm are fleshed out. Its inductive bias should be flexible and adapt to the input data while constantly searching for a simple, orthogonal and complete set of hypotheses explaining the data. It should recursively reduce the size of its representations thereby compressing the data increasingly at every iteration.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Jun 2015 09:29:11 GMT  (421kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04366v1", "27 pages, 3 figures, position paper"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages, 3 figures, position paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["arthur franz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04366"}
