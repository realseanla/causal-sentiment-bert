This paper is concerned with finding optimal policies for POMDPs. We propose several improvements to incremental pruning, presently the most efficient exact algorithm for solving POMDPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:07:12 GMT  (320kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7417v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang", "stephen s lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7417"}
