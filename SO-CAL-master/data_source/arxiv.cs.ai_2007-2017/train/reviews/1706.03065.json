Basic balanced structures and combinatorial balanced problems are briefly described. A special attention is targeted to various balance/unbalance indices (including some new versions of the indices): by cluster cardinality, by cluster weights, by inter-cluster edge/arc weights, by cluster element structure (for element multi-type clustering). Further, versions of optimization clustering problems are suggested (including multicriteria problem formulations). Illustrative numerical examples describe calculation of balance indices and element multi-type balance clustering problems (including example for design of student teams).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 19:34:58 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03065v1", "21 pages, 17 figures, 14 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 17 figures, 14 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["mark sh levin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03065"}
