It is parameterised in a discriminative framework and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference. Importantly, we consider partiallysupervised learning and propose algorithms for generalised partially-supervised learning and constrained inference. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Sep 2010 13:25:05 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.2009v1", "56 pages, short version presented at NIPS'08"]], "COMMENTS": "56 pages, short version presented at NIPS'08", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI", "authors": ["tran the truyen", "dinh q phung", "hung hai bui", "svetha venkatesh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1009.2009"}
