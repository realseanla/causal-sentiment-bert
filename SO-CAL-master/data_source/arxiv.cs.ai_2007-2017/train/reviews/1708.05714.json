Such a machine is only possible if there is something wrong with the foundations of computer science and mathematics. We therefore check our work by looking very closely at Cantor's diagonalization and construct a novel formal language as an Abelian group which allows us, through equivalence relations, to provide a non-trivial counterexample to Cantor's argument. As if that wasn't enough, we then discover that the impredicative nature of G\\\"odel's diagonalization lemma leads to logical tautology, invalidating any meaning behind the method, leaving no doubt that diagonalization is flawed. Our discovery in regards to these foundational arguments opens the door to solving the P vs NP problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 22:36:07 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05714v1", "21 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["mark inman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05714"}
