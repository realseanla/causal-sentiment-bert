The proposed networks are tailored to glioblastomas (both low and high grade) pictured in MR images. By their very nature, these tumors can appear anywhere in the brain and have almost any kind of shape, size, and contrast. These reasons motivate our exploration of a machine learning solution that exploits a flexible, high capacity DNN while being extremely efficient. Here, we give a description of different model choices that we've found to be necessary for obtaining competitive performance. We explore in particular different architectures based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e. DNNs specifically adapted to image data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 May 2015 20:06:21 GMT  (949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03540v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 17:37:02 GMT  (1683kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03540v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 20 May 2016 06:30:23 GMT  (2872kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03540v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["mohammad havaei", "axel davy", "david warde-farley", "antoine biard", "aaron courville", "yoshua bengio", "chris pal", "pierre-marc jodoin", "hugo larochelle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.03540"}
