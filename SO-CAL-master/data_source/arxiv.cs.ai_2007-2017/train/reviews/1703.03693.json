Classical and quantum nodes can be distinguished based on certain correlations in their states. This paper investigates some properties of the states obtained in a decision tree structure. How these correlations may be mapped to the decision tree is considered. Classical tree representations and approximations to quantum states are provided.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 21:39:52 GMT  (513kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03693v1", "9 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["subhash kak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.03693"}
