It is built in Clojure - a modern Lisp dialect, and is backed by the OWL API. Used simply, it has a similar syntax to OWL Manchester syntax, but it provides arbitrary extensibility and abstraction. It builds on existing facilities for Clojure, which provides a rich and modern programming tool chain, for versioning, distributed development, build, testing and continuous integration. In this paper, we describe the library, this environment and the its potential implications for the ontology development process.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 16:35:19 GMT  (14kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0213v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DL", "authors": ["phillip lord"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0213"}
