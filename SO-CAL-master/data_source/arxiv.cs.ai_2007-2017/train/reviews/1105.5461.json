We show that globally complete probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events is NP-hard. We then concentrate on the special case of probabilistic deduction in conditional constraint trees. We elaborate very efficient techniques for globally complete probabilistic deduction. In detail, for conditional constraint trees with point probabilities, we present a local approach to globally complete probabilistic deduction, which runs in linear time in the size of the conditional constraint trees. For conditional constraint trees with interval probabilities, we show that globally complete probabilistic deduction can be done in a global approach by solving nonlinear programs. We show how these nonlinear programs can be transformed into equivalent linear programs, which are solvable in polynomial time in the size of the conditional constraint trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2011 01:53:20 GMT  (205kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.5461v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["t lukasiewicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.5461"}
