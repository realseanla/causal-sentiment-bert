Accordingly, feature selection has become more and more important and plays a critical role for face data description and recognition. In this paper, we propose a trainable feature selection algorithm based on the regularized frame for face recognition. By enforcing a sparsity penalty term on the minimum squared error (MSE) criterion, we cast the feature selection problem into a combinatorial sparse approximation problem, which can be solved by greedy methods or convex relaxation methods. Moreover, based on the same frame, we propose a sparse Ho-Kashyap (HK) procedure to obtain simultaneously the optimal sparse solution and the corresponding margin vector of the MSE criterion. The proposed methods are used for selecting the most informative Gabor features of face images for recognition and the experimental results on benchmark face databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 12:05:47 GMT  (102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2748v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["yixiong liang", "lei wang", "yao xiang", "beiji zou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2748"}
