Methods based on Markov assumption are widely-used, but independently combine several most recent components. Recently, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) based methods have been successfully applied in several sequential modeling tasks. However, for real-world applications, these methods have difficulty in modeling the contextual information, which has been proved to be very important for behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel model, named Context-Aware Recurrent Neural Networks (CA-RNN). Instead of using the constant input matrix and transition matrix in conventional RNN models, CA-RNN employs adaptive context-specific input matrices and adaptive context-specific transition matrices. The adaptive context-specific input matrices capture external situations where user behaviors happen, such as time, location, weather and so on. And the adaptive context-specific transition matrices capture how lengths of time intervals between adjacent behaviors in historical sequences affect the transition of global sequential features. Experimental results show that the proposed CA-RNN model yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods and context-aware recommendation methods on two public datasets, i.e., the Taobao dataset and the Movielens-1M dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 15:33:46 GMT  (629kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05787v1", "IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2016, to apear"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM) 2016, to apear", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["qiang liu", "shu wu", "diyi wang", "zhaokang li", "liang wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05787"}
