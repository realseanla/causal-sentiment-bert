Part 1: Converting CNF's to orthogonal DNF's", "abstract": "For most branching algorithms in Boolean logic \"branching\" means \"variable-wise branching\". We present the apparently novel technique of clause-wise branching, which is used to solve the ALLSAT problem for arbitrary Boolean functions in CNF format. Specifically, it converts a CNF into an orthogonal DNF, i.e. into an exclusive sum of products. Our method is enhanced by two ingredients: The use of a good SAT-solver and wildcards beyond the common don't-care symbol.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 14:32:41 GMT  (2015kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08472v1", "26 pages, 4 figures, 10 Tables"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:57:49 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08472v2", "27 pages, 3 figures, 10 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages, 4 figures, 10 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["marcel wild"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08472"}
