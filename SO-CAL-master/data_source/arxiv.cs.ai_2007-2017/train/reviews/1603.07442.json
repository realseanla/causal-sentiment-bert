The model transfers an input domain to a target domain in semantic level, and generates the target image in pixel level. To generate realistic target images, we employ the real/fake-discriminator in Generative Adversarial Nets, but also introduce a novel domain-discriminator to make the generated image relevant to the input image. We verify our model through a challenging task of generating a piece of clothing from an input image of a dressed person. We present a high quality clothing dataset containing the two domains, and succeed in demonstrating decent results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 05:20:59 GMT  (4963kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07442v1", "The code and the dataset will be available soon"], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 01:20:33 GMT  (4974kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07442v2", "The code and the dataset will be available soon"], ["v3", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 13:17:40 GMT  (5118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07442v3", "Published in ECCV 2016.
