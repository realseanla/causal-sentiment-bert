The space of truth values for this logic is the lattice of possibility functions, that, from an algebraic point of view, forms a quantal. A second contribution comes from the understanding of the new conjunction as the combination of tokens of information coming from different sources, which makes our language \"dynamic\". A Gentzen calculus is presented, which is proved sound and complete with respect to the given semantics. The problem of truth functionality is discussed in this context.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:06 GMT  (405kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4931v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["luca boldrin", "claudio sossai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4931"}
