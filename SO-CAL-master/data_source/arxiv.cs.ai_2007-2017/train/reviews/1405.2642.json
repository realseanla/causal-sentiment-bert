We introduced the knowledge base dynamics to deal with two important points: first, to handle belief states that need not be deductively closed; and the second point is the ability to declare certain parts of the belief as immutable. In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem. This approach is very close to the Hansson's dyadic representation of belief. Here, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for knowledge base dynamics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 May 2014 06:54:12 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2642v1", "Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences, 2014"], ["v2", "Thu, 22 May 2014 16:29:54 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2642v2", "Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Applied Mathematics &amp; Information Sciences, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["radhakrishnan delhibabu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.2642"}
