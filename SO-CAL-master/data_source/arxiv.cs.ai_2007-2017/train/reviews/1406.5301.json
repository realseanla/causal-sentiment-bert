In 2003, two stochastic solvers reported computational complexity of $O(1.423^L)$ and $O(1.370^L)$, refined to $O(1.5097^L)$ and $O(1.4072^L)$ for L odd in this paper. The solvers from 2009, in our experiments, demonstrate average-case asymptotic performance of $114.515*1.3464^L$ for L even, and $320.360*1.3421^L$ for L odd.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Jun 2014 08:00:15 GMT  (2216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5301v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 06:57:01 GMT  (2215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5301v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 14 Jul 2014 13:54:15 GMT  (2212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5301v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 12:17:46 GMT  (6126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5301v4", "text overlap withthis http URL"], ["v5", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 12:44:48 GMT  (6125kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5301v5", null], ["v6", "Sat, 6 May 2017 08:36:16 GMT  (2359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5301v6", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["borko bo\\v{s}kovi\\'c", "franc brglez", "janez brest"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.5301"}
