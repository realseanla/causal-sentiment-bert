In this paper, we port the state-of-the-art SAT symmetry breaker BreakID to answer set programming (ASP). The result is a lightweight tool that can be plugged in between the grounding and the solving phases that are common when modelling in ASP. We compare our tool with sbass, the current state-of-the-art symmetry breaker for ASP.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 13:47:41 GMT  (427kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08447v1", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jo devriendt", "bart bogaerts"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08447"}
