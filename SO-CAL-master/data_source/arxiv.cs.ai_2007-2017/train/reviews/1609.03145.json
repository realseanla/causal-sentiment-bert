Relational models describe complete networked {domains by taking into account global dependencies in the data}. Relational models can lead to more accurate predictions if compared to non-relational machine learning approaches. Relational models typically are based on probabilistic graphical models, e.g., Bayesian networks, Markov networks, or latent variable models. Relational models have applications in social networks analysis, the modeling of knowledge graphs, bioinformatics, recommendation systems, natural language processing, medical decision support, and linked data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Sep 2016 10:14:18 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03145v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["volker tresp", "maximilian nickel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03145"}
