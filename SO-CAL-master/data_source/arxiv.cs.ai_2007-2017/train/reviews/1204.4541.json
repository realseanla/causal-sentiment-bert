However, for many processes, which require the appraisal of an expert or much computational time, only a small part of these objects can be taken into account. In this context, robust sampling methods become necessary. In this paper, we propose a sampling method based on clustering techniques. Our method consists in dividing the objects in clusters, then in selecting in each cluster, the most representative objects. A case-study in the context of a process dedicated to knowledge revision for geographic data generalisation is presented. This case-study shows that our method allows to select relevant samples of objects.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Apr 2012 06:35:41 GMT  (153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4541v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick taillandier", "julien gaffuri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4541"}
