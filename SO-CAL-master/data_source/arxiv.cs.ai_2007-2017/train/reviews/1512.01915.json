We characterize this relation in the standard context of imperfect information concurrent game. We assume that whenever a set of agents form a coalition to achieve a goal, they share their knowledge before acting. Based on this assumption, we propose new semantics for alternating-time temporal logic with imperfect information and perfect recall. It turns out that this semantics is sufficient to preserve all the desirable properties of coalition ability in traditional coalitional logics. Meanwhile, we investigate how knowledge sharing within a group of agents contributes to its coalitional ability through the interplay of epistemic and coalition modalities. This work provides a partial answer to the question: which kind of group knowledge is required for a group to achieve their goals in the context of imperfect information.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 05:27:07 GMT  (94kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01915v1", "This version corrected errors in its previous version published at AI'15"], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 09:00:32 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01915v2", "This version corrected errors in its previous version published at AI'15"]], "COMMENTS": "This version corrected errors in its previous version published at AI'15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guifei jiang", "dongmo zhang", "laurent perrussel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01915"}
