We show that the identification of causal effect between a singleton variable X and a set of variables Y can be accomplished systematically, in time polynomial in the number of variables in the graph. When the causal effect is identifiable, a closed-form expression can be obtained for the probability that the action will achieve a specified goal, or a set of goals.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:35 GMT  (462kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4948v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david galles", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4948"}
