Previous approaches either discover plans by maximally \"matching\" observed actions to plan libraries, assuming target plans are from plan libraries, or infer plans by executing domain models to best explain the observed actions, assuming complete domain models are available. In real world applications, however, target plans are often not from plan libraries and complete domain models are often not available, since building complete sets of plans and complete domain models are often difficult or expensive. In this paper we view plan libraries as corpora and learn vector representations of actions using the corpora; we then discover target plans based on the vector representations. Our approach is capable of discovering underlying plans that are not from plan libraries, without requiring domain models provided. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance to traditional plan recognition approaches in three planning domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 05:50:14 GMT  (119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05662v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xin tian", "hankz hankui zhuo", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05662"}
