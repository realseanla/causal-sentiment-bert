Most of the techniques have been developed after an intensive experimental process. It is believed that these techniques exploit the underlying structure of industrial instances. However, there are few works trying to exactly characterize the main features of this structure.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 14:02:12 GMT  (429kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03329v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 21:04:10 GMT  (429kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03329v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["carlos ans\\'otegui", "maria luisa bonet", "jes\\'us gir\\'aldez-cru", "jordi levy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03329"}
