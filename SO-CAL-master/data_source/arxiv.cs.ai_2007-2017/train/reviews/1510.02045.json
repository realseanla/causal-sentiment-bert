We study how the budget constraints of individual traders affect their ability to impact the market price. As a concrete application of our characterization, we give sufficient conditions for a property we call budget additivity: two traders with budgets B and B' and the same beliefs would have a combined impact equal to a single trader with budget B+B'. That way, even if a single trader cannot move the market much, a crowd of like-minded traders can have the same desired effect. When the set of payoff vectors associated with outcomes, with coordinates corresponding to securities, is affinely independent, we obtain that a generalization of the heavily-used logarithmic market scoring rule is budget additive, but the quadratic market scoring rule is not. Our results may be used both descriptively, to understand if a particular market maker is affected by budget constraints or not, and prescriptively, as a recipe to construct markets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 18:02:01 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02045v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["nikhil devanur", "miroslav dud\\'ik", "zhiyi huang", "david m pennock"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.02045"}
