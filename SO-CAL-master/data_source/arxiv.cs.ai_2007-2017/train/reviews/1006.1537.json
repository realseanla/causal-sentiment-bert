As we know, previous algorithms for solving #SAT have been analyzed only regarding the number of variables as the parameter. However, the time complexity for solving #SAT instances depends not only on the number of variables, but also on the number of clauses. Therefore, it is significant to exploit the time complexity from the other point of view, i.e. the number of clauses. In this paper, we present algorithms for solving #2-SAT and #3-SAT with rigorous complexity analyses using the number of clauses as the parameter. By analyzing the algorithms, we obtain the new worst-case upper bounds O(1.1892m) for #2-SAT and O(1.4142m) for #3-SAT, where m is the number of clauses.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 11:48:12 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.1537v1", "6 pages; proceedings of AAAI 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages; proceedings of AAAI 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["junping zhou", "minghao yin", "chunguang zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.1537"}
