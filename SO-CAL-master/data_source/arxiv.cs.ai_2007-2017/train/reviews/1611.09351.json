{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Nov-2016", "title": "Adams Conditioning and Likelihood Ratio Transfer Mediated Inference", "abstract": "Forensic science advocates the use of inference mechanisms which may be viewed as simple multi-agent protocols. An important protocol of this kind involves an agent FE (forensic expert) who communicates to a second agent TOF (trier of fact) first its value of a certain likelihood ratio with respect to its own belief state which is supposed to be captured by a probability function on FE's proposition space. Subsequently FE communicates its recently acquired confirmation that a certain evidence proposition is true. The inference part of this sort of reasoning, here referred to as likelihood ratio transfer mediated reasoning, involves TOF's revision of its own belief state, and in particular an evaluation of the resulting belief in the hypothesis proposition.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 22:31:02 GMT  (40kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09351v1", "43 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Dec 2016 10:07:29 GMT  (47kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09351v2", "In this revision, besides the improvement of several details, some remarks and results concerning transposition of the conditional and the prosecutor's fallacy have been included.
