An important but poorly understood aspect of sensory processing is the role of active sensing. Here, we present a Bayes-optimal inference and control framework for active sensing, C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller). Unlike previously proposed algorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information maximization (Infomax) [Butko &amp; Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy [Najemnik &amp; Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a combination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and effort. We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to illustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial and optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly inadequate. Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we present both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain context-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity. These approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem involving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC and statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 May 2013 22:46:35 GMT  (356kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.6650v1", "Scheduled to appear in UAI 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Scheduled to appear in UAI 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["sheeraz ahmad", "angela j yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.6650"}
