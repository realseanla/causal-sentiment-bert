Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-lite_R, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:20:50 GMT  (560kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3901v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["piero a bonatti", "marco faella", "luigi sauro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3901"}
