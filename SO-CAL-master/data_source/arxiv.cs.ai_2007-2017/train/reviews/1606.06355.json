However, little effort has been put into developing methods to learn policies for complex persistent tasks and tasks that are time-sensitive. In this paper, we take a step towards solving this problem by using signal temporal logic (STL) as task specification, and taking advantage of the temporal abstraction feature that the options framework provide. We show via simulation that a relatively easy to implement algorithm that combines STL and options can learn a satisfactory policy with a small number of training cases", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 22:43:29 GMT  (467kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06355v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xiao li", "calin belta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06355"}
