McCain's embedding of definite propositional causal theories into logic programming paved the way to the use of answer set solvers for answering queries about actions described in such languages. In this paper we extend this embedding to nondefinite theories and to first-order causal logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Mar 2011 15:48:44 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.4558v1", "29 pages.
