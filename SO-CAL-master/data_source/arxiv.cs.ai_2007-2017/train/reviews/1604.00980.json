We proposed a method that allows a trust computation which is previously subjective and incomputable. An example of case study for the trust computation is the United States of America Great Britain relations. The method supports decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be known as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 05:26:08 GMT  (879kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00980v1", "Keywords Trust Algebra, International Relations, Trust Computation, Foreign Policy, Politics, Dempster-Shafer, Subjective Logic, Common Criteria, Defense, National Security, Terrorism, Counter Terrorism, Trust Perception, Foreign Ministry, Intelligent"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords Trust Algebra, International Relations, Trust Computation, Foreign Policy, Politics, Dempster-Shafer, Subjective Logic, Common Criteria, Defense, National Security, Terrorism, Counter Terrorism, Trust Perception, Foreign Ministry, Intelligent", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI", "authors": ["mohd anuar mat isa", "ramlan mahmod", "nur izura udzir", "jamalul-lail ab manan", "ali dehghan tanha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00980"}
