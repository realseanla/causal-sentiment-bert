The approach taken is to model domain knowledge as Bayesian Network fragments that are glued together to form a complete view of the domain specific system requirements. User requirements are introduced as evidence and the propagation of belief is used to determine what are the appropriate system requirements as indicated by user requirements. This concept has been demonstrated in the development of a system specification and the results are presented here.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:56:51 GMT  (247kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6678v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["philip s barry", "kathryn blackmond laskey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6678"}
