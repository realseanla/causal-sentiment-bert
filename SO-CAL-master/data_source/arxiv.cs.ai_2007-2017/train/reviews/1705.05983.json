In such a machine, a computing unit does not need to keep the legacy of a universal computing core. The data can be delivered to the computing units, and the results can be collected from them through Collective Streaming, reminiscent of Collective Communication in Supercomputing. There is no need for a deep memory hierarchy as in a GPU, nor a fine-grain mesh as in a systolic array.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 02:15:27 GMT  (2483kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05983v1", "17 pages, 13 figures; to be published in IEEE APSIPA Transaction on Signal and Information Processing as an invited paper on Industrial Technology Advances"], ["v2", "Tue, 23 May 2017 16:30:39 GMT  (2490kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05983v2", "17 pages, 13 figures; to be published in IEEE APSIPA Transaction on Signal and Information Processing as an invited paper on Industrial Technology Advances"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 13 figures; to be published in IEEE APSIPA Transaction on Signal and Information Processing as an invited paper on Industrial Technology Advances", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["chien-ping lu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05983"}
