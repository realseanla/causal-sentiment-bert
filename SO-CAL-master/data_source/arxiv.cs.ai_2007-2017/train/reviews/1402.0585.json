Since the 1950s, different computational techniques related to Artificial Intelligence have been used for algorithmic composition, including grammatical representations, probabilistic methods, neural networks, symbolic rule-based systems, constraint programming and evolutionary algorithms. This survey aims to be a comprehensive account of research on algorithmic composition, presenting a thorough view of the field for researchers in Artificial Intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:43:06 GMT  (846kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0585v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jose david fernandez", "francisco vico"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0585"}
