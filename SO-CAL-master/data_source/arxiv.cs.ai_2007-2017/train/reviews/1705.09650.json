We learn a probabilistic deterministic real timed automaton profiling benign behavior of encryption control in the DVB control access system. This profile is used as a one-class classifier. Anomalous items in a testing sequence are detected when the sequence is not accepted by the learned model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 May 2017 09:26:49 GMT  (3058kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09650v1", "This paper has been accepted by the Thirty-Second Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) Workshop on Learning and Automata (LearnAut)"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper has been accepted by the Thirty-Second Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) Workshop on Learning and Automata (LearnAut)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.FL cs.LO", "authors": ["xiaoran liu", "qin lin", "sicco verwer", "dmitri jarnikov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09650"}
