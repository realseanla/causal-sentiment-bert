{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2013", "title": "Negation in the Head of CP-logic Rules", "abstract": "CP-logic is a probabilistic extension of the logic FO(ID). Unlike ASP, both of these logics adhere to a Tarskian informal semantics, in which interpretations represent objective states-of-affairs. In other words, these logics lack the epistemic component of ASP, in which interpretations represent the beliefs or knowledge of a rational agent. Consequently, neither CP-logic nor FO(ID) have the need for two kinds of negations: there is only one negation, and its meaning is that of objective falsehood. Nevertheless, the formal semantics of this objective negation is mathematically more similar to ASP's negation-as-failure than to its classical negation. The reason is that both CP-logic and FO(ID) have a constructive semantics in which all atoms start out as false, and may only become true as the result of a rule application. This paper investigates the possibility of adding the well-known ASP feature of allowing negation in the head of rules to CP-logic. Because CP-logic only has one kind of negation, it is of necessity this ''negation-as-failure like'' negation that will be allowed in the head. We investigate the intuitive meaning of such a construct and the benefits that arise from it.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:41:20 GMT  (22kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6156v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joost vennekens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6156"}
