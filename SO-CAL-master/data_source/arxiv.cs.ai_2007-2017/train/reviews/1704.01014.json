{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Apr-2017", "title": "An Ontological Architecture for Orbital Debris Data", "abstract": "The orbital debris problem presents an opportunity for inter-agency and international cooperation toward the mutually beneficial goals of debris prevention, mitigation, remediation, and improved space situational awareness (SSA). Achieving these goals requires sharing orbital debris and other SSA data. Toward this, I present an ontological architecture for the orbital debris domain, taking steps in the creation of an orbital debris ontology (ODO). The purpose of this ontological system is to (I) represent general orbital debris and SSA domain knowledge, (II) structure, and standardize where needed, orbital data and terminology, and (III) foster semantic interoperability and data-sharing. In doing so I hope to (IV) contribute to solving the orbital debris problem, improving peaceful global SSA, and ensuring safe space travel for future generations.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 21:26:37 GMT  (1012kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01014v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["robert j rovetto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01014"}
