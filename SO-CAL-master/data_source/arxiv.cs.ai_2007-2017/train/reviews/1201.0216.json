These smart communities promise to enable a number of innovative applications and services that will improve the quality of life. This position paper addresses some opportunities and challenges of building smart communities characterized by cyber-physical and social intelligence.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 31 Dec 2011 03:19:14 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0216v1", "ACM UBICOMP Symposium on Social and Community Intelligence (SCI), Beijing, China, September 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "ACM UBICOMP Symposium on Social and Community Intelligence (SCI), Beijing, China, September 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["feng xia", "jianhua ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.0216"}
