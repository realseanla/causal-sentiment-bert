The time extension is based on the hypothesis of bounded asynchrony: the computation takes a bounded period of time and is measured by a discrete global clock. Action prefixing is then considered as the syntactic marker which distinguishes a time instant from the next one. Supported by soft constraints instead of crisp ones, tell and ask agents are now equipped with a preference (or consistency) threshold which is used to determine their success or suspension. In the paper we provide a language to describe the agents behavior, together with its operational and denotational semantics, for which we also prove the compositionality and correctness properties. After presenting a semantics using maximal parallelism of actions, we also describe a version for their interleaving on a single processor (with maximal parallelism for time elapsing). Coordinating agents that need to take decisions both on preference values and time events may benefit from this language.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 12:23:38 GMT  (166kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0461v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 09:08:34 GMT  (166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0461v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["stefano bistarelli", "maurizio gabbrielli", "maria chiara meo", "francesco santini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0461"}
