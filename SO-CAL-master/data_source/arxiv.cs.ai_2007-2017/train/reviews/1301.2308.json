Although POMDPs are typically intractable, our formulation admits tractable solution. Instead of maintaining a value function over a high-dimensional set of belief states, we reduce the state space to one of smaller dimension, in which grid-based dynamic programming techniques are effective. We develop an error bound for the resulting approximation, and discuss an application of the model to a problem in targeted advertising.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:22 GMT  (1301kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2308v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paat rusmevichientong", "benjamin van roy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2308"}
