The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pseudorehearsal can increase performance of an actor-critic agent with neural-network based policy selection and function approximation in a pole balancing task and compare different pseudorehearsal approaches. We expect that pseudorehearsal assists learning even in such very simple problems, given proper initialization of the rehearsal parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 09:27:52 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04912v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marochko vladimir", "leonard johard", "manuel mazzara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04912"}
