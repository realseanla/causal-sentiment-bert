Having detailed the resulting sensitivity functions in our previous work, we now study the effect of parameter inaccuracies on a recommended decision in view of a threshold decision-making model. We detail the effect of varying a single and multiple parameters from a conditional probability table and present a computational procedure for establishing bounds between which assessments for these parameters can be varied without inducing a change in the recommended decision. We illustrate the various concepts involved by means of a real-life dynamic network in the field of infectious disease.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 15:39:01 GMT  (245kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6818v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CE", "authors": ["theodore charitos", "linda c van der gaag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6818"}
