Although certain OWL features (like owl:sameAs) are very popular, other features of OWL are largely neglected by publishers in the Linked Data world. This may suggest that despite the promise of easy implementations and the proposal of tractable profiles suggested in OWL's second version, there is still no \"right\" standard fragment for the Linked Data community. In this paper, we (1) analyse uptake of OWL on the Web of Data, (2) gain insights into the OWL fragment that is actually used/usable on the Web, where we arrive at the conclusion that this fragment is likely to be a simplified profile based on OWL RL, (3) propose and discuss such a new fragment, which we call OWL LD (for Linked Data).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 17:51:00 GMT  (346kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0984v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI", "authors": ["birte glimm", "aidan hogan", "markus kr\\\"otzsch", "axel polleres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.0984"}
