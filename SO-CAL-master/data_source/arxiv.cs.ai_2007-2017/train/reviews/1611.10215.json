Experimental results on an updated version of IEEE-RTS96 show high accuracy measured on operational cost, achieved in run-times that are lower in several orders of magnitude than the traditional approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 15:24:55 GMT  (2988kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10215v1", "Package contains both original article, and its supplementary material, in two separate files"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 19:29:49 GMT  (3058kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10215v2", "Package contains both original article, and its supplementary material, in two separate files"]], "COMMENTS": "Package contains both original article, and its supplementary material, in two separate files", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["gal dalal", "elad gilboa", "shie mannor", "louis wehenkel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.10215"}
