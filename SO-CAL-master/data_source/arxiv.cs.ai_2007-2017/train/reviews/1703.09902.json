A survey of NLG is timely in view of the changes that the field has undergone over the past decade or so, especially in relation to new (usually data-driven) methods, as well as new applications of NLG technology. This survey therefore aims to (a) give an up-to-date synthesis of research on the core tasks in NLG and the architectures adopted in which such tasks are organised; (b) highlight a number of relatively recent research topics that have arisen partly as a result of growing synergies between NLG and other areas of artificial intelligence; (c) draw attention to the challenges in NLG evaluation, relating them to similar challenges faced in other areas of Natural Language Processing, with an emphasis on different evaluation methods and the relationships between them.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 06:51:00 GMT  (3455kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09902v1", "111 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "111 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["albert gatt", "emiel krahmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09902"}
