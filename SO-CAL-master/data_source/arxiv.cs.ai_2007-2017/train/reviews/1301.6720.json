In this paper, we explore the problem of finding the optimal policy from a restricted set of policies, represented as finite state automata of a given size. This problem is also intractable, but we show that the complexity can be greatly reduced when the POMDP and/or policy are further constrained. We demonstrate good empirical results with a branch-and-bound method for finding globally optimal deterministic policies, and a gradient-ascent method for finding locally optimal stochastic policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:42 GMT  (387kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6720v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nicolas meuleau", "kee-eung kim", "leslie pack kaelbling", "anthony r cassandra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6720"}
