This concept incorporates the beneficial properties of both generalized neutrosophic set introduced by A.A. Salama [7]and soft set techniques proposed by Molodtsov [4]. We also study some properties of this concept. Some definitions and operations have been introduced on generalized neutrosophic soft set. Finally we present an application of generalized neuutrosophic soft set in decision making problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 May 2013 09:42:50 GMT  (178kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2724v1", "14 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["said broumi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2724"}
