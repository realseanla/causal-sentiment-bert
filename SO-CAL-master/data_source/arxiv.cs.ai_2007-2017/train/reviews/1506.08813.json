Argumentation semantics for PDL will allow for the application of argument game proof theories to the process of inference in PDL, making the reasons for accepting a conclusion transparent and the inference process more intuitive. This also opens up the possibility for argumentation-based distributed reasoning and communication amongst agents with PDL representations of mental attitudes.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 21:53:54 GMT  (253kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08813v1", "46 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 11:01:17 GMT  (253kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08813v2", "46 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "46 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anthony p young", "sanjay modgil", "odinaldo rodrigues"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08813"}
