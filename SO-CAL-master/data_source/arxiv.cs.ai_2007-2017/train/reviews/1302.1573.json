POMDPs are difficult to solve. This paper identifies a subclass of POMDPs called region observable POMDPs, which are easier to solve and can be used to approximate general POMDPs to arbitrary accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:30 GMT  (1407kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1573v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang", "wenju liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1573"}
