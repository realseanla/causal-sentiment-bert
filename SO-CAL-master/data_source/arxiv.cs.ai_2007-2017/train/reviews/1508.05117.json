Here we study random K-satisfiability for K = 3 and K = 4 by the Backtracking Survey Propagation algorithm. This algorithm is able to find, in a time linear in the problem size, solutions within a region never reached before, very close to SAT-UNSAT threshold, and even beyond the freezing threshold. For K = 3 the algorithmic threshold practically coincides with the SAT-UNSAT threshold. We also study the whitening process on all the solutions found by the Backtracking Survey Propagation algorithm: none contains frozen variables and the whitening procedure is able to remove all variables, following a two-steps process, in a time that diverges approaching the algorithmic threshold.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Aug 2015 20:41:29 GMT  (172kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05117v1", "9 pages, 9 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 17:00:45 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05117v2", "10 pages, 9 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 22:26:58 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05117v3", "10 pages, 9 figures. v2: data largely improved and manuscript rewritten"], ["v4", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 07:37:19 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05117v4", "11 pages, 10 figures. v2: data largely improved and manuscript rewritten"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["raffaele marino", "giorgio parisi", "federico ricci-tersenghi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.05117"}
