Multi-label classification is a superset of traditional binary and multi-class classification problems. The proposed work extends the extreme learning machine technique to adapt to the multi-label problems. As opposed to the single-label problem, both the number of labels the sample belongs to, and each of those target labels are to be identified for multi-label classification resulting in in-creased complexity. The proposed high speed multi-label classifier is applied to six benchmark datasets comprising of different application areas such as multi-media, text and biology. The training time and testing time of the classifier are compared with those of the state-of-the-arts methods. Experimental studies show that for all the six datasets, our proposed technique have faster execution speed and better performance, thereby outperforming all the existing multi-label clas-sification methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 14:56:12 GMT  (423kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08898v1", "12 pages, 2 figures, 10 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 2 figures, 10 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["meng joo er", "rajasekar venkatesan", "ning wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08898"}
