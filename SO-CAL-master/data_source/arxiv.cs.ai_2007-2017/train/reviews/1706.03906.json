There are already a few approaches for counting models over various types of constraints. Recently, hashing-based approaches achieve both theoretical guarantees and scalability, but still rely on solution enumeration. In this paper, a new probabilistic polynomial time approximate model counter is proposed, which is also a hashing-based universal framework, but with only satisfiability queries. A variant with a dynamic stopping criterion is also presented. Empirical evaluation over benchmarks on propositional logic formulas and SMT(BV) formulas shows that the approach is promising.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 05:26:02 GMT  (207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03906v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["cunjing ge", "feifei ma", "tian liu", "jian zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03906"}
