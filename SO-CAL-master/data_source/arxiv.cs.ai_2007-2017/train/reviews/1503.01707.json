Object creation generates new object identifiers in the result, that do not belong to the set of constants in the source database. The new object identifiers can be also seen as Skolem terms. Hence, object-creating conjunctive queries can also be regarded as restricted second-order tuple-generating dependencies (SO tgds), considered in the data exchange literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 17:47:04 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01707v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 14:59:40 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01707v2", "This revised version has been accepted on 11 January 2016 for publication in The VLDB Journal"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["angela bonifati", "werner nutt", "riccardo torlone", "jan van den bussche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01707"}
