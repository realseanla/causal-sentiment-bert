The dominant role that entropy maximization has obtained in this context is questioned by arguing that the minimum information principle on which it is based could be supplanted by an at least as plausible \"likelihood of evidence\" principle. We then review a method for turning given selection functions into representation independent variants, and discuss the tradeoffs involved in this transformation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:04:45 GMT  (290kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7387v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["manfred jaeger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7387"}
