Many algorithms for approximate inference with such models are based on sampling. From a logic programming perspective, sampling boils down to repeatedly calling the same queries on a knowledge base composed of a static part and a dynamic part. The larger the static part, the more redundancy there is in these repeated calls. This is problematic since inefficient sampling yields poor approximations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 17:01:34 GMT  (100kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5381v1", "17 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daan fierens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.5381"}
