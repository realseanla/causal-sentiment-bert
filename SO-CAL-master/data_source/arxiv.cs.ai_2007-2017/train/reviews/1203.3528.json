DecRSPI is designed to improve scalability and tackle problems that lack an explicit model. The algorithm uses Monte- Carlo methods to generate a sample of reachable belief states. Then it computes a joint policy for each belief state based on the rollout estimations. A new policy representation allows us to represent solutions compactly. The key benefits of the algorithm are its linear time complexity over the number of agents, its bounded memory usage and good solution quality. It can solve larger problems that are intractable for existing planning algorithms. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and scalability of the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (212kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3528v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["feng wu", "shlomo zilberstein", "xiaoping chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3528"}
