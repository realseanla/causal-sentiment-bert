Classical methods of file type detection including considering file extensions and magic bytes can be easily spoofed. Content-based file type detection is a newer way that is taken into account recently. In this paper, a new content-based method for the purpose of file type detection and file type clustering is proposed that is based on the PCA and neural networks. The proposed method has a good accuracy and is fast enough.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 10:18:07 GMT  (463kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3174v1", "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables"], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Jul 2011 14:02:13 GMT  (155kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3174v2", "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables"], ["v3", "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 21:31:17 GMT  (348kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3174v3", "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 Pages, 5 Figure, 2 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["m c amirani", "m toorani", "a a beheshti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.3174"}
