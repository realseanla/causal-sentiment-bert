We offer one version of equational semantics which is equivalent to CF2 semantics, and a better version which gives the same results as traditional Dung semantics for even loops but can still handle odd loops.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 15:45:31 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0220v1", "36 pages, version dated 15 February 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "36 pages, version dated 15 February 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["dov m gabbay"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.0220"}
