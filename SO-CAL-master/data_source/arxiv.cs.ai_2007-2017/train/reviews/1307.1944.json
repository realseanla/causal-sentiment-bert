{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jul-2013", "title": "READ-EVAL-PRINT in Parallel and Asynchronous Proof-checking", "abstract": "The LCF tradition of interactive theorem proving, which was started by Milner in the 1970-ies, appears to be tied to the classic READ-EVAL-PRINT-LOOP of sequential and synchronous evaluation of prover commands. We break up this loop and retrofit the read-eval-print phases into a model of parallel and asynchronous proof processing. Thus we explain some key concepts of the Isabelle/Scala approach to prover interaction and integration, and the Isabelle/jEdit Prover IDE as front-end technology. We hope to open up the scientific discussion about non-trivial interaction models for ITP systems again, and help getting other old-school proof assistants on a similar track.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 04:41:45 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1944v1", "In Proceedings UITP 2012,arXiv:1307.1528"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings UITP 2012,arXiv:1307.1528", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["makarius wenzel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1944"}
