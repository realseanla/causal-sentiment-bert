One of the important parameters in the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) is the frame skip rate. It decides the granularity at which agents can control game play. A frame skip value of $k$ allows the agent to repeat a selected action $k$ number of times. The current state of the art architectures like Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Dueling Network Architectures (DuDQN) consist of a framework with a static frame skip rate, where the action output from the network is repeated for a fixed number of frames regardless of the current state. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, Dynamic Frame skip Deep Q-Network (DFDQN) which makes the frame skip rate a dynamic learnable parameter. This allows us to choose the number of times an action is to be repeated based on the current state. We show empirically that such a setting improves the performance on relatively harder games like Seaquest.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 May 2016 20:58:41 GMT  (319kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05365v1", "6 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1506.08941by other authors"], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 01:04:13 GMT  (421kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.05365v2", "IJCAI 2016 Workshop on Deep Reinforcement Learning: Frontiers and Challenges; 6 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 8 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1506.08941by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["aravind s lakshminarayanan", "sahil sharma", "balaraman ravindran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.05365"}
