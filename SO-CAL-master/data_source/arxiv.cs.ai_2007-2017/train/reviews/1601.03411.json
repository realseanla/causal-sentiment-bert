This methodology naturally handles algorithms that do not always terminate, so it can (theoretically) be used with partial algorithms for undecidable problems, such as those found in artificial general intelligence (AGI) and automated theorem proving. We mention new approaches to self-improving AGI and logical uncertainty enabled by this methodology.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 21:17:42 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03411v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 28 Feb 2016 18:30:51 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03411v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 19:21:41 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03411v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 8 May 2016 00:52:51 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03411v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 01:30:46 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03411v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["andrew macfie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.03411"}
