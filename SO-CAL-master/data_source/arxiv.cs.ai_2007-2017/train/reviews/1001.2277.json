These can only be quantified using fuzzy sets. The aim of this paper is to solve a fuzzy linear programming problem in which the parameters involved are fuzzy quantities with logistic membership functions. To explore the applicability of the method a numerical example is considered to determine the monthly production planning quotas and profit of a home textile group.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:22:26 GMT  (687kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2277v1", "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["i elamvazuthi", "t ganesan", "p vasant", "j f webb"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.2277"}
