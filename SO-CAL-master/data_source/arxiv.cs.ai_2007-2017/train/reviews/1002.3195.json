For instance, by inducing similarity networks between movies rated similarly by users, or between documents containing common terms, and or between clinical trials involving the same themes, we can aim to find the global structure of connectivities underlying the data, and use the network as a basis to make connections between seemingly disparate entities. In the above applications, composing similarities between objects of interest finds uses in serendipitous recommendation, in storytelling, and in clinical diagnosis, respectively. We present an algorithmic framework for traversing similarity paths using the notion of `hammock' paths which are generalization of traditional paths. Our framework is exploratory in nature so that, given starting and ending objects of interest, it explores candidate objects for path following, and heuristics to admissibly estimate the potential for paths to lead to a desired destination. We present three diverse applications: exploring movie similarities in the Netflix dataset, exploring abstract similarities across the PubMed corpus, and exploring description similarities in a database of clinical trials. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of our approach for unstructured knowledge discovery in similarity networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 04:07:06 GMT  (2419kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3195v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["m shahriar hossain", "michael narayan", "naren ramakrishnan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.3195"}
