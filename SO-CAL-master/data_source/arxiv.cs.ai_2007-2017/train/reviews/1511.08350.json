Many efficient specialized methods have been developed but they are all suffering from a lack of genericity. The Constraint Programming (CP) approaches are not so effective because of the size of their encodings. In[7], we have proposed the global constraint Prefix-Projection for SPM which remedies to this drawback. However, this global constraint cannot be directly extended to support gap constraint. In this paper, we propose the global constraint GAP-SEQ enabling to handle SPM with or without gap constraint. GAP-SEQ relies on the principle of right pattern extensions. Experiments show that our approach clearly outperforms both CP approaches and the state-of-the-art cSpade method on large datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 10:45:34 GMT  (598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08350v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amina kemmar", "samir loudni", "yahia lebbah", "patrice boizumault", "thierry charnois"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08350"}
