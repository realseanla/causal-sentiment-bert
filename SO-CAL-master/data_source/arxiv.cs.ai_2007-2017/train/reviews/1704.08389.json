This paper conducts an investigation on how the public perceives the progress of AI by utilizing the data shared on Twitter. Specifically, this paper performs a comparative analysis on the understanding of users from two categories -- general AI-Tweeters (AIT) and the expert AI-Tweeters (EAIT) who share posts about AI on Twitter. Our analysis revealed that users from both the categories express distinct emotions and interests towards AI. Users from both the categories regard AI as positive and are optimistic about the progress of AI but the experts are more negative than the general AI-Tweeters. Characterization of users manifested that `London' is the popular location of users from where they tweet about AI. Tweets posted by AIT are highly retweeted than posts made by EAIT that reveals greater diffusion of information from AIT.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 00:37:05 GMT  (1243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08389v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 02:06:08 GMT  (1243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08389v2", "New results atarXiv:1709.09534"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["lydia manikonda", "cameron dudley", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08389"}
