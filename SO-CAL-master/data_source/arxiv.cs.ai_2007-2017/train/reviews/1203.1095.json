However, existing infrastructure for defining search heuristics is often inadequate. Either modeling capabilities are extremely limited or users are faced with a general-purpose programming language whose features are not tailored towards writing search heuristics. As a result, major improvements in performance may remain unexplored.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 03:59:34 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1095v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tom schrijvers", "guido tack", "pieter wuille", "horst samulowitz", "peter j stuckey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.1095"}
