{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Feb-2010", "title": "Rewriting Constraint Models with Metamodels", "abstract": "An important challenge in constraint programming is to rewrite constraint models into executable programs calculat- ing the solutions. This phase of constraint processing may require translations between constraint programming lan- guages, transformations of constraint representations, model optimizations, and tuning of solving strategies. In this paper, we introduce a pivot metamodel describing the common fea- tures of constraint models including different kinds of con- straints, statements like conditionals and loops, and other first-class elements like object classes and predicates. This metamodel is general enough to cope with the constructions of many languages, from object-oriented modeling languages to logic languages, but it is independent from them. The rewriting operations manipulate metamodel instances apart from languages. As a consequence, the rewriting operations apply whatever languages are selected and they are able to manage model semantic information. A bridge is created between the metamodel space and languages using parsing techniques. Tools from the software engineering world can be useful to implement this framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2010 07:26:48 GMT  (215kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3023v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["raphael chenouard", "laurent granvilliers", "ricardo soto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.3023"}
