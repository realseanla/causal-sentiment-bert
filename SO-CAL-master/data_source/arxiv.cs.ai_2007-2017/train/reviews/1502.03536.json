{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Feb-2015", "title": "Speeding up Permutation Testing in Neuroimaging", "abstract": "Multiple hypothesis testing is a significant problem in nearly all neuroimaging studies. In order to correct for this phenomena, we require a reliable estimate of the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER). The well known Bonferroni correction method, while simple to implement, is quite conservative, and can substantially under-power a study because it ignores dependencies between test statistics. Permutation testing, on the other hand, is an exact, non-parametric method of estimating the FWER for a given $\\alpha$-threshold, but for acceptably low thresholds the computational burden can be prohibitive. In this paper, we show that permutation testing in fact amounts to populating the columns of a very large matrix ${\\bf P}$. By analyzing the spectrum of this matrix, under certain conditions, we see that ${\\bf P}$ has a low-rank plus a low-variance residual decomposition which makes it suitable for highly sub--sampled --- on the order of $0.5\\%$ --- matrix completion methods. Based on this observation, we propose a novel permutation testing methodology which offers a large speedup, without sacrificing the fidelity of the estimated FWER. Our evaluations on four different neuroimaging datasets show that a computational speedup factor of roughly $50\\times$ can be achieved while recovering the FWER distribution up to very high accuracy. Further, we show that the estimated $\\alpha$-threshold is also recovered faithfully, and is stable.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 04:30:06 GMT  (534kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03536v1", "NIPS 13"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 13", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.CO cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["chris hinrichs", "vamsi k ithapu", "qinyuan sun", "sterling c johnson", "vikas singh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.03536"}
