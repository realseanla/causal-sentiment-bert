Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) in particular have been shown to be efficient in solving high dimensional problems. Even though several RRT variants have been proposed for dynamic replanning, these methods only perform well in environments with infrequent changes. This paper addresses the dynamic path planning problem by combining simple techniques in a multi-stage probabilistic algorithm. This algorithm uses RRTs for initial planning and informed local search for navigation. We show that this combination of simple techniques provides better responses to highly dynamic environments than the RRT extensions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 20:55:01 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0224v1", "7 pages, 5 figures.
