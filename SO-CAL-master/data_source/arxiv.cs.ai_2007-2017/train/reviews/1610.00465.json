The motive is to improve the accuracy in unstable classification and regression methods. One of the most well known method in this group is Bagging. Arcing or Adaptive Resampling and Combining methods like AdaBoost are smarter variants of P&amp;C methods. In this extended abstract, we lay the groundwork for a new family of methods under the P&amp;C umbrella, known as Evolutionary Sampling (ES). We employ Evolutionary algorithms to suggest smarter sampling in both the feature space (sub-spaces) as well as training samples. We discuss multiple fitness functions to assess ensembles and empirically compare our performance against randomized sampling of training data and feature sub-spaces.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 09:53:06 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00465v1", "3 pages, 1 table, Data Efficient Machine Learning Workshop (DEML'16), ICML"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 1 table, Data Efficient Machine Learning Workshop (DEML'16), ICML", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["harsh nisar", "bhanu pratap singh rawat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00465"}
