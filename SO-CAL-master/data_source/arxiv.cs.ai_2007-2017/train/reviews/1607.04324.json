In this paper, we present the random key cuckoo search (RKCS) algorithm for solving the famous Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). We used a simplified random-key encoding scheme to pass from a continuous space (real numbers) to a combinatorial space. We also consider the displacement of a solution in both spaces using Levy flights. The performance of the proposed RKCS is tested against a set of benchmarks of symmetric TSP from the well-known TSPLIB library. The results of the tests show that RKCS is superior to some other metaheuristic algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Apr 2016 12:40:50 GMT  (776kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04324v1", "13 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["aziz ouaarab", "b ahiod", "xin-she yang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.04324"}
