Advances in ASP solving technology are customarily assessed in competition events, as it happens for other closely-related problemsolving technologies such as SAT/SMT, QBF, Planning and Scheduling etc. ASP Competitions are (usually) biennial events, but the 5th edition departs from this tradition in order to be present in the FLoC Olympic Games of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) 2014, which will be the largest event in the history of logic.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 22:15:50 GMT  (74kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3710v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 16 May 2014 07:35:23 GMT  (74kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3710v2", "10 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 26 May 2014 05:01:26 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3710v3", "10 pages"], ["v4", "Tue, 3 Jun 2014 17:16:36 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3710v4", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["francesco calimeri", "martin gebser", "marco maratea", "francesco ricca"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3710"}
