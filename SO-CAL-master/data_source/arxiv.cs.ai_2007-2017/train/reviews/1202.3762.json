While previous work has addressed automated decision-theoretic planning for DCMDPs, optimal solutions have only been defined so far for limited settings, e.g., DC-MDPs having hyper-rectangular piecewise linear value functions. In this work, we extend symbolic dynamic programming (SDP) techniques to provide optimal solutions for a vastly expanded class of DCMDPs. To address the inherent combinatorial aspects of SDP, we introduce the XADD - a continuous variable extension of the algebraic decision diagram (ADD) - that maintains compact representations of the exact value function. Empirically, we demonstrate an implementation of SDP with XADDs on various DC-MDPs, showing the first optimal automated solutions to DCMDPs with linear and nonlinear piecewise partitioned value functions and showing the advantages of constraint-based pruning for XADDs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (837kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3762v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["scott sanner", "karina valdivia delgado", "leliane nunes de barros"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3762"}
