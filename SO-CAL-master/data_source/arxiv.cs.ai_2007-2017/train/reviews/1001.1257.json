Their main goal is the production of an appropriate and adaptive response to a cognitive or behavioral task. Different strategies of response production can be adopted, among which haphazard trials, formation of mental schemes and heuristics. In this paper, we propose a model of Boolean neural network that incorporates these strategies by recurring to global optimization strategies during the learning session. The model characterizes as well the passage from an unstructured/chaotic attractor neural network typical of data-driven processes to a faster one, forward-only and representative of schema-driven processes. Moreover, a simplified version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) is introduced in order to test the model. Our results match with experimental data and point out some relevant knowledge coming from psychological domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Jan 2010 12:34:04 GMT  (104kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1257v1", "11 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["graziano barnabei", "franco bagnoli", "ciro conversano", "elena lensi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.1257"}
