Software size is an important metric in determining the effort, cost, and productivity. Today, source lines of code and function point are the most used sizing metrics. Backfiring is a well-known technique for converting between function points and source lines of code. However when backfiring is used, there is a high margin of error. This study introduces a method to improve the accuracy of backfiring. Intelligent systems have been used in software prediction models to improve performance over traditional techniques. For this reason, a hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy is used because it takes advantages of the neural networks learning and fuzzy logic human-like reasoning. This paper describes an improved backfiring technique which uses Neuro-Fuzzy and compares the new method against the default conversion ratios currently used by software practitioners.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 15:40:44 GMT  (180kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06191v1", "International Conference on Soft Computing, Intelligent System and Information Technology, Bali, Indonesia, pp. 12-17, 2007"]], "COMMENTS": "International Conference on Soft Computing, Intelligent System and Information Technology, Bali, Indonesia, pp. 12-17, 2007", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["justin wong", "danny ho", "luiz fernando capretz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06191"}
