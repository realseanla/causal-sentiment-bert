Typically, natural user instructions are high-level and can be reduced into low-level tasks expressed in common verbs (e.g., `take', `get', `put'). For robots understanding such instructions, one of the key challenges is to process high-level user instructions and achieve the specified tasks with robots' primitive actions. To address this, we propose novel algorithms by utilizing semantic roles of common verbs defined in semantic dictionaries and integrating multiple open knowledge to generate task plans. Specifically, we present a new method for matching and recovering semantics of user instructions and a novel task planner that exploits functional knowledge of robot's action model. To verify and evaluate our approach, we implemented a prototype system using knowledge from several open resources. Experiments on our system confirmed the correctness and efficiency of our algorithms. Notably, our system has been deployed in the KeJia robot, which participated the annual RoboCup@Home competitions in the past three years and achieved encouragingly high scores in the benchmark tests.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 09:02:16 GMT  (1038kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02877v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["dongcai lu", "feng wu", "xiaoping chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02877"}
