After a state of the art about the coordination models and their possible applications to disaster management, we give an overview of the tsunami plan of Ho Chi Minh City and then its graphical representation with BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). We then show how to exploit it with workflow tools to simulate (YAWL language) and analyse it (PROM tool)", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 16:29:52 GMT  (1541kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4851v1", "7 pages.
