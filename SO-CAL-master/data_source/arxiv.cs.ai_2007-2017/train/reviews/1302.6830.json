Techniques are presented for handling various types of complicating plan features. These include plans with context-dependent consequences, indirect consequences, actions with preconditions that must be true during the execution of an action, contingencies, multiple levels of abstraction multiple execution agents with partially-ordered and temporally overlapping actions, and plans which reference specific times and time durations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:18 GMT  (912kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6830v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul e lehner", "christopher elsaesser", "scott a musman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6830"}
