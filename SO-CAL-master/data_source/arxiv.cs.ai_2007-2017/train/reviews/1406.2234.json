Inspired by broken sidewalks during on-campus construction projects, we develop two models for navigating this \"unreliable network.\" These are based on a concept of \"accumulating risk\" backward from the destination, and both operate on directed acyclic graphs with a probability of failure associated with each edge. The first serves to introduce and has faults addressed by the second, more conservative model. Next, we show a paradox when these models are used to construct polynomials on conceptual networks, such as design processes and software development life cycles. When the risk of a network increases uniformly, the most reliable path changes from wider and longer to shorter and narrower. If we let professional inexperience--such as with entry level cooks and software developers--represent probability of edge failure, does this change in path imply that the novice should follow instructions with fewer \"back-up\" plans, yet those with alternative routes should be followed by the expert?", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 16:14:04 GMT  (63kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2234v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["bryan knowles", "mustafa atici"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2234"}
