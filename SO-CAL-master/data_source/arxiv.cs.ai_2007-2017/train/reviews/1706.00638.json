Human brain not only analyses these data but also starts synthesizing new information from the existing data. The current age Big-data systems are needed not just to analyze data but also to come up new interpretation. We believe that the pivotal ability in human brain which enables us to do this is what is known as \"intuition\". Here, we present an intuition based architecture for big data analysis and synthesis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 11:35:52 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00638v1", "This paper is presented in the Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture Conference 2017 and published by their proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper is presented in the Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture Conference 2017 and published by their proceedings", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amit kumar mishra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00638"}
