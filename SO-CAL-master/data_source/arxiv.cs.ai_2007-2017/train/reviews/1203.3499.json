We present a novel delayed column generation algorithm and provide empirical evidence that the algorithm efficiently computes k-bounded MAP states for meaningful real-world graph matching problems. The underlying idea is that, instead of solving one large optimization problem, it is often more efficient to tackle several small ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (178kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3499v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mathias niepert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3499"}
