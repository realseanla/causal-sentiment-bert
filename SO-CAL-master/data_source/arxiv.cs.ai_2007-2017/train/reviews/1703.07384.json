It is based on principles of Data Mining for analyzing web data. Data Mining first adapts integration of data to generate warehouse. Then, it extracts useful information with the help of algorithm. The task of representing extracted documents is done by using Vector Based Statistical Approach that represents each document in set of Terms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:34:34 GMT  (2599kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07384v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["vishal jain", "dr mayank singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07384"}
