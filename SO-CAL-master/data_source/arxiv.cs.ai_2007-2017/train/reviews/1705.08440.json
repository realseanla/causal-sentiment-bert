We discuss some general assumptions underlying the project. Further, the requirements for a user-friendly computer assistant are specified along with the nature of tools aiding the researcher. Next we show some aspects of belief network approach and Dempster-Shafer (DST) methodology introduced in practice to system SEAD. Specifically we present the application of DS methodology to belief revision problem. Further a concept of an interface to probabilistic and DS belief networks enabling a user to understand the communication with a belief network based reasoning system is presented", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 17:51:58 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08440v1", "Intelligent Information Systems Proceedings of a Workshop held in August\\'ow, Poland, 7-11 June, 1993, pages 210- 238"]], "COMMENTS": "Intelligent Information Systems Proceedings of a Workshop held in August\\'ow, Poland, 7-11 June, 1993, pages 210- 238", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m michalewicz", "s t wierzcho\\'n", "m a k{\\l}opotek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08440"}
