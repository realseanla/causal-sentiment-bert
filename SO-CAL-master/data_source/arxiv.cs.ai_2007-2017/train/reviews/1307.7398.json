We address this shortcoming and show how a recently developed reactive ASP system can be harnessed to provide appropriate reasoning capacities within a robotic system. To be more precise, we furnish a package integrating the reactive ASP solver oClingo with the popular open-source robotic middleware ROS. The resulting system, ROSoClingo, provides a generic way by which an ASP program can be used to control the behaviour of a robot and to respond to the results of the robot's actions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jul 2013 20:10:51 GMT  (353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7398v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["benjamin", "res", "philipp obermeier", "orkunt sabuncu", "torsten schaub", "david rajaratnam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7398"}
