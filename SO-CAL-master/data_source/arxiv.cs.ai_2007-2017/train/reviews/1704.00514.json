Although important in practice, this task is so far underexplored, partly due to the lack of labelled data. To overcome this, we explore several auxiliary tasks, including semantic super-sense tagging and identification of multi-word expressions, and cast the task as a multi-task learning problem with deep recurrent neural networks. Our multi-task models perform significantly better than previous state of the art approaches on two scientific KBC datasets, particularly for long keyphrases.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 10:25:22 GMT  (19kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00514v1", "ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 16:48:49 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00514v2", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["isabelle augenstein", "anders s\u00f8gaard"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.00514"}
