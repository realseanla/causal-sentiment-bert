It is reasoned that in classification problem arising in an information system (represented by information table), a novel set called Granular set naturally arises. It is realized that in any hierarchical classification problem, Granular set naturally arises. Also when the target set of objects forms a graded set the lower and upper approximations of target sets form a graded set. This generalizes the concept of rough set. It is hoped that a detailed theory of granular/ graded sets finds several applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 11:26:32 GMT  (397kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4324v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["garimella rama murthy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4324"}
