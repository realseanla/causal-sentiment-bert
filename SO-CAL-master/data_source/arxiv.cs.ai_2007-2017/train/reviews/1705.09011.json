{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-May-2017", "title": "Principled Hybrids of Generative and Discriminative Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "We propose a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that blends both generative and discriminative modeling in a principled way. By maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods, models derived from this framework can use both labeled instances from the source domain as well as unlabeled instances from both source and target domains. Under this framework, we show that the popular reconstruction loss of autoencoder corresponds to an upper bound of the negative marginal log-likelihoods of unlabeled instances, where marginal distributions are given by proper kernel density estimations. This provides a way to interpret the empirical success of autoencoders in domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning. We instantiate our framework using neural networks, and build a concrete model, DAuto. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DAuto on text, image and speech datasets, showing that it outperforms related competitors when domain adaptation is possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 01:02:16 GMT  (1121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09011v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Oct 2017 19:29:31 GMT  (1122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09011v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["han zhao", "zhenyao zhu", "junjie hu", "adam coates", "geoff gordon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09011"}
