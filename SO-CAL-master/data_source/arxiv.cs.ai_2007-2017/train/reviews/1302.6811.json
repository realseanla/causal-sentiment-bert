We present a subset of probability logic sufficient for representing the class of Bayesian networks with discrete-valued nodes. We impose constraints on the form of the sentences that guarantee that the knowledge base contains all the probabilistic information necessary to generate a network. We define the concept of d-separation for knowledge bases and prove that a knowledge base with independence conditions defined by d-separation is a complete specification of a probability distribution. We present a network generation algorithm that, given an inference problem in the form of a query Q and a set of evidence E, generates a network to compute P(Q|E). We prove the algorithm to be correct.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:25 GMT  (826kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6811v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter haddawy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6811"}
