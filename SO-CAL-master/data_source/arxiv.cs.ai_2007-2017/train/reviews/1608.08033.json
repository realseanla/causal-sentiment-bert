In order to provide a foundation for human knowledge representation and reasoning in the presence of vagueness, imprecision, and uncertainty, fuzzy logic should have the ability to deal with linguistic hedges, which play a very important role in the modification of fuzzy predicates. In this paper, we extend fuzzy logic in narrow sense with graded syntax, introduced by Novak et al., with many hedge connectives. In one case, each hedge does not have any dual one. In the other case, each hedge can have its own dual one. The resulting logics are shown to also have the Pavelka-style completeness", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 12:55:15 GMT  (23kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08033v1", "10 pages, International Journal of Computer Science &amp; Information Technology (IJCSIT) Vol 8, No 3, June 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, International Journal of Computer Science &amp; Information Technology (IJCSIT) Vol 8, No 3, June 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["van hung le"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08033"}
