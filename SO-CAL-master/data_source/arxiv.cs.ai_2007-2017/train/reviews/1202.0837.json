The goal is to better understand how we can develop intelligence tests that can evaluate social intelligence. We analyse several reinforcement algorithms in several contexts of cooperation and competition. Our experimental setting is inspired by the recently developed Darwin-Wallace distribution.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 22:38:04 GMT  (223kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.0837v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["javier insa-cabrera", "jose-luis benacloch-ayuso", "jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.0837"}
