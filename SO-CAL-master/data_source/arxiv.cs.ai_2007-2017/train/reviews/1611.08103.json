In this paper, we first present the $\\gamma-$fuzzy covering based probabilistic and grade approximation operators and double-quantitative approximation operators. We also study the relationships among the three types of $\\gamma-$fuzzy covering based approximation operators. Second, we propose the $\\gamma^{\\ast}-$fuzzy coverings based multi-granulation probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators and multi-granulation double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. We also investigate the relationships among these types of $\\gamma-$fuzzy coverings based approximation operators. Finally, we employ several examples to illustrate how to construct the lower and upper approximations of fuzzy sets with the absolute and relative quantitative information.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 09:06:57 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08103v1", "It enriches the fuzzy covering rough set theory"]], "COMMENTS": "It enriches the fuzzy covering rough set theory", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guangming lang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08103"}
