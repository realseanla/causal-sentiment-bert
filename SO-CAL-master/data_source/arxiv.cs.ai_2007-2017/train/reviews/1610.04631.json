In null space based LDA (NLDA), a well-known LDA extension, between-class distance is maximized in the null space of the within-class scatter matrix. However, there are some limitations in NLDA. Firstly, for many data sets, null space of within-class scatter matrix does not exist, thus NLDA is not applicable to those datasets. Secondly, NLDA uses arithmetic mean of between-class distances and gives equal consideration to all between-class distances, which makes larger between-class distances can dominate the result and thus limits the performance of NLDA. In this paper, we propose a harmonic mean based Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multi-Class Discriminant Analysis (MCDA), for image classification, which minimizes the reciprocal of weighted harmonic mean of pairwise between-class distance. More importantly, MCDA gives higher priority to maximize small between-class distances. MCDA can be extended to multi-label dimension reduction. Results on 7 single-label data sets and 4 multi-label data sets show that MCDA has consistently better performance than 10 other single-label approaches and 4 other multi-label approaches in terms of classification accuracy, macro and micro average F1 score.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 20:36:57 GMT  (1784kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04631v1", "IEEE 28th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 16:38:29 GMT  (221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04631v2", "IEEE 28th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE 28th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["shuai zheng", "feiping nie", "chris ding", "heng huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04631"}
