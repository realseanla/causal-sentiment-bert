Subtask A addresses the challenge of rumour stance classification, which involves identifying the attitude of Twitter users towards the truthfulness of the rumour they are discussing. Stance classification is considered to be an important step towards rumour verification, therefore performing well in this task is expected to be useful in debunking false rumours. In this work we classify a set of Twitter posts discussing rumours into either supporting, denying, questioning or commenting on the underlying rumours. We propose a LSTM-based sequential model that, through modelling the conversational structure of tweets, which achieves an accuracy of 0.784 on the RumourEval test set outperforming all other systems in Subtask A.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 13:41:25 GMT  (149kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07221v1", "SemEval 2017 RumourEval: Determining rumour veracity and support for rumours (SemEval 2017 Task 8, Subtask A)"]], "COMMENTS": "SemEval 2017 RumourEval: Determining rumour veracity and support for rumours (SemEval 2017 Task 8, Subtask A)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["elena kochkina", "maria liakata", "isabelle augenstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07221"}
