There is a need to automatically recognize the activities performed by walker users to better understand activity patterns, mobility issues and the context in which falls are more likely to happen. We design and compare several techniques to recognize walker related activities. A comprehensive evaluation with control subjects and walker users from a retirement community is presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (599kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3500v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["farheen omar", "mathieu sinn", "jakub truszkowski", "pascal poupart", "james tung", "allen caine"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3500"}
