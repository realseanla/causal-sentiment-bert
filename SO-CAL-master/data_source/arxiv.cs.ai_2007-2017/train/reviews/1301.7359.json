It presents several syntactic combination rules to merge possibilistic knowledge bases, provided by different sources, into a new possibilistic knowledge base. These combination rules are first described at the meta-level outside the language of possibilistic logic. Next, an extension of possibilistic logic, where the combination rules are inside the language, is proposed. A proof system in a sequent form, which is sound and complete with respect to the possibilistic logic semantics, is given.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:23 GMT  (403kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7359v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["salem benferhat", "claudio sossai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7359"}
