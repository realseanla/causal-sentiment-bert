International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition, ICDAR 2015. The task comprises the recognition of historical handwritten documents. The core algorithms of our system are based on multi-dimensional recurrent neural networks (MDRNN) and connectionist temporal classification (CTC). The software modules behind that as well as the basic utility technologies are essentially powered by PLANET's ARGUS framework for intelligent text recognition and image processing.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 May 2016 19:19:43 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08412v1", "Description of CITlab's System for the HTRtS 2015 Task : Handwritten Text Recognition on the tranScriptorium Dataset"]], "COMMENTS": "Description of CITlab's System for the HTRtS 2015 Task : Handwritten Text Recognition on the tranScriptorium Dataset", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["gundram leifert", "tobias strau{\\ss}", "tobias gr\\\"uning", "roger labahn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08412"}
