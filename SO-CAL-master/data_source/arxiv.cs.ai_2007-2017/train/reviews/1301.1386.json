First we describe a sorted version of CR-Prolog called SPARC. Second, we translate a basic version of the CR-Prolog into the language of DLV and compare the performance with the state of the art CR-Prolog solver. The results form the foundation for future more efficient and user friendly implementation of SPARC and shed some light on the relationship between two useful knowledge representation constructs: consistency restoring rules and weak constraints of DLV.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:00 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1386v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["evgenii balai", "michael gelfond", "yuanlin zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1386"}
