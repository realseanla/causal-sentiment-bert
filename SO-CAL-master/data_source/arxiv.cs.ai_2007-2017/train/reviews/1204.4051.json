We are still lacking a profound understanding of appropriate solution representations and effective neighborhood structures. Clearly, both the delivery volumes and the routing aspects of the alternatives need to be reflected in an encoding, and must be modified when searching by means of local search. Our work contributes to the better understanding of such solution representations. On the basis of an experimental investigation, the advantages and drawbacks of two encodings are studied and compared.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 11:32:07 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4051v1", "Proceedings of EU/ME 2012, Workshop on Metaheuristics for Global Challenges, May 10-11, 2012, Copenhagen, Denmark"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of EU/ME 2012, Workshop on Metaheuristics for Global Challenges, May 10-11, 2012, Copenhagen, Denmark", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thibaut barth\\'elemy", "martin josef geiger", "marc sevaux"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4051"}
