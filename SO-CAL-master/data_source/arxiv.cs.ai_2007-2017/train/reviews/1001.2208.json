This has limited the effectiveness of these systems. In this position paper two ways in which AISs could be made more biologically realistic are discussed. We propose that AISs should draw their inspiration from organisms which possess only innate immune systems, and that AISs should employ systemic models of the immune system to structure their overall design. An outline of plant and invertebrate immune systems is presented, and a number of contemporary research that more biologically-realistic AISs could have is also discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 15:45:07 GMT  (181kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2208v1", "12 pages, 6th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS2007), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4628, Santos, Brazil"], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Mar 2010 15:03:09 GMT  (181kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2208v2", "12 pages, 6th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS2007), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4628, Santos, Brazil"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 6th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS2007), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 4628, Santos, Brazil", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["jamie twycross", "uwe aickelin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.2208"}
