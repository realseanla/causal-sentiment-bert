To reduce the computational cost of planning in these domains, we execute actions as we construct the plan, and sacrifice optimality by searching to a fixed depth and using a heuristic function to estimate the value of states. Although this paper concentrates on the search algorithm, we also discuss ways of constructing heuristic functions suitable for this approach. Our results show that by interleaving search and execution, close to optimal policies can be found without the computational requirements of other approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:15:13 GMT  (1122kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6799v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["richard dearden", "craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6799"}
