It would only be natural to try to progress from verification, model checking or testing a system against its formal specification into constructing it automatically. Classical algorithmic synthesis theory provides interesting algorithms but also alarming high complexity and undecidability results. The use of genetic programming, in combination with model checking and testing, provides a powerful heuristic to synthesize programs. The method is not completely automatic, as it is fine tuned by a user that sets up the specification and parameters. It also does not guarantee to always succeed and converge towards a solution that satisfies all the required properties. However, we applied it successfully on quite nontrivial examples and managed to find solutions to hard programming challenges, as well as to improve and to correct code. We describe here several versions of our method for synthesizing sequential and concurrent systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 03:45:20 GMT  (162kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6785v1", "In Proceedings INFINITY 2013,arXiv:1402.6610"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings INFINITY 2013,arXiv:1402.6610", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["gal katz", "doron peled"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.6785"}
