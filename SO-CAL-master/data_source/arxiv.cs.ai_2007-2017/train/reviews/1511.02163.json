By exploiting submodularity, we are able to give hardness results and approximation algorithms for optimizing over such metrics. Additionally, we demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of these metrics and associated algorithms on both a metric minimization task (a form of clustering) and also a metric maximization task (generating diverse k-best lists).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 17:13:32 GMT  (1353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02163v1", "15 pages, 1 figure, a short version of this will appear in the NIPS 2015 conference"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 1 figure, a short version of this will appear in the NIPS 2015 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["jennifer gillenwater", "rishabh k iyer", "bethany lusch", "rahul kidambi", "jeff a bilmes"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.02163"}
