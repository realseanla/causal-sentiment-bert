We propose to use a pretrained convnet feature, a concatenated feature vector using activations of feature maps of multiple layers in a trained convolutional network. We show that how this convnet feature can serve as a general-purpose music representation. In the experiment, a convnet is trained for music tagging and then transferred for many music-related classification and regression tasks as well as an audio-related classification task. In experiments, the convnet feature outperforms the baseline MFCC feature in all tasks and many reported approaches of aggregating MFCCs and low- and high-level music features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 16:48:03 GMT  (3787kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09179v1", "16 pages, single column, NOT iclr submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 15:58:38 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09179v2", "To appear at 18th International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, 2017"], ["v3", "Sat, 15 Jul 2017 13:36:05 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09179v3", "18th International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, Suzhou, China, 2017"], ["v4", "Wed, 13 Sep 2017 16:20:26 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09179v4", "18th International Society of Music Information Retrieval (ISMIR) Conference, Suzhou, China, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, single column, NOT iclr submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.MM cs.SD", "authors": ["keunwoo choi", "gy\\\"orgy fazekas", "mark sandler", "kyunghyun cho"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09179"}
