The problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. As for many intractable problems, techniques from the field of artificial intelligence are useful in finding solutions close to optimum for large inputs. An evolutionary algorithm for solving the debts' clearing problem is proposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Feb 2014 14:39:57 GMT  (187kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6556v1", "13 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["csaba patcas", "attila bartha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.6556"}
