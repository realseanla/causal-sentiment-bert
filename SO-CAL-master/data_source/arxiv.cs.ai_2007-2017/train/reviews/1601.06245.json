By employing the persuasion techniques, the PTA seeks to maintain the student in a high motivation and high ability state in which he or she has higher cognitive ability and his or her changes in attitudes are more persistent. However, the existing model of the PTA still has a few limitations. Firstly, the existing PTA model focuses on modelling the PTA's ability to persuade, while does not model its ability to be taught by the student and to practice the knowledge it has learnt. Secondly, the quantitative model for computational processes in the PTA has low reusability. Thirdly, there is still a gap between theoretical models and practical implementation of the PTA.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 23 Jan 2016 07:29:20 GMT  (4162kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06245v1", "This is a book draft"]], "COMMENTS": "This is a book draft", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["zhiwei zeng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06245"}
