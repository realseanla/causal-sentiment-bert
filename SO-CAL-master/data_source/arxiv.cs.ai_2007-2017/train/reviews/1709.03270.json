We introduce the foundation of an opinion mining approach with the definition of pattern and support measure. The support measure is derived from the commitment definition. A new algorithm called OpMiner that extracts the set of frequent opinions modelled as a mass functions is detailed. Finally, we apply our approach on a real-world biomedical database that stores opinions of experts to evaluate the reliability level of biomedical data. Performance analysis showed a better quality patterns for our proposed model in comparison with literature-based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:23:00 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03270v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["ahmed samet", "thomas guyet", "benjamin negrevergne", "tien-tuan dao", "tuan nha hoang", "marie-christine ho ba tho"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03270"}
