We have adapted the TOPSIS description from existing Fuzzy theory literature and distilled the bare minimum concepts required for understanding and applying TOPSIS. An example has been worked out to illustrate the application of TOPSIS for a multi-criteria group decision making scenario.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 May 2012 06:21:54 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5098v1", "3 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 3 Jun 2017 07:18:30 GMT  (7kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5098v2", "3 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["balwinder sodhi", "prabhakar t v"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.5098"}
