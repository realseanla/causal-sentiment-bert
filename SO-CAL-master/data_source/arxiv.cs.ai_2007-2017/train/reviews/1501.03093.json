Our models are described in PRISM, and our tool uses the existing interface and simulator of PRISM. Our tool extends PRISM by adding novel algorithms for multiple mean-payoff objectives, and also provides features such as (i)~generating strategies and exploring them for simulation, and checking them with respect to other properties; and (ii)~generating an approximate Pareto curve for two mean-payoff objectives. In addition, we present a new practical algorithm for the analysis of MDPs with multiple mean-payoff objectives under memoryless strategies.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 18:04:46 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03093v1", "Extended version for a TACAS 2015 tool demo paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version for a TACAS 2015 tool demo paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["tom\\'a\\v{s} br\\'azdil", "krishnendu chatterjee", "vojt\\v{e}ch forejt", "anton\\'in ku\\v{c}era"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03093"}
