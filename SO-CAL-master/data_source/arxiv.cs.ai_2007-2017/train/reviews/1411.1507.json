{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Nov-2014", "title": "Scalable Parallel Numerical CSP Solver", "abstract": "We present a parallel solver for numerical constraint satisfaction problems (NCSPs) that can scale on a number of cores. Our proposed method runs worker solvers on the available cores and simultaneously the workers cooperate for the search space distribution and balancing. In the experiments, we attained up to 119-fold speedup using 256 cores of a parallel computer.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 06:33:17 GMT  (2104kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1507v1", "The final publication is available at Springer"]], "COMMENTS": "The final publication is available at Springer", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["daisuke ishii", "kazuki yoshizoe", "toyotaro suzumura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.1507"}
