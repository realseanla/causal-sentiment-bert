{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Apr-2012", "title": "Large-Scale Automatic Labeling of Video Events with Verbs Based on Event-Participant Interaction", "abstract": "We present an approach to labeling short video clips with English verbs as event descriptions. A key distinguishing aspect of this work is that it labels videos with verbs that describe the spatiotemporal interaction between event participants, humans and objects interacting with each other, abstracting away all object-class information and fine-grained image characteristics, and relying solely on the coarse-grained motion of the event participants. We apply our approach to a large set of 22 distinct verb classes and a corpus of 2,584 videos, yielding two surprising outcomes. First, a classification accuracy of greater than 70% on a 1-out-of-22 labeling task and greater than 85% on a variety of 1-out-of-10 subsets of this labeling task is independent of the choice of which of two different time-series classifiers we employ. Second, we achieve this level of accuracy using a highly impoverished intermediate representation consisting solely of the bounding boxes of one or two event participants as a function of time. This indicates that successful event recognition depends more on the choice of appropriate features that characterize the linguistic invariants of the event classes than on the particular classifier algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 19:59:15 GMT  (928kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3616v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["andrei barbu", "alexander bridge", "dan coroian", "sven dickinson", "sam mussman", "siddharth narayanaswamy", "dhaval salvi", "lara schmidt", "jiangnan shangguan", "jeffrey mark siskind", "jarrell waggoner", "song wang", "jinlian wei", "yifan yin", "zhiqi zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3616"}
