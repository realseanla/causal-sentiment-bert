We discuss the brain prosthesis thought experiment. We evaluate how the experience of the brain simulation might differ from the biological, according to a number of hypotheses about experience and the properties of simulation. Then, we identify finer questions relating to the original inquiry, and answer them from both a general physicalist, and panexperientialist perspective.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 17:19:53 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5379v1", "10 pages, draft of conference paper published in AGI 2012, also accepted to AISB 2012 but it was too late to arrange travel, unfortunately; Artificial General Intelligence, 5th International Conference, AGI 2012, Oxford, UK, December 8-11, 2012.
