This model can also be used to detect the other possible emotions at the time of recognition. Accuracy measurements of human emotions by the fuzzy model are discussed through two methods; the first is accuracy analysis and the second is false positive rate analysis. This fuzzy model detects more emotions, but on the other hand, for some of emotions, a lower accuracy was obtained with the comparison with the non-fuzzy human emotions detection methods. This system was trained and tested by Support Vector Machine (SVM) to recognize the users' emotions. Overall, this model represents a closer similarity between human brain detection of emotions and computer systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 09:38:21 GMT  (337kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1474v1", "12th WSEAS International Conference on Applications of Computer Engineering (ACE '13), Cambridge, MA, USA, 30 Jan. - 1 Feb. 2013 ISBN: 978-1-61804-156-2, Pages 77-82"]], "COMMENTS": "12th WSEAS International Conference on Applications of Computer Engineering (ACE '13), Cambridge, MA, USA, 30 Jan. - 1 Feb. 2013 ISBN: 978-1-61804-156-2, Pages 77-82", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["kaveh bakhtiyari", "hafizah husain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.1474"}
