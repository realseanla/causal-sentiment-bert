It is based on fuzzy constraints represented as fuzzy geometric relations that can be hierarchically structured. The concept of spatial template is introduced to capture the idea of interrelated objects in two-dimensional space. The representation model is used to specify imprecise or vague information consisting in relative locations and orientations of template objects. It is shown in this paper how a template represented by this model can be matched against a crisp situation to recognize a particular instance of this template. Furthermore, the proximity measure (fuzzy measure) between the instance and the template is worked out - this measure can be interpreted as a degree of similarity. In this context, template recognition can be viewed as a case of fuzzy pattern recognition. The results of this work have been implemented and applied to a complex military problem from which this work originated.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:18:12 GMT  (1017kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6829v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stephane lapointe", "rene proulx"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6829"}
