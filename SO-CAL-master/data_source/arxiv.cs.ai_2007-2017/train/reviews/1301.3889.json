Due to their coarse level of representation detail, qualitative probabilistic networks do not provide for resolving trade-offs and typically yield ambiguous results upon inference. We present an algorithm for computing more insightful results for unresolved trade-offs. The algorithm builds upon the idea of using pivots to zoom in on the trade-offs and identifying the information that would serve to resolve them.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:52:25 GMT  (277kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3889v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["silja renooij", "linda c van der gaag", "simon parsons", "shaw green"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3889"}
