We propose to encode the preferences of an agent as sequences of \"alternative acceptable outcomes\". We then study how the agent's beliefs and norms can be used to filter the mental attitudes out of the sequences of alternative acceptable outcomes. Finally, we formalise such intuitions in a novel Modal Defeasible Logic and we prove that the resulting formalisation is computationally feasible.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 13 Dec 2015 09:19:27 GMT  (70kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04021v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["guido governatori", "francesco olivieri", "simone scannapieco", "antonino rotolo", "matteo cristani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04021"}
