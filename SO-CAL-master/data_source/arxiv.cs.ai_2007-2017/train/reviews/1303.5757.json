If Bel is the combination using Dempster's Rule of belief functions Bel, ..., Bel,7, then, for subset b of the frame C), Bel(b) can be calculated in time linear in 1(31 and m (given that the weight of conflict is bounded). The algorithm can also be used to improve the complexity of the Shenoy-Shafer algorithms on Markov trees, and be generalised to calculate Dempster-Shafer Belief over other logics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:33:58 GMT  (196kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5757v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nic wilson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5757"}
