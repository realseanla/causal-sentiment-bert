While sentence ordering for single document summarization can be determined from the ordering of sentences in the input article, this is not the case for multidocument summarization where summary sentences may be drawn from different input articles. In this paper, we propose a methodology for studying the properties of ordering information in the news genre and describe experiments done on a corpus of multiple acceptable orderings we developed for the task. Based on these experiments, we implemented a strategy for ordering information that combines constraints from chronological order of events and topical relatedness. Evaluation of our augmented algorithm shows a significant improvement of the ordering over two baseline strategies.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:57:02 GMT  (173kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1820v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["r barzilay", "n elhadad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1820"}
