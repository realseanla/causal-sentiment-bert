In particular, assuming a set of leading diagnoses being given, we show how queries (sets of measurements) can be computed and optimized along two dimensions: expected number of queries and cost per query. By means of a suitable decoupling of two optimizations and a clever search space reduction the computations are done without any inference engine calls. For the full search space, we give a method requiring only a polynomial number of inferences and guaranteeing query properties existing methods cannot provide. Evaluation results using real-world problems indicate that the new method computes (virtually) optimal queries instantly independently of the size and complexity of the considered diagnosis problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 May 2017 00:47:29 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09879v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick rodler", "wolfgang schmid", "konstantin schekotihin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09879"}
