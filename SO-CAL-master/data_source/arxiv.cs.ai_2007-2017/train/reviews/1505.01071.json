Proactive adaptation of such systems allows changing the service and the context based on prediction. However, the definition of the context is still vague and not suitable to prediction. In this paper we discuss and classify previous definitions of context. Then, we present a new definition which allows pervasive systems to understand and predict their contexts. We analyze the essential lines that fall within the context definition, and propose some scenarios to make it clear our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 May 2015 16:34:23 GMT  (440kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01071v1", "Context-aware; Pervasive Computing; Context Definition; 2015.
