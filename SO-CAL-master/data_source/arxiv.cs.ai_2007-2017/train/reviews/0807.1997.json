Previous studies typically treat the instances in the bags as independently and identically distributed. However, the instances in a bag are rarely independent, and therefore a better performance can be expected if the instances are treated in an non-i.i.d. way that exploits the relations among instances. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multi-instance learning method, which regards each bag as a graph and uses a specific kernel to distinguish the graphs by considering the features of the nodes as well as the features of the edges that convey some relations among instances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Jul 2008 20:19:18 GMT  (413kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1997v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Apr 2009 17:22:40 GMT  (441kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1997v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 17 Apr 2009 08:43:03 GMT  (436kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1997v3", "ICML, 2009"], ["v4", "Wed, 13 May 2009 16:22:00 GMT  (453kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1997v4", "ICML, 2009"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["zhi-hua zhou", "yu-yin sun", "yu-feng li"], "accepted": true, "id": "0807.1997"}
