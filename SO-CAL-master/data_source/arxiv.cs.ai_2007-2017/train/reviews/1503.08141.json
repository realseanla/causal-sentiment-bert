We introduce a theory $\\mathsf{JCDL}$ of Justified Conditional Doxastic Logic that replaces conditional belief formulas $B^\\psi\\varphi$ by expressions $t{\\,:^{\\psi}}\\varphi$ made up of a term $t$ whose syntactic structure suggests a derivation of the belief $\\varphi$ after revision by $\\psi$. This allows us to think of terms $t$ as reasons justifying a belief in various formulas after a revision takes place. We show that $\\mathsf{JCDL}$-theorems are the exact analogs of $\\mathsf{CDL}$-theorems, and that this result holds the other way around as well. This allows us to think of $\\mathsf{JCDL}$ as a theory of revisable justified belief.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 16:46:04 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08141v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["alexandru baltag", "bryan renne", "sonja smets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.08141"}
