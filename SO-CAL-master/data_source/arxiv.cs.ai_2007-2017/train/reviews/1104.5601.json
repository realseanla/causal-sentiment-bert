We show that either randomized or history-based policies can improve performance. We prove that the complexity of computing a policy that maximizes the mean reward under a variance constraint is NP-hard for some cases, and strongly NP-hard for others. We finally offer pseudopolynomial exact and approximation algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 11:39:40 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5601v1", "A full version of an ICML 2011 paper"]], "COMMENTS": "A full version of an ICML 2011 paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["shie mannor", "john n tsitsiklis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1104.5601"}
