We find that the best way of tackling this problem is to offer an iteration formula that takes the initial values and the attack relation and iterates a sequence of intermediate values that eventually converges leading to an extension. The properties surrounding the application of the iteration formula and its connection with other numerical and non-numerical techniques proposed by others are thoroughly investigated in this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 12:56:17 GMT  (160kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6706v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 18:09:21 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6706v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["d gabbay", "o rodrigues"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6706"}
