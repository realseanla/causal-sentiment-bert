{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Jun-2012", "title": "A Dynamic Programming Algorithm for Inference in Recursive Probabilistic Programs", "abstract": "We describe a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the marginal distribution of discrete probabilistic programs. This algorithm takes a functional interpreter for an arbitrary probabilistic programming language and turns it into an efficient marginalizer. Because direct caching of sub-distributions is impossible in the presence of recursion, we build a graph of dependencies between sub-distributions. This factored sum-product network makes (potentially cyclic) dependencies between subproblems explicit, and corresponds to a system of equations for the marginal distribution. We solve these equations by fixed-point iteration in topological order. We illustrate this algorithm on examples used in teaching probabilistic models, computational cognitive science research, and game theory.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jun 2012 19:44:02 GMT  (258kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3555v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Sep 2012 22:00:30 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3555v2", "Second Statistical Relational AI workshop at UAI 2012 (StaRAI-12)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["andreas stuhlm\\\"uller", "noah d goodman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3555"}
