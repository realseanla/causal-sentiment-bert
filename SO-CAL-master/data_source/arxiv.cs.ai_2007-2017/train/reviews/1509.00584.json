{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Sep-2015", "title": "Turing's Imitation Game has been Improved", "abstract": "Using the recently introduced universal computing model, called orchestrated machine, that represents computations in a dissipative environment, we consider a new kind of interpretation of Turing's Imitation Game. In addition we raise the question whether the intelligence may show fractal properties. Then we sketch a vision of what robotic cars are going to do in the future. Finally we give the specification of an artificial life game based on the concept of orchestrated machines. The purpose of this paper is to start the search for possible relationships between these different topics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 07:18:20 GMT  (616kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00584v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["norbert b\\'atfai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.00584"}
