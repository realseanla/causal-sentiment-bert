{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Mar-2014", "title": "Beyond Q-Resolution and Prenex Form: A Proof System for Quantified Constraint Satisfaction", "abstract": "We consider the quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP) which is to decide, given a structure and a first-order sentence (not assumed here to be in prenex form) built from conjunction and quantification, whether or not the sentence is true on the structure. We present a proof system for certifying the falsity of QCSP instances and develop its basic theory; for instance, we provide an algorithmic interpretation of its behavior. Our proof system places the established Q-resolution proof system in a broader context, and also allows us to derive QCSP tractability results.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 15:19:57 GMT  (32kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0222v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 23 May 2014 08:15:56 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0222v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 14:07:51 GMT  (237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0222v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 13:55:26 GMT  (246kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0222v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["hubie chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0222"}
