We classify OMQs according to the shape of their conjunctive queries (treewidth, the number of leaves) and the existential depth of their ontologies. For each of these classes, we determine the combined complexity of OMQ answering, and whether all OMQs in the class have polynomial-size first-order, positive existential, and nonrecursive datalog rewritings. We obtain the succinctness results using hypergraph programs, a new computational model for Boolean functions, which makes it possible to connect the size of OMQ rewritings and circuit complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 May 2016 10:10:37 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01207v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["meghyn bienvenu", "stanislav kikot", "roman kontchakov", "vladimir podolskii", "michael zakharyaschev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01207"}
