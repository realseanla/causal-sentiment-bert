In addition, inheritance within representation of vague and imprecise knowledge are also discussed. New types of inheritance, general classification of all known inheritance types and approach, which allows avoiding in many cases problems with exceptions, redundancy and ambiguity within object-oriented dynamic networks and their fuzzy extension, are introduced in the paper. The proposed approach bases on conception of homogeneous and inhomogeneous or heterogeneous class of objects, which allow building of inheritance hierarchy more flexibly and efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 17:34:11 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04212v1", "in Information and Software Technologies, Communications in Computer and Information Science, Springer, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "in Information and Software Technologies, Communications in Computer and Information Science, Springer, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dmytro terletskyi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04212"}
