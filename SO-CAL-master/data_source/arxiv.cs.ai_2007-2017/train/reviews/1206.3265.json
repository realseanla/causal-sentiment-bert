In this paper we study several variants of the tuning problem and show that these problems are NPPP-complete in general. We further show that the problems remain NP-complete or PP-complete, for a number of restricted variants. These complexity results provide insight in whether or not recent achievements in sensitivity analysis and tuning can be extended to more general, practicable methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:35:54 GMT  (179kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3265v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["johan kwisthout", "linda c van der gaag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3265"}
