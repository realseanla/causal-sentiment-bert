{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Mar-2017", "title": "Supervised Typing of Big Graphs using Semantic Embeddings", "abstract": "We propose a supervised algorithm for generating type embeddings in the same semantic vector space as a given set of entity embeddings. The algorithm is agnostic to the derivation of the underlying entity embeddings. It does not require any manual feature engineering, generalizes well to hundreds of types and achieves near-linear scaling on Big Graphs containing many millions of triples and instances by virtue of an incremental execution. We demonstrate the utility of the embeddings on a type recommendation task, outperforming a non-parametric feature-agnostic baseline while achieving 15x speedup and near-constant memory usage on a full partition of DBpedia. Using state-of-the-art visualization, we illustrate the agreement of our extensionally derived DBpedia type embeddings with the manually curated domain ontology. Finally, we use the embeddings to probabilistically cluster about 4 million DBpedia instances into 415 types in the DBpedia ontology.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 18:20:07 GMT  (1504kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07805v1", "6 pages, to be published in Semantic Big Data Workshop at ACM, SIGMOD 2017; extended version in preparation for Open Journal of Semantic Web (OJSW)"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, to be published in Semantic Big Data Workshop at ACM, SIGMOD 2017; extended version in preparation for Open Journal of Semantic Web (OJSW)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["mayank kejriwal", "pedro szekely"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07805"}
