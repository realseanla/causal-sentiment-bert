Using these results as a benchmark, we discuss the role that the discount factor may play in the quality of the learning process of a deep Q-network (DQN). When the discount factor progressively increases up to its final value, we empirically show that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of learning steps. When used in conjunction with a varying learning rate, we empirically show that it outperforms original DQN on several experiments. We relate this phenomenon with the instabilities of neural networks when they are used in an approximate Dynamic Programming setting. We also describe the possibility to fall within a local optimum during the learning process, thus connecting our discussion with the exploration/exploitation dilemma.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 12:25:18 GMT  (954kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02011v1", "NIPS 2015 Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop"], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 10:33:00 GMT  (959kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02011v2", "NIPS 2015 Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2015 Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["vincent fran\\c{c}ois-lavet", "raphael fonteneau", "damien ernst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.02011"}
