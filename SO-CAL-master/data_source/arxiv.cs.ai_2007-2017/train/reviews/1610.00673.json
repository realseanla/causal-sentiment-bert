However, training a policy that generalizes well across a wide range of real-world conditions requires far greater quantity and diversity of experience than is practical to collect with a single robot. Fortunately, it is possible for multiple robots to share their experience with one another, and thereby, learn a policy collectively. In this work, we explore distributed and asynchronous policy learning as a means to achieve generalization and improved training times on challenging, real-world manipulation tasks. We propose a distributed and asynchronous version of Guided Policy Search and use it to demonstrate collective policy learning on a vision-based door opening task using four robots. We show that it achieves better generalization, utilization, and training times than the single robot alternative.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 18:54:00 GMT  (4289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00673v1", "Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["ali yahya", "adrian li", "mrinal kalakrishnan", "yevgen chebotar", "sergey levine"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00673"}
