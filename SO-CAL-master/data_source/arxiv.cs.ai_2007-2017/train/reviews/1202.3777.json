However, belief propagation over junction tree is known to be computationally intensive in the general case. Its complexity may increase dramatically with the connectivity and state space cardinality of Bayesian network nodes. In this paper, we address this computational challenge using GPU parallelization. We develop data structures and algorithms that extend existing junction tree techniques, and specifically develop a novel approach to computing each belief propagation message in parallel. We implement our approach on an NVIDIA GPU and test it using BNs from several applications. Experimentally, we study how junction tree parameters affect parallelization opportunities and hence the performance of our algorithm. We achieve speedups ranging from 0.68 to 9.18 for the BNs studied.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (156kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3777v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["lu zheng", "ole mengshoel", "jike chong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3777"}
