All these are constructed in the framework of multi-valued representations and are based on a penta-valued logic that uses the following logical values: true, false, unknown, contradictory and ambiguous. Also a new distance for bounded real interval was defined.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 08:56:02 GMT  (333kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02060v1", "6 pages.
