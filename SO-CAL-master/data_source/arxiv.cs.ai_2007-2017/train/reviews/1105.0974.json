The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to spectral approaches in terms of minimizing normalized cut. However, unlike spectral approaches, the proposed algorithm scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges. The algorithm consists of three components that are processed sequentially: a greedy agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure, model order selection, and a local refinement.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 May 2011 04:55:53 GMT  (659kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0974v1", "Submitted to Pattern Recognition. 27 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Pattern Recognition. 27 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["seyed salim tabatabaei", "mark coates", "michael rabbat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.0974"}
