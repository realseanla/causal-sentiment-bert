This kind of problem can find many real-world applications and has been studied extensively in the literature. However, existing solutions either need a central controller for information sharing or requires slot synchronization among different nodes, which increases the difficulty of practical implementations, especially for a very large and heterogeneous system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 04:58:54 GMT  (265kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03992v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.PF", "authors": ["ying zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03992"}
