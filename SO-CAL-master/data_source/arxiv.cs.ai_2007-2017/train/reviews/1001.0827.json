We introduce the K-tree clustering algorithm in an Information Retrieval context by adapting it for document clustering. Many large scale problems exist in document clustering. K-tree scales well with large inputs due to its low complexity. It offers promising results both in terms of efficiency and quality. Document classification was completed using Support Vector Machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 07:51:23 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0827v1", "12 pages, INEX 2008"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, INEX 2008", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["christopher m de vries", "shlomo geva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.0827"}
