One way of limiting the search space and avoiding local optima is to impose qualitative constraints that are based on background knowledge concerning the domain. We present a method for integrating formal statements of qualitative constraints into two learning algorithms, APN and EM. In our experiments with synthetic data, this method yielded networks that satisfied the constraints almost perfectly. The accuracy of the learned networks was consistently superior to that of corresponding networks learned without constraints. The exploitation of qualitative constraints therefore appears to be a promising way to increase both the interpretability and the accuracy of learned Bayesian networks with known structure.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:53:24 GMT  (378kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3903v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["frank wittig", "anthony jameson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3903"}
