Some combination rules are used with the assumption of their sources independence whereas others combine beliefs of dependent sources. Therefore, the choice of the combination rule depends on the independence of sources involved in the combination. In this paper, we propose also a measure of independence, positive and negative dependence to integrate in mass functions before the combinaision with the independence assumption.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 12:48:41 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04786v1", "in French"]], "COMMENTS": "in French", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mouna chebbah", "mouloud kharoune", "arnaud martin", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04786"}
