{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2013", "title": "Generating Shortest Synchronizing Sequences using Answer Set Programming", "abstract": "For a finite state automaton, a synchronizing sequence is an input sequence that takes all the states to the same state. Checking the existence of a synchronizing sequence and finding a synchronizing sequence, if one exists, can be performed in polynomial time. However, the problem of finding a shortest synchronizing sequence is known to be NP-hard. In this work, the usefulness of Answer Set Programming to solve this optimization problem is investigated, in comparison with brute-force algorithms and SAT-based approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:30:10 GMT  (12kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6146v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["canan g\\\"uni\\c{c}en", "esra erdem", "h\\\"usn\\\"u yenig\\\"un"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6146"}
