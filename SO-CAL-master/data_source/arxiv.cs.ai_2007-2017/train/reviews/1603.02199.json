To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 18:53:00 GMT  (5414kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02199v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 23:01:46 GMT  (6485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02199v2", "revised related work, added additional experiments to evaluate data requirements"], ["v3", "Sat, 2 Apr 2016 23:50:24 GMT  (6485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02199v3", "fixing some malformed citations"], ["v4", "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 23:32:37 GMT  (6486kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02199v4", "This is an extended version of \"Learning Hand-Eye Coordination for Robotic Grasping with Large-Scale Data Collection,\" ISER 2016.
