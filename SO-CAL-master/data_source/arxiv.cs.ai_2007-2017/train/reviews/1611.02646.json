Exponential explosion makes it difficult to consider the whole concept lattice arising from data, one needs to select most useful and interesting concepts. In this paper interestingness measures of concepts are considered and compared with respect to various aspects, such as efficiency of computation and applicability to noisy data and performing ranking correlation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 18:26:24 GMT  (724kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02646v1", "20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables"], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 18:19:22 GMT  (612kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02646v2", "20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sergei o kuznetsov", "tatiana makhalova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02646"}
