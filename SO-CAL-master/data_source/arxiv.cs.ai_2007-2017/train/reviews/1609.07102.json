While initial solutions proposed a data model to represent a specific dimension of meta-information (such as time or provenance), the need for a general annotation framework which allows representing different context dimensions is needed. In this paper, we extend the 4dFluents ontology by Welty and Fikes---on associating temporal validity to statements---to any dimension of context, and discuss possible issues that multidimensional context representations have to face and how we address them.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 18:37:12 GMT  (200kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07102v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jos\\'e m gim\\'enez-garc\\'ia", "antoine zimmermann", "pierre maret"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07102"}
