In this field, a data structure can be designed in the form of tree which in turn utilized vertices and edges. Covering is a widely used form of data structure in data mining and covering-based rough sets provide a systematic approach to this type of data. In this paper, we study the connectedness of graphs through covering-based rough sets and apply it to connected matroids. First, we present an approach to inducing a covering by a graph, and then covering-based rough sets are employed to study the connectedness of the graph from the viewpoint of the approximation operators. Second, we construct a graph from a matroid, and find the matroid and the graph have the same connectedness, which makes us to apply connected graphs to study connected matroids. In summary, this paper provides a new approach to studying graph theory and matroid theory.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 02:32:43 GMT  (49kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4234v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 4 Jan 2014 12:00:52 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4234v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 08:23:03 GMT  (40kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4234v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aiping huang", "william zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4234"}
