This problem can be solved using the chase algorithm, which extends the given set of facts with fresh facts in order to satisfy the rules. If the chase terminates, then CQs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of facts. The chase, however, does not terminate necessarily, and checking whether the chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous acyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase termination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity notions called model-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity (MSA). Furthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and establish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that MFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:44:16 GMT  (595kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4110v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["bernardo cuenca grau", "ian horrocks", "markus kr\\\"otzsch", "clemens kupke", "despoina magka", "boris motik", "zhe wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4110"}
