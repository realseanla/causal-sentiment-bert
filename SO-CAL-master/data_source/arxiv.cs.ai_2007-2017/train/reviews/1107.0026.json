The suggested applications are in natural language processing, more specifically in surface natural language generation and in machine translation, where a sentence is obtained by first generating a large set of candidate sentences, represented in a compact way, and then by filtering such a set through a parser. We study several formal properties of IDL-expressions and compare this new formalism with more standard ones. We also present a novel parsing algorithm for IDL-expressions and prove a non-trivial upper bound on its time complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:33:50 GMT  (139kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0026v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m j nederhof", "g satta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0026"}
