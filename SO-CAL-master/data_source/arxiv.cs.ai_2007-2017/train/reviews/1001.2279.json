This paper presents an implementation of a supervised learning method based on membership function training in the context of Mamdani fuzzy models. Specifically, auto zoom function of a digital camera is modelled using Mamdani technique. The performance of control method is verified through a series of simulation and numerical results are provided as illustrations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 19:25:09 GMT  (622kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2279v1", "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS December 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["i elamvazuthi", "p vasant", "j f webb"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.2279"}
