We introduce concepts of abstract modules and abstract modular systems to study general principles behind the design and analysis of model-finding programs, or solvers, for integrated heterogeneous multi-logic systems. We show how abstract modules and abstract modular systems give rise to transition systems, which are a natural and convenient representation of solvers pioneered by the SAT community. We illustrate our approach by showing how it applies to answer set programming and propositional logic, and to multi-logic systems based on these two formalisms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:37:56 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6151v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yuliya lierler", "miroslaw truszczynski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6151"}
