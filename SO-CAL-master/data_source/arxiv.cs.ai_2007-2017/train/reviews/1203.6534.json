To show its interest, we describe a new compact representation of preferences specific to spanning trees, identifying an efficient maximal spanning tree sub-problem. Next, we compare this problem with the Pareto-based multiobjective one. And at last, we propose an efficient algorithm solving the associated preferential consistency problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 14:30:38 GMT  (194kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6534v1", "12 pages, 7 figures, conference : Workshop on modeling and solving problems with constraints (ECAI 2008-W31), Patras, Greece, 21 july 2008"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 7 figures, conference : Workshop on modeling and solving problems with constraints (ECAI 2008-W31), Patras, Greece, 21 july 2008", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["r\\'emy-robert joseph"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.6534"}
