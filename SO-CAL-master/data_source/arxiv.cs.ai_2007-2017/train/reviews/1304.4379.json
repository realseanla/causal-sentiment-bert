MAP inference in graphical models is an optimization problem which can be compiled to integer linear programs (ILPs). We describe several advances in translating MAP queries to ILP instances and present the novel meta-algorithm cutting plane aggregation (CPA). CPA exploits local context-specific symmetries and bundles up sets of linear constraints. The resulting counting constraints lead to more compact ILPs and make the symmetry of the ground model more explicit to state-of-the-art ILP solvers. Moreover, RockIt parallelizes most parts of the MAP inference pipeline taking advantage of ubiquitous shared-memory multi-core architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 09:29:58 GMT  (475kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4379v1", "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2013"], ["v2", "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 10:19:58 GMT  (475kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.4379v2", "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jan noessner", "mathias niepert", "heiner stuckenschmidt"], "accepted": true, "id": "1304.4379"}
