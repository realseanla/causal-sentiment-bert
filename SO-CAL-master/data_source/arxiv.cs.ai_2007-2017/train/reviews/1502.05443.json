{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Feb-2015", "title": "Influence-Optimistic Local Values for Multiagent Planning --- Extended Version", "abstract": "Recent years have seen the development of a number of methods for multiagent planning under uncertainty that scale to tens or even hundreds of agents. However, most of these methods either make restrictive assumptions on the problem domain, or provide approximate solutions without any guarantees on quality. To allow for meaningful benchmarking through measurable quality guarantees on a very general class of problems, this paper introduces a family of influence-optimistic upper bounds for factored Dec-POMDPs. Intuitively, we derive bounds on very large multiagent planning problems by subdividing them in sub-problems, and at each of these sub-problems making optimistic assumptions with respect to the influence that will be exerted by the rest of the system. We numerically compare the different upper bounds and demonstrate how, for the first time ever, we can achieve a non-trivial guarantee that the heuristic solution of problems with hundreds of agents is close to optimal. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the upper bounds may improve the effectiveness of heuristic influence search, and discuss further potential applications to multiagent planning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 23:42:24 GMT  (275kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05443v1", "long version of extended abstract at AAMAS 2015"], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Jul 2015 08:58:50 GMT  (193kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05443v2", "Long version of IJCAI 2015 paper (and extended abstract at AAMAS 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "long version of extended abstract at AAMAS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SY", "authors": ["frans a oliehoek", "matthijs t j spaan", "stefan witwicki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05443"}
