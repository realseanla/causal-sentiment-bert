Most of these formalisms, however, assume that the probabilistic structure of the knowledge remains static over time. We present a general approach for extending ontology languages to handle time-evolving uncertainty represented by a dynamic Bayesian network. We show how reasoning in the original language and dynamic Bayesian inferences can be exploited for effective reasoning in our framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 11:32:46 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08030v1", "Fifth International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI (StarAI'2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "Fifth International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI (StarAI'2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["\\ ismail \\ ilkan ceylan", "rafael pe\\~naloza"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08030"}
