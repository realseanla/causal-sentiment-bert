The key idea is that structure priors are defined via a probability tree and that the proposal mechanism for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm operates by traversing this tree, thereby defining a cheaply computable acceptance probability. We have applied this approach to Bayesian net structure learning using a number of priors and tree traversal strategies. Our results show that these must be chosen appropriately for this approach to be successful.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:22:27 GMT  (994kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2254v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nicos angelopoulos", "james cussens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2254"}
