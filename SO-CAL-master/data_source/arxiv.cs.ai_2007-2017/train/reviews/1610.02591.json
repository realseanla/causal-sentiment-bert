We propose XOR_MMAP, a novel approach to solve the Marginal MAP Problem, which represents the intractable counting subproblem with queries to NP oracles, subject to additional parity constraints. XOR_MMAP provides a constant factor approximation to the Marginal MAP Problem, by encoding it as a single optimization in polynomial size of the original problem. We evaluate our approach in several machine learning and decision making applications, and show that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art Marginal MAP solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 22:32:35 GMT  (1736kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02591v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 21:22:06 GMT  (3225kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02591v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yexiang xue", "zhiyuan li", "stefano ermon", "carla p gomes", "bart selman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.02591"}
