The Answer is in Your Facebook Likes", "abstract": "In economics and psychology, delay discounting is often used to characterize how individuals choose between a smaller immediate reward and a larger delayed reward. People with higher delay discounting rate (DDR) often choose smaller but more immediate rewards (a \"today person\"). In contrast, people with a lower discounting rate often choose a larger future rewards (a \"tomorrow person\"). Since the ability to modulate the desire of immediate gratification for long term rewards plays an important role in our decision-making, the lower discounting rate often predicts better social, academic and health outcomes. In contrast, the higher discounting rate is often associated with problematic behaviors such as alcohol/drug abuse, pathological gambling and credit card default. Thus, research on understanding and moderating delay discounting has the potential to produce substantial societal benefits.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 16:16:09 GMT  (348kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07726v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 05:27:59 GMT  (348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07726v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 01:00:03 GMT  (348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07726v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["tao ding", "warren k bickel", "shimei pan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07726"}
