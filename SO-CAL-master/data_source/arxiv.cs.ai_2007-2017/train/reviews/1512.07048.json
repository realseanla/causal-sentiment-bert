Let us assume that someone who is both very beautiful and very smart is more rare than what we would expect from the combination of the number of beautiful and brainy people. Of course there will still always be some individuals that defy this stereotype; these beautiful brainy people are exactly the class of anomaly we focus on in this paper. They do not posses rare qualities, but it is the unexpected combination of factors that makes them stand out.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 12:15:12 GMT  (397kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07048v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 15:55:56 GMT  (404kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07048v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["roel bertens", "jilles vreeken", "arno siebes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07048"}
