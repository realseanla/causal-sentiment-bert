CoCoE can offer answers to questions like: Is dataset A better than B for knowledge discovery since it is more complex and informative?, Is dataset X better than Y for simple value lookups due its flatter structure?, etc. In order to address such questions, we introduce a set of well-founded measures based on complementary notions from distributional semantics, network analysis and information theory. These measures are part of a specific implementation of the CoCoE methodology that is available for download. Last but not least, we illustrate CoCoE by its application to selected biomedical RDF datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 14:45:43 GMT  (296kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1061v1", "A current working draft of the paper submitted to the ISWC'14 conference (track information available here:this http URL)"]], "COMMENTS": "A current working draft of the paper submitted to the ISWC'14 conference (track information available here:this http URL)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["vit novacek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1061"}
