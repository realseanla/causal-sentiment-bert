We demonstrate the use of this latest version of the language in the representation of important kinds of knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:05 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1387v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marcello balduccini", "michael gelfond"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1387"}
