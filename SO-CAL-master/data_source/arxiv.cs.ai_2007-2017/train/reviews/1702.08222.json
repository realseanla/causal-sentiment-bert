Key factors influencing team performance are competences and personality of team members. Hence, we present a computational model to compose proficient and congenial teams based on individuals' personalities and their competences to perform tasks of different nature. With this purpose, we extend Wilde's post-Jungian method for team composition, which solely employs individuals' personalities. The aim of this study is to create a model to partition agents into teams that are balanced in competences, personality and gender. Finally, we present some preliminary empirical results that we obtained when analysing student performance. Results show the benefits of a more informed team composition that exploits individuals' competences besides information about their personalities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 10:36:36 GMT  (143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08222v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ewa", "rejczuk", "juan a rodriguez-aguilar", "carme roig", "carles sierra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08222"}
