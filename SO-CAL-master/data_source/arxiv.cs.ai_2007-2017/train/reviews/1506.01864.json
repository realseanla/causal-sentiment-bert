A lot of research in this area has been focused so far on finding the shortest paths while in many applications producing smooth paths is preferable. In our work, we study the problem of generating smooth grid paths and concentrate on angle constrained path planning. We put angle constrained path planning problem formally and present a new algorithm of solving it - LIAN. We examine LIAN both theoretically and empirically. On the theoretical side, we prove that LIAN is sound and complete (under well-defined restrictions). On the experimental side, we show that LIAN significantly outperforms competitors in ability to find solutions under tough resource constraints and in computational efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 11:09:23 GMT  (694kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01864v1", "13 pages (12 pages: main text, 1 page: references), 7 figures, 19 references, submitted 2015-May-20 to \"The 38 German Conference on Artificial Intelligence\" (KI-2015)"], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 15:59:28 GMT  (414kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01864v2", "13 pages (12 pages: main text, 1 page: references), 7 figures, 20 references, submitted 2015-June-22 to \"The 38 German Conference on Artificial Intelligence\" (KI-2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages (12 pages: main text, 1 page: references), 7 figures, 19 references, submitted 2015-May-20 to \"The 38 German Conference on Artificial Intelligence\" (KI-2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["konstantin yakovlev", "egor baskin", "ivan hramoin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01864"}
