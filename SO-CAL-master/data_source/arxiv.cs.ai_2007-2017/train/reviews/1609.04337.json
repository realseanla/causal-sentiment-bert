However, computation of the full disparity distribution with an advanced Bayesian model is usually an intractable problem, and proves computationally challenging even with a simple model. In this paper, we show how probabilistic hardware using distributed memory and alternate representation of data as stochastic bitstreams can solve that problem with high performance and energy efficiency. We put forward a way to express discrete probability distributions using stochastic data representations and perform Bayesian fusion using those representations, and show how that approach can be applied to diparity computation. We evaluate the system using a simulated stochastic implementation and discuss possible hardware implementations of such architectures and their potential for sensorimotor processing and robotics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 16:41:31 GMT  (3301kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04337v1", "Preprint of article submitted for publication in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning and accepted pending minor revisions"], ["v2", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 15:36:01 GMT  (5037kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04337v2", "Preprint of article submitted for publication in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning and accepted pending minor revisions"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint of article submitted for publication in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning and accepted pending minor revisions", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["alexandre coninx", "pierre bessi\\`ere", "jacques droulez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.04337"}
