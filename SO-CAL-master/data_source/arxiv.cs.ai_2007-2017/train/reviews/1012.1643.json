In this paper we propose the lightweight dynamic user-friendly interaction with humans during execution of scientific workflows via the low-barrier approach of Semantic Wikis as an intuitive interface for non-technical scientists. Our Process Makna Semantic Wiki system is a novel combination of an business process management system adapted for scientific workflows with a Corporate Semantic Web Wiki user interface supporting knowledge intensive human interaction tasks during scientific workflow execution.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 23:49:29 GMT  (137kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1643v1", "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.
