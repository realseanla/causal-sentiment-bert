We employ tools from the self-normalized processes to provide a simple and self-contained proof of a tail bound of a vector-valued martingale. We use the bound to construct a new tighter confidence sets for the least squares estimate.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 04:06:31 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2670v1", "Submitted to the 24th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2011)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to the 24th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2011)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yasin abbasi-yadkori", "david pal", "csaba szepesvari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2670"}
