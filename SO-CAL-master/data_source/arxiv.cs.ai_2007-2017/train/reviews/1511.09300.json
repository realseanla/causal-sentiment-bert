They are applied to diverse decision problems. In this paper we apply influence diagrams to the optimization of a vehicle speed profile. We present results of computational experiments in which an influence diagram was used to optimize the speed profile of a Formula 1 race car at the Silverstone F1 circuit. The computed lap time and speed profiles correspond well to those achieved by test pilots. An extended version of our model that considers a more complex optimization function and diverse traffic constraints is currently being tested onboard a testing car by a major car manufacturer. This paper opens doors for new applications of influence diagrams.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 13:30:13 GMT  (199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09300v1", "Presented at the Twelfth Annual Bayesian Modeling Applications Workshop, Amtsterdam, The Netherlands, 16th July 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the Twelfth Annual Bayesian Modeling Applications Workshop, Amtsterdam, The Netherlands, 16th July 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["v\\'aclav kratochv\\'il", "ji\\v{r}\\'i vomlel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.09300"}
