Currently these videos are cat- egorized manually by the help of the user community. In this paper, we propose a combination of color spaces with the Bayesian network approach for robust detection of skin color followed by an automated video categorization. Exper- imental results show that our method can achieve satisfactory performance for categorizing videos based on skin color.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Apr 2012 06:44:42 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1811v1", "International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI), Volume 9, Issue 1, No 3, January 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues (IJCSI), Volume 9, Issue 1, No 3, January 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["rehanullah khan", "asad maqsood", "zeeshan khan", "muhammad ishaq", "arsalan arif"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1811"}
