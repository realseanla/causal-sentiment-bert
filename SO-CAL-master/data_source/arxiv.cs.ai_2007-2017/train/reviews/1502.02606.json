Unfortunately, the resulting submodular optimization problems are often too large to be solved on a single machine. We develop a simple distributed algorithm that is embarrassingly parallel and it achieves provable, constant factor, worst-case approximation guarantees. In our experiments, we demonstrate its efficiency in large problems with different kinds of constraints with objective values always close to what is achievable in the centralized setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 19:04:43 GMT  (1448kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02606v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 17:49:22 GMT  (1448kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02606v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["rafael da ponte barbosa", "alina ene", "huy l nguyen", "justin ward"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.02606"}
