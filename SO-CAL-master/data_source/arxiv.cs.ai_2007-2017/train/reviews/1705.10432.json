These new methods address the main limitations of conventional Reinforcement Learning methods such as customized feature engineering and small action/state space dimension requirements. In this paper, we leverage one of the state-of-the-art Reinforcement Learning methods, known as Trust Region Policy Optimization, to tackle intersection management for autonomous vehicles. We show that using this method, we can perform fine-grained acceleration control of autonomous vehicles in a grid street plan to achieve a global design objective.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 02:04:29 GMT  (1010kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10432v1", "Accepted in IEEE Smart World Congress 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in IEEE Smart World Congress 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO cs.SY", "authors": ["hamid mirzaei", "tony givargis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10432"}
