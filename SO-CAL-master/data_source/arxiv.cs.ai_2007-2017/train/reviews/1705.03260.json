Shepard's account is based on a rational Bayesian model of generalization, providing an answer to the question of why such a law should emerge. Extending this account to explain how humans use multiple examples to make better generalizations requires an additional assumption, called the size principle: hypotheses that pick out fewer objects should make a larger contribution to generalization. The degree to which this principle warrants similarly law-like status is far from conclusive. Typically, evaluating this principle has not been straightforward, requiring additional assumptions. We present a new method for evaluating the size principle that is more direct, and apply this method to a diverse array of datasets. Our results provide support for the broad applicability of the size principle.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 10:21:49 GMT  (2249kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03260v1", "6 pages, 4 figures, To appear in the Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures, To appear in the Proceedings of the 39th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joshua c peterson", "thomas l griffiths"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03260"}
