In the last decade, researchers have proposed many efficient solutions to analyze / classify large text dataset, however, analysis / classification of short text is still a challenge because 1) the data is very sparse 2) It contains noise words and 3) It is difficult to understand the syntactical structure of the text. Short Messaging Service (SMS) is a text messaging service for mobile/smart phone and this service is frequently used by all mobile users. Because of the popularity of SMS service, marketing companies nowadays are also using this service for direct marketing also known as SMS marketing.In this paper, we have proposed Ontology based SMS Controller which analyze the text message and classify it using ontology aslegitimate or spam. The proposed system has been tested on different scenarios and experimental results shows that the proposed solution is effective both in terms of efficiency and time.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 09:29:47 GMT  (542kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01379v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mohammed a balubaid", "umar manzoor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01379"}
