It exploits algorithm selection techniques based on classification to select one among a set of out-of-the-box heterogeneous ASP solvers used as black-box engines. In this paper we report on (i) a new optimized implementation of MEASP; and (ii) an attempt of applying algorithm selection to non-ground programs. An experimental analysis reported in the paper shows that (i) the new implementation of \\measp is substantially faster than the previous version; and (ii) the multi-engine recipe can be applied to the evaluation of non-ground programs with some benefits.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 12:45:07 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0876v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco maratea", "luca pulina", "francesco ricca"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0876"}
