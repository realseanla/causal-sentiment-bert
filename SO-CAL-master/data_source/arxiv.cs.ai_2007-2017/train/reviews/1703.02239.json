Although little is known, the author's group has propounded this framework for around 20 years and already has shown a variety of functions that emerge in a neural network (NN) through RL. In this paper, they are introduced again at this timing.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 06:51:19 GMT  (1398kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02239v1", "5 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 16 May 2017 07:22:07 GMT  (1385kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02239v2", "The Multi-disciplinary Conference on Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making (RLDM) 2017, 5 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["katsunari shibata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02239"}
