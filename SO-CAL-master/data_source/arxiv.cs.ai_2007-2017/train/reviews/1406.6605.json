Their purpose is to describe static knowledge. Our goal, in the other hand, is to be able to do the same thing with dynamic knowledge. To reach that objective we introduce substitution modifying concepts and roles. We investigate the effect of adding such substitutions to the logic SROIQ, yielding SROIQsigma, and prove that the satisfiability of a property is still decidable in SROIQsigma.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Jun 2014 17:01:19 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6605v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 07:37:42 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6605v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["jon ha\\\"el brenas", "rachid echahed", "martin strecker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6605"}
