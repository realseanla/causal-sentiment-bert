If such an intersection were successful, an algorithm with ethically traceable behavior and cogent equivalence to human cognition is established. The process of framework development itself reveals avenues of improvement and optimization. This paper will propose the application of Kant's critique of reason to current perceptions of autonomous intelligent systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 14:54:19 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01908v1", "3 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 28 May 2017 09:15:49 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01908v2", "4 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["christopher a tucker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01908"}
