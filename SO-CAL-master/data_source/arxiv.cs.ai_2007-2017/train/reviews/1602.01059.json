A way to compare them consists in using a ranking-based semantics which rank-order arguments from the most to the least acceptable ones. Recently, a number of such semantics have been proposed independently, often associated with some desirable properties. However, there is no comparative study which takes a broader perspective. This is what we propose in this work. We provide a general comparison of all these semantics with respect to the proposed properties. That allows to underline the differences of behavior between the existing semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 19:49:03 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01059v1", "Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2016), Feb 2016, Phoenix, United States"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-2016), Feb 2016, Phoenix, United States", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["elise bonzon", "j\u00e9r\u00f4me delobelle", "s\u00e9bastien konieczny", "nicolas maudet"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.01059"}
