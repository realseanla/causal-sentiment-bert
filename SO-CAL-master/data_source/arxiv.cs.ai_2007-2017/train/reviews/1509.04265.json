This relevance is primarily used for feature selection as feature weighting can be seen as a generalization of it, but it is also useful to better understand a problem's domain or to guide an inductor in its learning process. Relief family of algorithms are proven to be very effective in this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Sep 2015 15:28:08 GMT  (38kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04265v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.03755"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Sep 2015 12:09:28 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04265v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.03755"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.03755", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["gabriel prat masramon", "llu\\'is a belanche mu\\~noz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04265"}
