We show that the discourse analyses produced by Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) parsers can improve document-level sentiment analysis, via composition of local information up the discourse tree. First, we show that reweighting discourse units according to their position in a dependency representation of the rhetorical structure can yield substantial improvements on lexicon-based sentiment analysis. Next, we present a recursive neural network over the RST structure, which offers significant improvements over classification-based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 20:28:12 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01599v1", "Published at Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2015)"], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 15:41:53 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01599v2", "Published at Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "Published at Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["parminder bhatia", "yangfeng ji", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.01599"}
