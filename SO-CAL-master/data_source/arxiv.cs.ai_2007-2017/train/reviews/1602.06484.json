We argue that instilling artificial intelligences with computational narrative intelligence affords a number of applications beneficial to humans. We lay out some of the machine learning challenges necessary to solve to achieve computational narrative intelligence. Finally, we argue that computational narrative is a practical step towards machine enculturation, the teaching of sociocultural values to machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 Feb 2016 01:59:09 GMT  (30kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06484v1", "5 pages, published in the CHI 2016 Workshop on Human-Centered Machine Learning"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, published in the CHI 2016 Workshop on Human-Centered Machine Learning", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mark o riedl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06484"}
