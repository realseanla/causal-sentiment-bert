With increasingly sophisticated games emerging, these simulations have become more realistic, but the underlying mechanisms are still, to a large extent, of an ad hoc nature. This paper proposes using a logistic model from psychometrics as a unified mechanism for task resolution in simulation-oriented games.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Jun 2013 13:10:01 GMT  (37kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0201v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 26 Jul 2013 08:43:46 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0201v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI", "authors": ["magnus lie hetland"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.0201"}
