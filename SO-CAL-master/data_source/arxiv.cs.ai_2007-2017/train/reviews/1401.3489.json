We start with the bounded inference mini-clustering algorithm and then move to the iterative scheme called Iterative Join-Graph Propagation (IJGP), that combines both iteration and bounded inference. Algorithm IJGP belongs to the class of Generalized Belief Propagation algorithms, a framework that allowed connections with approximate algorithms from statistical physics and is shown empirically to surpass the performance of mini-clustering and belief propagation, as well as a number of other state-of-the-art algorithms on several classes of networks. We also provide insight into the accuracy of iterative BP and IJGP by relating these algorithms to well known classes of constraint propagation schemes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:38:39 GMT  (533kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3489v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["robert mateescu", "kalev kask", "vibhav gogate", "rina dechter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3489"}
