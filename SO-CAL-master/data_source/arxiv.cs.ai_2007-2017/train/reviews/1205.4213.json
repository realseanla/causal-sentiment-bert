{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-May-2012", "title": "Online Structured Prediction via Coactive Learning", "abstract": "We propose Coactive Learning as a model of interaction between a learning system and a human user, where both have the common goal of providing results of maximum utility to the user. At each step, the system (e.g. search engine) receives a context (e.g. query) and predicts an object (e.g. ranking). The user responds by correcting the system if necessary, providing a slightly improved -- but not necessarily optimal -- object as feedback. We argue that such feedback can often be inferred from observable user behavior, for example, from clicks in web-search. Evaluating predictions by their cardinal utility to the user, we propose efficient learning algorithms that have ${\\cal O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}})$ average regret, even though the learning algorithm never observes cardinal utility values as in conventional online learning. We demonstrate the applicability of our model and learning algorithms on a movie recommendation task, as well as ranking for web-search.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 May 2012 18:19:13 GMT  (93kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4213v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:25:02 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4213v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["pannaga shivaswamy", "thorsten joachims"], "accepted": true, "id": "1205.4213"}
