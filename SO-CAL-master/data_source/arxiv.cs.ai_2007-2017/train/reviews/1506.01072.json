Previous hybrid analog CMOS-memristor approaches required extensive CMOS circuitry for training, and thus eliminated most of the density advantages gained by the adoption of memristor synapses. Further, they used different waveforms for pre and post-synaptic spikes that added undesirable circuit overhead. Here we describe a hardware architecture that can feature a large number of memristor synapses to learn real-world patterns. We present a versatile CMOS neuron that combines integrate-and-fire behavior, drives passive memristors and implements competitive learning in a compact circuit module, and enables in-situ plasticity in the memristor synapses. We demonstrate handwritten-digits recognition using the proposed architecture using transistor-level circuit simulations. As the described neuromorphic architecture is homogeneous, it realizes a fundamental building block for large-scale energy-efficient brain-inspired silicon chips that could lead to next-generation cognitive computing.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 21:35:51 GMT  (1580kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01072v1", "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, vol 5, no. 2, June 2015, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, vol. 5, no.2, June 2015"], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 20:32:49 GMT  (1190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01072v2", "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, vol 5, no. 2, June 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, vol 5, no. 2, June 2015, Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems, IEEE Journal on, vol. 5, no.2, June 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV cs.ET", "authors": ["xinyu wu", "vishal saxena", "kehan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01072"}
