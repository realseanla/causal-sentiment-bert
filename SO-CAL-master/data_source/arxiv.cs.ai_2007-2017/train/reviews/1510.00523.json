Despite its significance, AllSAT has been relatively unexplored compared to other variants. We thus survey and discuss major techniques of AllSAT solvers. We faithfully implement them and conduct comprehensive experiments using a large number of instances and various types of solvers including one of the few public softwares. The experiments reveal solver's characteristics. Our implemented solvers are made publicly available so that other researchers can easily develop their solver by modifying our codes and compare it with existing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 08:32:59 GMT  (470kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00523v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["takahisa toda", "takehide soh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.00523"}
