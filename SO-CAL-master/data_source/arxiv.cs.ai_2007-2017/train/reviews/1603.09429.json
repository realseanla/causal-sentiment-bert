To represent such problems, we use Ordinal Conditional Functions that may take infinite values. We model belief change in this context through simple arithmetical operations that allow us to capture the intuition that certain antecedents can not be validated by any number of observations. We frame our approach as a form of finite belief improvement, and we propose a model of conditional belief revision in which only the \"right\" hypothetical levels of implausibility are revised.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 00:48:40 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09429v1", "7 pages, 1 figure, presented at the International Workshop on Non-monotonic Reasoning 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure, presented at the International Workshop on Non-monotonic Reasoning 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aaron hunter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09429"}
