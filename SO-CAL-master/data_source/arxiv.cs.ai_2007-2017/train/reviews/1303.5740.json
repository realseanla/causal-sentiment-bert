One major drawback of this modeling is the inability to model uncertainties, which are often encountered in practice. In this paper, a new tool, called U-yraph, is proposed for environment modeling. A U-graph is an extension of distance graphs with the ability to handle a kind of uncertainty. By modeling an uncertain environment as a U-graph, and a navigation problem as a Markovian decision process, we can precisely define a new optimality criterion for navigation plans, and more importantly, we can come up with a general algorithm for computing optimal plans for navigation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:32:32 GMT  (335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5740v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["runping qi", "david l poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5740"}
