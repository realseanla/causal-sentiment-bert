The M stands for meta-modelling as defined by Motz, Rohrer and Severi. To show our main result, we define an ExpTime Tableau algorithm as an extension of an algorithm for checking consistency of a knowledge base in ALC by Nguyen and Szalas.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 01:31:38 GMT  (471kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03749v1", "Long version of a submitted paper, 43 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Long version of a submitted paper, 43 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["monica martinez", "edelweis rohrer", "paula severi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03749"}
