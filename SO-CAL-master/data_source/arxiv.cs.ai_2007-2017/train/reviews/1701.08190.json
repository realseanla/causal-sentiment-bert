This paper reviews the existing DM languages. We are presenting important primitives of the DM language and classifying our languages according to primitives' satisfaction. In addition, we presented languages' syntaxes and tried to apply each one to a database sample to test a set of KDD operations. This study allows us to highlight languages capabilities and limits, which is very useful for future work and perspectives.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 21:00:19 GMT  (382kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08190v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB", "authors": ["mohamed anis bach tobji"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08190"}
