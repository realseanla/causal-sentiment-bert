Our aims are to develop new machine learning approaches based on neural networks and graphical models, and to understand the capabilities of machine learning techniques relative to traditional alternatives, such as those based on constraint solving from the programming languages community.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 22:34:50 GMT  (5474kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04428v1", "50 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "50 pages, 20 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["alexander l gaunt", "marc brockschmidt", "rishabh singh", "nate kushman", "pushmeet kohli", "jonathan taylor", "daniel tarlow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04428"}
