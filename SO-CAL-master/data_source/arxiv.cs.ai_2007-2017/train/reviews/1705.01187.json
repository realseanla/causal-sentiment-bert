Automated Driving (AD) has potential to drastically reduce such accidents. In this work, we focus on the technical challenges that arise from AD in urban environments. We present the overall architecture of an AD system and describe in detail the perception and planning modules. The AD system, built on a modified Acura RLX, was demonstrated in a course in GoMentum Station in California. We demonstrated autonomous handling of 4 scenarios: traffic lights, cross-traffic at intersections, construction zones and pedestrians. The AD vehicle displayed safe behavior and performed consistently in repeated demonstrations with slight variations in conditions. Overall, we completed 44 runs, encompassing 110km of automated driving with only 3 cases where the driver intervened the control of the vehicle, mostly due to error in GPS positioning. Our demonstration showed that robust and consistent behavior in urban scenarios is possible, yet more investigation is necessary for full scale roll-out on public roads.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 22:04:59 GMT  (2019kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01187v1", "Accepted to Intelligent Vehicles Conference (IV 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to Intelligent Vehicles Conference (IV 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["akansel cosgun", "lichao ma", "jimmy chiu", "jiawei huang", "mahmut demir", "alexandre miranda anon", "thang lian", "hasan tafish", "samir al-stouhi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01187"}
