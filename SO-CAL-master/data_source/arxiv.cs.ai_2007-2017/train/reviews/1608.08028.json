In contrast to earlier work, we study not only the effect of interventions on equilibrium states; rather, we model asymptotic behaviour that is dynamic under interventions that vary in time, and include as a special case the study of static equilibria.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 12:43:42 GMT  (175kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08028v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul k rubenstein", "stephan bongers", "joris m mooij", "bernhard schoelkopf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08028"}
