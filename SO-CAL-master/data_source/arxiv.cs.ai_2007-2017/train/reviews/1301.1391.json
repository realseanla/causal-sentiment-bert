The aim of this paper is to investigate theoretically how SAT can be utilized for the efficient solution of problems that are harder than NP or co-NP. In particular, we consider the fundamental reasoning problems in propositional disjunctive answer set programming (ASP), Brave Reasoning and Cautious Reasoning, which ask whether a given atom is contained in at least one or in all answer sets, respectively. Both problems are located at the second level of the Polynomial Hierarchy and thus assumed to be harder than NP or co-NP. We cannot transform these two reasoning problems to SAT in polynomial time, unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:37 GMT  (156kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1391v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 May 2013 17:17:43 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1391v2", "A short version will appear in the Proceedings of the Proceedings of the 27th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'13).
