In order to achieve this, the main concepts in Pattern Recognition area are described because the AIML uses such theoretical framework in their syntactic and semantic structures. After that, AIML language is described and each AIML command/tag is followed by an application example. Also, the usage of AIML embedded tags for the handling of sequence dialogue limitations between humans and machines is shown. Finally, computer systems that assist in the design of chatterbots with the AIML language are classified and described.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:49:43 GMT  (410kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3091v1", "International Journal of Computer science and engineering Survey (IJCSES) - 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Computer science and engineering Survey (IJCSES) - 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["maria das gra\\c{c}as bruno marietto", "rafael varago de aguiar", "gislene de oliveira barbosa", "wagner tanaka botelho", "edson pimentel", "robson dos santos fran\\c{c}a", "vera l\\'ucia da silva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3091"}
