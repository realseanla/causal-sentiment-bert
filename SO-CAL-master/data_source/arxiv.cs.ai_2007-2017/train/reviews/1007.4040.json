In this paper, we generalize the notions of completion and loop formulas of logic programs to description logic programs and show that the answer sets of a dl-program can be precisely captured by the models of its completion and loop formulas. Furthermore, we propose a new, alternative semantics for dl-programs, called the {\\em canonical answer set semantics}, which is defined by the models of completion that satisfy what are called canonical loop formulas. A desirable property of canonical answer sets is that they are free of circular justifications. Some properties of canonical answer sets are also explored.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 04:48:19 GMT  (73kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.4040v1", "29 pages, 1 figures (in pdf), a short version appeared in ICLP'10"]], "COMMENTS": "29 pages, 1 figures (in pdf), a short version appeared in ICLP'10", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["yisong wang", "jia-huai you", "li yan yuan", "yi-dong shen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1007.4040"}
