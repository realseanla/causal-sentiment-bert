In this work, these operators are used to compute topological relations between objects defined by the constraints of the nine Intersection Model (9-IM) from Egenhofer. With the help of these constraints, we define a procedure to compute the topological relations on CSG objects. These topological relations are Disjoint, Contains, Inside, Covers, CoveredBy, Equals and Overlaps, and are defined in a top-level ontology with a specific semantic definition on relation such as Transitive, Symmetric, Asymmetric, Functional, Reflexive, and Irreflexive. The results of topological relations computation are stored in the ontology allowing after what to infer on these topological relationships. In addition, logic rules based on the Semantic Web Language allows the definition of logic programs that define which topological relationships have to be computed on which kind of objects. For instance, a \"Building\" that overlaps a \"Railway\" is a \"RailStation\".", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Jan 2013 08:13:54 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4780v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CG cs.AI", "authors": ["helmi ben hmida", "christophe cruz", "frank boochs", "christophe nicolle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.4780"}
