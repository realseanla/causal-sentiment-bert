It relies on the use of virtual agents that are capable to react in real time to a human interlocutor's expressed affects, through the detection of non-verbal cues, their analysis and their interpretation in the context of the job interview situation. Our system build affective states and beliefs about a real user in interaction with a virtual character. To this end, we rely on real-time social cue recognition, communicative performance computation and affective computation/decision from the recruiter. Indeed, building a credible job interview simulation with a reactive virtual agent requires to perceive the applicant in order to understand its reactions and adapt to his performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 15:38:43 GMT  (487kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5039v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Feb 2014 11:04:53 GMT  (541kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5039v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["haza\u007fel jones", "nicolas sabouret", "ionut damian", "tobias baur", "elisabeth", "r\\'e", "ka\\'ska porayska-pomsta", "paola rizzo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5039"}
