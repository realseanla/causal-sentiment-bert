The design variables subject to optimization are window position and size, overhangs, fins, wall positioning, and building orientation. A procedure using a transformation operator with gradient descent, such as behavior, coupled with a dynamic simulation engine was developed for the thermal evaluation and optimization process. However, the need to evaluate all possible alternatives regarding designing variables being used during the optimization process leads to an intensive use of thermal simulation, which dramatically increases the simulation time, rendering it unpractical. An alternative approach is a smart optimization approach, which utilizes an oriented and adaptive search technique to efficiently find the near optimum solution. This paper presents the search methodology for the building orientation of floor plan designs, and the corresponding efficiency and effectiveness indicators. The calculations are based on 100 floor plan designs generated by EPSAP. All floor plans have the same design program, location, and weather data, changing only their geometry. Dynamic simulation of buildings was effectively used together with the optimization procedure in this approach to significantly improve the designs. The use of the orientation variable has been included in the algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 21:24:53 GMT  (780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6883v1", "10 pages, 6 figures, conference paper"], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Aug 2013 16:37:33 GMT  (780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6883v2", "10 pages, 6 figures, conference paper; Proceedings of CLIMA 2013 16-19 June 2013 Prague Czech Republic (2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 6 figures, conference paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.AI", "authors": ["eug\\'enio rodrigues", "ad\\'elio rodrigues gaspar", "\\'alvaro gomes adai-laeta department of mechanical engineering university of coimbra inescc department of electrical", "computer engineering", "university of coimbra)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.6883"}
