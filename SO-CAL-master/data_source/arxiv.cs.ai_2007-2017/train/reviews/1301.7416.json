Such reduction is interesting because it enables one to readily use one's favorite BN inference algorithm to efficiently evaluate IDs. Two such reduction methods have been proposed previously (Cooper 1988, Shachter and Peot 1992). This paper proposes a new method. The BN inference problems induced by the mew method are much easier to solve than those induced by the two previous methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:07:07 GMT  (329kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7416v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7416"}
