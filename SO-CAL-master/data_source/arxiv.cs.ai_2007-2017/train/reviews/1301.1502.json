The classification problems in medical area often classify medical dataset based on the result of medical diagnosis or description of medical treatment by the medical practitioner. This research work discusses the classification process of Gene Expression data for three different cancers which are breast cancer, lung cancer and leukemia cancer with two classes which are cancerous stage and non cancerous stage. We have applied a fuzzy soft set similarity based classifier to enhance the accuracy to predict the stages among cancer genes and the informative genes are selected by using Entopy filtering.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 11:48:49 GMT  (456kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1502v1", "7 pages, IJSER Vol.3 Issue: 10 Oct 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, IJSER Vol.3 Issue: 10 Oct 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CE", "authors": ["n kalaiselvi", "h hannah inbarani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1502"}
