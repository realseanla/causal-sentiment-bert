Even during the development process visualisations can be a great help to the developer. We created IDPD3 as a library to visualise models of logic theories. IDPD3 is a new version of $ID^{P}_{Draw}$ and adds support for visualised interactive simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:40:57 GMT  (457kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00928v1", "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 67-81, August 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 67-81, August 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["ruben lapauw", "ingmar dasseville", "marc denecker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00928"}
