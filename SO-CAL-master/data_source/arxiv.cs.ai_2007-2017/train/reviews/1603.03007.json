The working metaphor we use is the \"day\" and \"night\" phases of mammalian life. During the \"day\" phase a robotic system stores the inbound information and is controlled by a light-weight rule-based system in real time. In contrast to that, during the \"night\" phase the stored information is been transferred to the supercomputing system to update the realistic neural network: emotional and behavioral strategies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Mar 2016 19:14:27 GMT  (24kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03007v1", "keywords: robotics, spiking neural networks, artificial emotions, affective computing"]], "COMMENTS": "keywords: robotics, spiking neural networks, artificial emotions, affective computing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander tchitchigin", "max talanov", "larisa safina", "manuel mazzara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03007"}
