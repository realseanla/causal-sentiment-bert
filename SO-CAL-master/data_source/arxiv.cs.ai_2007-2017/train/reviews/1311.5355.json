In the present paper we construct a fuzzy model for the reasoning process giving through the calculation of the possibilities of all possible individuals' profiles a quantitative/qualitative view of their behaviour during the above process and we use the centroid defuzzification technique for measuring the reasoning skills. We also present a number of classroom experiments illustrating our results in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Nov 2013 10:35:57 GMT  (1682kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5355v1", "16 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1212.2614"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 3 figures, 1 table. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1212.2614", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael gr voskoglou", "igor ya subbotin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.5355"}
