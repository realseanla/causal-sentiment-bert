This paper proposes the EmbeddedHunter algorithm, which incorporates the technique in a hierarchical stochastic bandit setting, following the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle and breaking away from the multiple-run framework in which random embedding has been conventionally applied similar to stochastic black-box optimization solvers. Our proposition is motivated by the bounded mean variation in the objective value for a low-dimensional point projected randomly into the decision space of Lipschitz-continuous problems. In essence, the EmbeddedHunter algorithm expands optimistically a partitioning tree over a low-dimensional---equal to the effective dimension of the problem---search space based on a bounded number of random embeddings of sampled points from the low-dimensional space. In contrast to the probabilistic theoretical guarantees of multiple-run random-embedding algorithms, the finite-time analysis of the proposed algorithm presents a theoretical upper bound on the regret as a function of the algorithm's number of iterations. Furthermore, numerical experiments were conducted to validate its performance. The results show a clear performance gain over recently proposed random embedding methods for large-scale problems, provided the intrinsic dimensionality is low.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 02:18:09 GMT  (320kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08773v1", "To appear at AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI math.OC", "authors": ["abdullah al-dujaili", "sundaram suresh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.08773"}
