However, writing ASP models is not trivial. We propose a novel method, called Sketched Answer Set Programming (SkASP), aiming at supporting the user in resolving this issue. The user writes an ASP program while marking uncertain parts open with question marks. In addition, the user provides a number of positive and negative examples of the desired program behaviour. The sketched model is rewritten into another ASP program, which is solved by traditional methods. As a result, the user obtains a functional and reusable ASP program modelling her problem. We evaluate our approach on 21 well known puzzles and combinatorial problems inspired by Karp's 21 NP-complete problems and demonstrate a use-case for a database application based on ASP.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 May 2017 11:03:53 GMT  (1455kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07429v1", "15 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sergey paramonov", "christian bessiere", "anton dries", "luc de raedt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07429"}
