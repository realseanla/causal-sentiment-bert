After an introduction to the cognitive science concepts from which this work is inspired and the current development in the use of simulation as a decision-making technique, we propose a generic framework based on theory of mind, which allows an agent to reason and perform actions using multiple simulations of automatically created or externally inputted models of the perceived environment. A description of a partial implementation is given, which aims to solve a popular game within the IJCAI2013 AIBirds contest. Results of our approach are presented, in comparison with the competition benchmark. Finally, future developments regarding the framework are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 May 2014 11:54:21 GMT  (302kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5048v1", "7 pages, 5 figures, IJCAI 2013 Symposium on AI in Angry Birds"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 5 figures, IJCAI 2013 Symposium on AI in Angry Birds", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mihai polceanu", "c\\'edric buche"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5048"}
