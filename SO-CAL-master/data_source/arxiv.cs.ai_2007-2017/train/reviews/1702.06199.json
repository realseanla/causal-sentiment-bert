The most important task in such Bayesian networks models is constructing the most reliable user models by learning and reflecting the training data into the probability distribution of user actions conditional on networks states. This paper provides an overall picture of the learning process in a Bayesian framework with an emphasize on the state-of-the-art theoretical analyses of the Expectation Maximization learning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 22:43:54 GMT  (357kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06199v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["quan nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06199"}
