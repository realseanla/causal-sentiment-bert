Given the information network, the intraclass similarity score s(a, b) is high if the set of objects that are related with a and the set of objects that are related with b are pair-wise similar according to all imposed relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 14:10:04 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06818v1", "Submited on KDD'15"]], "COMMENTS": "Submited on KDD'15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ben usman", "ivan oseledets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.06818"}
