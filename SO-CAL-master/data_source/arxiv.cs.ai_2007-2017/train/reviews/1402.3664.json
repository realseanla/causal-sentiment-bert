In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the parameter estimation in the case where belief structures are uncertain and represented as interval-valued belief structures. Within our proposed method, the maximization of likelihood criterion and minimization of estimated parameter's uncertainty are taken into consideration simultaneously. As an illustration, the proposed method is employed to estimate parameters for deterministic and uncertain belief structures, which demonstrates its effectiveness and versatility.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Feb 2014 08:07:49 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3664v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["xinyang deng", "yong hu", "felix chan", "sankaran mahadevan", "yong deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.3664"}
