We address Bayesian active learning and experimental design problems, where we sequentially select tests to reduce uncertainty about a set of hypotheses. Instead of minimizing uncertainty per se, we consider a set of overlapping decision regions of these hypotheses. Our goal is to drive uncertainty into a single decision region as quickly as possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Feb 2014 16:59:21 GMT  (6536kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5886v1", "Extended version of work appearing in the International conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of work appearing in the International conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["shervin javdani", "yuxin chen", "amin karbasi", "reas krause", "j", "rew bagnell", "siddhartha srinivasa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5886"}
