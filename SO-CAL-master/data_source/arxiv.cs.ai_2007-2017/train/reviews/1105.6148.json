Negating facts can be achieved by asking the user for constants that do not appear elsewhere in the knowledge base.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2011 02:19:21 GMT  (154kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6148v1", "8 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Mar 2013 23:40:11 GMT  (188kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6148v2", "8 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m a el-dosuky", "t t hamza", "m z rashad", "a h naguib"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.6148"}
