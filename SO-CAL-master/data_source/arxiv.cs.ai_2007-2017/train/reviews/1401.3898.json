We investigate the precise relationship between the first-order stable model semantics and first-order loop formulas, and study conditions under which the former can be represented by the latter. In order to facilitate the comparison, we extend the definition of a first-order loop formula which was limited to a nondisjunctive program, to a disjunctive program and to an arbitrary first-order theory. Based on the studied relationship we extend the syntax of a logic program with explicit quantifiers, which allows us to do reasoning involving non-Herbrand stable models using first-order reasoners. Such programs can be viewed as a special class of first-order theories under the stable model semantics, which yields more succinct loop formulas than the general language due to their restricted syntax.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:18:54 GMT  (541kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3898v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["joohyung lee", "yunsong meng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3898"}
