Still, today the experts use visual tools for analyzing the data. In order to make the task realistic, a method has been proposed in this paper to automatically detect the different patterns in buildings. The K Means clustering is used to automatically identify the ON (operational) cycles of the chiller. In the next step the ON cycles are transformed to symbolic representation by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) method. Then the SAX symbols are converted to bag of words representation for hierarchical clustering. Moreover, the proposed technique is applied to real life data of adsorption chiller. Additionally, the results from the proposed method and dynamic time warping (DTW) approach are also discussed and compared.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 18:11:32 GMT  (1047kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01398v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["usman habib", "gerhard zucker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01398"}
