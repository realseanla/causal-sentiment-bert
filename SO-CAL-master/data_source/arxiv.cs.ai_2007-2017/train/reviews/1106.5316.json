This models situations where agents arrive and depart during the process of dividing a resource. We show that well known fair division procedures like cut-and-choose and the Dubins-Spanier moving knife procedure can be adapted to apply to such online problems. We propose some fairness properties that online cake cutting procedures can possess like online forms of proportionality and envy-freeness. We also consider the impact of collusion between agents. Finally, we study theoretically and empirically the competitive ratio of these online cake cutting procedures. Based on its resistance to collusion, and its good performance in practice, our results favour the online version of the cut-and-choose procedure over the online version of the moving knife procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 07:13:37 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5316v1", "To appear in the Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2011)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2011)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.5316"}
