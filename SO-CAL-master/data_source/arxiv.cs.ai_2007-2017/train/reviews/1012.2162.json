A closer examination, however, shows that the fundamental property---nondeterminism---in nondeterministic finite automata has not been well embodied in the generalization. In this paper, we introduce nondeterministic fuzzy automata with or without $\\el$-moves and fuzzy languages recognized by them. Furthermore, we prove that (deterministic) fuzzy automata, nondeterministic fuzzy automata, and nondeterministic fuzzy automata with $\\el$-moves are all equivalent in the sense that they recognize the same class of fuzzy languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Dec 2010 02:42:30 GMT  (114kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2162v1", "14 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yongzhi cao", "yoshinori ezawa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.2162"}
