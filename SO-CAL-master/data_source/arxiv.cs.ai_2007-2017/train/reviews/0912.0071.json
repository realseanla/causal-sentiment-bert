Chaudhuri and Monteleoni (2008) recently provided privacy-preserving techniques for learning linear separators via regularized logistic regression. With the goal of handling large databases that may not be linearly separable, we provide privacy-preserving support vector machine algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 04:35:44 GMT  (47kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071v1", "Submitted to AISTATS 2010"], ["v2", "Mon, 22 Feb 2010 19:33:44 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071v2", "Under review"], ["v3", "Tue, 23 Feb 2010 05:26:22 GMT  (75kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071v3", "Under review"], ["v4", "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 23:16:36 GMT  (217kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071v4", "40 pages, 7 figures, under review"], ["v5", "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 22:35:55 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0071v5", "40 pages, 7 figures, accepted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to AISTATS 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CR cs.DB", "authors": ["kamalika chaudhuri", "claire monteleoni", "anand d sarwate"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.0071"}
