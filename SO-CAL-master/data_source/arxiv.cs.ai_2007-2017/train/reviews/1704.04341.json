The language is a variant of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that is extended to probabilistic specifications in a way that permits approximations to be learned in finite time. We provide several small environments that demonstrate the advantages of our geometric LTL (GLTL) language and illustrate how it can be used to specify standard reinforcement-learning tasks straightforwardly.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 03:41:59 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04341v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael l littman", "ufuk topcu", "jie fu", "charles isbell", "min wen", "james macglashan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04341"}
