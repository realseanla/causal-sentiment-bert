This design process consists of the following: (i) definition of a set of time/logical points; (ii) modular design of the system for each time/logical point (e.g., on the basis of combinatorial synthesis as hierarchical morphological design or multiple choice problem) to obtain several system solutions; (iii) selection of the system solution for each time/logical point while taking into account their quality and the quality of compatibility between neighbor selected system solutions (here, combinatorial synthesis is used as well). Mainly, the examined time/logical points are based on a time chain. In addition, two complicated cases are considered: (a) the examined logical points are based on a tree-like structure, (b) the examined logical points are based on a digraph. Numerical examples illustrate the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Jun 2013 18:07:54 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4635v1", "13 pages, 25 figures, 14 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 25 figures, 14 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SY", "authors": ["mark sh levin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.4635"}
