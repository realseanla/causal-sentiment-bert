We present a method of how to induce a theory (i.e. a semantic description) of the meaning of a command in terms of a minimal set of background knowledge. The only thing we have is a sequence of observations from which we extract what kinds of effects were caused by performing the command. This way, we yield a description of the semantics of the action and, hence, a definition.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 20:33:34 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7303v1", "KRR Workshop at ICLP 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "KRR Workshop at ICLP 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["martin e mueller", "madhura d thosar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7303"}
