Utilizing the strengths of both methods, such hybrid inference methods has the potential of expanding the class of problems which can be solved under bounded resources as well as solving problems which otherwise resist exact solutions. The paper provides a detailed description of a particular instance of such a hybrid scheme; namely, combination of exact inference and Gibbs sampling in discrete Bayesian networks. We argue that this combination calls for an extension of the usual message passing scheme of ordinary junction trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:22:22 GMT  (331kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4968v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["uffe kj{\\ae}rulff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4968"}
