We provide a semantic characterization of rational closure in SHIQ in terms of a preferential semantics, based on a finite rank characterization of minimal models. We show that the rational closure of a TBox can be computed in EXPTIME using entailment in SHIQ.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 20:16:30 GMT  (67kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2023v1", "30 pages, extended version of paper accepted to DL2014"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages, extended version of paper accepted to DL2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["laura giordano", "valentina gliozzi", "nicola olivetti", "gian luca pozzato"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2023"}
