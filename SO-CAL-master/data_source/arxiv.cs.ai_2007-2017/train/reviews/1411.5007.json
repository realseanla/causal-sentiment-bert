Immediately after its inception, two competing and seemingly different approaches emerged---one an application of no-regret online learning, the other a sophisticated gradient method applied to a convex-concave saddle-point formulation. Since then, both approaches have grown in relative isolation with advancements on one side not effecting the other. In this paper, we rectify this by dissecting and, in a sense, unify the two views.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 20:43:39 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5007v1", "AAAI Workshop on Computer Poker and Imperfect Information"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI Workshop on Computer Poker and Imperfect Information", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["kevin waugh", "j", "rew bagnell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.5007"}
