Credibility theory is used to model the problem and specifies a preference index at which it is desired that the travel times to reach the customers fall into their time windows. We propose the integration of fuzzy and ant colony system based evolutionary algorithm to solve the problem while preserving the constraints. Computational results for certain benchmark problems having short and long time horizons are presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm. Comparison between different preferences indexes have been obtained to help the user in making suitable decisions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 06:11:48 GMT  (467kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3806v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CE cs.NE", "authors": ["sandhya bansal", "v katiyar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.3806"}
