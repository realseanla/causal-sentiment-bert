It aims at bridging the gap between symbolic and subsymbolic processing. Instances are represented by points in a high-dimensional space and concepts are represented by convex regions in this space. In this paper, we present our approach towards grounding the dimensions of a conceptual space in latent spaces learned by an InfoGAN from unlabeled data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 11:59:06 GMT  (203kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04825v1", "accepted at NeSy 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted at NeSy 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["lucas bechberger", "kai-uwe k\\\"uhnberger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04825"}
