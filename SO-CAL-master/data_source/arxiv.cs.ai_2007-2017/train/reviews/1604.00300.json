In this paper, we propose a SAT formulation of the problem to successfully mine frequent flexible sequences occurring in transactional datasets. Our SAT-based approach can easily be extended with extra constraints to address a broad range of pattern mining applications. To demonstrate this claim, we formulate and add several constraints, such as gap and span constraints, to our model in order to extract more specific patterns. We also use interactive solving to perform important derived tasks, such as closed pattern mining or maximal pattern mining. Finally, we prove the practical feasibility of our SAT model by running experiments on two real datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 15:49:51 GMT  (45kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00300v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["r\\'emi coletta", "benjamin negrevergne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00300"}
