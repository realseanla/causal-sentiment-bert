The latter is presented with experimental results on a linear Gaussian model and a non-parametric dependent Dirichlet process mixture of objects model for object recognition and tracking.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 23:48:55 GMT  (2695kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00075v1", "Supervisor: Frank Wood.
