When performing conflict analysis, sensitivity analysis, or when answering questions like \"What if the finding on X had been y instead of x?\" you need probabilities P (e'| h), where e' is a subset of e, and h is a configuration of a (possibly empty) set of variables. Cautious propagation is a modification of HUGIN propagation into a Shafer-Shenoy-like architecture. It is less efficient than HUGIN propagation; however, it provides easy access to P (e'| h) for a great deal of relevant subsets e'.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:50 GMT  (258kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4962v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["finn verner jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4962"}
