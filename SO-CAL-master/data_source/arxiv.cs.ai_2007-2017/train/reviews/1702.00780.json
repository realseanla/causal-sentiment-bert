ASPIC+ does not place such a requirement on arguments, instead requiring that every rule and fact that are part of an argument be used in its construction. Thus ASPIC+ arguments are minimal in the sense that removing any element of the argument would lead to a structure that is not an argument. In this brief note we discuss these two types of minimality and show how the first kind of minimality can, if desired, be recovered in ASPIC+.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 18:45:38 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00780v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["zimi li", "rea cohen", "simon parsons"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00780"}
