The process is sometimes assisted by software tools that facilitate the information extraction from a textual corpus. Despite of the great use of XML Schema files on the internet and especially in the B2B domain, tools that offer a complete semantic analysis of XML schemas are really rare. In this paper we introduce Janus, a tool for automatically building a reference knowledge base starting from XML Schema files. Janus also provides different useful views to simplify B2B application integration.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 10:38:51 GMT  (162kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.4892v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI", "authors": ["ivan bedini", "benjamin nguyen", "georges gardarin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.4892"}
