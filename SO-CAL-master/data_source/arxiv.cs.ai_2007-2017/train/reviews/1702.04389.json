Currently, the Samu Entropy project specifies only requirements for new esport games to be developed with particular attention to the investigation of the relationship between esport and artificial intelligence. It is quite obvious that there is a very close and natural relationship between esport games and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the project Samu Entropy focuses not only on using artificial intelligence, but on creating AI in a new way. We present a reference game called Face Battle that implements the Samu Entropy requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 21:18:17 GMT  (880kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04389v1", "15 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["norbert b\\'atfai", "ren\\'at\\'o besenczi", "gerg\\h{o} bogacsovics", "fanny monori"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04389"}
