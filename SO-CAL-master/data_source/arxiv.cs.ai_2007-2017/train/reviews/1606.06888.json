However, under general forms of state uncertainty as considered in the Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG), such decision making problems are still not very well understood. This paper makes a contribution to the theory of zero-sum POSGs by characterizing structure in their value function. In particular, we introduce a new formulation of the value function for zs-POSGs as a function of the \"plan-time sufficient statistics\" (roughly speaking the information distribution in the POSG), which has the potential to enable generalization over such information distributions. We further delineate this generalization capability by proving a structural result on the shape of value function: it exhibits concavity and convexity with respect to appropriately chosen marginals of the statistic space. This result is a key pre-cursor for developing solution methods that may be able to exploit such structure. Finally, we show how these results allow us to reduce a zs-POSG to a \"centralized\" model with shared observations, thereby transferring results for the latter, narrower class, to games with individual (private) observations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 10:41:04 GMT  (64kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06888v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["auke j wiggers", "frans a oliehoek", "diederik m roijers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06888"}
