(2002) in order to represent the dynamic dependencies among stochastic processes. These dependencies are based on a generalization of Granger-causality to continuous time, first developed by Schweder (1970) for Markov processes, who called them local dependencies. They deserve special attention as they are asymmetric unlike stochastic (in)dependence. In this paper we focus on their graphical representation and develop a suitable, i.e. asymmetric notion of separation, called delta-separation. The properties of this graph separation as well as of local independence are investigated in detail within a framework of asymmetric (semi)graphoids allowing a deeper insight into what information can be read off these graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:20:13 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6841v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vanessa didelez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6841"}
