In many situations, these parameters are themselves random variables - this may reflect the uncertainty of the domain expert, or may come from atraining sample used to estimate the parameter values. The distribution overthese \"CPtable variables\" induces a distribution over the response the BNwill return to any \"What is Pr(H | E)?\" query. This paper investigates thevariance of this response, showing first that it is asymptotically normal,then providing its mean and asymptotical variance. We then present aneffective general algorithm for computing this variance, which has the samecomplexity as simply computing the (mean value of) the response itself - ie,O(n 2^w), where n is the number of variables and w is the effective treewidth. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that this algorithm, whichincorporates assumptions and approximations, works effectively in practice,given only small samples.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:44 GMT  (988kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2313v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tim van allen", "russell greiner", "peter hooper"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2313"}
