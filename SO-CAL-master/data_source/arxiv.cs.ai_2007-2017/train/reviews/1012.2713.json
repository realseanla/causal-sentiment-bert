By analyzing features of plan modification in conformant planning problems, quantitative results are obtained. If the number of operators is less than, almost all conformant planning problems can't be solved with plan modification. If the number of operators is more than, almost all conformant planning problems can be solved with plan modification. The results of the experiments also show that there exists an experimental threshold of density (ratio of number of operators to number of propositions), which separates the region where almost all conformant planning problems can't be solved with plan modification from the region where almost all conformant planning problems can be solved with plan modification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 12:42:15 GMT  (3750kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2713v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["junping zhou", "minghao yin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.2713"}
