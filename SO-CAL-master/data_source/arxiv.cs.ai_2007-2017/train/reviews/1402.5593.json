The experiment was described in `The Impact of Social Comparisons on Reciprocity' by G\\\"achter et al. 2012. Since this paper uses state-of-art data science techniques, the results provide a different point of view on the problem. As already shown in relevant literature from experimental economics, human decisions deviate from rational payoff maximization. The average gift rate was $31$%. Gift rate was under no conditions zero. Further, we derive some special findings and calculate their significance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Feb 2014 10:07:59 GMT  (125kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5593v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rustam tagiew", "dmitry i ignatov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5593"}
