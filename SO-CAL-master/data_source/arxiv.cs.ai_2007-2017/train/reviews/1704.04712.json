To address this problem, we propose a learn-memorize-recall-reduce paradigm for robotic cloud computing. The learning stage converts incoming unstructured data into structured data; the memorization stage provides effective storage for the massive amount of data; the recall stage provides efficient means to retrieve the raw data; while the reduction stage provides means to make sense of this massive amount of unstructured data with limited computing resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Apr 2017 02:55:07 GMT  (697kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04712v1", "6 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 00:20:51 GMT  (697kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04712v2", "6 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["shaoshan liu", "bolin ding", "jie tang", "dawei sun", "zhe zhang", "grace tsai", "jean-luc gaudiot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04712"}
