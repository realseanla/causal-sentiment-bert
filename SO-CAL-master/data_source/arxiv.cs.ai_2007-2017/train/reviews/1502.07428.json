This subset needs to inherently reflect the type of information contained in the entire set, while minimizing redundancy. For such purposes, clustering may seem like a natural approach. However, existing clustering methods are not ideally suited for representative selection, especially when dealing with non-metric data, where only a pairwise similarity measure exists. In this paper we propose $\\delta$-medoids, a novel approach that can be viewed as an extension to the $k$-medoids algorithm and is specifically suited for sample representative selection from non-metric data. We empirically validate $\\delta$-medoids in two domains, namely music analysis and motion analysis. We also show some theoretical bounds on the performance of $\\delta$-medoids and the hardness of representative selection in general.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 04:16:31 GMT  (1240kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07428v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 22:44:29 GMT  (1237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07428v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["elad liebman", "benny chor", "peter stone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.07428"}
