This goes beyond classical sentiment analysis, and also much further than customer profiling. The purpose here is to have a characterisation of users in terms of personality traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. While this is an incipient area of research, we ask the question of whether cognitive abilities, and intelligence in particular, are also measurable from user profiles. However, we pose the question as broadly as possible in terms of subjects, in the context of universal psychometrics, including humans, machines and hybrids. Namely, in this paper we analyse the following question: is it possible to measure the intelligence of humans and (non-human) bots in a social network or a game just from their user profiles, i.e., by observation, without the use of interactive tests, such as IQ tests, the Turing test or other more principled machine intelligence tests?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 May 2013 21:39:57 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1655v1", "Keywords: intelligence; user profiles; cognitive abilities; social networks; universal psychometrics; games; virtual worlds"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: intelligence; user profiles; cognitive abilities; social networks; universal psychometrics; games; virtual worlds", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1655"}
