{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jun-2016", "title": "Adding Context to Concept Trees", "abstract": "Concept Trees are a type of database that can organise arbitrary textual information using a very simple rule. Each tree tries to represent a single cohesive concept and the trees can link with each other for navigation and semantic purposes. The trees are therefore a type of semantic network and would benefit from having a consistent level of context for each of the nodes. The Concept Tree nodes have a mathematical basis allowing for a consistent build process. These would represent nouns or verbs in a text sentence, for example. New to the design can then be lists of descriptive elements for each of the nodes. The descriptors can also be weighted, but do not have to follow the strict counting rule of the tree nodes. With the new descriptive layers, a much richer type of knowledge can be achieved and still reasoned over automatically. The linking structure of the licas network is very relevant to building the concept trees now and forms the basis for their construction. The concept tree - symbolic neural network relation is also extended further.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 17:32:11 GMT  (522kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05597v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 10:58:32 GMT  (747kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05597v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kieran greer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05597"}
