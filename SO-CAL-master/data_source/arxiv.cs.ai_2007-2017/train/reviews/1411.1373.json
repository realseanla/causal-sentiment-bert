The behavior of future AI systems can be described by mathematical equations, which are adapted to analyze possible unintended AI behaviors and ways that AI designs can avoid them. This article also discusses how future AI will differ from current AI, the politics of AI, and the ultimate use of AI to help understand the nature of the universe and our place in it.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 19:40:02 GMT  (1771kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1373v1", "165 pages, 34 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Nov 2014 19:11:41 GMT  (1782kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1373v2", "167 pages, 34 figures.
