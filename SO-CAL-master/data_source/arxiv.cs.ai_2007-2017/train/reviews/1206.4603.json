Collaborative filtering tasks, on the other hand, learn to model user's preferences over items. In this paper we study the joint problem of recommending items to a user with respect to a given query, which is a surprisingly common task. This setup differs from the standard collaborative filtering one in that we are given a query x user x item tensor for training instead of the more traditional user x item matrix. Compared to document retrieval we do have a query, but we may or may not have content features (we will consider both cases) and we can also take account of the user's profile. We introduce a factorized model for this new task that optimizes the top-ranked items returned for the given query and user. We report empirical results where it outperforms several baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:41:20 GMT  (223kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4603v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["jason weston", "chong wang", "ron j weiss", "adam berenzweig"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4603"}
