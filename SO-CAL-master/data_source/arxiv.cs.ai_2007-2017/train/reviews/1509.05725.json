Backdoor sets to heterogeneous base classes can be much smaller than backdoor sets to homogeneous ones, hence they are much more desirable but possibly harder to find. We draw a detailed complexity landscape for the problem of detecting strong and weak backdoor sets into heterogeneous base classes for SAT and CSP.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 17:39:33 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05725v1", "a preliminary version appeared in Proc.
