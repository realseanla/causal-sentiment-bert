This paper derives a general formula for such instrumental variables, that is, exogenous variables that directly affect some variables but not all. With the help of this formula, it is possible to test whether a model involving instrumental variables may account for the data, or, conversely, whether a given variables can be deemed instrumental.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:04 GMT  (351kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4976v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4976"}
