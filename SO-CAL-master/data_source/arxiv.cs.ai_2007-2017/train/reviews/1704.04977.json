This paper introduces a class of probabilistic programs for formulating and solving these problems. The formulation uses randomized path planning algorithms as the basis for probabilistic models of the process by which autonomous agents plan to achieve their goals. Because these path planning algorithms do not have tractable likelihood functions, new inference algorithms are needed. This paper proposes two Monte Carlo techniques for these \"likelihood-free\" models, one of which can use likelihood estimates from neural networks to accelerate inference. The paper demonstrates efficacy on three simple examples, each using under 50 lines of probabilistic code.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 14:34:02 GMT  (3995kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04977v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 14:40:03 GMT  (3995kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04977v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marco f cusumano-towner", "alexey radul", "david wingate", "vikash k mansinghka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04977"}
