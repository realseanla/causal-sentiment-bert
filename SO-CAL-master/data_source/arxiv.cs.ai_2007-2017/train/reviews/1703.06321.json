In this paper we show how they can be used to solve the Goddard problem. We present results of numerical experiments with this problem and compare the solutions provided by influence diagrams with the optimal solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Mar 2017 17:25:55 GMT  (49kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06321v1", "10 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 08:11:19 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06321v2", "10 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ji\\v{r}\\'i vomlel", "v\\'aclav kratochv\\'il"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06321"}
