The probability distribution is encoded into a Boolean normal form and compiled to a target language, in order to represent local structure expressed among conditional probabilities more efficiently. We show that further improvements are possible, by exploiting the knowledge that is lost during the encoding phase and incorporating it into a compiler inspired by Satisfiability Modulo Theories. Constraints among variables are used as a background theory, which allows us to optimize the Shannon decomposition. We propose a new language, called Weighted Positive Binary Decision Diagrams, that reduces the cost of probabilistic inference by using this decomposition variant to induce an arithmetic circuit of reduced size.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 11:58:28 GMT  (258kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05551v1", "30 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "30 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["giso h dal", "peter j f lucas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05551"}
