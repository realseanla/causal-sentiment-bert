Recursive structural equation models are one kind of DAG model. However, non-recursive structural equation models of the kinds used to model economic processes are naturally represented by directed cyclic graphs with independent errors, a characterization of conditional independence errors, a characterization of conditional independence constraints is obtained, and it is shown that the result generalizes in a natural way to systems in which the error variables or noises are statistically dependent. For non-linear systems with independent errors a sufficient condition for conditional independence of variables in associated distributions is obtained.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:23:34 GMT  (420kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4982v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter l spirtes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4982"}
