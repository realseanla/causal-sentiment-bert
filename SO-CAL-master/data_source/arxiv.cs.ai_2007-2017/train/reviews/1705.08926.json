There is a great need for new reinforcement learning methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the agents' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single agent's action, while keeping the other agents' actions fixed. COMA also uses a critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing agents are competitive with state-of-the-art centralised controllers that get access to the full state.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 May 2017 18:52:17 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["jakob foerster", "gregory farquhar", "triantafyllos afouras", "nantas nardelli", "shimon whiteson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08926"}
