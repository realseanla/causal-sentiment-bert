We describe a way to obtain higher-order theorem proving problems from Mizar articles that make use of these constructs. In particular, higher-order logic is used to represent schemes, a global choice construct and set level binders. The higher-order automated theorem provers Satallax and LEO-II have been run on collections of these problems and the results are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2016 12:37:54 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06996v1", "Accepted to CICM 2016.
