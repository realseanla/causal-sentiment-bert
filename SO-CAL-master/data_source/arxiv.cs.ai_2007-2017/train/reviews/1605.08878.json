In this paper, we now demystify the theory behind the development of the pre-assessment system followed by some computational experimentation and graph visualisation of the agent classified rules learning algorithm in the estimation and prediction of classified rules. In addition, we present some preliminary results of the pre-assessment system evaluation. From the results, it is gathered that the system has performed according to its design specification.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 May 2016 11:29:09 GMT  (1732kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08878v1", "10 pages, 15 figures, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning iJET, 11(1), 2016, PhD research work"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 15 figures, International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning iJET, 11(1), 2016, PhD research work", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["kennedy e ehimwenma", "martin beer", "paul crowther"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08878"}
