An example of an OA model is as follows: If ($x_1 = $ `blue' AND $x_2=$ `middle') OR ($x_1 = $ `yellow'), then predict $Y=1$, else predict $Y=0$. Or's of And's models have the advantage of being interpretable to human experts, since they are a set of conditions that concisely capture the characteristics of a specific subset of data. We present two optimization-based machine learning frameworks for constructing OA models, Optimized OA (OOA) and its faster version, Optimized OA with Approximations (OOAx). We prove theoretical bounds on the properties of patterns in an OA model. We build OA models as a diagnostic screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea, that achieves high accuracy with a substantial gain in interpretability over other methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 19:55:59 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02210v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tong wang", "cynthia rudin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02210"}
