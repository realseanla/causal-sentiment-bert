The integration of neural-symbolic can offer better learning and reasoning while providing a means for interpretability through the representation of symbolic knowledge. Although previous works focus intensively on supervised feedforward neural networks, little has been done for the unsupervised counterparts. In this paper we show how to integrate symbolic knowledge into unsupervised neural networks. We exemplify our approach with knowledge in different forms, including propositional logic for DNA promoter prediction and first-order logic for understanding family relationship.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 21:58:50 GMT  (56kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01991v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 04:11:21 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01991v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["son n tran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01991"}
