Considered as a basic service for answering object queries over DL ontologies, instance checking can be realized by using the most specific concept (MSC) method, which converts instance checking into subsumption problems. This method, however, loses its simplicity and efficiency when applied to large and complex ontologies, as it tends to generate very large MSC's that could lead to intractable reasoning. In this paper, we propose a revision to this MSC method for DL SHI, allowing it to generate much simpler and smaller concepts that are specific-enough to answer a given query. With independence between computed MSC's, scalability for query answering can also be achieved by distributing and parallelizing the computations. An empirical evaluation shows the efficacy of our revised MSC method and the significant efficiency achieved when using it for answering object queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 02:18:01 GMT  (329kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7585v1", "International Journal of Intelligence Science, 2014"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Feb 2015 20:23:48 GMT  (329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7585v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 17:18:41 GMT  (329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7585v3", null]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Intelligence Science, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jia xu", "patrick shironoshita", "ubbo visser", "nigel john", "mansur kabuka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7585"}
