The new proposed algorithm is data driven and self-adaptive, it adjusts its parameters to the data to make the classification operation as fast as possible. The performance of UCSC is evaluated by comparing it with the well known K-means algorithm using several artificial and real-life data sets. The experiments show that the proposed UCSC algorithm is more reliable and has high classification precision comparing to traditional classification methods such as K-means.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2012 09:44:06 GMT  (165kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.5217v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["m t al-muallim", "r el-kouatly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.5217"}
