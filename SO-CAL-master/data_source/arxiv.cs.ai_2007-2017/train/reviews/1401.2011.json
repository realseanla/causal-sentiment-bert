We propose a framework that can model this, and consider different semantics that capture different assumptions about the agents' beliefs regarding whether or not there is ambiguity. We examine the expressive power of logics of ambiguity compared to logics that cannot model ambiguity, with respect to the different semantics that we propose.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jan 2014 14:19:54 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2011v1", "Some of the material in this paper appeared in preliminary form in \"Ambiguous langage and differences of belief\" (seearXiv:1203.0699)"]], "COMMENTS": "Some of the material in this paper appeared in preliminary form in \"Ambiguous langage and differences of belief\" (seearXiv:1203.0699)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LO", "authors": ["joseph y halpern", "willemien kets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.2011"}
