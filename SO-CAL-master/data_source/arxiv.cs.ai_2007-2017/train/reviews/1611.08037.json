Different from most existing works where the profits are assumed to be static, in this work we investigate a variant that has time-dependent profits. Specifically, the profits to be collected change over time and they follow different (e.g., independent) time-varying functions. The problem is essentially NP-hard. To tackle the challenge, we present a simple and effective framework that incorporates time-variations into the fundamental planning process. Specifically, we propose a deterministic spatio-temporal representation where both spatial description and temporal logic are unified into one routing topology. By employing existing basic sorting and searching algorithms, the routing solutions can be computed in an extremely efficient way. The proposed method is easy to implement and extensive numerical results show that our approach is time efficient and generates near-optimal solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 00:07:56 GMT  (1055kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08037v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 2 Jul 2017 04:56:41 GMT  (1765kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08037v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["zhibei ma", "kai yin", "lantao liu", "gaurav s sukhatme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08037"}
