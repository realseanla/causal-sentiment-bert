The algorithm constructs adaptively efficient proposal distributions approximating the local beliefs at each note of the MRF. This is achieved by considering proposal distributions in the exponential family whose parameters are updated iterately in an Expectation Propagation (EP) framework. The proposed particle scheme provides consistent estimation of the LBP marginals as the number of particles increases. We demonstrate that it provides more accurate results than the Particle Belief Propagation (PBP) algorithm of Ihler and McAllester (2009) at a fraction of the computational cost and is additionally more robust empirically. The computational complexity of our algorithm at each iteration is quadratic in the number of particles. We also propose an accelerated implementation with sub-quadratic computational complexity which still provides consistent estimates of the loopy BP marginal distributions and performs almost as well as the original procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 09:34:21 GMT  (1512kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05934v1", "submitted to NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.CO cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["thibaut lienart", "yee whye teh", "arnaud doucet"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.05934"}
