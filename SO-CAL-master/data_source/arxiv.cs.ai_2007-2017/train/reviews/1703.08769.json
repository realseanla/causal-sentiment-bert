In this paper, we propose a new task that aims at parsing scene with a large and open vocabulary, and several evaluation metrics are explored for this problem. Our proposed approach to this problem is a joint image pixel and word concept embeddings framework, where word concepts are connected by semantic relations. We validate the open vocabulary prediction ability of our framework on ADE20K dataset which covers a wide variety of scenes and objects. We further explore the trained joint embedding space to show its interpretability.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 05:44:56 GMT  (5445kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08769v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 18:28:20 GMT  (8759kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08769v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["hang zhao", "xavier puig", "bolei zhou", "sanja fidler", "antonio torralba"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08769"}
