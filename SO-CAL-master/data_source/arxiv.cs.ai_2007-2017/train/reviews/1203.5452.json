In order to make correct decision, individuals, teams and organizations need both knowledge management (to manage content) and collaboration (to manage group processes) to make that more effective and efficient. In this paper, we explain the knowledge management and collaboration convergence. Then, we propose a formal description of mixed and multimodal decision making (MDM) process where decision may be made by three possible modes: individual, collective or hybrid. Finally, we explicit the MDM process based on UML-G profile.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 24 Mar 2012 22:18:36 GMT  (427kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5452v1", "Keywords-collaborative knowledge management; mixed decision making; dynamicity of actors; UML-G"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords-collaborative knowledge management; mixed decision making; dynamicity of actors; UML-G", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nesrine ben yahia", "narj\\`es bellamine", "henda ben ghezala"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.5452"}
