Each embedding is a vector that represents four contiguous beats of music and is derived from a symbolic representation. We consider autoencoding-based methods including denoising autoencoders, and context reconstruction, and evaluate the resulting embeddings on a forward prediction and a classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 13:35:46 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04486v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 20:09:52 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04486v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI", "authors": ["mason bretan", "sageev oore", "doug eck", "larry heck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04486"}
