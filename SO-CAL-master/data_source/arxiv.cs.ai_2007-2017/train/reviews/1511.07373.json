This, although a purely mathematical result, can be claimed to imply that every rational method to reason with uncertainty must be based on sets of extended probability distributions, where extended probability is standard probability extended with infinitesimals.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 19:24:17 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07373v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stefan arnborg", "gunnar sj\\\"odin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07373"}
