However, current spoken dialogue systems are deficient in their strategies for preventing, identifying and repairing problems that arise in the conversation. This paper reports results on automatically training a Problematic Dialogue Predictor to predict problematic human-computer dialogues using a corpus of 4692 dialogues collected with the 'How May I Help You' (SM) spoken dialogue system. The Problematic Dialogue Predictor can be immediately applied to the system's decision of whether to transfer the call to a human customer care agent, or be used as a cue to the system's dialogue manager to modify its behavior to repair problems, and even perhaps, to prevent them. We show that a Problematic Dialogue Predictor using automatically-obtainable features from the first two exchanges in the dialogue can predict problematic dialogues 13.2% more accurately than the baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:55:26 GMT  (111kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1817v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["a gorin", "i langkilde-geary", "m a walker", "j wright", "h wright hastie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1817"}
