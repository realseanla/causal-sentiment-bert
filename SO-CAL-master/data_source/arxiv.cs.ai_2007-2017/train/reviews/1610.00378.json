We add here one more tool to the toolbox: the simple observation that if one is forced to choose between a variety of possible conditioning sets for a pair of variables, one should choose the one with the highest p-value. One can use the CPC (Conservative PC, Ramsey et al., 2012) algorithm as a guide to possible sepsets for a pair of variables. However, whereas CPC uses a voting rule to classify colliders versus noncolliders, our proposed algorithm, PC-Max, picks the conditioning set with the highest p-value, so that there are no ambiguities. We combine this with two other optimizations: (a) avoiding bidirected edges in the orientation of colliders, and (b) parallelization. For (b) we borrow ideas from the PC-Stable algorithm (Colombo and Maathuis, 2014). The result is an algorithm that scales quite well both in terms of accuracy and time, with no risk of bidirected edges.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 00:47:51 GMT  (240kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00378v1", "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, technical report"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 17:24:45 GMT  (242kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00378v2", "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joseph ramsey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00378"}
