Further, we introduce three altenative measures of a fuzzy system's effectiveness connected to the above model. An applcation is also developed for the Mathematical Modelling process illustrating our results.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Dec 2012 20:31:01 GMT  (1763kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2614v1", "9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 3 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael gr voskoglou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.2614"}
