To this end, high-level robot control has seen the application of formal methods to automatically synthesize correct-by-construction controllers from user-defined specifications; synthesis fails if and only if there exists no controller that achieves the specified behavior. Recent work has also addressed the challenge of providing easy-to-understand feedback to users when a specification fails to yield a corresponding controller. Existing techniques provide feedback on portions of the specification that cause the failure, but do so at a coarse granularity. This work presents techniques for refining this feedback, extracting minimal explanations of unsynthesizability.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Sep 2014 14:50:54 GMT  (457kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1455v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["vasumathi raman", "hadas kress-gazit"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.1455"}
