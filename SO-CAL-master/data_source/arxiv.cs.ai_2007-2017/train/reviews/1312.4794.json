However, semantic annotation of the web documents is the successful way to make the Semantic Web vision a reality. This paper introduces the Semantic Web and its vision (stack layers) with regard to some concept definitions that helps the understanding of semantic annotation. Additionally, this paper introduces the semantic annotation categories, tools, domains and models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 14:12:51 GMT  (783kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4794v1", "8 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["thabet slimani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4794"}
