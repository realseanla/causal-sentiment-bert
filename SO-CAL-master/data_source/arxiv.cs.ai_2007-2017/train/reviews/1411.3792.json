We base correct simulation of the multi-agent system by a finite integer model. For verification we use model checking tool SPIN. Protocols of agents are written in Promela language and properties of the multi-agent data analysis system are expressed in logic LTL. We run several experiments with SPIN and the model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 04:39:04 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.3792v1", "In Proceedings MOD* 2014,arXiv:1411.3453"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings MOD* 2014,arXiv:1411.3453", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA cs.SE", "authors": ["natalia garanina", "eugene bodin", "elena sidorova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.3792"}
