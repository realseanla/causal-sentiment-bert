The proposed ensemble is formed with adaptive neuro-fuzzy self-organizing Kohonen maps in a parallel processing mode. A final result is chosen by the best neuro-fuzzy self-organizing Kohonen map.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:30:25 GMT  (238kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06490v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["zhengbing hu", "yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "olena o boiko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06490"}
