Recently there has been great interest in solving this problem on real-world massive graphs. For such graphs, local search is a promising approach to finding optimal or near-optimal solutions. In this paper we propose a local search algorithm that exploits reduction rules and data structures to solve the MinVC problem in such graphs. Experimental results on a wide range of real-word massive graphs show that our algorithm finds better covers than state-of-the-art local search algorithms for MinVC. Also we present interesting results about the complexities of some well-known heuristics.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Sep 2015 10:48:31 GMT  (96kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05870v1", "7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, 6 algorithms, submitted to AAAI-16"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, 6 algorithms, submitted to AAAI-16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI", "authors": ["yi fan", "chengqian li", "zongjie ma", "ljiljana brankovic", "vladimir estivill-castro", "abdul sattar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05870"}
