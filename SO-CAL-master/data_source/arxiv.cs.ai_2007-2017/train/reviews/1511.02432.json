The proposed method is called \"T-S modeling (or T-S fuzzy identification method) based on moving rate\". First, to improve the shortcomings of existing fuzzy reasoning methods based on matching degree, the moving rates for s-type, z-type and trapezoidal membership functions of T-S fuzzy model were defined. Then, the differences between proposed moving rate and existing matching degree were explained. Next, the identification method based on moving rate is proposed for T-S model. Finally, the proposed identification method is applied to the fuzzy modeling for the precipitation forecast and security situation prediction. Test results show that the proposed method significantly improves the effectiveness of fuzzy identification.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Nov 2015 03:08:52 GMT  (243kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02432v1", "24 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["son-il kwak", "gang choe", "in-song kim", "gyong-ho jo", "chol-jun hwang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02432"}
