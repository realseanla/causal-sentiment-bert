The considered subset of epistemic ATL is known to have the finite model property and decidable model-checking. This entails the decidability of validity but the implied algorithm is unfeasible. Reducing the validity problem to that in a corresponding system of CTL makes the techniques for automated deduction for that logic available for the handling of the apparently more complex system of ATL.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Mar 2013 19:06:40 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0794v1", "In Proceedings SR 2013,arXiv:1303.0071"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings SR 2013,arXiv:1303.0071", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["dimitar p guelev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0794"}
