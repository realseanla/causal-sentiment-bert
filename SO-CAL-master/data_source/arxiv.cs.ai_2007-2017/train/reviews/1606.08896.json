Despite their resemblance, the relationship has not been formally stated. In this paper, we describe the precise semantic relationship between them from a logical perspective. This is facilitated by first extending fuzzy logic to allow weights, which can be also viewed as a generalization of PSL, and then relate that generalization to MLN. We observe that the relationship between PSL and MLN is analogous to the known relationship between fuzzy logic and Boolean logic, and furthermore the weight scheme of PSL is essentially a generalization of the weight scheme of MLN for the many-valued setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 21:43:19 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08896v1", "In Working Notes of the 6th International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI"]], "COMMENTS": "In Working Notes of the 6th International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["joohyung lee", "yi wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08896"}
