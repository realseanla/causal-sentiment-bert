{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Apr-2017", "title": "Beating Atari with Natural Language Guided Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "We introduce the first deep reinforcement learning agent that learns to beat Atari games with the aid of natural language instructions. The agent uses a multimodal embedding between environment observations and natural language to self-monitor progress through a list of English instructions, granting itself reward for completing instructions in addition to increasing the game score. Our agent significantly outperforms Deep Q-Networks (DQNs), Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) agents, and the best agents posted to OpenAI Gym on what is often considered the hardest Atari 2600 environment: Montezuma's Revenge.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 21:31:29 GMT  (603kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05539v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["russell kaplan", "christopher sauer", "alexander sosa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05539"}
