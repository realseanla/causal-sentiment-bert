{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Apr-2017", "title": "Vehicle Traffic Driven Camera Placement for Better Metropolis Security Surveillance", "abstract": "Security surveillance is one of the most important issues in smart cities, especially in an era of terrorism. Deploying a number of (video) cameras is a common surveillance approach. Given the never-ending power offered by vehicles to metropolises, exploiting vehicle traffic to design camera placement strategies could potentially facilitate security surveillance. This article constitutes the first effort toward building the linkage between vehicle traffic and security surveillance, which is a critical problem for smart cities. We expect our study could influence the decision making of surveillance camera placement, and foster more research of principled ways of security surveillance beneficial to our physical-world life.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 09:27:25 GMT  (898kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08508v1", "10 pages, 2 figures, under review for IEEE Intelligent Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures, under review for IEEE Intelligent Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["xiaobo ma", "yihui he", "xiapu luo", "jianfeng li", "mengchen zhao", "bo an", "xiaohong guan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08508"}
