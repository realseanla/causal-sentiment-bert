By improving SSA data-sharing we improve global SSA. Computational ontology should provide one means toward that goal. This paper develops the ontology of the SSA domain and takes steps in the creation of a Space Situational Awareness Ontology. It follows (Rovetto, 2015) and outlines objectives, requirements and desiderata; and describes the SSA domain and discipline of ontology. The purposes of the SSA ontology are to explore the potential for ontology development and engineering to (i) represent SSA data, general knowledge, and domain objects, (ii) clearly annotate and express the meaning of that orbital, near-earth and deep-space da-ta, and (iii) foster SSA data sharing among SSA actors and space object catalogs. By improving global SSA via actionable data- and knowledge-exchange, we can achieve the broader goals (and motivations) of (iv) advancing our capacity for planetary defense from near- or deep-space ob-ects, and (v) improving spaceflight safety for future generations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 19:37:14 GMT  (794kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01924v1", "This paper can also be categorized under \"Other computer science\", or \"Databases\" or anything related to Knowledge representation, reasoning and engineering; ontology; data modeling; concept modeling.
