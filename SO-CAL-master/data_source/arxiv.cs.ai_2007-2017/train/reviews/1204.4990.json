The quality of obtained solution is directly linked to the pertinence of the used objective function. However, designing such function, which has to translate the user needs, is usually fastidious. In this paper, a method to help user objective functions designing is proposed. Our approach, which is highly interactive, is based on man machine dialogue and more particularly on the comparison of problem instance solutions by the user. We propose an experiment in the domain of cartographic generalisation that shows promising results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Apr 2012 08:02:19 GMT  (363kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4990v1", "International Conference on Information Technology and Applications, Hanoi : Viet Nam (2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "International Conference on Information Technology and Applications, Hanoi : Viet Nam (2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["patrick taillandier", "julien gaffuri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4990"}
