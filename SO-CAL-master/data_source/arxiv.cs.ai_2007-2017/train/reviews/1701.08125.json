Based on the observation that traditional design and operation concepts reach their limits, transferring more autonomy to the systems themselves should result in a reduction of complexity for users, administrators, and developers. However, there seems to be a need for an updated definition of the term \"Organic Computing\", of desired properties of technical, organic systems, and the objectives of the Organic Computing initiative. With this article, we will address these points.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 17:35:56 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08125v1", "10 pages, one figure, article"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, one figure, article", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["sven tomforde", "bernhard sick", "christian m\\\"uller-schloer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08125"}
