In this paper, we present a rule based Expert System used in diagnosis of Cerebral Palsy. The expert system takes user input and depending on the symptoms of the patient, diagnoses if the patient is suffering from Cerebral Palsy. The Expert System also classifies the Cerebral Palsy as mild, moderate or severe based on the presented symptoms.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 16:52:12 GMT  (344kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0117v1", "4 pages, 1 figure, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rajdeep borgohain", "sugata sanyal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1207.0117"}
