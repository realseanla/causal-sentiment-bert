A variable elimination rule (value elimination rule) allows the polynomial-time identification of certain variables (domain elements) whose elimination, without the introduction of extra compensatory constraints, does not affect the satisfiability of an instance. We show that there are essentially just four variable elimination rules and three value elimination rules defined by forbidding generic sub-instances, known as irreducible existential patterns, in arc-consistent CSP instances. One of the variable elimination rules is the already-known Broken Triangle Property, whereas the other three are novel. The three value elimination rules can all be seen as strict generalisations of neighbourhood substitution.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 20:22:44 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03796v1", "A full version of an IJCAI'13 paper to appear in Journal of Computer and System Sciences (JCSS)"]], "COMMENTS": "A full version of an IJCAI'13 paper to appear in Journal of Computer and System Sciences (JCSS)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["david a cohen", "martin c cooper", "guillaume escamocher", "stanislav zivny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.03796"}
