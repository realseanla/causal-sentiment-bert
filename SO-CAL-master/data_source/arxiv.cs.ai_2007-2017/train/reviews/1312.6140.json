In this paper we present an answer set programming based software system, called DIAMOND (DIAlectical MOdels eNcoDing). It translates ADFs into answer set programs whose stable models correspond to models of the ADF with respect to several semantics (i.e. admissible, complete, stable, grounded).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:17:03 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6140v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stefan ellmauthaler", "hannes strass"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6140"}
