There are numerous QAS based on the user documents present today, but they all are limited to providing objective answers and process simple questions only. Complex questions cannot be answered by the existing QAS, as they require interpretation of the current and old data as well as the question asked by the user. The above limitations can be overcome by using deep cases and neural network. Hence we propose a modified QAS in which we create a deep artificial neural network with associative memory from text documents. The modified QAS processes the contents of the text document provided to it and find the answer to even complex questions in the documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 06:09:36 GMT  (102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09327v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["ahlam ansari", "moonish maknojia", "altamash shaikh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.09327"}
