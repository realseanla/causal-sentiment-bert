However, all these systems are quite complex (to understand, reimplement, or modify). In this paper we propose a new algorithm portfolio for SAT that is extremely simple, but in the same time so efficient that it outperforms SATzilla. For a new SAT instance to be solved, our portfolio finds its k-nearest neighbors from the training set and invokes a solver that performs the best at those instances. The main distinguishing feature of our algorithm portfolio is the locality of the selection procedure --- the selection of a SAT solver is based only on few instances similar to the input one.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 16:20:44 GMT  (22kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0268v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 14:38:07 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0268v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mladen nikolic", "filip maric", "predrag janicic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0268"}
