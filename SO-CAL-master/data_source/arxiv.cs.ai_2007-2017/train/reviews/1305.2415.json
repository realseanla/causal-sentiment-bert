This algorithm uses Exponentiated Gradient to find the optimal exploration of the LINUCB. Within a deliberately designed offline simulation framework we conduct evaluations with real online event log data. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms surveyed algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 May 2013 11:13:14 GMT  (422kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2415v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["djallel bouneffouf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2415"}
