Computational work in this area has approached this via two different routes: by focusing on acquiring a knowledge base of common causal relations between events, or by attempting to understand a particular story or macro-event, along with its storyline. In this position paper, we focus on knowledge acquisition approach and claim that newswire is a relatively poor source for learning fine-grained causal relations between everyday events. We describe experiments using an unsupervised method to learn causal relations between events in the narrative genres of first-person narratives and film scene descriptions. We show that our method learns fine-grained causal relations, judged by humans as likely to be causal over 80% of the time. We also demonstrate that the learned event pairs do not exist in publicly available event-pair datasets extracted from newswire.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:12:01 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09453v1", "Events and Stories in the News Workshop, ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Events and Stories in the News Workshop, ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["zhichao hu", "elahe rahimtoroghi", "marilyn a walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09453"}
