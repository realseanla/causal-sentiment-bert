We study the problem of how multiple such judgments can be aggregated. We define the problem by adapting various classical social-choice-theoretic properties for the argumentation domain. We show that while argument-wise plurality voting satisfies many properties, it fails to guarantee the \\emph{collective rationality} of the outcome, and struggles with ties. We then present more general results, proving multiple impossibility results on the existence of \\emph{any} good aggregation operator. After characterising the sufficient and necessary conditions for satisfying collective rationality, we study whether restricting the domain of argument-wise plurality voting to classical semantics allows us to escape the impossibility result. We close by listing graph-theoretic restrictions under which argument-wise plurality rule does produce collectively rational outcomes. In addition to identifying fundamental barriers to collective argument evaluation, our results open up the door for a new research agenda for the argumentation and computational social choice communities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 May 2014 09:13:38 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6509v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Jun 2014 15:31:03 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6509v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 19 Jul 2015 10:53:38 GMT  (1559kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.6509v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["edmond awad", "richard booth", "fernando tohme", "iyad rahwan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.6509"}
