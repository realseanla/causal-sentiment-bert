To do so, it utilizes hierarchical abstractions, also known as skills -- a type of temporally extended action (Sutton et. al. 1999) to plan at a higher level, abstracting away from the lower-level details. We incorporate risk sensitivity, also referred to as Situational Awareness (SA), into hierarchical RL for the first time by defining and learning risk aware skills in a Probabilistic Goal Semi-Markov Decision Process (PG-SMDP). This is achieved using our novel Situational Awareness by Risk-Conscious Skills (SARiCoS) algorithm which comes with a theoretical convergence guarantee. We show in a RoboCup soccer domain that the learned risk aware skills exhibit complex human behaviors such as `time-wasting' in a soccer game. In addition, the learned risk aware skills are able to mitigate reward-based model misspecification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 11:01:32 GMT  (4088kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02847v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["daniel j mankowitz", "aviv tamar", "shie mannor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02847"}
