The problem is finding and traversing a collision-free path for a holonomic robot, without kinodynamic restrictions, moving in an environment with several unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries. The availability of perfect information of the environment at all times is assumed.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 21:13:36 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0270v1", "54 pages, Master of Science in Informatics Engineering thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "54 pages, Master of Science in Informatics Engineering thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["nicolas a barriga"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.0270"}
