At the same time, necessity of adopting some component of cognitive architectures for extending capabilities of probabilistic programming languages is pointed out. In particular, implicit specification of generative models via declaration of concepts and links between them is proposed, and usefulness of declarative knowledge for achieving efficient inference is briefly discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 May 2016 08:34:17 GMT  (115kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01180v1", "4 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["alexey potapov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01180"}
