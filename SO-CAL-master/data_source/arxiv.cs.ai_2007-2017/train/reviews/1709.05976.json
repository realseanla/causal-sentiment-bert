Our approach draws inspiration from ideas rooted in distributional semantics, specifically the Skip Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) approach, widely used to learn word embeddings for natural language processing tasks. Learning such embeddings can be reduced to a certain matrix factorization. Our approach is novel in that it highlights interesting connections between label embedding methods used for multi-label learning and paragraph/document embedding methods commonly used for learning representations of text data. The framework can also be easily extended to incorporate auxiliary information such as label-label correlations; this is crucial especially when there are a lot of missing labels in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive set of experiments on a variety of benchmark datasets, and show that the proposed learning methods perform favorably compared to several baselines and state-of-the-art methods for large-scale multi-label learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 14:34:16 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05976v1", "9 Pages, 0 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 Pages, 0 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["rahul wadbude", "vivek gupta", "piyush rai", "nagarajan natarajan", "harish karnick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05976"}
