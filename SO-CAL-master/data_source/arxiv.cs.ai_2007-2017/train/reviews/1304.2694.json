A novel marginal density estimator is introduced and shown both analytically and empirically to outperform standard estimators by several orders of magnitude. The developed theory and algorithms apply to a broad class of probabilistic models including statistical relational models considered not susceptible to lifted probabilistic inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 18:47:47 GMT  (842kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2694v1", "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of AAAI 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mathias niepert"], "accepted": true, "id": "1304.2694"}
