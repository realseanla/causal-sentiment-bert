Many of the current approaches to context-awareness either lack a solid theoretical basis for modeling or ignore important requirements such as modularity, high-order uncertainty management and group-based context-awareness. Therefore, their real-world application and extendability remains limited. In this paper, we present f-Context as a service-based context-awareness framework, based on language-action perspective (LAP) theory for modeling. Then we identify some of the complex, informational parts of context which contain high-order uncertainties due to differences between members of the group in defining them. An agent-based perceptual computer architecture is proposed for implementing f-Context that uses computing with words (CWW) for handling uncertainty. The feasibility of f-Context is analyzed using a realistic scenario involving a group of mobile users. We believe that the proposed approach can open the door to future research on context-awareness by offering a theoretical foundation based on human communication, and a service-based layered architecture which exploits CWW for context-aware, group-based and platform-independent access to information systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 06:15:38 GMT  (422kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5460v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC", "authors": ["nasser ghadiri", "ahmad baraani-dastjerdi", "nasser ghasem-aghaee", "mohammad a nematbakhsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1101.5460"}
