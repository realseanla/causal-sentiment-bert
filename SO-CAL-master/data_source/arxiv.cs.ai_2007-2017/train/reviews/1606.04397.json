It is compared with a symbolic graph-based algorithm and it is shown that both approaches are similar with respect to structure and complexity. Nevertheless, the strong spatial cognition solution is easy to understand and even pops up immediately when one has to solve the problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 14:41:24 GMT  (5000kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04397v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ulrich furbach", "florian furbach", "christian freksa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04397"}
