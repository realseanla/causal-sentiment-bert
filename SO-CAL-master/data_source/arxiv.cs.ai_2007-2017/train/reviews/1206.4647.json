Equally important is active query selection to further reduce the amount of preference information users must provide. We address the problem of active learning of user preferences for matching problems, introducing a novel method for determining probabilistic matchings, and developing several new active learning strategies that are sensitive to the specific matching objective. Experiments with real-world data sets spanning diverse domains demonstrate that matching-sensitive active learning", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:22:24 GMT  (311kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4647v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["laurent charlin", "richard s zemel", "craig boutilier"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4647"}
