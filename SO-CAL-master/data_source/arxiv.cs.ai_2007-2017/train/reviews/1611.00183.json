State-of-the-art density-based algorithms perform well because they 1) take the local neighbourhoods of data points into account and 2) consider feature subspaces. In highly complex and high-dimensional data, however, existing methods are likely to overlook important outliers because they do not explicitly take into account that the data is often a mixture distribution of multiple components.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 11:22:26 GMT  (1090kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00183v1", "Short version accepted at IEEE BigData 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Short version accepted at IEEE BigData 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["bas van stein", "matthijs van leeuwen", "thomas b\\\"ack"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00183"}
