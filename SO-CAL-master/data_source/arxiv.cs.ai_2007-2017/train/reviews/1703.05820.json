Yet, in some cases agents may wish to emphasize the low or high returns regardless of their probability. Borrowing from the economics and control literature, we review the risk-sensitive value function that arises from an exponential utility and illustrate its effects on an example. This risk-sensitive value function is not always applicable to reinforcement learning problems, so we introduce the particle value function defined by a particle filter over the distributions of an agent's experience, which bounds the risk-sensitive one. We illustrate the benefit of the policy gradients of this objective in Cliffworld.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 21:08:31 GMT  (299kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05820v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["chris j maddison", "dieterich lawson", "george tucker", "nicolas heess", "arnaud doucet", "riy mnih", "yee whye teh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05820"}
