The objective of the p-Sulu Planner is to allow users to command continuous, stochastic systems, such as unmanned aerial and space vehicles, in a manner that is both intuitive and safe. To this end, we first develop a new plan representation called a chance-constrained qualitative state plan (CCQSP), through which users can specify the desired evolution of the plant state as well as the acceptable level of risk. An example of a CCQSP statement is go to A through B within 30 minutes, with less than 0.001% probability of failure.\" We then develop the p-Sulu Planner, which can tractably solve a CCQSP planning problem. In order to enable CCQSP planning, we develop the following two capabilities in this paper: 1) risk-sensitive planning with risk bounds, and 2) goal-directed planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints. The first capability is to ensures that the probability of failure is bounded. The second capability is essential for the planner to solve problems with a continuous state space such as vehicle path planning. We demonstrate the capabilities of the p-Sulu Planner by simulations on two real-world scenarios: the path planning and scheduling of a personal aerial vehicle as well as the space rendezvous of an autonomous cargo spacecraft.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:41:20 GMT  (3050kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0579v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["masahiro ono", "brian c williams", "l blackmore"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0579"}
