While the theory of these problems was thoroughly investigated in the 1980s, prior work either did not scale to industrial size instances or gave up correctness guarantees to achieve scalability. Recently, we proposed a novel approach that combines universal hashing and SAT solving and scales to formulas with hundreds of thousands of variables without giving up correctness guarantees. This paper provides an overview of the key ingredients of the approach and discusses challenges that need to be overcome to handle larger real-world instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 14:10:10 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06633v1", "Appears in proceedings of AAAI-16 Workshop on Beyond NP"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in proceedings of AAAI-16 Workshop on Beyond NP", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["kuldeep s meel", "moshe vardi", "supratik chakraborty", "daniel j fremont", "sanjit a seshia", "dror fried", "alexander ivrii", "sharad malik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06633"}
