When using convolutional neural networks to classify single pixels in patches of a whole image, a lot of redundant computations are carried out when using sliding window networks. This set of new architectures solve this issue by either removing redundant computations or using fully convolutional architectures that inherently predict many pixels at once.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 01:20:46 GMT  (3683kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03371v1", "92 pages, project source code available atthis https URL, technical report written at ETH Z\\\"urich, in collaboration with AMD, UZH INI and HHMI Janelia"]], "COMMENTS": "92 pages, project source code available atthis https URL, technical report written at ETH Z\\\"urich, in collaboration with AMD, UZH INI and HHMI Janelia", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["fabian tschopp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03371"}
