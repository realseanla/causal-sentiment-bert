In this work, we study the challenges that arise in such complex environments, and summarize current methods to approach these. We choose a task within the Doom game, that has not been approached yet. The goal for the agent is to fight enemies in a 3D world consisting of five rooms. We train the DQN and LSTM-A3C algorithms on this task. Results show that both algorithms learn sensible policies, but fail to achieve high scores given the amount of training. We provide insights into the learned behavior, which can serve as a valuable starting point for further research in the Doom domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 07:07:47 GMT  (1352kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02164v1", "Bachelor's thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "Bachelor's thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["danijar hafner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02164"}
