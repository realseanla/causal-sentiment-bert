In this paper a score function and an accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic sets is firstly proposed to make the distinction between them. Then the idea is extended to interval neutrosophic sets. A multi-criteria decision making method based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative. Thus, we can rank all alternatives and make the selection of the best of one(s) according to the score-accuracy functions. Finally, some illustrative examples are presented to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 12:15:08 GMT  (372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5202v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["r{\\i}dvan \\c{s}ahin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5202"}
