These applications also bring a large scale heterogeneous and distributed information which pose a great challenge in terms of the semantic ambiguity. It is critical for application services in cloud computing environment to provide users intelligent service and precise information. Semantic information processing can help users deal with semantic ambiguity and information overload efficiently through appropriate semantic models and semantic information processing technology. The semantic information processing have been successfully employed in many fields such as the knowledge representation, natural language understanding, intelligent web search, etc. The purpose of this report is to give an overview of existing technologies for semantic information processing in cloud computing environment, to propose a research direction for addressing distributed semantic reasoning and parallel semantic computing by exploiting semantic information newly available in cloud computing environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 May 2013 05:36:16 GMT  (178kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4228v1", "20 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI", "authors": ["wei yu", "junpeng chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.4228"}
