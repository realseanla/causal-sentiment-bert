The last version of the system has by a large margin won the 2013 CASC LTB competition. This paper describes the motivation behind the methods used in MaLARea, discusses the general approach and the issues arising in evaluation of such system, and describes the Mizar@Turing100 and CASC'24 versions of MaLARea.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 03:42:00 GMT  (21kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2359v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 28 May 2014 13:51:17 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2359v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["cezary kaliszyk", "josef urban", "ji\\v{r}\\'i vysko\\v{c}il"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.2359"}
