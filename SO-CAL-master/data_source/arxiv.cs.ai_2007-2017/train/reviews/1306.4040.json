This can be naturally addressed as an attack planning problem. Previous approaches to this problem were based on modeling the actions and assets in the PDDL language, and using off-the-shelf AI tools to generate attack plans. These approaches however are limited. In particular, the planning is classical (the actions are deterministic) and thus not able to handle the uncertainty involved in this form of attack planning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 23:26:23 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4040v1", "ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2011), at ACM CCS Conference 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec 2011), at ACM CCS Conference 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI", "authors": ["carlos sarraute", "gerardo richarte", "jorge lucangeli obes core security technologies", "itba", "uba )"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.4040"}
