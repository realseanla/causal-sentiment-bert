This extrinsic, task-based evaluation also provides a unique window into the semantics captured (or missed) by unsupervised grammar induction systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 16:09:29 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09405v1", "6 pages, short paper, EMNLP 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:25:39 GMT  (332kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09405v2", "EMNLP 2016, Table 2 erratum, Code and Freebase Semantic Parsing data URL"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, short paper, EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["yonatan bisk", "siva reddy", "john blitzer", "julia hockenmaier", "mark steedman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.09405"}
