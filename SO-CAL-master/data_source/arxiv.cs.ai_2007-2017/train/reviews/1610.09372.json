{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Oct-2016", "title": "Multi-agent projective simulation: A starting point", "abstract": "We develop a two-defender (Alice and Bob) invasion game using the method of projective simulation. The agent, say Alice, encounters attack' symbols coming from the right attacker where she can learn to prevent. However, some of these signs are invisible for her. Instead, she perceives some other signs that are related to Bob's task. We elaborate an example in which an agent perceives an equal portion of percepts from both attackers. Alice can choose to concentrate on her job, though she loses some attacks. Alternatively, she can have some collaboration with Bob to get and give help. It is concluded that the maximum blocking efficiency in concentration is just the minimum blocking efficiency in collaboration. Furthermore, Alice has a choice to select two different forgetting factors for her task or helping. Therefore, she can choose between herself and the other. As the main result, we conclude that if Alice selects to be selfish, she probably earns more blocking in her task and also, higher efficiency in collective blocking, regardless of Bob's selection. In addition, it turns out that when the selection of both partners is selfishness, it is the highest justice on sharing individual efficiency and it is a maximum in collective blocking efficiency too. Finally, we propose some other questions that can be tracked regarding the present study.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 10:35:53 GMT  (1360kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09372v1", "17 pages, 11 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Jun 2017 16:28:34 GMT  (1036kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09372v2", "22 pages, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rasoul kheiri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09372"}
