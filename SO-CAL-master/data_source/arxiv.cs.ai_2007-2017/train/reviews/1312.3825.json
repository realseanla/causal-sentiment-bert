It presents research efforts that were undertaken to inform on how well traditional machine learning algorithms can handle this task. In particular, four PD related motor symptoms are highlighted (i.e. tremor, bradykinesia, freezing of gait and dyskinesia) and their details summarized. Thus the primary objective of this research is to provide a literary foundation for development and improvement of algorithms for detecting PD related motor symptoms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Dec 2013 14:58:39 GMT  (727kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3825v1", "Health Informatics: An International Journal (HIIJ), November 2013, Volume 2, Number 4"]], "COMMENTS": "Health Informatics: An International Journal (HIIJ), November 2013, Volume 2, Number 4", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["claas ahlrichs", "michael lawo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.3825"}
