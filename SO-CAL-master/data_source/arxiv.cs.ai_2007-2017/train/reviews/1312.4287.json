A dialogue game is a 2-player game where the parties play arguments. We show how to model dialogue games in a skeptical, non-monotonic formalism, and we show that the problem of deciding what move (set of rules) to play at each turn is an NP-complete problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 10:09:06 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4287v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["guido governatori", "francesco olivieri", "simone scannapieco", "antonino rotolo", "matteo cristani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4287"}
