Results of our preliminary experiments show that, with some approaches, close integration of perception and planning improves the quality of plans, as well as the computation times of feasible plans.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 05:40:49 GMT  (963kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7466v1", "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics Workshop at ICLP 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Knowledge Representation and Reasoning in Robotics Workshop at ICLP 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV cs.RO", "authors": ["damien jade duff", "esra erdem", "volkan patoglu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7466"}
