{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-May-2014", "title": "Probabilistic Inductive Logic Programming Based on Answer Set Programming", "abstract": "We propose a new formal language for the expressive representation of probabilistic knowledge based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). It allows for the annotation of first-order formulas as well as ASP rules and facts with probabilities and for learning of such weights from data (parameter estimation). Weighted formulas are given a semantics in terms of soft and hard constraints which determine a probability distribution over answer sets. In contrast to related approaches, we approach inference by optionally utilizing so-called streamlining XOR constraints, in order to reduce the number of computed answer sets. Our approach is prototypically implemented. Examples illustrate the introduced concepts and point at issues and topics for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 May 2014 17:18:49 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0720v1", "Appears in the Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in the Proceedings of the 15th International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning (NMR 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["matthias nickles", "alessandra mileo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0720"}
