One way of dealing with symmetry is to add constraints that eliminate symmetric solutions. We survey recent results in this area, focusing especially on two common and useful cases: symmetry breaking constraints for row and column symmetry, and symmetry breaking constraints for eliminating value symmetry", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 02:56:16 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3348v1", "To appear in Proceedings of Twenty-Sixth Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-12)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proceedings of Twenty-Sixth Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-12)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["toby walsh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1204.3348"}
