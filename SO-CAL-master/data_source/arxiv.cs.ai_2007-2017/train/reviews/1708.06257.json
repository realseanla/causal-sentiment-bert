Part I: Residual Networks", "abstract": "In this series of notes, we try to model neural networks as as discretizations of continuous flows on the space of data, which can be called flow model. The idea comes from an observation of their similarity in mathematical structures. This conceptual analogy has not been proven useful yet, but it seems interesting to explore.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 14:30:49 GMT  (211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06257v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["zhen li", "zuoqiang shi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06257"}
