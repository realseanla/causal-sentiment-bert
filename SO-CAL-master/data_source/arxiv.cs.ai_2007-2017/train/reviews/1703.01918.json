The increase in data will push the need for semantic segmentation frameworks that are able to classify non-RGB imagery, but this type of algorithmic development requires an increase in publicly available benchmark datasets with class labels. In this paper, we introduce a high-resolution multispectral dataset with image labels. This new benchmark dataset has been pre-split into training/testing folds in order to standardize evaluation and continue to push state-of-the-art classification frameworks for non-RGB imagery.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 15:16:56 GMT  (1748kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01918v1", "9 pages, 8 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 8 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["ronald kemker", "carl salvaggio", "christopher kanan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01918"}
