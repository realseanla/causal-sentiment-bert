The system will also need a mechanism for ordering competing explanations. We examine two representative approaches to explanation in the literature - one due to G\\\"ardenfors and one due to Pearl - and show that both suffer from significant problems. We propose an approach to defining a notion of \"better explanation\" that combines some of the features of both together with more recent work by Pearl and others on causality.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:54:13 GMT  (1841kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1526v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["urszula chajewska", "joseph y halpern"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1526"}
