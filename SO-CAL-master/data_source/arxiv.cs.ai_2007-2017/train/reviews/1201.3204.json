We investigate Hash-Distributed A* (HDA*), a simple approach to parallel best-first search that asynchronously distributes and schedules work among processors based on a hash function of the search state. We use this approach to parallelize the A* algorithm in an optimal sequential version of the Fast Downward planner, as well as a 24-puzzle solver. The scaling behavior of HDA* is evaluated experimentally on a shared memory, multicore machine with 8 cores, a cluster of commodity machines us- ing up to 64 cores, and a large-scale high-performance cluster using up to 1024 processors. We show that this approach scales well, allowing the effective utilization of large amount of distributed memory to optimally solve problems which require more than a terabyte of RAM. We also compare HDA* to Transposition-table Driven Scheduling (TDS), a hash-based parallelization of IDA*, and show that, in planning, HDA* significantly outperforms TDS. A simple hybrid which combines HDA* and TDS to exploit both of their strengths is proposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Jan 2012 10:31:47 GMT  (262kb,S)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3204v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 03:39:16 GMT  (119kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3204v2", "in press, to appear in Artificial Intelligence"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["akihiro kishimoto", "alex fukunaga", "adi botea"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3204"}
