Traditionally, belief change occurs by either a revision process or by an update process, depending on whether the agent is informed with $\\alpha$ in a static world or, respectively, whether $\\alpha$ is a 'signal' from the environment due to an event occurring. Boutilier suggested a unified model of qualitative belief change, which \"combines aspects of revision and update, providing a more realistic characterization of belief change.\" In this paper, I propose a unified model of quantitative belief change, where an agent's beliefs are represented as a probability distribution over possible worlds. As does Boutilier, I take a dynamical systems perspective. The proposed approach is evaluated against several rationality postulated, and some properties of the approach are worked out.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 19:28:00 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02126v1", "Presented at the Sixteenth International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 22-24 April 2016, Cape Town, South Africa. 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the Sixteenth International Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning, 22-24 April 2016, Cape Town, South Africa. 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gavin rens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02126"}
