Over the last years convolutional neural networks have achieved almost human performance in recognizing concrete classes (i.e.\\ specific object categories). This paper tests the performance of a current CNN (GoogLeNet) on the task of differentiating between abstract classes which are trivially differentiable for humans. We trained and tested the CNN on the two abstract classes of horizontal and vertical orientation and determined how well the network is able to transfer the learned classes to other, previously unseen objects.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 12:51:23 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05506v1", "To be published in the proceedings of the International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and Communications Technologies 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published in the proceedings of the International Conference on Bio-inspired Information and Communications Technologies 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["sebastian stabinger", "antonio rodriguez-sanchez", "justus piater"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05506"}
