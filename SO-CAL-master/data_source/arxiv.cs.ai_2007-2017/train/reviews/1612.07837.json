We show that our model, which profits from combining memory-less modules, namely autoregressive multilayer perceptrons, and stateful recurrent neural networks in a hierarchical structure is able to capture underlying sources of variations in the temporal sequences over very long time spans, on three datasets of different nature. Human evaluation on the generated samples indicate that our model is preferred over competing models. We also show how each component of the model contributes to the exhibited performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Dec 2016 23:28:47 GMT  (819kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07837v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Feb 2017 20:04:46 GMT  (819kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07837v2", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI", "authors": ["soroush mehri", "kundan kumar", "ishaan gulrajani", "rithesh kumar", "shubham jain", "jose sotelo", "aaron courville", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.07837"}
