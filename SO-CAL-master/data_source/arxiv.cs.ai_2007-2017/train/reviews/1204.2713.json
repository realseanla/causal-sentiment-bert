We focus on this problem and present an approach for the semantic formalization of usage logs, which lays the basis for eective techniques of querying expressive usage patterns. We also present a query answering approach, which is useful to nd in the logs expressive patterns of usage behavior via formulation of semantic and temporal-based constraints. We have processed over 30 thousand user browsing sessions extracted from usage logs of DBPedia and Semantic Web Dog Food. All these events are formalized semantically using respective domain ontologies and RDF representations of the Web resources being accessed. We show the eectiveness of our approach through experimental results, providing in this way an exploratory analysis of the way users browse theWeb of Data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Apr 2012 13:17:01 GMT  (1768kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2713v1", "2nd International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2012) in the 21st International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2012), Lyon, France, April 17th, 2012"], ["v2", "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 16:54:08 GMT  (1672kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2713v2", "2nd International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2012) in the 21st International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2012), Lyon, France, April 17th, 2012"], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Apr 2012 06:46:51 GMT  (1665kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.2713v3", "2nd International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2012) in the 21st International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2012), Lyon, France, April 17th, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "2nd International Workshop on Usage Analysis and the Web of Data (USEWOD2012) in the 21st International World Wide Web Conference (WWW2012), Lyon, France, April 17th, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.HC cs.IR", "authors": ["julia hoxha", "martin junghans", "sudhir agarwal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.2713"}
