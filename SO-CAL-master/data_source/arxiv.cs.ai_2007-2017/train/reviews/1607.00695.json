Sometimes, this may prove to be a difficult task (e.g., conflict, mistrust, no information sharing, etc.). In this paper, we explore the possibility of achieving Pareto Optimal outcomes in a group by using a bottom-up approach: discovering Pareto optimal outcomes by interacting in subgroups. We analytically show that Pareto optimal outcomes in a subgroup are also Pareto optimal in a supergroup of those agents in the case of strict, transitive, and complete preferences. Then, we empirically analyze the prospective usability and practicality of bottom-up approaches in a variety of decision making domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 22:44:57 GMT  (322kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00695v1", "2nd Workshop on Conflict Resolution in Decision Making (COREDEMA@ECAI2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "2nd Workshop on Conflict Resolution in Decision Making (COREDEMA@ECAI2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["victor sanchez-anguix", "reyhan aydogan", "tim baarslag", "catholijn m jonker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00695"}
