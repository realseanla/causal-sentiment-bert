Also, we extend the FLP stable model semantics to allow generalized quantifiers by referring to an operator that is similar to the $\\sm$ operator. For a reasonable syntactic class of logic programs, we show that the two stable model semantics of generalized quantifiers are interchangeable.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Jan 2013 02:29:49 GMT  (17kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1393v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2012), 5th International Workshop, September 4, 2012, Budapest, Hungary", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["joohyung lee", "yunsong meng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.1393"}
