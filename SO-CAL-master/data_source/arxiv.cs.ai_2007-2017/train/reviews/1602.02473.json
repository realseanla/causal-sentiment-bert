This study formulates the concern on how wireless sensor networks can take advantage of the computational intelligent techniques using both single- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an overall aim of concurrently minimizing the required time for localization, minimizing energy consumed during localization, and maximizing the number of nodes fully localized through the adjustment of wireless sensor transmission ranges while using TBL process. A parameter-study of the applied PSO variants is performed, leading to results that show algorithmic improvements of up to 32% in the evaluated objectives.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Feb 2016 06:27:20 GMT  (5140kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02473v1", "19 Pages, 13 Figures, 10 Tables, Journal"]], "COMMENTS": "19 Pages, 13 Figures, 10 Tables, Journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["hussein s al-olimat", "robert c green ii", "mansoor alam", "vijay devabhaktuni", "wei cheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02473"}
