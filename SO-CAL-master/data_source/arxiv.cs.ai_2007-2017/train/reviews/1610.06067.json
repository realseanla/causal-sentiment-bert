First, we describe how several algorithmic fairness questions can be phrased as program verification problems. Second, we discuss an automated verification technique for proving or disproving fairness of decision-making programs with respect to a probabilistic model of the population.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 15:31:34 GMT  (2264kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06067v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["aws albarghouthi", "loris d'antoni", "samuel drews", "aditya nori"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06067"}
