These methods, however, lack statistical justification. This contribution derives consistency results for learning problems in structured domains and thereby generalizes learning in vector spaces and manifolds.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Apr 2012 09:29:10 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4294v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1001.0921"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1001.0921", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["brijnesh j jain", "klaus obermayer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4294"}
