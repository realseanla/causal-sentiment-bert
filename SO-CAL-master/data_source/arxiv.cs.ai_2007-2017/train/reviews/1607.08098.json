As a consequence, the rate of progress in the development of this type of system is directly related to the speed with which knowledge bases can be assembled, and on its quality. We attempt to solve the knowledge acquisition problem, for a Business Information System, developing a supervised multistrategy learning paradigm. This paradigm is centred on a collaborative data mining strategy, where groups of experts collaborate using data-mining process on the supervised acquisition of new knowledge extracted from heterogeneous machine learning data models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 May 2016 20:04:40 GMT  (240kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08098v1", "9 pages, 6 figures, conference ICKEDS'04"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 6 figures, conference ICKEDS'04", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["carlos leandro", "helder pita", "lu\\'is monteiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.08098"}
