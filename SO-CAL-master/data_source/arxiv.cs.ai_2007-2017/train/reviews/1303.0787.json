However, there are scenarios in which a restricted form of manipulation can instead be beneficial. In this paper we consider the iterative version of several voting rules, where at each step one agent is allowed to manipulate by modifying his ballot according to a set of restricted manipulation moves which are computationally easy and require little information to be performed. We prove convergence of iterative voting rules when restricted manipulation is allowed, and we present experiments showing that most iterative voting rules have a higher Condorcet efficiency than their non-iterative version.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Mar 2013 19:05:45 GMT  (495kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0787v1", "In Proceedings SR 2013,arXiv:1303.0071"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings SR 2013,arXiv:1303.0071", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["umberto grandi", "rea loreggia", "francesca rossi", "kristen brent venable", "toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0787"}
