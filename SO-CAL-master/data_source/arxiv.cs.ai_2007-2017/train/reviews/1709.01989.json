This article defines the terms \"data science\" (also referred to as \"data analytics\") and \"machine learning\" and how they are related. In addition, it defines the term \"optimizing analytics\" and illustrates the role of automatic optimization as a key technology in combination with data analytics. It also uses examples to explain the way that these technologies are currently being used in the automotive industry on the basis of the major subprocesses in the automotive value chain (development, procurement; logistics, production, marketing, sales and after-sales, connected customer). Since the industry is just starting to explore the broad range of potential uses for these technologies, visionary application examples are used to illustrate the revolutionary possibilities that they offer. Finally, the article demonstrates how these technologies can make the automotive industry more efficient and enhance its customer focus throughout all its operations and activities, extending from the product and its development process to the customers and their connection to the product.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 20:38:00 GMT  (457kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01989v1", "22 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["martin hofmann", "florian neukart", "thomas b\\\"ack"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01989"}
