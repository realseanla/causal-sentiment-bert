It is intended for research scenarios related to safe human-robot collaboration (SHRC) and interaction (SHRI) in the industrial domain. The task of human and object modeling has been used for detecting activity, and for inferring and predicting actions, different from those works, we do human and object modeling in order to learn interactions in RGB-D data for improving segmentation. For this purpose, we define a novel density function to model a three dimensional (3D) scene in a virtual environment (VREP). This density function takes into account various possible configurations of human-object and object-object relationships and interactions governed by their affordances. Using this function, we synthesize a large, realistic and highly varied synthetic RGB-D dataset that we use for training. We train a random forest classifier, and the pixelwise predictions obtained is integrated as a unary term in a pairwise conditional random fields (CRF). Our evaluation shows that modeling these interactions improves segmentation performance by ~7\\% in mean average precision and recall over state-of-the-art methods that ignore these interactions in real-world data. Our approach is computationally efficient, robust and can run real-time on consumer hardware.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 May 2016 22:34:37 GMT  (2006kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08464v1", "accepted for publication at 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted for publication at 25th IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN), 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC cs.RO", "authors": ["vivek sharma", "sule yildirim-yayilgan", "luc van gool"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08464"}
