Research into this family of cells has revealed that they perform information fusion which directs immune responses. We have derived a Dendritic Cell Algorithm based on the functionality of these cells, by modelling the biological signals and differentiation pathways to build a control mechanism for an artificial immune system. We present algorithmic details in addition to experimental results, when the algorithm was applied to anomaly detection for the detection of port scans. The results show the Dendritic Cell Algorithm is sucessful at detecting port scans.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Mar 2010 12:04:01 GMT  (584kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0789v1", "21 pages, 17 figures, Information Fusion"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 17 figures, Information Fusion", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.NE", "authors": ["julie greensmith", "uwe aickelin", "gianni tedesco"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0789"}
