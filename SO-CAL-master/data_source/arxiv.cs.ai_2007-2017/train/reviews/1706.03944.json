We present a data-driven analytic strategy based on combinatorial optimization and analysis of historical data. The data cover historical mobility of the users in one region of Sweden during a week. Applying the proposed method to the case study, we have identified the optimal proportion of geo-demographic segments in the customer base, developed a functionality to assess the potential of a planned marketing campaign, and explored the problem of an optimal number and types of the geo-demographic segments to target through marketing campaigns. With the help of fuzzy logic, the conclusions of data analysis are automatically translated into comprehensible recommendations in a natural language.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 08:08:11 GMT  (575kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03944v1", "conference"]], "COMMENTS": "conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY", "authors": ["j sidorova", "l skold", "o rosander", "l lundberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03944"}
