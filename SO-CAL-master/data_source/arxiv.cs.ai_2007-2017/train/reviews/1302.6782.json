This technique approximates posterior moments and marginal posterior distributions with reasonable accuracy [errors are O(n^-2) for posterior means] in many interesting cases. The method also seems promising for computing approximations for Bayes factors for use in the context of model selection, model uncertainty and mixtures of pdfs. The limitations, regularity conditions and computational difficulties for the implementation of Laplace's method are comparable to those associated with the methods of maximum likelihood and posterior mode analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:13:37 GMT  (1224kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6782v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["adriano azevedo-filho", "ross d shachter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6782"}
