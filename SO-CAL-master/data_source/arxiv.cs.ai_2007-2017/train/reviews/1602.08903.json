To this end, the so-called GL-supported and GL-stage models are defined. These two classes of logical models are logic programming counterparts of the notion of range which is an established concept in argumentation semantics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 10:55:12 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08903v1", "16 pages, to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["mauricio osorio", "juan carlos nieves"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08903"}
