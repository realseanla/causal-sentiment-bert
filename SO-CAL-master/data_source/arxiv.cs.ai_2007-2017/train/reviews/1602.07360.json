For a given accuracy level, is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 1MB (461x smaller than AlexNet).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 00:09:45 GMT  (402kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 27 Feb 2016 20:24:20 GMT  (513kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 07:21:49 GMT  (1006kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360v3", "Added macro- and microarchitectural design space exploration.
