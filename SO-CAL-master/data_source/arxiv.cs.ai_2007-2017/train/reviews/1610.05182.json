A high-frequency, low-level \"spinal\" network with access to proprioceptive sensors learns sensorimotor primitives by training on simple tasks. This pre-trained module is fixed and connected to a low-frequency, high-level \"cortical\" network, with access to all sensors, which drives behavior by modulating the inputs to the spinal network. Where a monolithic end-to-end architecture fails completely, learning with a pre-trained spinal module succeeds at multiple high-level tasks, and enables the effective exploration required to learn from sparse rewards. We test our proposed architecture on three simulated bodies: a 16-dimensional swimming snake, a 20-dimensional quadruped, and a 54-dimensional humanoid. Our results are illustrated in the accompanying video at", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 16:03:42 GMT  (8333kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05182v1", "Supplemental video available atthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Supplemental video available atthis https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["nicolas heess", "greg wayne", "yuval tassa", "timothy lillicrap", "martin riedmiller", "david silver"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05182"}
