Due to its rather simple syntax paired with high-performance solvers, ASP is interesting for industrial applications. However, to err is human and thus debugging is an important activity during the development process. Therefore, tools for debugging non-ground answer set programs are needed. In this paper, we present a new graphical debugging interface for non-ground answer set programs. The tool is based on the recently-introduced DWASP approach for debugging and it simplifies the interaction with the debugger. Furthermore, the debugging interface is integrated in ASPIDE, a rich IDE for answer set programs. With our extension ASPIDE turns into a full-fledged IDE by offering debugging support.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 18:11:43 GMT  (190kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04969v1", "Paper presented at the 1st Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming (TAASP 2016), Klagenfurt, Austria, 26 September 2016, 15 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 1st Workshop on Trends and Applications of Answer Set Programming (TAASP 2016), Klagenfurt, Austria, 26 September 2016, 15 pages, LaTeX, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["philip gasteiger", "carmine dodaro", "benjamin musitsch", "kristian reale", "francesco ricca", "konstantin schekotihin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04969"}
