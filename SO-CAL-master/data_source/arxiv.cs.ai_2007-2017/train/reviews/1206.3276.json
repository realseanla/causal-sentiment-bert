In this paper, we explicate the desiderata of an explanation and confront them with the concept of explanation proposed by existing methods. The necessity of taking into account causal approaches when a causal graph is available is discussed. We then introduce causal explanation trees, based on the construction of explanation trees using the measure of causal information ow (Ay and Polani, 2006). This approach is compared to several other methods on known networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 15:41:30 GMT  (1079kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3276v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ulf nielsen", "jean-philippe pellet", "r\\'e elisseeff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3276"}
