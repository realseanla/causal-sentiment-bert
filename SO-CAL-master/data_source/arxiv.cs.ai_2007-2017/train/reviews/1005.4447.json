The mastermind of the project, Academician V.Glushkov, baptized it \"Evidence Algorithm\", EA. The work on the project lasted, off and on, more than 40 years. In the framework of the project, the Russian and English versions of the System for Automated Deduction, SAD, were constructed. They may be already seen as powerful theorem-proving assistants.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 May 2010 22:18:29 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4447v1", "To appear in The 9th International Conference on Mathematical Knowledge Management: MKM 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in The 9th International Conference on Mathematical Knowledge Management: MKM 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["alexander lyaletski", "konstantin verchinine kiev national taras shevchenko university", "math-info department", "paris 12 university)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.4447"}
