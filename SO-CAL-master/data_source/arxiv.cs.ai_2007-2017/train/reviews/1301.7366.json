Finally, we illustrate the method by its application to some practical examples. With them we show that hypergraph models allow defining a finer factorization or performing a more precise conditional independence analysis than undirected graph models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:02:59 GMT  (551kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7366v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["enrique f castillo", "juan ferr\\'andiz", "pilar sanmartin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7366"}
