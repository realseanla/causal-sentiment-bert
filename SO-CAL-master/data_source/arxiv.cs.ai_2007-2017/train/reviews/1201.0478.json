In this work we show that certain reasoning problems on the second level of the polynomial hierarchy still maintain their full complexity when restricted to instances of fixed distance to one of the above graph classes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Jan 2012 14:59:11 GMT  (55kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0478v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["wolfgang dvo\\v{r}\\'ak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.0478"}
