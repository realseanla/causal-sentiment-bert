{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Aug-2015", "title": "Reflective Oracles: A Foundation for Classical Game Theory", "abstract": "Classical game theory treats players as special---a description of a game contains a full, explicit enumeration of all players---even though in the real world, \"players\" are no more fundamentally special than rocks or clouds. It isn't trivial to find a decision-theoretic foundation for game theory in which an agent's coplayers are a non-distinguished part of the agent's environment. Attempts to model both players and the environment as Turing machines, for example, fail for standard diagonalization reasons.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 20:08:37 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04145v1", "Extended version of \"Reflective Oracles: A Foundation for Game Theory in Artificial Intelligence\" accepted to LORI-V"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of \"Reflective Oracles: A Foundation for Game Theory in Artificial Intelligence\" accepted to LORI-V", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["benja fallenstein", "jessica taylor", "paul f christiano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04145"}
