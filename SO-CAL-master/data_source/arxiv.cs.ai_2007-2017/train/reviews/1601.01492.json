We focus on SNTV, Bloc, k-Borda, and Chamberlin-Courant, as well as on approximate variants of Chamberlin-Courant, since the original rule is NP-hard to compute. We show that SHIFT BRIBERY tends to be significantly harder in the multiwinner setting than in the single-winner one by showing settings where SHIFT BRIBERY is easy in the single-winner cases, but is hard (and hard to approximate) in the multiwinner ones. Moreover, we show that the non-monotonicity of those rules which are based on approximation algorithms for the Chamberlin-Courant rule sometimes affects the complexity of SHIFT BRIBERY.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 11:35:43 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01492v1", "27 Pages.
