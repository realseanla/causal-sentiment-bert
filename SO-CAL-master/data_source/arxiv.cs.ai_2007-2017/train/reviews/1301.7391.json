In most settings we should expect the former to be difficult, and the latter potentially impossible without experimental intervention. In this work, we examine some restricted settings in which perfectly reconstruct the hidden structure solely on the basis of observed sample data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:05:04 GMT  (259kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7391v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael kearns", "yishay mansour"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7391"}
