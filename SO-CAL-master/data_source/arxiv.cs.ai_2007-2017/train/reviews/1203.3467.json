In this paper we present three non-linear sensitivity analysis methods that utilize this partial derivative information and therefore do not require re-evaluating the decision situation multiple times. Specifically, we show how to efficiently compare strategies in decision situations, perform sensitivity to risk aversion and compute the value of perfect hedging [Seyller, 2008].", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (319kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3467v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["debarun bhattacharjya", "ross d shachter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3467"}
