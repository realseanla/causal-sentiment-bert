Our generative model is an $n$ node multilayer neural net that has degree at most $n^{\\gamma}$ for some $\\gamma &lt;1$ and each edge has a random edge weight in $[-1,1]$. Our algorithm learns {\\em almost all} networks in this class with polynomial running time. The sample complexity is quadratic or cubic depending upon the details of the model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Oct 2013 19:49:32 GMT  (791kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.6343v1", "The first 18 pages serve as an extended abstract and a 36 pages long technical appendix follows"]], "COMMENTS": "The first 18 pages serve as an extended abstract and a 36 pages long technical appendix follows", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["sanjeev arora", "aditya bhaskara", "rong ge 0001", "tengyu ma"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.6343"}
