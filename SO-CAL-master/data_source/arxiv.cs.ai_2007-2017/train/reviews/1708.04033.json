Conventional part mating methods used in the current manufacturing requires tedious tuning of numerous parameters before deployment. We show how the robot can successfully perform a tight clearance peg-in-hole task through training a recurrent neural network with reinforcement learning. In addition to saving the manual effort, the proposed technique also shows robustness against position and angle errors for the peg-in-hole task. The neural network learns to take the optimal action by observing the robot sensors to estimate the system state. The advantages of our proposed method is validated experimentally on a 7-axis articulated robot arm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 08:32:30 GMT  (802kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04033v1", "Conference: Accepted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), Vancouver, Canada, September 24-28, 2017.
