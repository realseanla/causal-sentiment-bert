This difficulty can be remedied in many cases of interest by introducing a three valued logic (true, false, and \"don't care\"). The three-valued approach allows the construction of \"compressed\" constraint systems which have the same solution sets as their two-valued counterparts, but which may involve dramatically fewer variables. Techniques to calculate point estimates for the posterior probabilities of entailed sentences are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:33:38 GMT  (239kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5753v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul snow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5753"}
