The assignment problem is a fundamental problem in both computer science and economics with application in many areas including task and resource allocation. We draw inspiration from multi-criteria decision making and voting and use order weighted averages (OWAs) to propose a novel and flexible class of algorithms for the assignment problem. We show an algorithm for finding a $\\Sigma$-OWA assignment in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hardness of finding an egalitarian assignment. Inspired by this setting we observe an interesting connection between our model and the classic proportional multi-winner election problem in social choice.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 00:51:53 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06840v1", "3 Figure"]], "COMMENTS": "3 Figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA", "authors": ["jing wu lian", "nicholas mattei", "renee noble", "toby walsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06840"}
