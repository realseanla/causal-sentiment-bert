When a set of symptoms is activated for a specific patient, we can generate a ground medical knowledge network composed of symptom nodes and potential disease nodes. By Incorporating a Boltzmann machine into the potential function of a Markov network, we investigated the joint probability distribution of the MKN. In order to deal with numerical symptoms, a multivariate inference model is presented that uses conditional probability. In addition, the weights for the knowledge graph were efficiently learned from manually annotated Chinese Electronic Medical Records (CEMRs). In our experiments, we found numerically that the optimum choice of the quality of disease node and the expression of symptom variable can improve the effectiveness of medical diagnosis. Our experimental results comparing a Markov logic network and the logistic regression algorithm on an actual CEMR database indicate that our method holds promise and that MKN can facilitate studies of intelligent diagnosis.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 01:51:34 GMT  (1212kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09368v1", "32 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jingchi jiang", "chao zhao", "yi guan", "qiubin yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09368"}
