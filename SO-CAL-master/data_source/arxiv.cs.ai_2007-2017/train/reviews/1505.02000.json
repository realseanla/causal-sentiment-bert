We found that a slightly unconventional \"stacked 2D\" approach provides much better classification performance than simple 2D patches without requiring significantly more computational power. We also examined the popular \"tri-planar\" approach used in some recently published studies, and found that it provides much better results than the 2D approaches, but also with a moderate increase in computational power requirement. Finally, we evaluated a full 3D convolutional architecture, and found that it provides marginally better results than the tri-planar approach, but at the cost of a very significant increase in computational power requirement.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 May 2015 11:35:53 GMT  (271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02000v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["matthew lai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02000"}
