This tutorial gives an overview of the technique. We describe example algorithms, describe formal guarantees for the method, and describe practical issues in implementing the algorithms. While our examples are predominantly drawn from the NLP literature, the material should be of general relevance to inference problems in machine learning. A central theme of this tutorial is that Lagrangian relaxation is naturally applied in conjunction with a broad class of combinatorial algorithms, allowing inference in models that go significantly beyond previous work on Lagrangian relaxation for inference in graphical models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 02:50:15 GMT  (490kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5208v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["alexander m rush", "michael collins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5208"}
