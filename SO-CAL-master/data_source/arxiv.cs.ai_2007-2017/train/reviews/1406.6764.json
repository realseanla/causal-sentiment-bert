In this paper we present a factorization criterion for these models that is equivalent to the global Markov property given by (the natural extension of) d-separation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 04:21:47 GMT  (169kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6764v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas s richardson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6764"}
