The task in CPF is to relocate a group of agents in a non-colliding way so that each agent eventually reaches its goal location from the given initial location. The abstraction adopted in this work assumes that agents are discrete items moving in an undirected graph by traversing edges. Makespan optimal solving of CPF means to generate solutions that are as short as possi-ble in terms of the total number of time steps required for the execution of the solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 06:42:45 GMT  (1852kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05452v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pavel surynek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05452"}
