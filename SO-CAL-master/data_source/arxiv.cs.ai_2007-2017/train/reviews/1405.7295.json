Their execution can, however, incur non-negligible cost. Here, we focus on cost-complexity of such systems. To that end, we introduce cost-aware multi-context systems, an extension of non-monotonic multi-context systems framework taking into account costs incurred by execution of semantic operators of the individual contexts. We formulate the notion of cost-complexity for consistency and reasoning problems in MCSs. Subsequently, we provide a series of results related to gradually more and more constrained classes of MCSs and finally introduce an incremental cost-reducing algorithm solving the reasoning problem for definite MCSs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 May 2014 16:13:53 GMT  (15kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7295v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter nov\\'ak", "cees witteveen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7295"}
