Inference is shown to be PEXP-complete, and variational methods are designed so as to exploit logical inference whenever possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 15:05:48 GMT  (251kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2652v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fabio gagliardi cozman", "rodrigo bellizia polastro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2652"}
