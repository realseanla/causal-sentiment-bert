Though the sensitivity to coincidences has often been presented as resulting from an erroneous assessment of probability, it appears to be a genuine competence, based on non-trivial computations. The model presented here suggests that coincidences occur when subjects perceive complexity drops. Co-occurring events are, together, simpler than if considered separately. This model leads to a possible redefinition of subjective probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2011 15:05:53 GMT  (217kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3932v1", "30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Washington : United States (2008)"]], "COMMENTS": "30th Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society, Washington : United States (2008)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jean-louis j -l dessalles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.3932"}
