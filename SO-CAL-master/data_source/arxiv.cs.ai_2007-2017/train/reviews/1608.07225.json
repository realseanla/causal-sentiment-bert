First, we introduce the \\textit{1D-move} perturbation to improve the space exploration performed by these algorithms. Second, we propose a new evaluation function $\\psi_{p,\\sigma}$ specifically targeting the Maximin criterion.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 14:55:43 GMT  (263kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07225v1", "extended version of ACM GECCO 2016 paper entitled \"Search Space Exploration and an Optimization Criterion for Hard Design Problems\""]], "COMMENTS": "extended version of ACM GECCO 2016 paper entitled \"Search Space Exploration and an Optimization Criterion for Hard Design Problems\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pierre berg\\'e", "kaourintin le guiban", "arpad rimmel", "joanna tomasik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07225"}
