In the final version of their paper, Halpern and Pearl slightly modified the definition of actual cause, in order to deal with problems pointed by Hopkins and Pearl. As we show, this modification has a nontrivial impact on the complexity of computing actual cause. To characterize the complexity, a new family D_k^P, k= 1, 2, 3, ..., of complexity classes is introduced, which generalizes the class DP introduced by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis (DP is just D_1^P). %joe2 %We show that the complexity of computing causality is $\\D_2$-complete %under the new definition.
