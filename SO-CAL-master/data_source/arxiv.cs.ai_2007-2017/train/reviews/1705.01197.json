We view intersection handling as a deep reinforcement learning problem, which approximates the state action Q function as a deep neural network. Using a traffic simulator, we show that directly copying a network trained for one type of intersection to another type of intersection decreases the success rate. We also show that when a network that is pre-trained on Task A and then is fine-tuned on a Task B, the resulting network not only performs better on the Task B than an network exclusively trained on Task A, but also retained knowledge on the Task A. Finally, we examine a lifelong learning setting, where we train a single network on five different types of intersections sequentially and show that the resulting network exhibited catastrophic forgetting of knowledge on previous tasks. This result suggests a need for a long-term memory component to preserve knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 23:05:56 GMT  (3281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01197v1", "Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["david isele", "akansel cosgun", "kikuo fujimura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01197"}
