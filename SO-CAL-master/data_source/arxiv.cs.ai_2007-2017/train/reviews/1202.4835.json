{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Feb-2012", "title": "Isabelle/PIDE as Platform for Educational Tools", "abstract": "The Isabelle/PIDE platform addresses the question whether proof assistants of the LCF family are suitable as technological basis for educational tools. The traditionally strong logical foundations of systems like HOL, Coq, or Isabelle have so far been counter-balanced by somewhat inaccessible interaction via the TTY (or minor variations like the well-known Proof General / Emacs interface). Thus the fundamental question of math education tools with fully-formal background theories has often been answered negatively due to accidental weaknesses of existing proof engines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 06:42:17 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.4835v1", "In Proceedings THedu'11,arXiv:1202.4535"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings THedu'11,arXiv:1202.4535", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.MS", "authors": ["makarius wenzel", "burkhart wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.4835"}
