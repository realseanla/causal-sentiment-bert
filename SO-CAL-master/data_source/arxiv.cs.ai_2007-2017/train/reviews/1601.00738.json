Multi-tenancy takes several forms depending on whether the back-end file system is a local file system (LFS) or a parallel file system (PFS), and on whether tenants are independent or share data across tenants. In this thesis I focus on and propose solutions to two cases: independent data-local file system, and shared data-parallel file system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 05:15:12 GMT  (1582kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00738v1", "PhD dissertation, December 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "PhD dissertation, December 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI cs.DB cs.SY", "authors": ["jiaan zeng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00738"}
