The choosen problem is on design of a physician's decision model which can take crisp as well as fuzzy data as input, unlike the traditional models. The author presents a mathematical model based on fuzzy set theory for physician aided evaluation of a complete representation of information emanating from the initial interview including patient past history, present symptoms, and signs observed upon physical examination and results of clinical and diagnostic tests.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 May 2010 17:40:38 GMT  (120kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4025v1", "this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["siddharths sankar biswas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.4025"}
