It is well-known that solver-based analysis of real-world FMs scale very well even though SAT instances obtained from such FMs are large, and the corresponding analysis problems are known to be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so effective, we systematically studied many syntactic and semantic characteristics of a representative set of large real-world FMs. We discovered that a key reason why large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that the vast majority of the variables in these models are unrestricted, i.e., the models are satisfiable for both true and false assignments to such variables under the current partial assignment. Given this discovery and our understanding of CDCL SAT solvers, we show that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such models without too many backtracks relative to the model size, explaining why solvers scale so well. Further analysis showed that the presence of unrestricted variables in these real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of variability. Additionally, we experimented with a series of well-known non-backtracking simplifications that are particularly effective in solving FMs. The remaining variables/clauses after simplifications, called the core, are so few that they are easily solved even with backtracking, further strengthening our conclusions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 04:25:39 GMT  (176kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05198v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 02:57:03 GMT  (223kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05198v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 29 Jul 2015 02:54:29 GMT  (276kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05198v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["jia hui liang", "vijay ganesh", "venkatesh raman", "krzysztof czarnecki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05198"}
