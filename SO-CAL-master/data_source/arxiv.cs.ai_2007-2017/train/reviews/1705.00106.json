We introduce an attention-based sequence learning model for the task and investigate the effect of encoding sentence- vs. paragraph-level information. In contrast to all previous work, our model does not rely on hand-crafted rules or a sophisticated NLP pipeline; it is instead trainable end-to-end via sequence-to-sequence learning. Automatic evaluation results show that our system significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art rule-based system. In human evaluations, questions generated by our system are also rated as being more natural (i.e., grammaticality, fluency) and as more difficult to answer (in terms of syntactic and lexical divergence from the original text and reasoning needed to answer).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 01:08:48 GMT  (227kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00106v1", "Accepted to ACL 2017, 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to ACL 2017, 11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["xinya du", "junru shao", "claire cardie"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.00106"}
