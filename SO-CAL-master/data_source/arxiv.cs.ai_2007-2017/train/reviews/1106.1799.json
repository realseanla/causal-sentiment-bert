{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jun-2011", "title": "Finding a Path is Harder than Finding a Tree", "abstract": "I consider the problem of learning an optimal path graphical model from data and show the problem to be NP-hard for the maximum likelihood and minimum description length approaches and a Bayesian approach. This hardness result holds despite the fact that the problem is a restriction of the polynomially solvable problem of finding the optimal tree graphical model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 13:13:51 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1799v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["c meek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1799"}
