We model a particular task, which consists of choosing what to do and to select which target in a situation where allies and foes are present. We explain the model in Bayesian programming and show how we could learn the conditional probabilities from data gathered during human-played sessions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 20:07:49 GMT  (2212kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5480v1", "30th international workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy, Chamonix : France (2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "30th international workshop on Bayesian Inference and Maximum Entropy, Chamonix : France (2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gabriel synnaeve", "pierre bessiere"], "accepted": false, "id": "1011.5480"}
