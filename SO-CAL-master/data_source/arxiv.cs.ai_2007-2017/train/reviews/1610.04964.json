The task in the puzzle is to rearrange $n^2-1$ pebbles on the square grid of the size of n x n using one vacant position to a desired goal configuration. An improvement to the existent polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and experimentally analyzed. The improved algorithm is trying to move pebbles in a more efficient way than the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called snakes and moving them jointly within the snake. An experimental evaluation showed that the algorithm using snakes produces solutions that are 8% to 9% shorter than solutions generated by the original algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 03:29:42 GMT  (1833kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04964v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pavel surynek", "petr michal\\'ik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04964"}
