The quality of the approximation can be measured by different indicators that take into account the approximation's closeness to the Pareto front and its distribution along the Pareto front. In particular, the averaged Hausdorff indicator prefers an almost uniform distribution. An observed drawback of multiobjective estimation of distribution algorithms (MEDAs) is that - as common for randomized metaheuristics - the final population usually is not uniformly distributed along the Pareto front. Therefore, we propose a postprocessing strategy which consists of applying the averaged Hausdorff indicator to the complete archive of generated solutions after optimization in order to select a uniformly distributed subset of nondominated solutions from the archive. In this paper, we put forward a strategy for extracting the above described subset. The effectiveness of the proposal is contrasted in a series of experiments that involve different MEDAs and filtering techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 19:44:48 GMT  (424kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07845v1", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["luis marti", "christian grimme", "pascal kerschke", "heike trautmann", "g\\\"unter rudolph"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07845"}
