Learning is cast explicitly as an optimisation problem where the goal is to find a BN structure which maximises log marginal likelihood (BDe score). Integer programming, specifically the SCIP framework, is used to solve this optimisation problem. Acyclicity constraints are added to the integer program (IP) during solving in the form of cutting planes. Finding good cutting planes is the key to the success of the approach -the search for such cutting planes is effected using a sub-IP. Results show that this is a particularly fast method for exact BN learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (184kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3713v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["james cussens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3713"}
