The reason is that multi-step methods often yield substantially better performance than their single-step counter-parts, due to a lower bias of the update targets. For non-linear function approximation, however, single-step methods appear to be the norm. Part of the reason could be that on many domains the popular multi-step methods TD($\\lambda$) and Sarsa($\\lambda$) do not perform well when combined with non-linear function approximation. In particular, they are very susceptible to divergence of value estimates. In this paper, we identify the reason behind this. Furthermore, based on our analysis, we propose a new multi-step TD method for non-linear function approximation that addresses this issue. We confirm the effectiveness of our method using two benchmark tasks with neural networks as function approximation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 01:21:27 GMT  (63kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05151v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["harm van seijen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05151"}
