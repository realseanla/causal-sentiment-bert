An entity is an object, physical or imaginary, that is connected by a path (or connection) and which is important for achieving the desired result of the scenario. In machine learning, we state that for any scenario, a subject entity is always, directly or indirectly, connected and affected by single or multiple independent / dependent entities, and their impact on the subject entity is dependent on various factors falling into the categories such as the existenc", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 11:08:32 GMT  (174kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0194v1", "Keywords- Machine Learning; unknown entities; independence; interaction; coverage, silent connections; ISSN 1473-804x online, 1473-8031 print"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords- Machine Learning; unknown entities; independence; interaction; coverage, silent connections; ISSN 1473-804x online, 1473-8031 print", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jitesh dundas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1107.0194"}
