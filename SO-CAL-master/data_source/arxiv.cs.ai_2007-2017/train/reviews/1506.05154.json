This paper proposes a study of how social network analysis can assist in modeling multiagent systems, while addressing similarities and differences between the two theories. We built a prototype of multi-agent systems for resolution of tasks through the formation of teams of agents that are formed on the basis of the social network established between agents. Agents make use of performance indicators to assess when should change their social network to maximize the participation in teams", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 21:17:05 GMT  (471kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05154v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["andre filipe de moraes batista", "maria das gra\\c{c}as bruno marietto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05154"}
