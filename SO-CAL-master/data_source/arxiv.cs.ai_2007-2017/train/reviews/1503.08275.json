For evaluating the modified simulated annealing optimizer, a number of test scenarios in the field of energy self-consumption maximization are defined and results are compared to a gradient descent and a total state space search approach. The benchmarking against these two reference methods demonstrates that the modified simulated annealing approach is able to find significantly better solutions than the gradient descent algorithm - being equal or very close to the global optimum - with significantly less computational effort and processing time than the total state space search approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Mar 2015 07:16:22 GMT  (631kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08275v1", "Computers &amp; Operations Research, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Computers &amp; Operations Research, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["rosemarie velik", "pascal nicolay"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.08275"}
