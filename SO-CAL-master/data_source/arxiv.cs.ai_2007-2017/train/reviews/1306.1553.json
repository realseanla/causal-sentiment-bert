Its simplification consisting in neglecting difference between true environment and its model estimated using limited number of observations causes exploration vs exploitation problem. Uncertainty can be expressed in terms of a probability distribution over the space of environment models, and this uncertainty can be propagated to the action-value function via Bellman iterations, which are computationally insufficiently efficient though. We consider possibility of directly measuring uncertainty of the action-value function, and analyze sufficiency of this facilitated approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Jun 2013 20:57:19 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1553v1", "AGI-13 Workshop paper"], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Jun 2013 14:32:12 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1553v2", "AGI-13 Workshop paper"]], "COMMENTS": "AGI-13 Workshop paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sergey rodionov", "alexey potapov", "yurii vinogradov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.1553"}
