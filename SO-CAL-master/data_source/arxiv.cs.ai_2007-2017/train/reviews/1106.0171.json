This paper proposes the concept of Pattern Recognition as Necessary and Sufficient Principle for a general cognitive science modeling, in a very ambitious scientific proposal. A formal physical definition of the pattern recognition concept is also proposed to solve many key conceptual gaps on the field.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2011 06:40:52 GMT  (636kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0171v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["gilberto de paiva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0171"}
