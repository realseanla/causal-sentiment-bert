Planning problems are usually goal-directed. This paper proposes several techniques for exploiting the goal-directedness to accelerate value iteration, a standard algorithm for solving Markov decision processes. Empirical studies have shown that the techniques can bring about significant speedups.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:41 GMT  (716kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1575v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang", "weihong zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1575"}
