We formally define the asymmetry network, an alternative representation for a conditional probability table. We also present an object-oriented representation for partially specified asymmetry networks. We show that the representation is parsimonious. We define an algebra for the elements of the representation that allows us to 'factor' any CPT and to soundly combine the partially specified asymmetry networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 15:59:31 GMT  (402kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6717v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["suzanne m mahoney", "kathryn blackmond laskey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6717"}
