Adaptation is a basic task in the CBR inference that can be modeled as the knowledge base revision problem and solved in propositional logic. However, in DLs, it is still a challenge problem since existing revision operators only work well for strictly restricted DLs of the \\emph{DL-Lite} family, and it is difficult to design a revision algorithm which is syntax-independent and fine-grained. In this paper, we present a new method for adaptation based on the DL $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$. Following the idea of adaptation as revision, we firstly extend the logical basis for describing cases from propositional logic to the DL $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$, and present a formalism for adaptation based on $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$. Then we present an adaptation algorithm for this formalism and demonstrate that our algorithm is syntax-independent and fine-grained. Our work provides a logical basis for adaptation in CBR systems where cases and domain knowledge are described by the tractable DL $\\mathcal{EL_{\\bot}}$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 May 2014 14:24:42 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4180v1", "21 pages.
