How to Make OWL an ASP Modeling Language", "abstract": "To exploit the Web Ontology Language OWL as an answer set programming (ASP) language, we introduce the notion of bounded model semantics, as an intuitive and computationally advantageous alternative to its classical semantics. We show that a translation into ASP allows for solving a wide range of bounded-model reasoning tasks, including satisfiability and axiom entailment but also novel ones such as model extraction and enumeration. Ultimately, our work facilitates harnessing advanced semantic web modeling environments for the logic programming community through an \"off-label use\" of OWL.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:38:53 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00924v1", "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 33-49, August 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 33-49, August 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["sarah alice gaggl", "sebastian rudolph", "lukas schweizer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00924"}
