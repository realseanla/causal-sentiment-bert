Global path planning is performed by first using a spatial database of the region to be traversed containing selected attributes such as height data and soil information from a suitable spatial database. The database is processed using a biomimetic swarm algorithm that is inspired by the nest building strategies followed by termites. Local path planning is performed online utilizing information regarding contingencies that affect the safe navigation of the AGV from various sensors. The simulation discussed has been implemented on the open source Player-Stage-Gazebo platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 04:46:47 GMT  (4511kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03176v1", "IEEE International Symposium on Measurements and Control in Robotics. 2008"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE International Symposium on Measurements and Control in Robotics. 2008", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["eshwaran vijaya kumar", "mansimar aneja", "dipti deodhare"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03176"}
