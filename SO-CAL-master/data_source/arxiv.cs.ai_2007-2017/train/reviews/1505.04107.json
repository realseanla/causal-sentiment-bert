OntoSOC modeling approach is based on Engestrom Human Activity Theory (HAT). That Theory allowed us to identify fundamental concepts and relationships between them. The top-down precess has been used to define differents sub-concepts. The modeled vocabulary permits us to organise data, to facilitate information retrieval by introducing a semantic layer in social web platform architecture, we project to implement. This platform can be considered as a collective memory and Participative and Distributed Information System (PDIS) which will allow Cameroonian communities to share an co-construct knowledge on permanent organized activities.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 May 2015 16:17:54 GMT  (464kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04107v1", "8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["guidedi kaladzavi", "papa fary diallo", "kolyang", "moussa lo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04107"}
