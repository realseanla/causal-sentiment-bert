Every Bayesian network model can be equivalently introduced by means of a factorization formula with respect to a chain graph which is Markov equivalent to the Bayesian network. A graphical characterization of such graphs is given. The class of equivalent graphs can be represented by a distinguished graph which is called the largest chain graph. The factorization formula with respect to the largest chain graph is a basis of a proposal of how to represent the corresponding (discrete) probability distribution in a computer (i.e. parametrize it). This way does not depend on the choice of a particular Bayesian network from the class of equivalent networks and seems to be the most efficient way from the point of view of memory demands. A separation criterion for reading independency statements from a chain graph is formulated in a simpler way. It resembles the well-known d-separation criterion for Bayesian networks and can be implemented locally.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:06:56 GMT  (349kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7414v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["milan studeny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7414"}
