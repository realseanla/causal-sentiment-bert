We show that the task of testing whether models are structurally incompatible with the data at hand, requires an exponential number of independence evaluations, each of the form: \"X is conditionally independent of Y, given Z.\" In contrast, a linear number of such evaluations is required to test a standard Bayesian network (one per vertex). On the positive side, we show that if a network with hidden variables G has a tree skeleton, checking whether G represents a given probability model P requires the polynomial number of such independence evaluations. Moreover, we provide an algorithm that efficiently constructs a tree-structured Bayesian network (with hidden variables) that represents P if such a network exists, and further recognizes when such a network does not exist.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:16:13 GMT  (945kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6809v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["dan geiger", "azaria paz", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6809"}
