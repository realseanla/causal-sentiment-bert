For simplicity, only the outermost level of graphs is taken into account. Localization of the \"conflict area\", diagnostic preferences, and bases for systematic conflict generation are considered. A notion of {\\em Potential Conflict Structure} ({\\em PCS}) constituting a basic tool for identification of possible conflicts is proposed and its use is discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 20:07:45 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4616v1", "This report is available form LAAS - Toulouse, France, from 1996.
