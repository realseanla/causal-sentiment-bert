These state­ ments formalized certain types of causal in­ teraction where (1) the effect is independent of the order that causes are introduced and (2) the impact of a single cause on the ef­ fect does not depend on what other causes have previously been applied. In this paper, we introduce an equivalent atemporal charac­ terization of causal independence based on a functional representation of the relationship between causes and the effect. In this rep­ resentation, the interaction between causes and effect can be written as a nested de­ composition of functions. Causal indepen­ dence can be exploited by representing this decomposition in the belief network, result­ ing in representations that are more efficient for inference than general causal models. We present empirical results showing the bene­ fits of a causal-independence representation for belief-network inference.",
