      "text" : "We investigate an approach to reasoning about causes through argumentation. We consider a causal model for a physical system, and look for arguments about facts. Some arguments are meant to provide explanations of facts whereas some challenge these explanations and so on. At the root of argumentation here, are causal links ({A1, · · · , An} causes B) and ontological links (o1 is_a o2). We present a system that provides a candidate explanation ({A1, · · · , An} explains {B1, · · · , Bm}) by resorting to an underlying causal link substantiated with appropriate ontological links. Argumentation is then at work from these various explaining links. A case study is developed : a severe storm Xynthia that devastated part of France in 2010, with an unaccountably high number of casualties."

      "text" : "Looking for explanations is a frequent operation, in various domains, from judiciary to mechanical fields. We\nconsider the case where we have some precise (not necessarily exhaustive) description of some mechanism, or situation, and we are looking for explanations of some facts. The description contains logical formulas, plus some causal and ontological formulas (or links). Indeed, it is known that, while there are similarity between causation and implication, causation cannot be rendered by a simple logical implication. Also, confusing causation and co-occurrence could lead to undesirable relationships. This is why we use here a causal formalism where some causal links and ontological links are added to classical logical formulas. Then the causal formalism will produce various explanation links [1]. However, if the situation described is complex enough, this will result in a great number of possible explanations, and some argumentation is involved in order to get some reasons to choose between all these candidate explanations.\nIn this text, we will consider as an example a severe storm, called Xynthia, which made 26 deaths in a single group of houses in La Faute sur Mer, a village in Vendée during a night in February 2010. This was a severe storm, with strong winds, low pressure, but it had been forecast. Since the casualties were excessive with respect to the strength of the meteorological phenomenon, various investigations have been ordered. This showed that various factors combined their effects. The weather had its role, however, other factors had been involved : recent houses and a fire station had been constructed in an area known as being susceptible of getting submerged. Also, the state authorities did not realize that asking people to stay at home was inappropriate in case of flooding given the traditionally low Vendée houses.\nIn this paper, we define in section 2 an enriched causal\nar X\niv :1\n40 1.\n41 44\nmodel, built from a causal model and an ontological model. We then show in section 4 how explanations can be derived from this enriched causal model. We explain in section 5 the use of argumentation in order to deal with the great number of possible explanations obtained and conclude in section 6. The Xynthia example, introduced in section 3, is used as illustration throughout the article."

      "text" : "The causal model is extended by resorting to the ontological model, and the result is called the enriched causal model. The enrichment lies in the so-called ontological deduction links (denoted ded ont−→ ) between literals. Such a link\nα ded ont−→ β\nsimply means that β can be deduced from α due to specialization/generalization links, the is-a−→ links in the ontological model, that relate the classes of objects mentioned in α and β. Note that the relation ded ont−→ is transitive and reflexive.\nHere is an easy illustration. A sedan is a kind of car, which is represented by sedan is-a−→ car in the ontological model. Then, Iown(sedan) ded ont−→ Iown(car) is an ontological deduction link in the enriched model.\nTechnically, the ded ont−→ links among literals are generated by means of a single principle as follows. The predicates used in the causal model are annotated so that each of their parameters is sorted either as universal or as existential.\nA universal parameter of a predicate “inherits” by specialization, meaning that if the predicate is true on this parameter then the predicate is also true for specializations of this parameter. The existential parameters of a predicate “inherits” by generalization, meaning that if a the predicate is true on this parameter, then the predicate is also true for generalizations of this parameter (cf above example of our owner of a sedan).\nAs another example, consider the unary predicate Flooded, where Flooded(o) means that class o (an area or a group of buildings) is submerged. Its unique parameter is taken to be “universal” so that if the literal Flooded(o) is true, then the literal Flooded(s) is also true whenever s is a specialization of o. The causal model is enriched by adding Flooded(o) ded ont−→ Flooded(s) for each class s satisfying s is-a−→ o.\nLet us now consider the unary predicate Occurs so that Occurs(Hurri) intuitively means : some hurricane occurs. Exactly as above “I own” predicate, this predicate is existential on its unique parameter. By means of the is-a−→ link Hurri is-a−→ SWind, we obtain the following ded ont−→ link : Occurs(Hurri) ded ont−→ Occurs(SWind).\nLet us provide the formal definition of ded ont−→ links in the case of unary predicates. Then, the general case is a natural, but intricate and thus ommitted here, generalization of the unary case.\nDefinition 1 Let us suppose that Prop1∃ and Prop2∀ are two unary predicates, of the “existential kind” for the first one, and of the “universal kind” for the second one. If in the ontology is the link class1\nis-a−→ class2, then the following two links are added to the enriched model : Prop1∃(class1)\nded ont−→ Prop1∃(class2) and Prop2∀(class2) ded ont−→ Prop2∀(class1).\nIn our formalism, causal and ontological links ded ont−→ entail classical implication :\n{α1, · · ·αn} causes α entails ( ∧n\ni=1αi)→ α. α ded ont−→ β entails α→ β. (1)\nOrdinary logical formulas are also allowed (for example for describing exclusions), which are added to the formulas coming from (1).\nWhen resorting to explanations (see section 4 below), these ded ont−→ links are extended to sets of literals (links denoted by→ded ontset ) as follows :\nDefinition 2 Let Φ and Ψ be two sets of literals, we define Φ →ded ontset Ψ, if for each ψ ∈ Ψ, there exists ϕ ∈ Φ such that ϕ ded ont−→ ψ (remind that ψ ded ont−→ ψ).\nNotice that if a sedan is a kind of car (sedan is-a−→ car), and Own a predicate existential on its unique argument, then we get {Iown(sedan), IamHappy} →ded ontset\n{Iown(car), IamHappy}, and {Iown(sedan), IamHappy} →ded ontset {Iown(car)}."

We have extracted a small part from all the information as an illustration of our approach.\nThe classes we consider in the ontological model and/or in the causal model are the following ones : Hurri, SWind, BFPA, House1FPA, HouseFPA, and BFPA have already been introduced in §2.2, together with a few is-a−→ links. Among the buildings in the flood-prone area, there is also a fire station FireSt (remind that we have also a group of houses HouseFPA, including a group of typical Vendée low houses with one level only House1FPA). We consider also three kinds of natural disasters (NatDis) : Hurri, together with “tsunami” (Tsun) and “flooding” (Flooding). As far as meteorological phenomena are concerned, we restrict ourselves to “Very low pressure” (VLPress), together with already seen Hurri and SWind, and finally we add ‘high spring tide” (HSTide) to our list of classes.\nTwo kinds of alerts (Alert) may be given by the authorities, “Alert-Evacuate” (AlertEvac) and “AlertStayAtHome” (AlertStay). We consider also an anemoter (Anemo) able to measure the wind strength and a fact asserting that “people stay at home” (PeopleStay).\n1. http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/13/rap-info/ i2697.asp\n2. www.ccomptes.fr/Publications/Publications/ Les-enseignements-des-inondations-de-2010-sur -le-littoral-atlantique-Xynthia-et-dans-le-Var\nThe following predicates are introduced : (Flooded) and (Victims_I) applied to a group of building respectively meaning that “flooding” occurs over this group, and that there were “victims” in this group (I ∈ {1, 2, 3} is a degree of gravity, e.g. Victims_1, Victims_2 and Victims_3 respectively mean, in % of the population of the group : “a small number”, “a significant number” and “a large number” of victims). OK means that its unique parameter is in a normal state. Occurs means that some fact has occurred (a strong wind, a disaster, . . .), Expected means that some fact is expected to occur.\nAll these predicates are “universal” on their unique parameter, except for the predicates Occurs and Expected which are “existential”.\nNote that negation of a literal is expressed by Neg as in Neg OK(Anemo) meaning that the anemometer is not in its normal behaviour state (the formula ¬(OK(Anemo) ∧ (NEG OK(anemo)) is thus added).\nThe classes and the ontological model are given in Figure 1 with the is-a−→ links represented as white-headed arrows labelled with (is-a).\nPart of the causal model is given in Figure 2 (remember, black-headed arrows represent causal links). It represents causal relations between [sets of] literals. It expresses that an alert occurs when a natural disaster is expected, or when a natural disaster occurs. Also, people stay at home if alerted to stay at home, and having one level home flooded results in many victims, and even more victims if the fire station itself is flooded,...\nFrom the ontological model and the causal model, the enriched causal model can be build, adding ded ont−→ links between literals when possible.\nFor instance, for our “existential” predicates, from Hurri\nis-a−→ SWind, the links Occurs(Hurri)\nded ont−→ Occurs(SWind), and Expected(Hurri)\nded ont−→ Expected(SWind) are added.\nIn the same way, for a universal predicate, from House1FPA is-a−→ BFPA, is added the link Flooded(BFPA) ded ont−→ Flooded(House1FPA)\n(cf Fig. 6).\nFigure 3 represents a part of the enriched causal model, where the (unlabelled) white-headed arrows represent the ded ont−→ links and each black-headed arrow represents a causal link (from a literal or, in case of forked entry, form a set of literals)."

      "text" : "Causal and ontological links allow us to infer explanation links. We want to exhibit candidate reasons that can explain a fact by means of at least one causal link. We disregard explanations that involve only links of the implicational kind. Here is how causal and ontological links are used in our formalism :\nLet Φ denote a set of literals and β be a literal.\nThe basic case is that Φ causes β yields that β can be explained by Φ. (2)\nThe general initial case involves two literals β = Prop(cl2) and δ = Prop(cl1) built on the same predicate Prop (eventual other parameters equal in these two literals) :{\nΦ causes β\nδ ded ont−→ β\n} yields that\nδ can be explained by Φ, provided δ is possible. (3)\n{δ} is the set of justifications for this explanation of δ by Φ.\nWe require also that the origin of the explanation is possible, thus the full set of justifications is here the set Φ ∪ {δ}, while in case of (2), this full set is Φ, even if no set is given explicitly. Indeed, it is always understood that the starting point of the explanation link must be possible, thus we sometimes omit it. Remind that from (1) we get ( ∧ ϕ∈Φ ϕ) → β and δ → β, thus adding β to the justification set is useless.\nAn explaining link Φ can explain α provided Ψ is possible where Ψ is a set of literals means that α can be explained by Φ provided the set Φ ∪ Ψ is possible : if adding Φ∪Ψ to the available data leads to inconsistency, then the explanation link cannot be used to explain δ by Φ.\nIn the figures, white-headed arrows represent “ontological links” : ded ont−→ links for bare arrows, and is-a−→ links for arrows with (is-a) mentioned, while dotted arrows represent explanation links (to be read can explain) produced by these rules, these arrows being sometimes labelled with the corresponding justification set.\nWe want also that our explanation links can follow ded ont−→ links as follows, in the case where Φ = {ϕ} is a singleton (thus we note sometimes ϕ instead of {ϕ}) :{\nϕ can explain δ provided Ψ is possible ϕ0 ded ont−→ ϕ δ ded ont−→ δ1 } yields that ϕ0 can explain δ1 provided Ψ is possible (4)\n{ϕ0} ∪Ψ is the full justification set for this explanation of δ1 by ϕ0. Again we get ϕ0 → ϕ by (1), so we need not to mention ϕ here.\nGeneralizing the case of (4) when Φ is a set of literals needs the use of→ded ontset :{\nΦ can explain δ provided Ψ is possible Φ0 →ded ontset Φ δ ded ont−→ δ1 } yields that Φ0 can explain δ1 provided Ψ is possible (5)\nNow, we also want that our explanation links are transitive, and this necessitates to be able to explain not only\nliterals, but sets of literals. Thus we introduce explanation links among sets of literals, which extend our explanation links from sets of literals towards literals (since it is an extension, we can keep the same name explanation link) :"

Let us first provide some motivation from our example.\nA possible set of explanations for the flooded buildings is constituted by the bad weather conditions (“very low pressure” and “strong wind”) together with “high spring tide” (see Fig. 2). Given this explanation (argument), it is possible to attack it by noticing : a strong wind is supposed to trigger the red alarm of my anemometer and I did not\nget any alarm. However, this counter-argument may itself be attacked by remarking that, in the case of a hurricane, that is a kind of strong wind, an anemometer is no longer operating, which can explain that a red alarm cannot be observed.\nLet us see how to consider formally argumentation when relying on an enriched causal model and explanations as described in sections 2 and 4. Of course, we begin with introducing arguments, as follows.\nArgument : That “Φ can explain γ in view of Θ, provided δ is possible”\nis formalized here as an argument whenever (3) holds, that is : Θ yields that γ can be explained by Φ, provided δ is possible.\nThe components of an argument consist of : – Φ, the explanation, a set of literals. – γ, the statement being explained, a literal. – ∆, the justification of the explanation (see Section 4),\na set of literals. – Θ, the evidence, comprised of propositions (e.g.,(∧ Φ ) → γ), causal links\n(e.g., Φ causes β), and ontological deduction links (e.g., δ ded ont−→ β).\nHere is an illustration from the Xynthia event. From Fig. 2, that the BFPA buildings are flooded can be explained via the set of two causal links\nΘ = { Occurs(Flooding) causes F looded(BFPA),Occurs(V LPress)Occurs(SWind) Occurs(HSTide)  causes Occurs(Flooding) } More precisely, using the basic case (2) twice, we obtain that Flooded(BFPA) can be explained by the set of literals\nΦ =  Occurs(V LPress)Occurs(SWind) Occurs(HSTide)  The corresponding argument is\nΘ yields that γ can be explained by Φ, provided ∆ is possible\nwhere – The explanation is Φ. – The statement being explained is γ = Flooded(BFPA). – The justification of the explanation is empty. – The evidence is Θ."

The latter is a counter-argument of type 5 in above list. Indeed, the statement to be explained by the counter-argument is the falsehood Red(anemo) (e.g., Green(Anemo) has been observed), using SWind, i.e., an item in the explanation in the attacked argument.

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "The aim of this work is to study the link between causes and explanations [5, 6], and to rely on explanations in an argumentative context [2].\nIn a first part, we define explanations as resulting from both causal and ontological links. An enriched causal model is built from a causal model and an ontology, from which the explaining links are derived (cf e.g. Fig4 and (2). Our work differs from other approaches in the literature in that it strictly separates causality, ontology and explanations, while considering that ontology is key in generating sensible explanations from causal statements. Note however that some authors have already introduced ontology to be used for problem solving tasks as planning [7, Chapter 2] and more recently for diagnosis and repair [9]. We then argue that these causal explanations are interesting building blocks to be used in an argumentative context.\nAlthough explanation and argumentation have long been identified as distinct processes [10], it is also recognized that the distinction is a matter of context, hence they both play a role [4] when it comes to eliciting an answer to a “why” question. This is exactly what is attempted in this paper, as we are providing “possible” explanations, that thus can be turned into arguments. The argument format has some advantages inasmuch as its uniformity allows us to express objection in an iterated way : “possible” explanations are challenged by counter-arguments that happen to represent rival, or incompatible, “possible” explanations. However, a lot remains to be done. Among others, comparing competing explanations according to minimality, preferences, and generally a host of criteria.\nWe have designed a system in answer set programming that implements most of the explicative proposal introduced above. We plan to include it in an argumentative framework and think it will a good basis for a really practical system, able to manage with a as rich and tricky example as the full Xinthia example.\nRéférences\n[1] Philippe Besnard, Marie-Odile Cordier, and Yves Moinard.

Some arguments are meant to provide explanations of facts whereas some challenge these explanations and so on. At the root of argumentation here, are causal links ({A1, · · · , An} causes B) and ontological links (o1 is_a o2). We present a system that provides a candidate explanation ({A1, · · · , An} explains {B1, · · · , Bm}) by resorting to an underlying causal link substantiated with appropriate ontological links. Argumentation is then at work from these various explaining links. A case study is developed : a severe storm Xynthia that devastated part of France in 2010, with an unaccountably high number of casualties.",
