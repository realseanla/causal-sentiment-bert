By independently tracking the encoding and decoding representations our algorithm permits exact polynomial marginalization of the latent segmentation during training, and during decoding beam search is employed to find the best alignment path together with the predicted output sequence. Our model tackles the bottleneck of vanilla encoder-decoders that have to read and memorize the entire input sequence in their fixedlength hidden states before producing any output. It is different from previous attentive models in that, instead of treating the attention weights as output of a deterministic function, our model assigns attention weights to a sequential latent variable which can be marginalized out and permits online generation. Experiments on abstractive sentence summarization and morphological inflection show significant performance gains over the baseline encoder-decoders."

      "text" : "The problem of mapping from one sequence to another is an importance challenge of natural language processing. Common applications include machine translation and abstractive sentence summarisation. Traditionally this type of problem has been tackled by a combination of hand-crafted features, alignment models, segmentation heuristics, and language models, all of which are tuned separately.\nThe recently introduced encoder-decoder paradigm has proved very successful for machine translation, where an input sequence is encoded into a fixed-length vector and an output sequence is then decoded from said vector (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014). This architecture is appealing, as it makes it possible to tackle the problem of sequence-to-sequence mapping by training a large neural network in an end-to-end fashion. However it is difficult for a fixed-length vector to memorize all the necessary information of an input sequence, especially for long sequences. Often a very large encoding needs to be employed in order to capture the longest sequences, which invariably wastes capacity and computation for short sequences. While the attention mechanism of Bahdanau et al. (2015) goes some way to address this issue, it still requires the full input to be seen before any output can be produced.\nIn this paper we propose an architecture to tackle the limitations of the vanilla encoder-decoder model, a segment to segment neural transduction model (SSNT) that learns to generate and align simultaneously. Our model is inspired by the HMM word alignment model proposed for statistical machine translation (Vogel et al., 1996; Tillmann et al., 1997); we impose a monotone restriction on the alignments but incorporate recurrent dependencies on the input which enable rich locally non-monotone alignments to be captured. This is similar to the sequence transduction model of Graves (2012), but we propose alignment distributions which are parameterised separately, making\nthe model more flexible and allowing online inference.\nOur model introduces a latent segmentation which determines correspondences between tokens of the input sequence and those of the output sequence. The aligned hidden states of the encoder and decoder are used to predict the next output token and to calculate the transition probability of the alignment. We carefully design the input and output RNNs such that they independently update their respective hidden states. This enables us to derive an exact dynamic programme to marginalize out the hidden segmentation during training and an efficient beam search to generate online the best alignment path together with the output sequence during decoding. Unlike previous recurrent segmentation models that only capture dependencies in the input (Graves et al., 2006; Kong et al., 2016), our segmentation model is able to capture unbounded dependencies in both the input and output sequences while still permitting polynomial inference.\nWhile attentive models treat the attention weights as output of a deterministic function, our model assigns attention weights to a sequential latent variable which can be marginalized out. Our model is general and could be incorporated into any RNNbased encoder-decoder architecture, such as Neural Turing Machines (Graves et al., 2014), memory networks (Weston et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2016) or stack-based networks (Grefenstette et al., 2015), enabling such models to process data online.\nWe conduct experiments on two different transduction tasks, abstractive sentence summarisation (sequence to sequence mapping at word level) and morphological inflection generation (sequence to sequence mapping at character level). We evaluate our proposed algorithms in both the online setting, where the input is encoded with a unidirectional LSTM, and where the whole input is available such that it can be encoded with a bidirectional network. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SSNT — it consistently output performs the baseline encoder-decoder approach while requiring significantly smaller hidden layers, thus showing that the segmentation model is able to learn to break one large transduction task into a series of smaller encodings and decodings. When bidirectional encodings are used the segmentation model\noutperforms an attention-based benchmark. Qualitative analysis shows that the alignments found by our model are highly intuitive and demonstrates that the model learns to read ahead the required number of tokens before producing output."

Each path from the top left node to the right-most column in the graph corresponds to an alignment. We constrain the alignments to be monotone, i.e. only forward and downward transitions are permitted at each point in the grid. This constraint enables the model to learn to perform online generation. Additionally, the model learns to align input and output segments, which means that it can learn local reorderings by memorizing phrases. Another possible constraint on the alignments would be to ensure that the entire input sequence is consumed before last output word is emitted, i.e. all valid alignment paths have to end in the bottom right corner of the grid. However, we do not enforce this constraint in our setup.\nThe probability contributed by an alignment is obtained by accumulating the probability of word predictions at each point on the path and the transition probability between points. The transition probabilities and the word output probabilities are modeled by neural networks, which are described in detail in the following sub-sections."

      "text" : "As the alignments are constrained to be monotone, we can treat the transition from timestep j to j+1 as a sequence of shift and emit operations. Specifically, at each input position, a decision of shift or emit is made by the model; if the operation is emit then the next output word is generated; otherwise, the model will shift to the next input word. While the multinomial distribution is an alternative for parameterising alignments, the shift/emit parameterisation does not place an upper limit on the jump size, as a multinomial distribution would, and biases the model towards shorter jump sizes, which a multinomial model would have to learn.\nWe describe two methods for modelling the alignment transition probability. The first approach is independent of the input or output words. To parameterise the alignment distribution in terms of shift and emit operations we use a geometric distribution,\np(aj|aj−1) = (1− e) aj−aj−1e, (7)\nwhere e is the emission probability. This transition probability only has one parameter e, which can be\nestimated directly by maximum likelihood as\ne =\n∑\nn Jn∑ n In + ∑ n Jn , (8)\nwhere In and Jn are the lengths of the input and output sequences of training example n, respectively.\nFor the second method we model the transition probability with a neural network,\np(a1 = i) = i−1∏\nd=1\n(1− p(ed,1))p(ei,1),\np(aj = i|aj−1 = k) =\ni−1∏\nd=k\n(1− p(ed,j))p(ei,j),\n(9)\nwhere p(ei,j) denotes the probability of emit for the alignment aj = i.

In abstractive sentence summarisation, summaries are generated from the given vocabulary without the constraint of copying words in the input sentence. Rush et al. (2015) compiled a data set for this task from the annotated Gigaword data set (Graff et al., 2003; Napoles et al., 2012), where sentence-summary pairs are obtained by pairing the headline of each article with its first sentence. Rush et al. (2015) use the splits of 3.8m/190k/381k for training, validation and testing. In previous work on this dataset, Rush et al. (2015) proposed an attention-based model with feed-forward neural networks, and Chopra et al. (2016) proposed an attention-based recurrent encoder-decoder, similar to one of our baselines.\nDue to computational constraints we place the following restrictions on the training and validation set:\n1. The maximum lengths for the input sentences\nand summaries are 50 and 25, respectively.\n2. For each sentence-summary pair, the product of the input and output lengths should be no greater than 500.\nWe use the filtered 172k pairs for validation and sample 1m pairs for training. While this training set is smaller than that used in previous work (and therefore our results cannot be compared directly against reported results), it serves our purpose for evaluating our algorithm against sequence to sequence and attention-based approaches under identical data conditions. Following from previous work (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Gülçehre et al., 2016), we report results on a randomly sampled test set of 2000 sentence-summary pairs. The quality of the generated summaries are evaluated by three versions of ROUGE for different match lengths, namely ROUGE-1 (unigrams), ROUGE-2 (bigrams), and ROUGE-L (longestcommon substring).\nFor training, we use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) for optimization, with an initial learning rate of 0.001. The mini-batch size is set to 32. The number of hidden units H is set to 256 for both our model and the baseline models, and dropout of 0.2 is applied to the input of LSTMs. All hyperparameters were optimised via grid search on\nthe perplexity of the validation set. We use greedy decoding to generate summaries.\nTable 1 displays the ROUGE-F1 scores of our models on the test set, together with baseline models, including the attention-based model. Our models achieve significantly better results than the vanilla encoder-decoder and outperform the attention-based model. The fact that SSNT+ performs better is in line with our expectations, as the neural network-parameterised alignment model is more expressive than that modelled by geometric distribution.\nTo make further comparison, we experimented with different sizes of hidden units and adding more layers to the baseline encoder-decoder. Table 2 lists the configurations of different models and their corresponding perplexities on the validation set. We can see that the vanilla encoder-decoder tends to get better results by adding more hidden units and stacking more layers. This is due to the limitation of compressing information into a fixed-size vector. It has to use larger vectors and deeper structure in order to memorize more information. By contrast, our model can do well with smaller networks. In fact, even with 1 layer and 128 hidden units, our model works much better than the vanilla encoder-decoder with 3 layers and 256 hidden units per layer."

The transformation from a base form to an inflected form usually includes concatenating it with a prefix or a suffix and substituting some characters. For example, the inflected form of a German stem abgang is abgängen\nwhen the case is dative and the number is plural. In our experiments, we use the same dataset as Faruqui et al. (2016). This dataset was originally created by Durrett and DeNero (2013) from Wiktionary, containing inflections for German nouns (de-N), German verbs (de-V), Spanish verbs (es-V), Finnish noun and adjective (fi-NA), and Finnish verbs (fi-V). It was further expanded by Nicolai et al. (2015) by adding Dutch verbs (nl-V) and French verbs (fr-V). The number of inflection types for each language ranges from 8 to 57. The number of base forms, i.e. the number of instances in each dataset, ranges from 2000 to 11200. The predefined split is 200/200 for dev and test sets, and the rest of the data for training.\nOur model is trained separately for each type of inflection, the same setting as the factored model described in Faruqui et al. (2016). The model is trained to predict the character sequence of the inflected form given that of the stem. The output is evaluated by accuracies of string matching. For all the experiments on this task we use 128 hidden units for the LSTMs and apply dropout of 0.5 on the input and output of the LSTMs. We use Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2015) for optimisation with initial learning rate of 0.001. During decoding, beam search is employed with beam size of 30.\nTable 3 gives the average accuracy of the uniSSNT+, biSSNT+, vanilla encoder-decoder, and attention-based models. The model with the best previous average result — denoted as adaptedseq2seq (FTND16) (Faruqui et al., 2016) — is also included for comparison. Our biSSNT+ model outperforms the vanilla encoder-decoder by a large margin and almost matches the state-of-the-art result\non this task. As mentioned earlier, a characteristic of these datasets is that the stems and their corresponding inflected forms mostly overlap. Compare to the vanilla encoder-decoder, our model is better at copying and finding correspondences between prefix, stem and suffix segments.\nTable 4 compares the results of biSSNT+ and previous models on each individual dataset. DDN13 and NCK15 denote the models of Durrett and DeNero (2013) and Nicolai et al. (2015), respectively. Both models tackle the task by feature engineering. FTND16 (Faruqui et al., 2016) adapted the vanilla encoderdecoder by feeding the i-th character of the encoded string as an extra input into the i-th position of the decoder. It can be considered as a special case of our model by forcing a fixed diagonal alignment between input and output sequences. Our model achieves comparable results to these models on all the datasets. Notably it outperforms other models on the Finnish noun and adjective, and verbs datasets, whose stems and inflected forms are the longest."

      "text" : "Our work is inspired by the seminal HMM alignment model (Vogel et al., 1996; Tillmann et al., 1997) proposed for machine translation. In contrast to that work, when predicting a target word we additionally condition on all previously generated words, which is enabled by the recurrent neural models. This means that the model also functions as a conditional language model. It can therefore be applied directly, while traditional\nmodels have to be combined with a language model through a noisy channel in order to be effective. Additionally, instead of EM training on the most likely alignments at each iteration, our model is trained with direct gradient descent, marginalizing over all the alignments.\nLatent variables have been employed in neural network-based models for sequence labelling tasks in the past. Examples include connectionist temporal classification (CTC) (Graves et al., 2006) for speech recognition and the more recent segmental recurrent neural networks (SRNNs) (Kong et al., 2016), with applications on handwriting recognition and part-of-speech tagging. Weighted finite-state transducers (WFSTs) have also been augmented to encode input sequences with bidirectional LSTMs (Rastogi et al., 2016), permitting exact inference over all possible output strings. While these models have been shown to achieve appealing performance on different applications, they have common limitations in terms of modelling dependencies between labels. It is not possible for CTCs to model explicit dependencies. SRNNs\nand neural WFSTs model fixed-length dependencies, making it is difficult to carry out effective inference as the dependencies become longer.\nOur model shares the property of the sequence transduction model of Graves (2012) in being able to model unbounded dependencies between output tokens via an output RNN. This property makes it possible to apply our model to tasks like summarisation and machine translation that require the tokens in the output sequence to be modelled highly dependently. Graves (2012) models the joint distribution over outputs and alignments by inserting null symbols (representing shift operations) into the output sequence. During training the model uses dynamic programming to marginalize over permutations of the null symbols, while beam search is employed during decoding. In contrast our model defines a separate latent alignment variable, which adds flexibility to the way the alignment distribution can be defined (as a geometric distribution or parameterised by a neural network) and how the alignments can be constrained, without redefining the dynamic program. In addition to marginalizing during training, our decoding algorithm also makes use of dynamic programming, allowing us to use either no beam or small beam sizes.\nOur work is also related to the attentionbased models first introduced for machine translation (Bahdanau et al., 2015). Luong et al. (2015) proposed two alternative attention mechanisms: a global method that attends all words in the input sentence, and a local one that points to parts of the input words. Another variation on this theme are pointer networks (Vinyals et al., 2015), where the outputs are pointers to elements of the variablelength input, predicted by the attention distribution. Jaitly et al. (2016) propose an online sequence to sequence model with attention that conditions on fixed-sized blocks of the input sequence and emits output tokens corresponding to each block. The model is trained with alignment information to generate supervised segmentations.\nAlthough our model shares the same idea of joint training and aligning with the attention-based models, our design has fundamental differences and advantages. While attention-based models treat the attention weights as output of a deterministic function (soft-alignment), in our model the attention\nweights correspond to a hidden variable, that can be marginalized out using dynamic programming. Further, our model’s inherent online nature permits it the flexibility to use its capacity to chose how much input to encode before decoding each segment."

    "abstractText" : "We introduce an online neural sequence to sequence model that learns to alternate between encoding and decoding segments of the input as it is read. By independently tracking the encoding and decoding representations our algorithm permits exact polynomial marginalization of the latent segmentation during training, and during decoding beam search is employed to find the best alignment path together with the predicted output sequence. Our model tackles the bottleneck of vanilla encoder-decoders that have to read and memorize the entire input sequence in their fixedlength hidden states before producing any output. It is different from previous attentive models in that, instead of treating the attention weights as output of a deterministic function, our model assigns attention weights to a sequential latent variable which can be marginalized out and permits online generation. Experiments on abstractive sentence summarization and morphological inflection show significant performance gains over the baseline encoder-decoders.",
