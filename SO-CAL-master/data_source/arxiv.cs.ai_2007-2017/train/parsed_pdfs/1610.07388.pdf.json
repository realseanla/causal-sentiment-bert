      "text" : "Pairwise comparisons are a fundamental tool in many decision-analysis methods such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 1980). However, when different entities1 are compared with regard to abstract, non-measurable criteria by fallible humans, it may happen that the set of comparisons is not consistent: for example, entity \uD835\uDC34 is two times better than entity \uD835\uDC35, entity \uD835\uDC35 is three times better than entity \uD835\uDC36, but entity \uD835\uDC34 is not six (= 2× 3) times better than entity \uD835\uDC36. Inconsistency can also be an inherent feature of the data (see e.g. Bozóki et al. (2016)).\n* e-mail: laszlo.csato@uni-corvinus.hu 1 Throughout paper, the term entity is used for the ’things’ that are compared. They are sometimes\ncalled alternatives, objects, etc.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n07 38\n8v 3\n[ cs\n.A I]\nTherefore, measuring the inconsistency of pairwise comparison matrices – that is, assigning a numerical value to the question ’How much a given matrix deviates from one representing consistent preferences?’ – emerges as an important issue. According to our knowledge, the first concept of inconsistency was presented by Kendall and Smith (1940). Since then, a large number of inconsistency indices has been proposed such as Saaty’s eigenvalue-based index (Saaty, 1977), the Koczkodaj inconsistency index (Koczkodaj, 1993; Duszak and Koczkodaj, 1994), the relative error (Barzilai, 1998), the geometric consistency index (Aguaron and Moreno-Jiménez, 2003), the inconsistency index by Peláez and Lamata (Peláez and Lamata, 2003), or the harmonic consistency index (Stein and Mizzi, 2007).\nDeeper understanding of inconsistency indices is not only a mathematical exercise. Brunelli et al. (2013) and Brunelli (2016a) show that the application of various indices may lead to different, even almost opposite conclusions, so choosing among them properly really counts. It is not by chance that a number of articles deals with the study and comparison of different inconsistency indices (see e.g. Bozóki and Rapcsák (2008) and Brunelli et al. (2013)). Recently, an axiomatic approach has been followed: the introduction and justification of reasonable properties may help to narrow the general definition of inconsistency index as well as highlight those problematic indices that do not satisfy certain requirements (Brunelli and Fedrizzi, 2011; Brunelli, 2016a, 2017; Brunelli and Fedrizzi, 2015; Cavallo and D’Apuzzo, 2012; Koczkodaj and Szwarc, 2014; Koczkodaj and Szybowski, 2015).\nNonetheless, while logical consistency (Is the set of properties devoid of logical contradiction? Does there exist any inconsistency index that satisfies all axioms?) and independence (Is there any redundant axiom, implied by some of the others?) are usually discussed by the authors (Brunelli, 2017; Brunelli and Fedrizzi, 2015), we do not know any result on the axiomatic characterization of inconsistency indices.\nCharacterization means proposing a set of properties such that there exists a unique measure satisfying all requirements. It is an extensively used approach in social choice, illustrated by the huge literature, for instance, on the axiomatization of the Shapley value in game theory (see e.g. Shapley (1953); Dubey (1975); Young (1985); Hart and Mas-Colell (1989); van den Brink (2002)), or on the Hirsch index in scientometrics (see e.g. Woeginger (2008); Quesada (2010); Miroiu (2013); Bouyssou and Marchant (2014)). It is not unknown in the case of methods used for deriving weights from pairwise comparison matrices (Fichtner, 1984, 1986; Barzilai, 1997), too.\nThe central contribution of this study is a characterization of the so-called Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking, induced by the Koczkodaj inconsistency index. The first axiomatization on this field suggests that inconsistency ranking may be a more natural concept than inconsistency index, since any monotonic transformation of the latter results in the same ranking. In other words, it makes no sense to differentiate between these variants of a given inconsistency index (see also Brunelli (2016b)).\nIt is worth to note that our approach is somewhat different from the previous ones in this topic, which aimed at finding a set of suitable properties to be satisfied by any reasonable inconsistency measure. Providing an axiomatic characterization implies neither we accept all properties involved as wholly justified and unquestionable nor we reject the axioms proposed by others. Therefore, the current paper does not argue against the application of other inconsistency indices. The sole implication of our result is that if one agrees with these – rather theoretic – axioms, then the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking remains the only choice.\nHence we follow characterizations on other fields by assigning modest importance for\nthe motivation behind the properties used and for the issue of inconsistency thresholds. Nonetheless, the Koczkodaj index seems to be a reasonable inconsistency index as it meets all reasonable axioms suggested by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015); Brunelli (2017); Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015). In our view, it mitigates the problem caused by the possible hard verification of our properties in practice. Note also that only one index has been associated to a general level of acceptance. However, if a threshold of acceptable inconsistency is given for the Koczkodaj index, then one can find the minimal number of matrix elements to be modified in order to get an acceptable matrix (Bozóki et al., 2015).\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main notions and notations. Section 3 introduces the axioms used in the characterization of the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking offered by Section 4. Independence of the axioms is shown in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 discusses our results and highlights some directions of future research."

A triad T can be entirely described by the three elements in its upper triangle: T = (\uD835\uDC611; \uD835\uDC612; \uD835\uDC613) such that \uD835\uDC611 is the outcome of the comparison between the 1st and the 2nd, \uD835\uDC612 is the outcome of the comparison between the 1st and the 3rd, and \uD835\uDC613 is the outcome of the comparison between the 2nd and the 3rd entities, respectively.\nDefinition 4. Consistency: Pairwise comparison matrix A = [\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57] ∈ R\uD835\uDC5B×\uD835\uDC5B+ is consistent if \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC58 = \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC58 for all 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC57, \uD835\uDC58 ≤ \uD835\uDC5B.\nWhen the consistency condition does not hold, the pairwise comparison matrix is said to be inconsistent. Remark 1. Triad T = (\uD835\uDC611; \uD835\uDC612; \uD835\uDC613) is consistent if and only if \uD835\uDC612 = \uD835\uDC611\uD835\uDC613.\nNote that a pairwise comparison matrix is consistent if and only if all of its triads are consistent.\nThe set of all pairwise comparison matrices is denoted by \uD835\uDC9C. Inconsistency is measured by associating a value for each pairwise comparison matrix.\nDefinition 5. Inconsistency index : Function \uD835\uDC3C : \uD835\uDC9C → R is an inconsistency index.\nThe paper discusses a specific inconsistency indicator, which is the following.\nDefinition 6.

A ⪰ B is interpreted such that pairwise comparison matrix A is at most as inconsistent as matrix B. The relations ∼ and ≻ are derived from ⪰ in the usual way.\nAny inconsistency index induces an inconsistency ranking: A ⪰ B if and only if matrix A has a not worse (typically, not larger) value of inconsistency than matrix B according to the given index.\nDefinition 7.

      "heading" : "3 Axioms for an inconsistency ranking",
      "text" : "We start by giving some properties that one could expect an inconsistency ranking to satisfy. After that, they will be commented.\nAxiom 1. Positive responsiveness (\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45): Consider two triads S = (1; \uD835\uDC602; 1) and T = (1; \uD835\uDC612; 1) such that \uD835\uDC602, \uD835\uDC612 ≥ 1. Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45 if S ⪰ T ⇐⇒ \uD835\uDC602 ≤ \uD835\uDC612.\nAxiom 2. Invariance under inversion of preferences (\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 ): Consider a triad T and its transpose T⊤. Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 if T ∼ T⊤.\nAxiom 3. Homogeneous treatment of entities (\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38): Consider the triads T = (1; \uD835\uDC612; \uD835\uDC613) and T′ = (1; \uD835\uDC612/\uD835\uDC613; 1). Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 if T ∼ T′.\nAxiom 4. Scale invariance (\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C): Take the triads T = (\uD835\uDC611; \uD835\uDC612; \uD835\uDC613) and T′ = (\uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC611; \uD835\uDC582\uD835\uDC612; \uD835\uDC58\uD835\uDC613). Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C if T ∼ T′ for all \uD835\uDC58 > 0.\nAxiom 5. Monotonicity (\uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41): Consider a pairwise comparison matrix A and its triad T. Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 if A ⪯ T.\nAxiom 6. Reducibility (\uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37): Consider a pairwise comparison matrix A. Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 if A has a triad T such that A ∼ T.\nPositive responsiveness is based on the observation that triad T differs more from the basic consistent triad of (1; 1; 1) than triad S. It is a similar, but more relaxed requirement than monotonicity on single comparisons, proposed by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015): \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45 contains only one implication instead of two, and the condition is demanded for triads, not for all pairwise comparison matrices.2\nInvariance under inversion of preferences means that inverting all the preferences does not affect inconsistency. This axiom was introduced in Brunelli (2017) for all pairwise comparison matrices. A fundamental reason for this requirement is that \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57 is an assessment of the relative importance of the \uD835\uDC56th entity with respect to the \uD835\uDC57th one. However, it may equivalently reflect the relative importance of the \uD835\uDC57th entity with respect to the \uD835\uDC56th one. The two values are logically reciprocal, but one gets the pairwise comparison matrix A⊤ instead of A (Bozóki and Rapcsák, 2008). Therefore, triads T and T⊤ should be in the same equivalence class of inconsistency.\nHomogeneous treatment of entities can be justified in the following way. According to triads T and T′, we have two entities (the 1st and the 2nd) equally important on their own. After they are compared with a third entity, the inconsistency of the resulting triad should not depend on the relative importance of the new entity. The violation of \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 would mean that inconsistency is influenced by the absolute importance of entities, contradicting to the notion of pairwise comparisons.\nScale invariance means that the level of inconsistency is independent from the mathematical representation of the preferences. For example, take the \uD835\uDC56th, the \uD835\uDC57th and the \uD835\uDC58th entities such that the \uD835\uDC56th is ’moderately more important’ than \uD835\uDC57th and \uD835\uDC57th is ’moderately more important’ than the \uD835\uDC58th with the same intensity of the two relations. Then it makes sense to expect the inconsistency ranking to be the same if ’moderately more important’ is identified by the number 2, or 3, or 4, and so on, even allowing for a change in the direction of the two preferences. Naturally, this transformation should preserve consistency, which finalizes the definition of \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C.\nMonotonicity is formulated on the idea that ’no pairwise comparison submatrix may have a worse inconsistency indicator than the given pairwise comparison matrix’ by Jacek Szybowski in Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015). Hence an extension of the set of entities compared cannot improve on inconsistency. For our characterization, it is enough to expect that no triad of the original matrix is allowed to be more inconsistent.\nReducibility ensures that there exists a ’critical’ triad whose inconsistency is responsible for the inconsistency of the original pairwise comparison matrix. It will be a crucial axiom in the main result, simplifying the problem by conmtracting its size. Readers familiar with characterizations in other fields of science will not be surprised: for example, the reduced game property is widely used in axiomatizations of different game theory concepts (see e.g. Davis and Maschler (1965)).\nNote that \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 together imply monotonicity not only for triads, but for all pairwise comparison submatrices, similarly to the definition of monotonicity by Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015)."

      "text" : "ranking\nTheorem 1. The Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking is the unique inconsistency ranking satisfying positive responsiveness, invariance under inversion of preferences, homogeneous treatment of entities, scale invariance, monotonicity and reducibility.\nProof. We will first argue that the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking satisfies all axioms. \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45, \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 and \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C immediately follows from (2). \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 is met due to taking the maximum of \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC57\uD835\uDC58/\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC58 and its inverse in (2). The Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking considers only the maximally inconsistent triad, and the set of triads of a pairwise comparison submatrix is a subset of the set of triads of the original matrix, therefore it meets \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37.\nUniqueness: it is shown that any inconsistency ranking satisfying the six axioms coincides with the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking.\nAssume that there exist pairwise comparison matrices A and B such that A ⪰ B according to an inconsistency ranking ⪰, which meets \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 , \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38, \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37. The idea is to gradually simplify – with the use of the axioms – the comparison of inconsistencies of pairwise comparison matrices A and B by considering matrices with the same inconsistency level until their ranking depends on a single mathematical relation.\n1. Due to \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37, there exist triads A1 = (\uD835\uDC4E1; \uD835\uDC4E2; \uD835\uDC4E3) and B1 = (\uD835\uDC4F1; \uD835\uDC4F2; \uD835\uDC4F3) such that A1 ∼ A and B1 ∼ B.\n2. \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 provides that A1 ⪯ A′ for all triads A′ ⊂ A and B1 ⪯ B′ for all triads B′ ⊂ B, respectively.\n3. Consider A2 = (1; \uD835\uDC4E2/\uD835\uDC4E21; \uD835\uDC4E3/\uD835\uDC4E1) and B2 = (1; \uD835\uDC4F2/\uD835\uDC4F21; \uD835\uDC4F3/\uD835\uDC4F1). \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C implies that A2 ∼ A1 and B2 ∼ B1.\n4. Consider A3 = (1; \uD835\uDC4E2/(\uD835\uDC4E1\uD835\uDC4E3); 1) and B3 = (1; \uD835\uDC4F2/(\uD835\uDC4F1\uD835\uDC4F3); 1). \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 results in A3 ∼ A2 and B3 ∼ B2.\n5. \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 provides that \uD835\uDC4E2/(\uD835\uDC4E1\uD835\uDC4E3) ≥ 1 and \uD835\uDC4F2/(\uD835\uDC4F1\uD835\uDC4F3) ≥ 1 can be assumed without loss of generality in A3 and B3, respectively.\n6. To summarize, A3 ∼ A2 ∼ A1 ∼ A ⪰ B ∼ B1 ∼ B2 ∼ B3. It leads to 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC4E2/(\uD835\uDC4E1\uD835\uDC4E3) ≤ \uD835\uDC4F2/(\uD835\uDC4F1\uD835\uDC4F3) because of the property \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45.\nHowever, 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC4E2/(\uD835\uDC4E1\uD835\uDC4E3) ≤ \uD835\uDC4F2/(\uD835\uDC4F1\uD835\uDC4F3) means that A1 ⪰\uD835\uDC3E B1 due to Definition 6. Analogously, since A1 ⪯ A′ for all triads A′ ⊂ A and B1 ⪯ B′ for all triads B′ ⊂ B, we get A1 ⪯\uD835\uDC3E A′ for all triads A′ ⊂ A and B1 ⪯\uD835\uDC3E B′ for all triads B′ ⊂ B, respectively. It is equivalent to A ∼ A1 ⪰\uD835\uDC3E B1 ∼ B, so ⪰ is the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking.\nThe six properties can be classified in at least two ways. The proof of Theorem 1 reveals that the first four axioms (\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 , \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 and \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C) characterize an inconsistency ranking on the set of triads, while \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 are responsible for its extension to pairwise comparison matrices with at least four entities. Therefore, by accepting \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37, other inconsistency rankings based on the maximally inconsistent triad can be characterized. From another perspective, two axioms, \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45 and \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 contain a ’preference’ relation, whereas \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 , \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 and \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C define some equivalence classes. \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 plays a special role by imposing equivalence between matrices of different size.\nThe six axioms above (\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 , \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38, \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37) are not enough to uniquely determine the Koczkodaj inconsistency index \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3E as any monotonic function of it generates the same inconsistency ranking. It means that some technical axioms are necessary in order to obtain the Koczkodaj inconsistency index.\nDefinition 8. Consistency detection (\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 ): Consider a consistent triad T. Inconsistency index \uD835\uDC3C satisfies \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 if \uD835\uDC3C(T) = 0.\n\uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 was suggested by Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015) and is a specific version of the property Existence of a unique element representing consistency in Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015). Nonetheless, adding \uD835\uDC36\uD835\uDC47 to the previous properties is still not enough to exclude some transformations of \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3E . Since it does not make much sense to differentiate between inconsistency indices which generate the same inconsistency ranking (Brunelli, 2016b), the axiomatic characterization of the Koczkodaj inconsistency index remains a topic of future research."

Inconsistency ranking ⪰1 is also based on triads, so it meets \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37.

Analogously to Theorem 1, ⪰1 is characterized by \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 , \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38, \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 , \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 (the five axioms it satisfies) and negative responsiveness, the inverse of positive responsiveness defined as S ⪰ T if and only if \uD835\uDC612 ≥ \uD835\uDC602. In a similar way, ⪰5 is the unique inconsistency\nranking satisfying \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45, \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 , \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38, \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C, \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 and reversed monotonicity, that is, A ⪰ B for any pairwise comparison matrix A and its triad B.\nInconsistency rankings ⪰1–⪰5 have not much practical use. On the other hand, inconsistency ranking ⪰6 may be meaningful if inconsistency is assumed to (deterministically) increase with size due to the possible presence of other inconsistent triads."

      "heading" : "6 Discussion",
      "text" : "The paper has provided an axiomatic characterization of the inconsistency ranking induced by the Koczkodaj inconsistency index. The theorem requires six properties, some of them directly borrowed from previous axiomatic discussions (\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 from Brunelli (2017) and \uD835\uDC40\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC41 from Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015)), some of them similar to the axioms used in the literature (\uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45 is a relaxed version of monotonicity on single comparisons by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015) and \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC38\uD835\uDC37 is implicitly contained in monotonicity by Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015)), and some of them introduced here (\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC38 and \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3C). Although we have given a few arguments for homogeneous treatment of entities and scale invariance, their justification can be debated. However, it does not influence the essence of our characterization, which only states that the Koczkodaj inconsistency ranking should be accepted when all properties are adopted.\nIt remains to be seen how this characterization can be modified. The proof of Theorem 1 shows that \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC43 can be eliminated if \uD835\uDC43\uD835\uDC45 is defined without the condition \uD835\uDC602, \uD835\uDC612 ≥ 1. Although it seems to be a simplification (we will have only five axioms instead of six), the current form better reflects the role of different properties, highlighted by the discussion of logical independence in Section 5.\nAnother direction can be the use of other known properties in the characterization. A natural candidate is the following one, suggested by Brunelli and Fedrizzi (2015) and applied by Koczkodaj and Szybowski (2015), too.\nDefinition 9. Order invariance (\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC3C): Consider a pairwise comparison matrix A and a permutation matrix P of the same size. Inconsistency ranking ⪰ satisfies \uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC3C if PAP⊤ ∼ A.\n\uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC3C says that changing the order of the entities does not affect the inconsistency of preferences. In our characterization, homogeneous treatment of entities and scale invariance have a somewhat analogous role, but they cannot be substituted immediately by \uD835\uDC42\uD835\uDC3C.\nTo summarize, the current study clearly does not mean the end of the discussion on inconsistency indices. The main aim of this topic is perhaps the identification of the best universal measure, or at least, the perfect in a certain field. For this purpose, a thorough understanding of inconsistency indicators is indispensable. We hope the current study may give new insights by presenting the first axiomatic characterization in this field for the ranking derived from the Koczkodaj inconsistency index."

The first axiomatization on this field suggests that inconsistency ranking may be a more natural concept than inconsistency index, since any monotonic transformation of the latter results in the same ranking. In other words, it makes no sense to differentiate between these variants of a given inconsistency index (see also Brunelli (2016b)).",
