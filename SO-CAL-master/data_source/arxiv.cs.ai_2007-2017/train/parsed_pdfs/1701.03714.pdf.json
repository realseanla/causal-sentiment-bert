      "text" : "The rationality postulates proposed by Caminada and Amgoud [3] have been influential in the development of instantiated argumentation systems. These postulates identify desirable properties for the conclusions drawn from an argument based reasoning process, and focus on the effects of non-defeasible rules within an argumentation system. However, these postulates provide no desiderata with regards to the conclusions drawn from the defeasible rules found within an argumentation system. This latter type of rule is critical to argumentation, and identifying postulates for such rules is therefore important. At the same time, a large body of work exists which deals with non-monotonic reasoning (NMR). Such NMR systems (exemplified by approaches such as circumscription [11], default logic [16] and auto-epistemic logic [14]) introduce various approaches to handling defeasible reasoning, and axioms have been proposed to categorise such systems [9].\nIn this paper we seek to combine the rich existing body of work on NMR with structured argumentation systems. We aim to identify what axioms structured argument systems, exemplified by ASPIC+[12] meet1. In doing so, we also wish to investigate the links between NMR axioms and the rationality postulates. Doing so may, in the future, allow us to identify additional postulates which apply to the defeasible portion of structured argumentation systems.\n1ASPIC+ was selected for this study due to its popularity, and its ability to model a variety of other structured systems [13].\n2 ASPIC+ Argumentation Framework\nASPIC+ [12] is a widely used formalism for structured argumentation, which satisfies the rationality postulates of [3]. Arguments within ASPIC+ are constructed by chaining two types of inference rules, beginning with elements of a knowledge base. The first type of inference rule is referred to as a strict rule, and represents rules whose conclusion can unconditionally be drawn from a set of premises. This is in contrast to defeasible inference rules, which allow for a conclusion to be drawn from a set of premises as long as no exceptions or contrary conclusions exist.\nDefinition 1 An argumentation system is a triple AS = 〈L,R, n〉 where:\n• L is a logical language closed under negation2 ·̄.\n• R = Rs ∪Rd is a set of strict (Rs ) and defeasible (Rd ) inference rules of the form φ1, . . . , φn → φ and φ1, . . . , φn ⇒ φ respectively (where φi , φ are meta-variables ranging over wff in L), and Rs ∩Rd = ∅.\n• n : Rd 7→ L is a naming convention for defeasible rules.\nWe write φ1, . . . , φn φ if R contains a rule of the form φ1, . . . , φn → φ or φ1, . . . , φn ⇒ φ.\nDefinition 2 A knowledge base in an argumentation system 〈L,R, n〉 is a set K ⊆ L consisting of two disjoint subsets Kn (the axioms) and Kp (the ordinary premises).\nAn argumentation theory consists of an argumentation system and knowledge base.\nDefinition 3 An argumentation theory AT is a pair 〈AS ,K〉, where AS is an argumentation system AS and K is a knowledge base.\nAn argumentation theory is strict iff Rd = ∅ and Kp = ∅, and is defeasible iff it is not strict. To ensure that reasoning meets norms for rational reasoning according to the rationality postulates of [3], an ASPIC+ argumentation system must be such that its strict rules are closed under transposition. That is, given a strict rule with premises ϕ = {φ1, . . . , φn} and conclusion φ (written ϕ → φ), a set of n additional rules of the following form must be present in the system: {φ} ∪ ϕ\\{φi} → φi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n .\nArguments are defined recursively in terms of sub-arguments and through the use of several functions: Prem(A) returns all the premises of argument A; Conc(A) returns A’s conclusion, and TopRule(A) returns the last rule used within the argument. Sub(A) returns all of A’s sub-arguments. Given this, arguments are defined as follows.\nDefinition 4 An argument A on the basis of an argumentation theory AT = 〈〈L,R, n〉,K〉 is:\n1. φ if φ ∈ K with: Prem(A) = {φ}; Conc(A) = {φ}; Sub(A) = {A}; TopRule(A) = undefined.\n2. A1, . . . ,An → / ⇒ φ if Ai are arguments such that there respectively exists a strict/defeasible rule Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) → / ⇒ φ in Rs / Rd . Prem(A) = Prem(A1) ∪ . . . ∪ Prem(An); Conc(A) = φ; Sub(A) = Sub(A1) ∪ . . . ∪ Sub(An) ∪ {A}; TopRule(A) = Conc(A1), . . . , Conc(An) → / ⇒ φ.\nWe write A(AT ) to denote the set of arguments on the basis of the theory AT , and given a set of arguments A, we write Concs(A) to denote the conclusions of those arguments, that is:\nConcs(A) = {Conc(A)|A ∈ A}\nLike other argumentation systems, ASPIC+ utilises conflict between arguments — represented through attacks — to determine what conclusions are justified.\nAn argument can be attacked in three ways: on its ordinary premises, on its conclusion, or on its inference rules. These three kinds of attack are called undermining, rebutting and undercutting attacks, respectively.\n2This is a small deviation from the standard presentation of ASPIC+, which makes use of a contrariness function which need not be symmetrical.\nDefinition 5 An argument A attacks an argument B iff A undermines, rebuts or undercuts B , where:\n• A undermines B (on B ′) iff Conc(A) = φ for some B ′ = φ ∈ Prem(B) and φ ∈ Kp .\n• A rebuts B (on B ′) iff Conc(A) = φ for some B ′ ∈ Sub(B) of the form B ′′1 , . . . ,B ′′ 2 ⇒ φ.\n• A undercuts B (on B ′) iff Conc(A) = n(r) for some B ′ ∈ Sub(B) such that TopRule(B) is a defeasible rule r of the form φ1, . . . , φn ⇒ φ.\nNote that, in ASPIC+ rebutting is restricted. That is an argument with a strict TopRule can rebut an argument with a defeasible TopRule, but not vice versa. ([4] and [10] introduce the ASPIC- and ASPIC+D systems which use unrestricted rebut). Finally, A set of arguments is said to be consistent iff there is no attack between any arguments in the set.\nAttacks can be distinguished by whether they are preference-dependent (rebutting and undermining) or preference-independent (undercutting). The former succeed only when the attacker is preferred. The latter succeed whether or not the attacker is preferred. Within ASPIC+ preferences over defeasible rules and ordinary premises are combined or lifted to obtain a preference ordering over arguments [12]. Here, we are not concerned about the means of combination, but, following [12], we only consider reasonable orderings. For our purposes, a reasonable ordering is one such that adding a strict rule or axiom to an argument will neither increase nor decrease its preference level.\nDefinition 6 A preference ordering is a binary relation over arguments, i.e., ⊆ A×A, where A is the set of all arguments constructed from the knowledge base in an argumentation system.\nCombining these elements results in the following:\nDefinition 7 A structured argumentation framework is a triple 〈A, att , 〉, where A is the set of all arguments constructed from the argumentation system, att is the attack relation, and is a preference ordering on A.\nPreferences over arguments interact with attacks such that preference-dependent attacks succeed when the attacking argument is preferred. In contrast preference-independent attacks always succeed. Attacks that succeed are called defeats. Using Definition 4 and the notion of defeat, we can instantiate an abstract argumentation framework from a structured argumentation framework.\nDefinition 8 An (abstract) argumentation framework AF corresponding to a structured argumentation framework SAF = 〈A, att , 〉 is a pair 〈A,Defeats〉 such that Defeats is the defeat relation on A determined by SAF .\nThis abstract argumentation framework can be evaluated using standard argumentation semantics [5], defining the notion of an extension:\nDefinition 9 Let AF = 〈A,Defeats〉 be an abstract argumentation framework, Let A ∈ A and E ⊆ A. E is said to be conflict-free iff there do not exist a B ,C ∈ E such that B defeats C . E is said to defend A iff for every B ∈ A such that B defeats A, there exists a C ∈ E such that C defeats B . The characteristic function F : 2A → 2A is defined as F (E ) = {A ∈ A|E defends A}. E is called (1) an admissible set iff E is conflict-free and E ⊆ F (E ); (2) a complete extension iff E is conflict-free and E = F (E ); (3) a grounded extension iff E is the minimal complete extension; and (4) a preferred extension iff E is a maximal complete extension, where minimality and maximality are w.r.t. set inclusion.\nWe note in passing that other extensions have been defined and refer the reader to [1] for further details.\nDefinition 10 If AF = 〈A,Defeats〉 is an abstract argumentation framework, and E is the extension under one of Dung’s semantics. We write Just(A) to denote the set of justified conclusions of the set of arguments A, i.e., Just(A) = {Concs(E )}.\n3 Axiomatic Reasoning and ASPIC+\nKraus et al. [9], building on earlier work by Gabbay [6], identified a set of axioms which characterise nonmonotonic inference in logical systems, and studied the relationships between sets of these axioms. Their goal was to characterise different kinds of reasoning; to pin down what it means for a logical system to be monotonic or non-monotonic; and — in particular — to be able distinguish between the two. Table 1 presents the axioms of [9], which we will use to characterise reasoning in ASPIC+. The symbol |∼ encodes a consequence relation, while |= identifies the statements obtainable from the underlying theory. Note that we have altered some of the symbols used in [9] to avoid confusion with the notation of ASPIC+. Equivalence is denoted ≡ (rather than ↔), and →֒ (rather than →) denotes the existence of a rule, acknowledging the fact that a rule may be strict or defeasible.\nConsequence relations that satisfy Ref, LLE, RW, Cut and CM are said to be cumulative, and [9] describes them as being the weakest interesting logical system. Cumulative consequence relations which also satisfy CP are monotonic, while consequence relations that are cumulative and satisfy M are called cumulative monotonic. Such relations are stronger than cumulative but not monotonic in the usual sense.\nTo determine which axioms ASPIC+does or does not comply with, we must decide how different aspects of the axioms should be interpreted. We interpret the consequence relation |∼ in a couple of ways that are natural in the context of ASPIC+— describing these in detail later — and which fit with the high level meaning of “if α is in the knowledge base, then β is a conclusion”, or “β is a consequence of α”.\nAssuming such an interpretation of α |∼ β we can consider the meaning of the axioms. Some axioms are clear. For example, axiom T says that if β is a consequence of α, and γ is a consequence of β, then γ is a consequence of α. Other axioms are more ambiguous. Does α ∧ β |∼ γ in Cut mean that γ is a consequence of the conjunction α ∧ β or is it a consequence of α and β together? In other words is ∧ a feature of the language underlying the reasoning system, or a feature of the meta-language in which the properties are written? Similarly, given the distinction between strict and defeasible rules, is α →֒ β a strict rule in ASPIC+, a defeasible rule, or some statement in the property meta-language?\nThe symbols found in the axioms are interpreted as follows.\n• |= α means that α is an element of the relevant argumentation theory AT .\n• α ∧ β means both α and β, in particular in Cut and CM, it means that both α and β are in the knowledge base.\n• α ≡ β is taken — as usual — to abbreviate the formula (α →֒ β) ∧ (β →֒ α). We assume α →֒ β and β →֒ α have the same interpretation, i.e., both or neither are strict.\n• α →֒ β has two interpretations. We have the strict interpretation in which α →֒ β denotes a strict rule α → β in ASPIC+, and the defeasible interpretation in which α →֒ β denotes either a strict or defeasible rule. We denote the latter interpretation by writing α β.\n4 Axioms and Consequences in ASPIC+\nWe now consider the two different interpretations of the non-monotonic consequence relation |∼ described above, identifying which axioms each interpretation satisfies. In the following, we assume an arbitrary ASPIC+ argumentation theory AT = 〈〈L,R, n〉,K〉, and write ATx for an extension of this augmentation theory also containing proposition x : ATx = 〈〈L,R, n〉,K ∪ {x}〉. An argument present in the latter, but not former, theory is denoted Ax ."

In the following, we will consider an arbitrary extension containing the justified conclusions, these proofs are therefore applicable to any extension based semantics.\nDefinition 12 We write α |∼j β, if for every ASPIC + argumentation theory AT = 〈〈L,R, n〉,K〉 such that β 6∈ Just(A(AT )), it is the case that β ∈ Just(A(ATα))\nIt is worth noting the following result.\nProposition 4 If α |∼j β then α |∼a β.\nProof Follows immediately from the definitions — for β to be a justified conclusion, there must first be an argument with β as a conclusion.\nSince there are, in general, less justified conclusions of a theory than there are arguments, |∼j is a more restrictive notion of consequence than |∼a . It is therefore no surprise to find that fewer of the axioms from [9] hold. We have the following.\nProposition 5 The consequence relation |∼j does not satisfy reflexivity, or the defeasible versions of LLE and RW.\nProof [Ref] Counterexample: consider an ASPIC+ theory that contains: Kn = {a} and R = ∅. Here, we have an argument A = [a]. If a is in the knowledge base Kp , we have another argument B = [a]. However, B is defeated by A, but not vice versa. So B is not in any extension, and Ref does not hold for |∼j . [LLE (defeasible version)] Counter-example: consider an ASPIC\n+ theory that contains Kn = {c} and R = {a ⇒ b; b ⇒ a; a ⇒ r ; c → n1} where n(b ⇒ a) = n1. Here, a |∼j r , but, b 6|∼j r . Therefore, the defeasible version of LLE does not hold for |∼j . [RW (defeasible version)] Consider any ASPIC + theory that contains β in its axioms. For such a theory, β will not appear in any justified conclusions. Therefore, the defeasible version of RW does not hold for |∼j .\nProposition 6 |∼j satisfies the strict version of LLE and RW, Cut and CM for strict or defeasible theories.\nProof Consider an arbitrary theory AT = 〈〈L,R, n〉,K〉. [LLE (strict version)]] Since |= α ≡ β, under the strict interpretation, the rule β → α is in AT , ATα and ATβ . Since α |∼j γ, we know that there is an extension Eα containing Aα1 ,A α 2 , . . . ,A α n with A α 1 = [α] and Conc(A α n) = γ. Furthermore, there is no attack 3 between Ai (i = 1 . . .n) and Bα, where Bα is an argument in Eα. In addition, there is no argument with conclusion β in Eα since Aα1 is in Eα and there is a strict rule α → β 4. Now consider theory ATβ , which has\n3Note that since |∼j considers any preference ordering, attacks and defeats here are equivalent. 4Due to closure under strict rules.\na chain of arguments Aβ0 = [β],A β 1 = [A β 0 → α],A β 2 , . . . ,A β n , where Conc(A β n) = γ. There is an extension Eβ = {A β 0 , . . . ,A β n} ∪ (Eα − {A α 1 , . . . ,A α n}) in ATβ under the same semantic. Therefore strict LLE holds for |∼j . [RW (strict version)] Consider the extension Eγ in ATγ containing an argument A γ with Conc(Aγ) = α. Since |= α β, under the strict interpretation, we know that α → β is in ATγ . Because of closure under strict rules, Bγ = [Aγ → β] is in Eγ . Therefore the strict version of RW holds for |∼j . [Cut] Since α ∧ β |∼j γ, we know that there is an extension Eα,β of ATα,β containing Bα,β ,A α,β 1 , . . . ,A α,β n with A α,β 1 = [α], B\nα,β = [β] and Conc(Aα,βn ) = γ. Now consider the theory ATα. Since α |∼j β, there is an extension Eα containing Bα1 ,B α 2 . . . ,B α m with B α 1 = [α] and Conc(B α m ) = β. The set Eα ∪ (Eα,β − {B\nα,β}) is an extension in ATα (c.f., LLE above). Therefore cut holds for |∼j . [CM] Since α |∼j β, ATα and ATα,β contain similar arguments. Since α |∼j γ, there is an extension Eα in ATα containing A α 1 , . . . ,A α n with A α 1 = [α] and Conc(A α n) = γ. Eα is also an extension in ATα,β , since ATα and ATα,β contain similar arguments. Therefore CM holds for |∼j .\nProposition 7 The consequence relation |∼j does not satisfy M, T or CP for defeasible theories.\nProof We will give counter-examples. [M] Consider the ASPIC+ theory that includes Kn = {a} and R = {a → b; b → a; b ⇒ γ}. Thus, b |∼j γ, however, a 6|∼j γ. Therefore, M does not hold for |∼j . [T] Consider the ASPIC+ theory which includes K = ∅ and R = {a ⇒ b; b ⇒ c; c ⇒ r ; a → c}. Thus, a |∼j b and b |∼j r , but a 6|∼j r . Therefore, T does not hold for |∼j . [CP] Since contraposition does not hold for |∼a , by Proposition 3 it cannot hold for |∼j .\nIf we consider only strict theories, the following holds.\nProposition 8 The consequence relation |∼j satisfies Ref, M and T for strict theories.\nProof If the theory is strict, for any argumentation theory, all conclusions are justified. Therefore, for any strict theory, if α |∼a β, then α |∼j β. We know that |∼a holds for Ref, M and T, therefore, |∼j holds for Ref, M and T in a strict theory.\nThus |∼j is cumulative monotonic for strict theories."

      "heading" : "4.3 Discussion",
      "text" : "The results from the previous sections are summarized in Table 2. What light does the above shine on ASPIC+ and argumentation-based reasoning in general? Considering |∼a , it is no surprise that the relation is cumulative monotonic and satisfies the axiom M which captures a form of monotonicity. It is clear from the detail of ASPIC+, and indeed any argumentation system, that the number of arguments grows over time. However, the fact that |∼a is not monotonic in the same strict sense as classical logic, and so is strictly weaker, as a result of not satisfying CP, is a bit more interesting. This is, of course, because arguments are not subject to the law of the excluded middle — it is perfectly possible for there to be arguments for α and α from the same theory.\nTurning to |∼j , this is perhaps a more reasonable notion of consequence for ASPIC + than |∼a . If α |∼j β, then there is an argument for β which holds despite any attacks (in the scenario we have considered, where all\nattacks may be defeats for some preference ordering — and therefore succeed — there can still be attacks on the argument for β, but the attacking arguments must themselves be defeated). This is quite a restrictive notion of consequence in a representation that allows for conflicting information, and as Table 2 makes clear, |∼j is a relatively weak notion of consequence. It obeys less of the axioms and thus sanctions less conclusions than the non-monotonic logics analysed in [9], for example. For defeasible theories |∼j is not cumulative, and only satisfies LLE and RW if the rules applied in those axioms are strict. As we pointed out above, at the time that [9] was published, cumulativity was considered the minimum requirement of a useful logic5. Whether or not one accepts this, it is clear that ASPIC+ is weak. But is it too weak? To answer this, we should consider the cause of the weakness, which as Table 2 shows is due to LLE, RW and Ref.\nLLE and RW only hold if the axioms are only applied to strict rules. In both cases, the effect of the axiom is to extend an existing argument, either switching one premise for another (LLE), or adding a rule to the conclusion of an argument (RW). While having these axioms hold for defeasible rules would allow |∼j to be cumulative for defeasible theories, it is not reasonable for justified conclusions to be drawn under these circumstances — using LLE or RW to extend arguments with defeasible rules by definition means that the new arguments can be defeated. Thus their conclusions may not be justified.\nA similar argument applies to Ref. Proposition 8 tells us that Ref holds for |∼j for strict theories. In effect that means that α has to be an axiom. If Ref were to hold for defeasible theories, α could be a premise. But premises can be defeated, again by definition, so it is not appropriate to directly conclude that any premise is a justified conclusion (it is necessary to go through the whole process of constructing arguments and establishing extensions to determine this).\nFrom this we conclude that though |∼j is not cumulative, and hence ASPIC + is, in some sense, weaker than non-monotonic logics like circumscription [11] and default logic [16], it is not clear that it is too weak. That is strengthening |∼j so that it is cumulative for defeasible theories would allow conclusions that make no sense from the point of view of argumentation-based reasoning. Whether there are other ways to strengthen ASPIC+ that do make sense is an open question, and one we will investigate."

Billington [2] describes Defeasible Logic, a logic that, as its name implies, differs from classical logic in that it deals with defeasible reasoning. In addition to introducing the logic, [2] shows that defeasible logic satisfies the axioms of reflexivity, cut and cautious monotonicity suggested in [6], thus satisfying what [6] describes as the basic requirements for a non-monotonic system (such a system is equivalent to a cumulative system in [9]). [8] subsequently established significant links between reasoning in defeasible logic and argumentationbased reasoning. To do this, [8] provides an argumentation system that makes use of defeasible logic as its underlying logic, and shows that the system is compatible with Dung’s semantics [5]. Given Defeasible Logic’s close relation to Prolog [15], this line of work is closely related to Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP) [7], a formalism combining results of Logic Programming and Defeasible Argumentation. As a rule-based argumentation system, DeLP also has strict/defeasible rules and a set of facts.

These results suggest that additional constraints need to be placed on any instantiation of ASPIC+. Since ASPIC+ is intended as a template that can be instantiated with other logics (by the inclusion of strict rules that capture the rules of inference of those logics), this is perhaps unsurprising. However, it does place constraints on what those logics must bring if certain properties are required of that instantiation of ASPIC+. For example, rules that capture contraposition are required for the strict part of ASPIC+ to be monotonic in the sense of [9]. We also investigated the relationship between the axioms of [9] and the rationality postulates, and suggested an alternative, axiom based formulation of the latter.\nAs mentioned above, we will investigate whether additional axioms can encode the rationality postulates described in [17]. We will also examine the properties of different interpretations of the logical symbols. For example, we assumed that ≡ encodes the presence of two rules, but says nothing about their preferences or defeaters. Finally, we may consider other interpretations of the consequence relation. This paper therefore opens up several significant avenues of future investigation."
