    "abstractText" : "We present an algorithm for arc reversal in Bayesian networks with tree-structured condi­ tional probability tables, and consider some of its advantages, especially for the simulation of dy­ namic probabilistic networks. In particular, the method allows one to produce CPTs for nodes in­ volved in the reversal that exploit regularities in the conditional distributions. We argue that this approach alleviates some of the overhead asso­ ciated with arc reversal, plays an important role in evidence integration and can be used to re­ strict sampling of variables in DPNs. We also provide an algorithm that detects the dynamic ir­ relevance of state variables in forward simula­ tion. This algorithm exploits the structured CPTs in a reversed network to determine, in a time­ independent fashion, the conditions under which a variable does or does not need to be sampled.",
