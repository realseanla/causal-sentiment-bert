A key direction of this research aims at sensing, modeling, and predicting the various types of environmental phenomena spatially distributed over our natural and built-up habitats so as to improve our knowledge and understanding of their economic, environmental, and health impacts and implications. This is non-trivial to achieve due to a trade-off between the quantity of sensing resources (e.g., number of deployed sensors, energy consumption, mission time) and the uncertainty in predictive modeling. In the case of deploying a limited number of mobile robotic sensing assets, such a trade-off motivates the need to plan the most informative resource-constrained observation paths to minimize the uncertainty in modeling and predicting a spatially varying environmental phenomenon, which constitutes the active sensing problem to be addressed in this paper.\nA wide multitude of natural and urban environmental phenomena is characterized by spatially correlated field measurements, which raises the following fundamental issue faced by the active sensing problem:\nHow can the spatial correlation structure of an environmental phenomenon be exploited to improve the active sensing performance and computational efficiency of robotic path planning?\nThe works of [11, 12, 13] have tackled this issue specifically in the context of an environmental hotspot field by studying how its spatial correlation structure affects the performance advantage of adaptivity in path planning: If the field is large with a few small hotspots exhibiting extreme measurements and much higher spatial variability than the rest of the field, then adaptivity can provide better active sensing performance. On the other hand, non-adaptive sampling techniques [2, 8, 14] suffice for smoothly-varying fields.\nIn this paper, we will investigate the above issue for another important broad class of environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields that exhibit a (often much) higher spatial correlation along one direction than along its perpendicular direction. Such fields occur widely in natural and built-up environments and some of them include (a) ocean and freshwater phenomena like plankton density [6], fish abundance [23], temperature and salinity [22]; (b) soil and atmospheric phenomena like peat thickness [25], surface soil moisture [26], rainfall [18]; (c) mineral deposits like radioactive ore [19]; (d) pollutant and contaminant concentration like air [1], heavy metals [16]; and (e) ecological abundance like vegetation density [9].\nThe geostatistics community has examined a related issue of how the spatial correlation structure of an anisotropic field\nar X\niv :1\n30 2.\n07 23\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n5 F\neb 2\n01 3\ncan be exploited to improve the predictive performance of a sampling design for a static sensor network. To resolve this, the following heuristic design [25] is commonly used for sampling the anisotropic fields described above: Arrange and place the static sensors in a rectangular grid such that one axis of the grid is aligned along the direction of lowest spatial correlation (i.e., highest spatial variability) and the grid spacing along this axis as compared to that along its perpendicular axis is proportional to the ratio of their respective spatial correlations. In the case of path planning for k robots, one may consider the sampling locations of the rectangular grid as cities to be visited in a k-traveling salesman problem so as to minimize the total distance traveled or mission time [15]. However, since the resulting observation paths are constrained by the heuristic sampling design, they are suboptimal in solving the active sensing problem (i.e., minimizing the predictive uncertainty). This drawback is exacerbated when the robots are capable of sampling at a higher resolution along their paths (e.g., due to high sensor sampling rate) than that of the grid, hence gathering suboptimal observations while traversing between grid locations.\nThis paper presents two principled approaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based on entropy and mutual information (respectively, Sections 3 and 4) criteria for in situ active sensing of environmental phenomena. In contrast to the existing methods described above, our proposed path planning algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between active sensing performance and computational efficiency. An important practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit the spatial correlation structure of anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. The specific contributions of our work in this paper include: • Analyzing the time complexity of our proposed algorithms\nand proving analytically that they scale better than stateof-the-art information-theoretic path planning algorithms [8, 13] with increasing length of planning horizon (Sections 3 and 4); • Providing theoretical guarantees on the active sensing per-\nformance of our proposed algorithms (Sections 3 and 4) for a class of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task (Section 2.1), which, in particular, can be improved with longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along the transect; • Empirically evaluating the time efficiency and active sens-\ning performance of our proposed algorithms on real-world temperature and plankton density field data (Section 5)."

      "text" : "In a transect sampling task [14, 24], a team of k robots is tasked to explore and sample an environmental phenomenon spatially distributed over a transect (Fig. 1) that is discretized into a r × n grid of sampling locations where the number n of columns is assumed to be much larger than the number r of sampling locations in each column, r is expected to be small in a transect, and k ≤ r. The columns are indexed in an increasing order from left to right. The k robots are constrained to simultaneously explore forward one column at a time from the leftmost column ‘1’ to the rightmost column ‘n’ such that each robot samples one location per column for a total of n locations. Hence, each robot, given its current location, can move to any of the r\nlocations in the adjacent column on its right. In practice, the transect sampling task is especially appropriate for and widely performed by mobile robots with limited maneuverability (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous surface and underwater vehicles (AUVs) [21]) because it involves less complex path maneuvers that can be achieved more reliably using less sophisticated on-board control algorithms. In terms of practical applicability, transect sampling is a particularly useful exploration task to be performed during the transit from the robot’s current location to a distant planned waypoint [10, 24] to collect the most informative observations. For active sensing of ocean and freshwater phenomena, the transect can span a spatial feature of interest such as a harmful algal bloom or pollutant plume to be explored and sampled by a fleet of AUVs being deployed off a ship vessel."

      "text" : "An environmental phenomenon is defined to vary as a realization of a rich class of Bayesian non-parametric models called the Gaussian process (GP) [20] that can formally characterize its spatial correlation structure and be refined with increasing number of observations. More importantly, GP can provide formal measures of predictive uncertainty (e.g., based on an entropy or mutual information criterion) for directing the robots to explore the highly uncertain areas of the phenomenon.\nLet D be a set of sampling locations representing the domain of the environmental phenomenon such that each location x ∈ D is associated with a realized (random) measurement zx (Zx) if x is sampled/observed (unobserved). Let {Zx}x∈D denote a GP, that is, every finite subset of {Zx}x∈D has a multivariate Gaussian distribution [20]. The GP is fully specified by its prior mean µx , E[Zx] and covariance σxx′ , cov[Zx, Zx′ ] for all x, x\n′ ∈ D. In the experiments (Section 5), we assume that the GP is second-order stationary, i.e., it has a constant prior mean and a stationary prior covariance structure (i.e., σxx′ is a function of x− x′ for all x, x′ ∈ D), both of which are assumed to be known. In particular, its covariance structure is defined by the widely-used squared exponential covariance function\nσxx′ , σ 2 s exp { −1\n2 (x− x′)TM−2(x− x′)\n} + σ2nδxx′ (1)\nwhere σ2s and σ 2 n are, respectively, the signal and noise variances controlling the intensity and noise of the measurements, M is a diagonal matrix with length-scale components `1 and `2 controlling the degree of spatial correlation or “similarity” between measurements along (i.e., horizontal direction) and perpendicular to (i.e., vertical direction) the transect, respectively, and δxx′ is a Kronecker delta of value 1 if x = x′, and 0 otherwise. For anisotropic fields, `1 6= `2.\nAn advantage of using GP to model the environmental phenomenon is its probabilistic regression capability: Given\na vector s of sampled locations and a column vector zs of corresponding measurements, the joint distribution of the measurements at any vector u of κ unobserved locations remains Gaussian with the following posterior mean vector and covariance matrix\nµu|s = µu + ΣusΣ −1 ss (zs − µs) (2)\nΣuu|s = Σuu − ΣusΣ−1ss Σsu (3) where µu (µs) is a column vector with mean components µx for every location x of u (s), Σus (Σss) is a covariance matrix with covariance components σxx′ for every pair of locations x of u (s) and x′ of s, and Σsu is the transpose of Σus. The posterior mean vector µu|s (2) is used to predict the measurements at vector u of κ unobserved locations. The uncertainty of these predictions can be quantified using the posterior covariance matrix Σuu|s (3), which is independent of the measurements zs, in two ways: (a) the trace of Σuu|s yields the sum of posterior variances Σxx|s over every location x of u; (b) the determinant of Σuu|s is used in calculating the Gaussian posterior joint entropy\nH(Zu|Zs) , 1\n2 log(2πe)κ ∣∣Σuu|s∣∣ . (4) Unlike the first measure of predictive uncertainty which assumes conditional independence between measurements at vector u of unobserved locations, the entropy-based measure (4) accounts for their correlation, thereby not overestimating their uncertainty. Hence, we will focus on using the entropy-based measure of uncertainty in this paper."

      "text" : "Notations. Each planning stage i is associated with column i of the transect for i = 1, . . . , n. In each stage i, the team of k robots samples from column i a total of k observations (each of which comprises a pair of a location and its measurement) that are denoted by a pair of vectors xi of k locations and Zxi of the corresponding random measurements. Let Xi denote the set of all possible robots’ sampling locations xi in stage i. It can be observed that χ , |X1| = . . . = |Xn| = rCk. We assume that the robots can deterministically (i.e., no stochasticity in motion) move from their current locations xi−1 in column i − 1 to the next locations xi in column i. Let xi:j and Zxi:j denote vectors concatenating robots’ sampling locations xi, . . . , xj and concatenating corresponding random measurements Zxi , . . . , Zxj over stages i to j, respectively, and Xi:j denote the set of all possible xi:j . Maximum Entropy Path Planning (MEPP). The work of [13] has proposed planning non-myopic observation paths x∗1:n with maximum entropy (i.e., highest uncertainty):\nx∗1:n = arg max x1:n∈X1:n H(Zx1:n) (5)\nthat, as proven in an equivalence result, minimize the posterior entropy/uncertainty remaining in the unobserved locations of the transect. Computing the maximum entropy paths x∗1:n incurs O ( χn(kn)3 ) , which is exponential in the length n of planning horizon. To mitigate this computational difficulty, an anytime heuristic search algorithm [7] is used to compute (5) approximately. However, its performance cannot be guaranteed. Furthermore, as reported in [14], when χ or n is large, its computed paths perform poorly even after incurring a huge amount of search time and space.\nApproximate MEPP(m). To establish a trade-off between active sensing performance and computational effi-\nciency, the key idea is to exploit a property of the covariance function (1) that the spatial correlation of measurements between any two locations decreases exponentially with increasing distance between them. Intuitively, such a property makes the measurements Zxi to be observed next in column i near-independent of the past distant measurements Zx1:i−m−1 observed from columns 1 to i−m−1 (i.e., far from column i) for a sufficiently large m by conditioning on the closer measurements Zxi−m:i−1 observed in columns i−m to i−1 (i.e., closer to column i). Consequently, H(Zxi |Zx1:i−1) can still be closely approximated by H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1) after assuming a m-th order Markov property, thus yielding the following approximation of the joint entropy H(Zx1:n) in (5):\nH(Zx1:n) = H(Zx1:m) + ∑n i=m+1 H(Zxi |Zx1:i−1)\n≈ H(Zx1:m) + ∑n i=m+1 H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1) . (6)\nThe first equality is due to the chain rule for entropy [3]. Using (6), MEPP (5) can be approximated by the following stage-wise dynamic programming equations, which we call MEPP(m):\nVi(xi−m:i−1) = max xi∈Xi H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1) + Vi+1(xi−m+1:i) Vn(xn−m:n−1) = max\nxn∈Xn H(Zxn |Zxn−m:n−1)\n(7) for stage i = m+1, . . . , n−1, each of which induces a corresponding optimal vector xEi of k locations given the optimal vector xEi−m:i−1 obtained from previous stages i−m to i−11. Let the optimal observation paths of MEPP(m) be denoted by xE1:n that concatenates\nxE1:m = arg max x1:m∈X1:m H(Zx1:m) + Vm+1(x1:m) (8)\nfor the first m stages and xEm+1, . . . , x E n derived using (7) for the subsequent stages m+ 1 to n. Our proposed MEPP(m) algorithm generalizes that of [14] which is essentially MEPP(1).\nTheorem 1 (Time Complexity). Deriving xE1:n of MEPP(m) requires O ( χm+1[n+ (km)3] ) time.\nThe proof of Theorem 1 is given in Appendix A.1. Unlike MEPP which scales exponentially in the planning horizon length n, our MEPP(m) algorithm scales linearly in n.\nLet ω1 and ω2 be the horizontal and vertical separation widths between adjacent grid locations, respectively, `′1 , `1/ω1 and ` ′ 2 , `2/ω2 denote the normalized horizontal and vertical length-scale components, respectively, and η , σ2n/σ 2 s . The following result bounds the loss in active sensing performance of the MEPP(m) algorithm (i.e., (7) and (8)) relative to that of MEPP (5):\nTheorem 2 (Performance Guarantee).

Theorem 2 reveals that the active sensing performance of MEPP(m)\n1In fact, solving MEPP(m) (7) yields a policy that, in each stage i, induces an optimal vector for every possible vector xi−m:i−1 (including possible diverged paths from x E i−m:i−1 due to external forces) obtained from previous m stages.\ncan be improved by decreasing , which is achieved using higher noise-to-signal ratio η (i.e., noisy, less intense fields), smaller number k of robots, shorter planning horizon length n, larger m, and/or lower spatial correlation `′1 along the transect. Two important implications result: (a) Increasing m trades off computational efficiency (Theorem 1) for better active sensing performance, and (b) if the spatial correlation of the anisotropic field along the transect is sufficiently low to maintain a relatively tight bound such that only a small m is needed, then MEPP(m) can exploit this spatial correlation structure to gain time efficiency while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance. In practice, it is often possible to obtain prior knowledge on a direction of low spatial correlation (refer to ocean and freshwater phenomena in Section 1 for examples) and align it with the horizontal axis of the transect."

      "heading" : "4. MUTUAL INFORMATION-BASED PATH PLANNING",
      "text" : "Notations. Recall that the team of k robots selects k locations xi to be sampled from column i of the transect for i = 1, . . . , n. Let ui denote a vector of remaining r − k unobserved locations in column i and Zui denote a vector of the corresponding random measurements. Let ui:j and Zui:j denote vectors concatenating remaining unobserved locations ui, . . . , uj and concatenating corresponding random measurements Zui , . . . , Zuj over stages i to j, respectively. Maximum Mutual Information Path Planning (M2IPP). An alternative to MEPP is to plan non-myopic observation paths x?1:n that share the maximum mutual information with the remaining unobserved locations u?1:n of the transect:\nx?1:n = arg max x1:n∈X1:n I(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n)\nI(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n) , H(Zu1:n)−H(Zu1:n |Zx1:n) . (9)\nFrom (9), I(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n) measures the reduction in entropy/ uncertainty of the measurements Zu1:n at the remaining unobserved locations u1:n of the transect by observing the measurements Zx1:n to be sampled along the paths x1:n. So, the path planning of M2IPP (9) is equivalent to the selection of remaining unobserved locations with the largest entropy reduction (i.e., determining u?1:n). This may be mistakenly perceived as the selection of remaining unobserved locations with the lowest uncertainty (i.e., minimizing posterior entropy term H(Zu1:n |Zx1:n) in (9)), which is exactly what the path planning of MEPP (5) can achieve, as mentioned in Section 3. Note, however, that the maximum mutual information paths (9) planned by M2IPP can in fact induce a very large prior entropy H(Zu1:n) but not necessarily the smallest posterior entropy H(Zu1:n |Zx1:n). Consequently, MEPP and M2IPP exhibit different path planning behaviors and resulting active sensing performances, as shown empirically in Section 5.\nSimilar to MEPP, M2IPP incurs exponential time in the length of planning horizon. To relieve this computational burden, we will describe an approximation algorithm for planning maximum mutual information paths next.\nApproximate M2IPP(m). We will exploit the same property of the covariance function (1) as that used by MEPP(m) (Section 3) to establish a trade-off between active sensing performance and computational efficiency for our M2IPP(m) algorithm. However, this is not as straightforward to achieve as that to derive MEPP(m) where a m-th order Markov\nproperty can simply be imposed on each posterior entropy term in (6). To illustrate this, using the chain rule for mutual information [3],\nI(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n) = I(Zx1:m ;Zu1:n) + n−m−1∑ i=m+1 I(Zxi ;Zu1:n |Zx1:i−1) + I(Zxn−m:n ;Zu1:n |Zx1:n−m−1) , after which a m-th order Markov property is assumed to yield the following approximation:\nI(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n) ≈ I(Zx1:m ;Zu1:n) + n−m−1∑ i=m+1 I(Zxi ;Zu1:n |Zxi−m:i−1)\n+ I(Zxn−m:n ;Zu1:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1) . (10)\nFrom (10), note that each conditional mutual information term I(Zxi ;Zu1:n |Zxi−m:i−1) cannot be evaluated individually because the remaining unobserved locations u1:n of the transect (specifically, u1:i−m−1 and ui+1:n in the respective columns 1 to i−m−1 and i+ 1 to n) cannot be determined simply by knowing the robots’ past and current sampling locations xi−m:i−1 and xi in columns i−m to i.\nTo resolve this, we exploit the same property of the covariance function (1) as that used by MEPP(m) (Section 3) again: It makes the measurements Zxi to be observed next in column i near-independent of the distant unobserved measurements Zu1:i−m−1 and Zui+m+1:n in the respective columns 1 to i − m − 1 and i + m + 1 to n (i.e., far from column i) for a sufficiently large m by conditioning on the closer measurements Zxi−m:i−1 and Zui−m:i+m in columns i − m to i + m (i.e., closer to column i). As a result, each term I(Zxi ;Zu1:n |Zxi−m:i−1) in (10) can be closely approximated by I(Zxi ;Zui−m:i+m |Zxi−m:i−1) for i = m+1, . . . , n−m−1:\nI(Zxi ;Zu1:n |Zxi−m:i−1) = H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1)−H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1 , Zu1:n) ≈ H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1)−H(Zxi |Zxi−m:i−1 , Zui−m:i+m) = I(Zxi ;Zui−m:i+m |Zxi−m:i−1)\nwhere the approximation follows from the above-mentioned conditional independence assumption and the equalities are due to the definition of conditional mutual information [3]. Similarly, I(Zx1:m ;Zu1:n) and I(Zxn−m:n ;Zu1:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1) in (10) are, respectively, approximated by I(Zx1:m ;Zu1:2m) and I(Zxn−m:n ;Zun−2m:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1). Then,\nI(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n) ≈ I(Zx1:m ;Zu1:2m)\n+ n−m−1∑ i=m+1 I(Zxi ;Zui−m:i+m |Zxi−m:i−1) + I(Zxn−m:n ;Zun−2m:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1)\n= I(Zx1:m ;Zu1:2m) + n−1∑ i=2m+1 I(Zxi−m ;Zui−2m:i |Zxi−2m:i−m−1)\n+ I(Zxn−m:n ;Zun−2m:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1) . (11) Using (11), M2IPP (9) can be approximated by the following stage-wise dynamic programming equations, which we call M2IPP(m):\nUi(xi−2m:i−1) = max xi∈Xi I(Zxi−m ;Zui−2m:i |Zxi−2m:i−m−1) + Ui+1(xi−2m+1:i)\nUn(xn−2m:n−1) = max xn∈Xn I(Zxn−m:n ;Zun−2m:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1) (12) for stage i = 2m+1, . . . , n−1, each of which induces a corresponding optimal vector xMi of k locations given the optimal vector xMi−2m:i−1 obtained from previous stages i − 2m to\ni−12. Note that the term I(Zxi−m ;Zui−2m:i |Zxi−2m:i−m−1) in each stage i can be evaluated now because the remaining unobserved locations ui−2m:i in columns i− 2m to i can be determined since the robots’ past and current sampling locations xi−2m:i−1 and xi in the same columns are given (i.e., as input to Ui and under the max operator, respectively). Let the optimal observation paths of M2IPP(m) be denoted by xM1:n that concatenates\nxM1:2m = arg max x1:2m∈X1:2m I(Zx1:m , Zu1:2m) + U2m+1(x1:2m) (13) for the first 2m stages and xM2m+1, . . . , x M n derived using (12) for the subsequent stages 2m+ 1 to n.\nTheorem 3 (Time Complexity). Deriving xM1:n of M2IPP(m) requires O ( χ2m+1[n+ 2(r(2m+ 1))3] ) time.\nThe proof of Theorem 3 is given in Appendix B.1. Unlike M2IPP that scales exponentially in the planning horizon length n, our M2IPP(m) algorithm scales linearly in n.\nThe following result bounds the loss in active sensing performance of the M2IPP(m) algorithm (i.e., (12) and (13)) relative to that of M2IPP (9):\nTheorem 4 (Performance Guarantee). The paths xM1:n are ε-optimal in achieving the maximum mutual information criterion, i.e., I(Zx?1:n ;Zu?1:n) − I(ZxM1:n ;ZuM1:n) ≤ ε where\nε , k(n−2m) [ rn+ 1\n2 k(n− 2m)\n] log 1+ exp { − (m+1) 2 2`′21 }2 η(1 + η) . The proof of Theorem 4 is given in Appendix B.3. As shown in Theorem 4, decreasing ε improves the active sensing performance of M2IPP(m); this can be achieved in a similar manner to that for decreasing the loss bound of MEPP(m) (see paragraph after Theorem 2) since the two loss bounds ε and are similar. In addition, smaller number r of sampling locations in each column decreases ε. M2IPP(m) shares the same implications as that of MEPP(m): (a) Increasing m trades off time efficiency (Theorem 3) for improved active sensing performance, and (b) M2IPP(m) can exploit a low spatial correlation `′1 of the anisotropic field along the transect to improve time efficiency (i.e., only requiring a small m) while preserving near-optimal active sensing performance (i.e., still maintaining a relatively tight bound ε)."

      "text" : "This section evaluates the active sensing performance and computational efficiency of the MEPP(m) (i.e., (7) and (8)) and M2IPP(m) (i.e., (12) and (13)) algorithms empirically on two real-world datasets: (a) May 2009 temperature field data of Panther Hollow Lake in Pittsburgh, PA spatially distributed over a 25 m by 150 m transect that is discretized into a 5× 30 grid [17], and (b) June 2009 plankton density field data of Chesapeake Bay spatially distributed over a 314 m by 1765 m transect that is discretized into a 8×45 grid [5]. These environmental phenomena are modeled by GPs with hyperparameters (i.e., horizontal and vertical lengthscales, signal and noise variances) (Section 2.2) learned using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) [20]: (a) `1 = 2Similar to MEPP(m), solving M2IPP(m) (12) yields a policy that, in each stage i, induces an optimal vector for every possible vector xi−2m:i−1 (including possible diverged paths from xEi−2m:i−1) obtained from previous 2m stages.\n40.45 m, `2 = 16.00 m, σ 2 s = 0.1542, and σ 2 n = 0.0036 for the temperature field, and (b) `1 = 27.53 m, `2 = 134.64 m, σ2s = 2.152, and σ 2 n = 0.041 for the plankton density field. It can be observed that the temperature and plankton density fields have low noise-to-signal ratios η of 0.023 and 0.019, respectively. Also, though both fields are observed to be highly anisotropic, the spatial correlation of the temperature field is much higher along the transect than perpendicular to it. According to Theorems 2 and 4, such field conditions lead to loose performance loss bounds for both algorithms, which does not necessarily imply their poor performance. So, the empirical evaluation here complements our theoretical results by assessing their performance-efficiency trade-off (i.e., by varying m) under these less favorable field conditions. To further investigate our algorithms’ trade-off behaviors under different horizontal and vertical spatial correlations, the corresponding length-scales `1 and `2 of the original temperature field (Fig. 2d) are reduced and fixed to produce three other modified fields (Figs. 2a, 2b, 2c) with the signal and noise variances σ2s and σ 2 n learned using MLE.\nComparison with Active Sensing Algorithms. The performance of our proposed algorithms is compared to that of state-of-the-art information-theoretic path planning algorithms for active sensing: The work of [13] has proposed the following greedy maximum entropy path planning (gMEPP) algorithm:\nV gi (x1:i−1) = max xi∈Xi H(Zxi |Zx1:i−1) (14)\nfor stage i = 1, . . . , n, each of which induces a corresponding optimal vector xEi of k locations given the optimal vector xE1:i−1 obtained from previous stages 1 to i − 1. A greedy maximum mutual information path planning (gM2IPP) algorithm is devised by [8] as follows:\nUgi (x1:i−1) = max xi∈Xi I(Zx1:i ;Zx1:i) (15)\nfor stage i = 1, . . . , n, each of which induces a corresponding optimal vector xMi of k locations given the optimal vector xM1:i−1 obtained from previous stages 1 to i − 1, and x1:i denotes a vector of all sampling locations in the domain D excluding those of x1:i. As mentioned earlier in Section 3, the work of [14] has developed MEPP(1), which is a special case of our MEPP(m) algorithm.\nIn contrast to our MEPP(m) and M2IPP(m) algorithms that scale linearly in the length n of planning horizon (Theorems 1 and 3), deriving xE1:n of gMEPP and x M 1:n of gM\n2IPP incurs quartic time in n. Hence, if the required value of m is sufficiently small, then MEPP(m) and M2IPP(m) can be more efficient than the greedy algorithms, as shown below.\nPerformance Metrics. The tested algorithms are evaluated using three different metrics: The (a) entropy metric EN(x1:n) , H(Zu1:n |Zx1:n) and (b) mutual information metric MI(x1:n) , I(Zx1:n ;Zu1:n) measure, respectively, the\nTable 1: Comparison of EN(x1:n), MI(x1:n), and ER(x1:n) (×10−5) performance for different temperature fields shown in Fig. 2 with varying number of robots.

It has an advantage over the two informationtheoretic metrics of using ground truth measurements to evaluate if the phenomenon is being predicted accurately. However, unlike the EN(x1:n) and MI(x1:n) metrics that account for the spatial correlation between measurements at the unobserved locations u1:n, the ER(x1:n) metric assumes conditional independence between them. In contrast to the ER(x1:n) metric, the EN(x1:n) and MI(x1:n) metrics consequently do not overestimate their uncertainty."

This can be explained by one of the following reasons: (a) A low spatial correlation along the transect cannot be exploited by gMEPP and gM2IPP, which consider the entire history of past measurements for improving active sensing performance; (b) a high correlation perpendicular to the transect can be exploited by MEPP(m) for better active sensing performance; and (c) unlike the greedy gMEPP and gM2IPP algorithms, MEPP(m) is capable of non-myopic planning to improve active sensing performance.\nFor field c (i.e., of large `1 and small `2) with 1 robot, MEPP(m) cannot exploit the low spatial correlation perpendicular to the transect for improving active sensing performance. Therefore, it needs to raise the value of m up to 4 in order to better exploit the high spatial correlation along the transect. Consequently, MEPP(m) can achieve EN(xE1:n) performance comparable to that achieved by gMEPP and gM2IPP while incurring similar computational time as gMEPP and about 2 orders of magnitude less time than gM2IPP. Increasing the number of robots allows MEPP(m) to achieve EN(xE1:n) performance comparable to that of gMEPP and gM2IPP using smaller values of m (i.e., m = 1 or 2), hence incurring 1 to 4 orders of magnitude less time.\n5.1.2 Mutual Information Metric MI(x1:n) The mutual information-based M2IPP(m) and gM2IPP\nalgorithms often perform better than or at least as well as the entropy-based MEPP(m) and gMEPP in this metric.\nFor fields a, b, and d (i.e., of small `1 or large `2) with any number of robots, M2IPP(m) can generally yield MI(xM1:n) values higher than or comparable to that achieved by gM2IPP and gMEPP using a small m value of 1, hence incurring less computational time (in particular, about 2 orders of magnitude less time than gM2IPP), as shown in Fig. 3. This can be explained by the same reasons as that discussed previously in Section 5.1.1.\nFor field c (i.e., of large `1 and small `2) with 1 or 3 robots, M2IPP(m) cannot exploit the low spatial correlation perpendicular to the transect for improving active sensing performance. So, it has to increase the value of m to 2 in order to better exploit the high correlation along the transect. As a result, M2IPP(m) can achieve MI(xM1:n) performance comparable to that achieved by gM2IPP and gMEPP while incurring less time with 1 robot and slightly more time with 3 robots than gM2IPP. With 2 robots, m = 1 suffices for M2IPP(m) to achieve MI(xM1:n) performance comparable to that achieved by gM2IPP and gMEPP while incurring less time (Fig. 3). A computationally cheaper alternative for active sensing of field c is to consider using MEPP(m) with larger m: When the values of m are raised to 4, 2, and 4 for the respective 1-, 2-, and 3-robot cases, it can produce MI(xE1:n) performance comparable to that achieved by gM2IPP and gMEPP while incurring similar or less time.\n5.1.3 Prediction Error Metric ER(x1:n) For field c (i.e., of large `1 and small `2) with any num-\nber of robots, MEPP(m) and M2IPP(m) cannot exploit the low spatial correlation perpendicular to the transect for improving active sensing performance. Hence, their values of m need to be raised in order to exploit the high correlation along the transect. Compared to M2IPP(m), it is computationally cheaper (Fig. 3) and offers greater performance improvement (Table 1) to increase the value of m of MEPP(m), which can then produce ER(xE1:n) values lower than that achieved by gMEPP and gM2IPP while incurring similar computational time to gMEPP and about 2 orders of magnitude less time than gM2IPP with 1 robot and 1 to 4 orders of magnitude less time than both with 2 or 3 robots. For field d (i.e., of large `1 and large `2) with any number of robots, MEPP(m) can now exploit the high spatial correlation perpendicular to the transect for better active sensing performance. As a result, MEPP(m) can yield better ER(xE1:n) performance than gMEPP and gM\n2IPP using smaller values of m (i.e., m = 1 or 2), hence incurring 1 to 4 orders of magnitude less time.\nFor fields a and b (i.e., of small `1) with 1 or 2 robots, M2IPP(m) can produce ER(xM1:n) values lower than or comparable to that achieved by gM2IPP and gMEPP using a small m value of 1, hence incurring less time (in particular, about 2 orders of magnitude less time than gM2IPP),\nas shown in Fig. 3. Increasing to 3 robots allows MEPP(m) to achieve ER(xE1:n) performance better than or comparable to that of gMEPP and gM2IPP using a small m value of 1, hence incurring 3 to 4 orders of magnitude less time (Fig. 3).

Note that they corroborate the second implications of Theorems 2 and 4 on the performance guarantees of MEPP(m) and M2IPP(m).\nFor anisotropic fields with high spatial correlation along the transect (e.g., temperature fields c and d), a larger m value is needed in order for MEPP(m) and M2IPP(m) to exploit it if the correlation perpendicular to the transect is low (i.e., field c). Compared to M2IPP(m), it is computationally cheaper to increase the value of m of MEPP(m) such that it performs better or at least as well as gMEPP and gM2IPP in all three metrics while incurring similar time to gMEPP and about 2 orders of magnitude less time than gM2IPP with 1 robot and often 1 to 4 orders of magnitude less time than both with 2 or 3 robots.

      "heading" : "6. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "This paper describes two principled information-theoretic path planning algorithms based on entropy and mutual information criteria (respectively, MEPP(m) and M2IPP(m)) for active sensing of GP-based anisotropic fields. Two important practical implications result from the theoretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of our algorithms (Theorems 2 and 4): Increasing m trades off computational efficiency (Theorems 1 and 3) for better active sensing performance, and our algorithms can exploit a low spatial correlation along the transect to improve time efficiency (i.e., only needing a small m) while preserving nearoptimal active sensing performance. This motivates the use of prior knowledge, if available, on a direction of low spatial correlation in order to align it with the horizontal axis of the transect. Empirical evaluation of real-world anisotropic temperature and plankton density field data reveals that our algorithms can perform better or at least as well as gMEPP and gM2IPP while often incurring a few orders of magnitude less time. In particular, it can be observed that anisotropic fields with low spatial correlation along the transect or high correlation perpendicular to the transect allow our algorithms to perform well using small values of m, thus yielding significant computational gain over gMEPP and gM2IPP. To perform well in a field with high correlation along the transect and low correlation perpendicular to the transect (i.e., less favorable conditions), our algorithms have to increase the value of m or the number of robots but can still achieve comparable or better time efficiency than gMEPP and gM2IPP."

The time needed to propagate the optimal values from stages n−1 to m+ 1 is O(χm+1(n−m− 1)).

Then, Y = AW.\nW>EW + W>E>B−1EW ≥ 0 (19)\n⇒W>B>B−1EW + W>E>B−1EW ≥ 0 (20)\n⇒W>(B + E)>B−1EW ≥ 0\n⇒W>A>B−1EW + W>A>W ≥W>A>W\n⇒W>A>(B−1E + I)W ≥W>A>W\n⇒W>A>B−1(E + B)W ≥W>A>A−1AW\n⇒ (AW)>B−1AW ≥ (AW)>A−1AW\n⇒ Y>B−1Y ≥ Y>A−1Y ⇒ ΣyAΣ−1BBΣAy ≥ ΣyAΣ −1 AAΣAy . (21)\nTo derive (19), since W is a vector and E = σ2nI, W >EW ≥ 0. Since B is a covariance matrix that is invertible and positive semi-definite, B−1 is positive semi-definite. Hence, W>E>B−1EW ≥ 0 and (19) therefore holds. Since B is symmetric, B> = B. Hence, (20) can be obtained from (19). The rest of the derivation from (20) to (21) is straightforward. From (17),\nσ2y|A = σ 2 s + σ 2 n − ΣyAΣ−1AAΣAy\n≥ σ2s + σ2n − ΣyAΣ−1BBΣAy (22) ≥ σ2n . (23)\nNote that (22) and (23) follow from (21) and (18), respectively. Therefore, Lemma 6 holds.\nLemma 7. H(Zxi−m−1 |Zxi−m:i−1)−H(Zxi−m−1 |Zxi−m:i−1 , Zxi) ≤ k2 log { 1 + ξ2\nη(1 + η)\n} .\nProof. We will first prove for the single-robot case. This result will be used later for the multi-robot case. Let xA , xi−m:i−1 and xp , xi−m−1.\nσ2xi−m−1|xi−m:i−1 − σ 2 xi−m−1|(xi−m:i−1,xi)\n= σ2xp|xA − σ 2 xp|(xA,xi) ≤ σ2xp − σ 2 xp|xi\n= σ2xp − ( σ2xp −\nσxpxiσxixp σ2xi\n)\n≤ σ4s exp\n{ − (m+1) 2\n2`′21 }2 σ2s + σ2n\n= σ2sξ 2\n1 + η . (24)\nThe first inequality follows from the property that variance reduction is submodular [4] in many practical cases (e.g., further conditioning on ZxA does not make Zxp and Zxi more correlated). To intuitively understand this notion of submodularity, observing a new location xi will reduce the variance at location xp more if few or no observations are made, and less if many observations are already taken (e.g.,\nat locations xA). The second equality is due to (3). The second inequality follows from the fact that the distance between any two locations from stage i and stage i−m− 1 is at least ω1(m+1). So, σxpxi ≤ σ2s exp{−(m+1)2/(2`′21 )}.\nH(Zxi−m−1 |Zxi−m:i−1)−H(Zxi−m−1 |Zxi−m:i−1 , Zxi) = H(Zxp |ZxA)−H(Zxp |ZxA , Zxi)\n= 1\n2 log σ2xp|xA σ2xp|(xA,xi)\n(25)\n≤ 1 2\nlog σ2xp|(xA,xi) +\nσ2sξ 2 1+η\nσ2xp|(xA,xi) (26)\n= 1\n2 log\n{ 1 +\nσ2sξ 2\nσ2xp|(xA,xi)(1 + η)\n}\n≤ 1 2 log\n{ 1 + σ2sξ 2\nσ2n(1 + η)\n} (27)\n≤ log { 1 + ξ2\nη(1 + η)\n} . (28)\nUsing (4), (25) can be obtained. Inequality (26) results from (24). Inequality (27) can be obtained using Lemma 6.\nWe will now prove for the k-robot case where k > 1. Then, vectors xi and xp comprise k locations each. Let x j i (x j p) denote the j-th location component in vector xi (xp). Let x j:t i (xj:tp ) denote a vector comprising the j-th to t-th location components in vector xi (xp).

The time needed to perform this over all χ2m possible vectors xi−2m:i−1 in each stage i is χ2m ×O(χ[r(2m+ 1)]3) = O(χ2m+1[r(2m+ 1)]3).

The time needed to propagate the optimal values from stages n − 1 to 2m + 1 is O(χ2m+1(n− 2m− 1)). Similarly, the time needed to evaluate I(Zxn−m:n ;Zun−2m:n |Zxn−2m:n−m−1) over all possible xn ∈ Xn and all χ2m possible vectors xn−2m:n−1 in stage n is O(χ2m+1[r(2m + 1)]3).

This paper presents two principled ap-<lb>proaches to efficient information-theoretic path planning based<lb>on entropy and mutual information criteria for in situ ac-<lb>tive sensing of an important broad class of widely-occurring<lb>environmental phenomena called anisotropic fields. Our pro-<lb>posed algorithms are novel in addressing a trade-off between<lb>active sensing performance and time efficiency. An impor-<lb>tant practical consequence is that our algorithms can exploit<lb>the spatial correlation structure of Gaussian process-based<lb>anisotropic fields to improve time efficiency while preserv-<lb>ing near-optimal active sensing performance. We analyze<lb>the time complexity of our algorithms and prove analyti-<lb>cally that they scale better than state-of-the-art algorithms<lb>with increasing planning horizon length. We provide the-<lb>oretical guarantees on the active sensing performance of<lb>our algorithms for a class of exploration tasks called tran-<lb>sect sampling, which, in particular, can be improved with<lb>longer planning time and/or lower spatial correlation along<lb>the transect. Empirical evaluation on real-world anisotropic<lb>field data shows that our algorithms can perform better or<lb>at least as well as the state-of-the-art algorithms while of-<lb>ten incurring a few orders of magnitude less computational<lb>time, even when the field conditions are less favorable.",
