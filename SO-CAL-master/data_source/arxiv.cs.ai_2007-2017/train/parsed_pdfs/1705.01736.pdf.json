When candidates are not representative of the population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one; this holds even when the underlying metric is a line. We examine how this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio improves from 3 to (4 − 2 √ 2) ≈ 1.1716; this bound is tight. When the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of 1.5 and a constant upper bound strictly better than 2 on the distortion of majority rule.\nThe aforementioned positive results depend in part on the assumption that the two candidates are independently and identically distributed. However, we show that i.i.d. candidates do not suffice for our upper bounds: if the population of candidates can be different from that of voters, an upper bound of 2 on the distortion is tight for both general metric spaces and the line. Thus, we show a constant gap between representative and non-representative candidates in both cases. The exact size of this gap in general metric spaces is a natural open question."

      "text" : "“[...] and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”\n— Abraham Lincoln\nAbraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address culminated with the oft-quoted words above. This single sentence gives a remarkably succinct summary of the role of a country’s populace in a participatory democracy, identifying three distinct facets: (1) The government should be of the people: the members of the government should be drawn from — and by inference representative\nof — the country’s populace. (2) The government should be by the people: decisions should be made by the populace. (3) The government should be for the people: its objective should be to serve the interests of the populace. In Lincoln’s words, the central question we study here is the following:\nIf a government by the people is to be for the people, how important is it that it also be of the people?\nIn quantifying this question, we observe that there is a surprisingly clean mapping of Lincoln’s vision onto central concepts of social choice theory:\n1. Who is the government of? Who are the candidates (people or ideas) to be aggregated?\n2. Who is the government by? What are the social choice rules used for aggregation?\n3. Who is the government for? What objective function is to be optimized?\nWhile the exact social choice rules to be used have been a topic of vigorous debate for several centuries [14, 15, 5, 12], the broad class they are drawn from is generally agreed upon: voters provide an ordinal ranking of (a subset of) the candidates, and these rankings are then aggregated to produce either a single winner or a consensus ranking of all (or some) candidates. Social choice is limited by the severe impossibility results of Arrow [5] and Gibbard and Satterthwaite [19, 28], establishing that even very simple combinations of desired axioms are in general unachievable. These impossibility results in turn have resulted in a fruitful line of work exploring restrictions on individuals’ preference orders for circumventing the impossibility of social choice.\nOne of the avenues toward circumventing the impossibility results simultaneously doubles as a framework for addressing the third question: What objective function is to be optimized by the social choice rule? The key modeling assumption is that all candidates (ideas or people) and voters are embedded in a metric space: small distances model high agreement, while large distances correspond to disagreement [8, 17, 9, 24, 23, 7, 27, 6]. The metric induces a preference order over candidates for each voter: she simply ranks candidates by distance from herself. When the metric space is specifically the line, we obtain the well-known and much studied special case of singlepeaked preferences [8, 24]. Embedding voters and candidates in a metric space has historically served two purposes: (1) Restricting the metric space — for example, by limiting its dimension — defines a restricted class of ordinal preference profiles, and might help circumvent the classic impossibility results of social choice. (2) The distances naturally provide an objective function: the best alternative is the one that is closest to the voters on average. Even when the metric space is unrestricted, replacing the hard axioms of social choice theory with this objective function can “circumvent” impossibility results through approximation [25], and permits comparing different social rules by quantifying their worst-case performance.\nWhile distances yield cardinal preferences and a social objective function, it is arguably unrealistic to expect individuals to articulate distances accurately. It is consequently unsurprising that common and well-established voting rules typically restrict voters to providing ordinal information, such as rankings or a single vote. Therefore, we view the metric space as implicit, and a social choice function as optimizing the associated cardinal objective function using only ordinal information.\nThis viewpoint was recently crisply expressed in a sequence of works originating with Anshelevich et al. [2, 3, 4, 1, 20]. In particular, Anshelevich et al. [2] examine many of the most widely\nused election voting rules, guided by the question: “How much worse is the outcome of voting than would be the omniscient choice of the best available candidate?” They showed remarkable separations: while some voting rules guarantee a distortion of no more than a constant factor, others are off by a factor that increases linearly in the number of candidates or — even worse — voters. The simplest, and in some sense canonical, example of such distortion is captured as follows:\nExample 1 A population consists of voters of whom just below half lean solidly left (at position −1), while just over half are just to the right of center (at position ǫ > 0). The population conducts an election between a solidly left-wing (position −1) and a solidly right-wing (position 1) candidate.\nBecause the centrist voters express their (slight) preference for the right-wing candidate, he is elected by a small majority. However, the average distance from the population to the right-wing candidate (1.5) is thrice that to the left-wing candidate (0.5), meaning that the majority vote led to a loss of a factor three in the utility.\nWe follow prior nomenclature in this domain [26, 10, 13, 11, 2] and term this utility loss the distortion. In examining Example 1 more closely, we identify a likely culprit for the high distortion: the right-wing candidate was not representative of the population — he was not of the people. Had we drawn two candidates from the population, the winner would in fact always be the socially optimal choice in this case. If we wanted to create the possibility of recreating the above example, we would need to move some fraction δ of the population to the right wing. If δ were large, then the election of a right-wing candidate would not be nearly as bad according to the objective function; conversely, if δ were small, then it would be unlikely that a right-wing candidate would run, so most of the time, the social choice rule would select an optimal candidate. Thus, intuitively, when candidates are drawn from the population, we would expect the distortion in the social cost to be better than when they are not. The goal of this article is to investigate to what extent this intuition holds.\nThe Model\nFormally, we assume that the candidates and voters are jointly located in a (finite) metric space; the distance between i and j is denoted by di,j. The candidates’ locations are given by a probability distribution p, while the voters’ location distribution is denoted by q. In order to isolate the driving question and side-step issues of specific voting rules, we focus on the simplest social choice scenario: two candidates i, i′ are drawn i.i.d. from p, and a simple majority vote determines the\nwinner between them. Voter j votes for the one of i, i′ who is closer1 to j. The social cost of candidate i is ci = ∑ j qjdi,j . With w(i, i ′) denoting the winner of the election and o(i, i′) the socially optimal candidate, the expected distortion of voting is ∑\ni,i′ pipi′ cw(i,i′) co(i,i′) . Our goal is then to\nunderstand whether and by how much the distortion decreases when candidates are of the people (when p = q).\nOur Results\nWe begin our investigation with arguably the simplest metric space, which nonetheless is frequently used to describe the political spectrum of countries: the line. As we saw in Example 1, even for the line, voting between two arbitrary candidates can lead to a distortion of 3. Our first main result (proved in Section 3) is that when two candidates are drawn i.i.d. from p = q, the expected distortion is at most 4 − 2 √ 2 ≈ 1.1716, and this bound is tight. The lower-bound example is in fact of the type discussed after Example 1, obtained by moving a suitable population mass δ from location ǫ to location 1. The more difficult part of the proof is the upper bound, and in particular, the proof that the worst-case distribution of voters/candidates always has support size 3. The proof proceeds by showing that for larger support sizes, there is always a sequence of alterations that gradually shifts the population to fewer locations, without lowering the distortion.\nNext, we turn our attention to general metric spaces. For arbitrary metric spaces, the distortion of voting can be larger. In Section 5, we analyze a simple example: just under half the population is located at one point i, while the rest of the population is spread out evenly over n ≫ 1 locations that are at distances just below 1 from each other and at distance 1 from i. As n → ∞, we show that the expected distortion converges to 32 . The upper bound we establish in Section 5 does not match this lower bound: we show that for every metric and every p, the expected distortion is at most 2 − 1652 . We conjecture that the bound of 32 is in fact tight — proving or disproving this conjecture is a natural direction for future work, discussed in Section 6.\nThe significance of our upper bounds on distortion (for the line and for general metric spaces) arises from the contrast to the corresponding bounds when q 6= p. In revisiting the improved distortion results we prove, we notice two potential driving factors: (1) The two candidates are independently and identically distributed. (2) The distributions of candidates and voters are the same. One may wonder whether the innocuous-looking assumption of i.i.d. candidates alone could be responsible for the lower distortion, without requiring that candidates be of the people. In Section 4, we rule out this possibility by establishing a (tight) bound of 2 on the distortion of voting when candidates are drawn i.i.d. from p 6= q, both in general metrics and on the line. The (small, but constant) gap between the distortions of 2− 1652 and 2 in general metric spaces, and the significant gap between the distortions of 4−2 √ 2 ≈ 1.1716 and 2 on the line, show that government by the people is more efficient when it is also of the people. The exact size of the gap between the two distortions in general metric spaces is a natural open question.\n1 Throughout, we will assume when convenient that the metric and distribution are in general position. Specifically, there are no ties in any voter’s preference order, and there are no ties in any election outcome. Ties could in principle be dealt with using suitable tie breaking rules, but the slight gain in generality would not be worth the overhead.\nRelated Work\nThere has been a lot of interest recently in circumventing the impossibility results of voting and social choice by approximation; see, e.g., [26, 25, 13] and [11] for a recent survey. Of particular interest is the recent direction in which the voters’ objective functions are derived from proximity in a metric space [2, 3, 4, 1, 20, 18]. One of the important issues is providing incentives for truthful revelation of preferences (e.g., [18]); in this paper, we side-step this issue by considering only elections between two candidates at a time.\nOur work is most directly inspired by the recent work of Anshelevich et al. [2, 3], which analyzes the distortion of ordinal voting rules when evaluated for metric preferences. Our work departs from [2, 3] in assuming that the candidates themselves are drawn i.i.d. from underlying distributions, and in particular in analyzing the case when the distribution of the candidates is equal to that of the voters.\nAnshelevich and Postl [3] consider a condition of instances that also aims to capture that candidates are in some sense “representative” of the voting population. Specifically, they define a notion of decisiveness as follows: Let i be a voter, and ji, j ′ i her two closest candidates, with di,ji ≤ di,j′i . An instance is α-decisive (for α ≤ 1) if di,ji ≤ αdi,j′i for all i; in other words, when α ≪ 1, every voter has a strongly preferred candidate. Naturally, the decisiveness condition is applicable only in elections in which the number of candidates is large or the space of voters is highly clustered. In our work, by considering candidates drawn from the voter distribution, we avoid such assumptions."

Depending on the context, we will refer to i as a point, candidate, or voter. The probability for a candidate to be drawn from point i is pi; we write p = (pi)i. The fraction of voters at i is qi, summarized as q = (qi)i. For a subset of points A, we write pA = ∑ i∈A pi to denote the total probability mass in A, and similarly for qA.

      "text" : "We begin with the simplest setting: the underlying metric space is the line, and two candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters (p = q). We first show a family of examples (a variant of Example 1) for which the expected distortion gets arbitrarily close to 4− 2 √ 2 ≈ 1.1716.\nExample 2 The metric space is the line, denoted by L. There are p1 = 12 − ǫ voters at location x1 = −1, p2 = 1− 1√2 voters at x2 = ǫ, and p3 = 1√ 2 − 12+ǫ voters at x3 = 1. This example is obtained from Example 1 by moving a suitable fraction of voters from location x2 = ǫ to x3 = 1, carefully trading off between two factors: (1) decreasing the pairwise distortion between the candidates at −1 and 1, but (2) increasing the chance of a such an election happening.\nBecause the voters at x2 = ǫ are slightly closer to 1 than to -1, a candidate drawn from x3 = 1 will win against a candidate drawn from x1 = −1. The costs of the two candidates are\nc1 = p2d1,2 + p3d1,3 = p2 + 2p3 +O(ǫ) = 1√ 2 +O(ǫ), c3 = p1d1,3 + p2d2,3 = 2p1 + p2 −O(ǫ) = 2− 1√ 2 −O(ǫ).\nBecause the candidates are drawn independently from p, the election between x1 and x3 happens with probability 2p1p3. In all other cases (when a candidate from x2 runs against one from x1 or x3, or both candidates are from the same location), the voters elect the socially better candidate. Therefore, the expected distortion is\nC (L,p,p) = (1− 2p1p3) · 1 + (2p1p3) · c3 c1\n= 4− 2 √ 2−O(ǫ).\nOur first main result is that Example 2 gives the worst distortion on the line.\nTheorem 3 For any distribution p, we have C (L,p,p) ≤ 4− 2 √ 2.\nWe will prove Theorem 3 in Section 3.2.

      "text" : "Given a distribution on the line with support size n, we label the support points as 1, . . . , n from left to right. Let m be the index of the median3, and let L = {1, . . . ,m−1} and R = {m+1, . . . , n} denote the locations to the left and to the right of the median, respectively. By the definition of the median, pL < 1 2 < pL + pm and pR < 1 2 < pm + pR.\nLemma 4 If two candidates (x, y) are drawn, the one closer to m wins the election.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we assume that dx,m < dy,m and x ∈ L ∪ {m}; that is, x lies to the left of the median, or x is the median. There are two cases depending on whether y is also to the left of m.\n1. If y ∈ L, then all voters to the right of the median as well as the median are going to vote for x, so x gets a pm + pR > 1 2 fraction of the votes.\n2. If y ∈ R, then all voters in L as well as m are going to vote for x, so x gets a pL + pm > 12 fraction of the votes.\nIn either case, x gets more than half of the votes and wins the election.\nThe next lemma characterizes the social cost ordering on the line.\nLemma 5 If x, y are on the same side of the median m (including one of them being the median), the one closer to m has smaller social cost.\nProof. Without loss of generality, assume that x ∈ L∪{m}, y ∈ L, and dx,m < dy,m. Intuitively, x has smaller social cost because more than half of the population need to first get to x before they can get to y. Formally, we have\ncx = ∑\ni∈L pidi,x +\n∑\ni∈{m}∪R pidi,x =\n∑ i∈L pidi,x + ∑ i∈{m}∪R pi (di,y − dx,y)\npL≤pm+pR ≤\n∑ i∈L pi (di,x − dx,y) + ∑ i∈{m}∪R pidi,y\n△−inequality ≤\n∑ i∈L pidi,y + ∑ i∈{m}∪R pidi,y = cy.\nAs a simple corollary of Lemmas 4 and 5, notice that if two candidates (x, y) are drawn from the same side of the median (including when one of them is the median), majority voting always elects the socially better candidate. This observation allows us to simplify the expression for C (D,p,p) on the line,\nC (L,p,p) = ∑\ni∈[n] p2i +\n∑\ni,j∈[n] 2pipjri,j = 1 +\n∑\ni∈L,j∈R 2pipj(ri,j − 1).\n3Recall that we assume the instance to be in general position, which implies uniqueness of the median.\n3.2 Proof of the Upper Bound of 4− 2 √ 2 In this section, we prove Theorem 3, showing that the worst-case distortion on the line is 4− 2 √ 2. The high-level idea is that, given any instance (L,p) with support size larger than 3, we can iteratively reduce its support size to 3 using a series of operations (Lemmas 6, 7 and 8), while preserving (or increasing) C (L,p,p). Once the instance has support size 3, we can optimize the locations and probabilities of these 3 points.\nAs before, let m be the index of the median, and let L = {1, . . . ,m−1} and R = {m+1, . . . , n} denote the points to the left and to the right of the median, respectively. We can assume that both L and R are non-empty; otherwise, the median is the leftmost or rightmost point, and we always elect the socially better candidate.\nThe proof proceeds by moving probability mass within L or within R to merge points until |L| = |R| = 1. None of the operations in this section will change the median m, so the election results are still decided by the candidates’ distance to m.\nWhen shifting the probability mass, we will not be able to guarantee that no pairwise election sees a decrease in distortion. Instead, we use a more global argument to show that the operation increases the distortion on average. We define ri to be the expected distortion conditioned on one of the candidates being i, and the other candidate being drawn according to p, that is,\nri = ∑\nj\npjri,j .\nWe will show that so long as pL, pm, and pR remain the same, C (L,p,p) is a linear function of the average distortion on one side of the median. By Lemmas 4 and 5, the pairwise distortion can be\nlarger than 1 only if two candidates are on different sides of m; therefore,\nC (L,p,p) = 1 + 2 ∑\ni∈L,j∈R pipj(ri,j − 1) = 1 + 2\n∑\ni∈L,j∈[n] pipj(ri,j − 1) = 1− 2pL + 2\n∑ i∈L piri,\nC (L,p,p) = 1− 2pR + 2 ∑\ni∈R piri.\nThe two preceding equations formalize that whenever pL and pR stay constant and ∑\ni∈R piri (or∑ i∈R piri) does not decrease, C (L,p,p) also does not decrease. This fact is exploited repeatedly in the proofs of the following lemmas.\nLemma 6 Let y∗ = argmaxy∈R ry be the “worst” candidate in R. Then, moving all probability mass from indices y > y∗ to y∗ does not decrease C (L,p,p). (A symmetric claim holds for the worst candidate x∗ = argmaxx∈L rx.) Proof. Since the operation does not change pL or pR, it is sufficient to show that ∑\ny∈R pyry does not decrease. By Lemma 4, all election results between pairs i, j ≤ y∗ are preserved. Let p′i, c′i, and r′i denote the corresponding values of pi, ci and ri after the operation. Then, for all 1 ≤ i, j ≤ y∗,\nr′i,j = c′ w(i,j)\nc′ o(i,j)\n= cw(i,j) −\n∑ y>y∗ pydy,y∗\nco(i,j) − ∑ y>y∗ pydy,y∗ ≥\ncw(i,j) co(i,j) = ri,j.\nAfter the shift of probability mass, y∗ is the largest index. Consider m < y ≤ y∗. Using that elections between two candidates on the same side of the median always result in the socially better candidate winning, we bound\nr′y = ∑\n1≤i≤y∗ p′ir ′ i,y =\n∑ i∈L pir ′ i,y + (1− pL) · 1 ≥ ∑ i∈L piri,y + (1− pL) = ry.\nAny candidates that used to be at y > y∗ are now at y∗, and y∗ used to be the worst candidate in R. Hence, for all of the probability mass from locations y > y∗, the expected distortion also weakly increases. Combining these two cases, we get\n∑\nm<y≤y∗ p′yr ′ y =\n∑\nm<y<y∗\npyr ′ y +\n∑\ny∗≤y≤n pyr\n′ y∗ ≥\n∑\nm<y≤y∗ pyry +\n∑\ny∗≤y≤n pyry∗ ≥\n∑ y∈R pyry.\nLemma 6 can be applied repeatedly unless the two worst candidates x∗ and y∗ are the leftmost and rightmost points. We next show that in that case, either all the probability mass of L or all the probability mass of R can be moved to x∗ or y∗, respectively.\nLemma 7 Let x∗ and y∗ be the worst candidates in L and R, respectively. Assume w.l.o.g. that dm,x∗ < dm,y∗. If x\n∗ = 1 and y∗ = n, then moving all probability mass from R to y∗ does not decrease C (L,p,p).\nProof. As for the previous lemma, because we are only shifting probability mass within R, it is sufficient to show that ∑ y∈R pyry does not decrease. Because more probability mass moved closer to y∗, we have that c′y∗ ≤ cy∗ , and because probability mass moved away from L (to the right), we get that c′i ≥ ci for all i ∈ L ∪ {m}.\nBy Lemma 4, y∗ loses all of his elections both before and after the move. Moreover, by Lemma 5, we get ry∗ = (1−pL)+ ∑ i∈L piri,y∗ before the move, and r ′ y∗ = (1−p′L)+ ∑ i∈L p ′ ir\n′ i,y∗ = (1−pL)+∑\ni∈L pir ′ i,y∗ after the move. Since r ′ i,y∗ = c′i c′ y∗ ≥ ci cy∗ = ri,y∗ for all i ∈ L, we get that r′y∗ ≥ ry∗ . Finally, because y∗ used to be the worst candidate in R, and after the move of probability mass is the only candidate in R, we bound\np′y∗r ′ y∗ =\n∑ y∈R pyr ′ y∗ ≥ ∑ y∈R pyry∗ ≥ ∑ y∈R pyry,\nwhich concludes the proof.\nOnce neither Lemma 6 nor Lemma 7 can be applied, we can apply Lemma 8.\nLemma 8 Let x∗ = 1, y∗ = n be the worst candidates in L and R, respectively. If |L| > 1, |R| = 1 and dm,y∗ > dm,x∗, then the size of L can be reduced by 1 without decreasing C (L,p,p).\nProof. Notice that m = n − 1 and L = {1, . . . , n − 2}. Recall that the only elections in which the winner could be socially inferior are those involving n and a candidate x ∈ L. Also, because dm,n > dm,x∗ ≥ dm,i for all i, we obtain that n loses all elections. We split the proof into two cases.\n1. If there exists an i ∈ L with ci ≤ cn, then in particular, cn−2 ≤ cn. Thus, candidate n − 2 wins all elections against i ≤ n− 2 (as he should) and against n (as he should), while losing to m (as he should). This implies that rn−2 = 1.\nConsider the effect of moving all probability mass from n−2 to the median m = n−1. First, all election results remain the same. The contribution of the probability mass that used to be at n − 2 to the distortion does not change. (It was 1 before and is still 1.) Furthermore, cn decreases while ci increases for all i < n − 2. Because n loses all pairwise elections, the overall distortion can only increase.\n2. If ci > cn for all i ∈ L, the expected distortion is exactly\nC (L,p,p) = 1− 2pnpL + 2pn ∑\ni∈L pi\nci cn .\nLet xi denote the position of point i on the line. Since |L| > 1, we have a point at position x2 in L with x1 < x2 < x3. Writing Y := ∑ j 6=2 pj|xn − xj | and Xi := ∑ j 6=2 pj |xi − xj|, we get that ci = Xi + p2|xi − x2|, and cn = Y + p2(xn − x2). Hence, we can rewrite\nC (L,p,p) = 1− 2pnpL + 2pn ∑ i∈L pi Xi + p2|xi − x2| Y + p2(xn − x2)\n= 1− 2pnpL + 2pn Y + p2xn − p2x2 · ( ∑ i∈L piXi − p2(p1x1 − n−2∑ i=3 pixi) + p2x2(p1 − n−2∑ i=3 pi) )\n= 1− 2pnpL + 2pn (Y/p2 + xn)− x2 · ( ∑ i∈L piXi/p2 − (p1x1 − n−2∑ i=3 pixi) + x2(p1 − n−2∑ i=3 pi) ) .\nTreating everything except x2 as constant, this expression is of the form B+βx2 A−x2 for all x2 ∈ [x1, x3], where A, B, and β are constants independent of x2. The derivative of this expression with respect to x2 is\nβA+B (A−x2)2 ; its sign is always the sign of βA + B. If βA + B > 0, then\nincreasing x2 to x3 strictly increases the expected distortion; otherwise, x2 can be decreased to x1 without decreasing the expected distortion. In either case, we reduce the size of L by 1.\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 3.\nProof of Theorem 3. By Lemmas 6, 7 and 8, the worst-case instance (L,p,p) has support size (at most) 3. Let x1 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 be the locations on the line. By rescaling and mirroring, we may assume without loss of generality that x1 = 0, x3 = 1, and x2 > 1 2 .\nIf x2 were not the median of the distribution, then the socially better candidate would always win, giving C (L,p,p) = 1. So in a worst-case distribution, x2 must be the median, and the socially worse candidate must win the election between x1 and x3. Because x2 > 1 2 , x3 is closer to the median, so he wins the election between x1 and x3; therefore, x1 must have lower cost than x3.

      "text" : "In this section, we prove a tight bound of 2 on the worst-case distortion of voting, when two candidates are drawn i.i.d. from a distribution p which may be different from the voter distribution q. This ratio is tight for both general metric spaces and the line, and the lemmas we prove in this section apply to arbitrary metric spaces.\nWe begin with an example on the line (a variant of Example 1) which establishes the lower bound of 2. The candidate distribution p has probability 1/2 at position −1, and the other 1/2 at position 1. The voter distribution q has a (1/2− ǫ) fraction of the voters at position −1, while the remaining voters are just to the right of center at position ǫ > 0. With probability 1/2, we draw two different candidates, and the distortion is 3 − O(ǫ); otherwise, we draw two candidates from the same location, getting a distortion of 1. Therefore, the expected distortion of the instance is 2−O(ǫ) → 2 as ǫ → 0.\nThe challenge is to establish the matching upper bound. In proving the upper bound, some of the techniques we establish will be useful in Section 5.\nTheorem 9 For all instances (D,p, q), the expected distortion C (D,p, q) is at most 2.\nThe overall proof structure is as follows. First, we show in Lemma 10 that if i = w(i, i′), then ci ≤ 3ci′ . That is, while the election winner can be socially worse, he cannot be too much worse.4 Lemma 10 is the only place where we use the metric structure and the voter distribution. Subsequently, we rewrite the social cost function C (D,p, q) accordingly, and then treat the costs as completely arbitrary numbers.\nSecond, in Lemma 11, we prove that if all pairwise elections have distortion at most 1 ≤ α ≤ 3, then C (D,p, q) ≤ (1 + α)/2. (While in this section, we will only use the lemma with α = 3, the version with general α constitutes a key step in Section 5.)\nLemma 10 ([2]) Let i = w(i, i′). Then, ci ≤ 3ci′ .\nProof. In the following derivation, we will use that:\n• Because i beats i′, at least half of the voters are at least as close to i as to i′.\n• For any voter j who is at least as close to i as to i′, the triangle inequality implies that di′,i ≤ di′,j + dj,i ≤ 2di′,j.\nThen, we can bound ci as follows:\nci = ∑\nj:di,j≤di′,j\nqj · di,j + ∑\nj:di,j>di′,j\nqj · di,j\n△−inequality ≤\n∑\nj:di,j≤di′,j\nqj · di′,j + ∑\nj:di,j>di′,j\nqj · (di′,j + di,i′)\ni beats i′ ≤ ∑\nj:di,j≤di′,j\nqj · (di′,j + di,i′) + ∑\nj:di,j>di′,j\nqj · di′,j\n≤ ∑\nj:di,j≤di′,j\nqj · (3di′,j) + ∑\nj:di,j>di′,j\nqj · di′,j\n≤ 3ci′ .\nLemma 11 For any 1 ≤ α ≤ 3 and any instance (D,p, q), if ri,j = cw(i,j) co(i,j) ≤ α for all (i, j), then C (D,p, q) ≤ 1+α2 .\nProof. Consider an instance (D,p, q) and its associated costs c. Without loss of generality, assume that c1 ≤ c2 ≤ · · · ≤ cn. For each candidate i, let ℓi = max{j | cj ≤ αci}. Notice that by the assumption that ri,j ≤ α for all i, j, whenever j > ℓi, we have that w(i, j) = o(i, j), resulting in a cost ratio of 1. We can therefore bound the expected distortion (minus 1) as follows:\nC (D,p, q)− 1 ≤ 2 ∑\ni<j≤ℓi pipj ·\n( cj ci − 1 ) =: Ĉ(p, c, α). (3)\nThe upper bound Ĉ(p, c, α) assumes that the worse candidate wins whenever the two candidates’ social costs are within a factor of α of each other. Note that this upper bound Ĉ(p, c, α) makes no\n4Lemma 10 is a special case of the more general result [2, Theorem 4]; we present a self-contained proof here for completeness.\nmore reference to distances or voter distributions. It depends on a distribution over candidates and a cost vector, both of which can be arbitrary, and it assumes that all elections whose candidates’ costs are more than a factor α apart choose the socially better candidate, while all other elections choose the socially worse candidate.\nWe will now argue that Ĉ(p, c, α) is at most α−12 . First, we show that the expression is maximized by moving probability mass so that ci and cj are at most a factor α apart for every i and j in the support of p. Suppose that there exists a pair i < j in the support of p with j > ℓi, i.e., with cj > αci. Consider moving ǫ probability mass from pi to pj , where a negative value of ǫ moves probability mass from pj to pi; call the resulting probability vector p(ǫ). Because our choice of i and j avoids the bilinear term pipj in (3), Ĉ(p(ǫ), c, α) is a linear function of ǫ. Therefore, the expression is maximized at an extreme, i.e., by moving all the probability mass from one of i and j to the other.\nOnce all points in the support of p are at most a factor α apart in social cost, the expression for Ĉ(p, c, α) in (3) becomes a sum over all pairs of points. Assume that the support of p has size n′ ≥ 3, and associated costs c1 < c2 < · · · < cn′ . (The inequalities can be assumed to be strict, because two points i, i′ with the same cost can be merged without affecting the value Ĉ(p, c, α).) Considering all terms except c2 as constants, Ĉ(p, c, α) is of the form β1 + β2c2 + β3/c2 (with β2, β3 ≥ 0), which is convex in c2. In particular, it attains its maximum at c2 = c1 or c2 = c3. In either case, we can merge the probability mass of point 2 with 1 or 3, reducing the support size by 1 without decreasing Ĉ(p, c, α). By repeating such merges, we eventually arrive at a distribution with support size 2 and c2 ≤ αc1. Finally, we can bound\nC (D,p, q) = 1 + Ĉ(p, c, α) ≤ 1 + 2p1(1− p1) · (α− 1) ≤ 1 + 1 2 (α− 1) = 1 + α 2 ."

      "text" : "In this section, we examine the setting where the underlying metric space is arbitrary, and the candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters. We establish the following main theorem:\nTheorem 12 The worst-case distortion sup(D,p,p)C (D,p,p) is between 32 and 2− 1652 .\nKey to the upper bound portion of this theorem is the following lemma.\nLemma 13 Assume that δ ≤ 1100 . Let (D,p,p) be an instance with maximum pairwise distortion (exactly) 3− δ. Then, C (D,p,p) ≤ 32 + 9 √ δ.\nWe prove Lemma 13 in Section 5.2. That proof relies on the following structural characterization: if a pair of candidates has distortion 3 − δ for sufficiently small δ, then the instance must be very structured: nearly half the probability mass must be concentrated very close to the socially optimal candidate, and most of the remaining candidates must be nearly equidistant to the two candidates.\nProof of Theorem 12. We begin by proving the lower bound, by constructing a family of instances whose distortion converges to 32 . We label the n+ 1 points {0, 1, . . . , n}. We set p0 = 1−ǫ2 , and all other pi = 1+ǫ 2n . The distances\n5 are d0,i = 1 for all i > 0, and di,j = 1 − ǫ for all i, j > 0. See Figure 4 for an illustration.\n5To avoid tie breaking issues, consider the distances as perturbed by distinct and very small amounts.\nThis way, all voters/candidates in the set {1, . . . , n} prefer each other over the voter/candidate 0. Therefore, even though candidate 0 is socially optimal (with a cost c0 = 1 2 + O(ǫ)), he loses to any other candidate in the election; the other candidates’ costs are ci = 1−O(1/n) −O(ǫ). With probability 12 − O(ǫ), an election occurs between candidate 0 and some other candidate i > 0, resulting in distortion 2−O(ǫ)−O(1/n). In the other cases (two candidates from 0, or two candidates i, j > 0), the distortion is at least 1. Hence, the overall expected distortion is at least (12 −O(ǫ)) · (2−O(ǫ)−O(1/n)) + 12 · 1 = 32 −O(ǫ)−O(1/n). As ǫ → 0 and n → ∞, the distortion approaches 32 .\nFor the upper bound, let δ = 1326 and consider the following two cases. If all pairwise elections have distortion at most 3−δ, then Lemma 11 implies that the overall expected distortion C (D,p,p) is at most 2−δ/2 = 2− 1652 . If some pair of candidates has distortion at least 3−δ, then Lemma 13 implies that the overall expected distortion is at most 32 +9 √ δ ≤ 2− 1652 . Together, these two cases complete the proof of the theorem.\nAs mentioned above, the key insight in the proof of Lemma 13 is that when a pair of candidates has rx,y ≥ 3 − δ, nearly half the probability mass must be concentrated very close to the socially optimal candidate, and most of the remaining candidates must be nearly equidistant to the two candidates. Trading off these four sources of approximation makes the proof of the lemma fairly complex. To illustrate the key ideas more cleanly, we therefore begin by proving the following special case of Lemma 13 with δ = 0.\nLemma 14 Let (D,p,p) be an instance. If there exists a pair of candidates x, y with cw(x,y) co(x,y) = 3, then C (D,p,p) = 1.5.\nAs before, we let pA = ∑\ni∈A pi denote the total probability mass in A. In addition, throughout this section, pA is the conditional candidate/voter distribution given that candidate i is drawn from A; that is, (pA)i = pi/pA. We use di,A to denote the average distance from i to the set A, i.e., di,A = Ej∼pA [di,j ]."

By the first (in)equality, dy,X = dy,x + dx,X = 2.\n4. By the third (in)equality, dy,x = dy,Y +dx,Y , so (because dy,Y = dx,Y and by triangle inequality), dy,i = dx,i = 1 for all i ∈ Y .\nBecause dx,X = 0, we can write px = 1 2 .

We will show that ∆i,j ≤ 5 for all i, j ∈ A, and thus C (D,p,p) ≤ 1.5. The three key properties we exploit repeatedly are the following.\n1. x is socially optimal, i.e., ci ≥ cx for all i ∈ A. This is because cx = 12 , and for each i ∈ A, at least all voters at x are at distance 1.\n2. ci ≤ 3cx for all i ∈ A. This is because di,A ≤ di,x + dx,A = 2 and di,x = 1, giving a total cost of at most 32 .\n3. If some i ∈ A beats x, then ci ≤ 2cx. This is because everyone in A has to vote for i, implying that di,A ≤ 1, giving ci ≤ 1.\n6In a sense, this extreme example does rely on tie breaking. Since we are proving an upper bound here, this is not a concern.\nNow fix some pair i, j ∈ A, and assume without loss of generality that i wins the election over j. For each of the three elections that contribute to ∆i,j (i vs. x, j vs. x, i vs. j), there is a term which is 1 if the election chooses the socially better candidate (e.g., w(i, x) = o(i, x)), and at most 3 otherwise. Thus, if we ever had ∆i,j > 5, at least two of the three elections would have to produce the socially worse candidate as a winner, e.g., w(i, x) 6= o(i, x). We distinguish three possible cases.\n1. If x beats j, then i must beat x and (because we assumed i to beat j) j must have lower cost than i. Because x is socially optimal (in particular having lower social cost than j), using that ci ≤ 2cx, we have that\n∆i,j = ri,x + rj,x + ri,j = ci cx + 1 + ci cj ≤ 1 + ci cx + ci cx ≤ 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\n2. If x beats i, then j must beat x and have lower cost than i. Then we obtain the expression.\n∆i,j = ri,x + rj,x + ri,j = 1 + cj cx + ci cj .\nTreating cj as a variable t, we have an expression of the form t cx + ci t , which is convex and hence maximized at an extreme point (t = ci or t = cx), giving an upper bound of 1 + 1 + ci cx ≤ 5.\n3. Finally, we have the case that both i and j beat x (implying that ci ≤ 2cx and cj ≤ 2cx). If i has lower social cost than j, we can bound\n∆i,j = ri,x + rj,x + ri,j ≤ 2 + 2 + 1 = 5.\nOtherwise we have cx ≤ cj < ci, and obtain the expression ∆i,j = cicx + cj cx + ci cj . Again, the expression cj cx + ci cj\nis maximized at cj = cx or cj = ci, in both cases giving us a bound of ci cx + 1 + ci cx ≤ 5."

      "text" : "The proof of Lemma 13 follows the same roadmap as the proof of Lemma 14, except that we no longer have a point with probability mass 1/2. Instead, close to half of the probability mass will be in a ball B of small radius around x. The three key properties used to bound ∆i,j will then be replaced with approximate (slightly inferior) versions.\nFor any pair of candidates i, j, we will be frequently using the following upper bounds on ci:\nci ≤ cj + di,j, (4) ci ≤ cj + di,j 2 whenever i beats j. (5)\nInequality (4) is simply by the triangle inequality, while Inequality (5) also uses the fact that half of the voters are closer to i, and at most the remaining half can contribute to the cost gap.\nLet (x, y) be the election maximizing rx,y, having rx,y = 3 − δ. Without loss of generality, assume that y = w(x, y) and dx,y = 2. Because cy = (3 − δ)cx and cy ≤ cx + dx,y2 = cx + 1, we obtain that\ncx ≤ 1\n2− δ . (6)\nAs before, let X be the set of voters closer to x than to y, and Y = X the set closer to y. Then, pX ≤ 12 ≤ pY . Following our intuition from the proof of Lemma 14, we partition the points into three disjoint sets A, B and C. Specifically, we will choose (later) a parameter p close to 1/2. As before, the set A captures the points that are “roughly equidistant” between x and y; specifically: A = {i | di,y ≤ di,x ≤ 1 + ρA} ⊆ Y , where we will choose ρA so that pA = p. The set B captures the points “close to” x: B = {i | di,x ≤ ρB} ⊆ X, where we choose ρB so that pB = p.7 The set C consists of the remaining points C = A ∪B. (C may contain points from both X and Y , and pC = 1 − 2p.) Observe that the closer p is to 1/2, the larger ρA and ρB will be, and we will have less control over where the points in A and B are located. Contrast this with the proof of Lemma 14, where the very stringent assumption of δ = 0 allowed us to choose p = 1/2 and still obtain ρA = ρB = 0.\nWe use the fact that cx ≈ 12 to derive that close to half of the probability mass must be in A, and close to half in B. To lower-bound the probability mass, notice that the cost of x can be lower-bounded term-by-term as follows:\n1. All points in B contribute cost at least 0.\n2. All points in X \\B contribute cost at least ρB .\n3. All points in A contribute cost at least 1.\n4. All points in Y \\A contribute cost at least 1 + ρA.\nWe can thus lower bound cx as follows:\n1\n2− δ ≥ cx ≥ (pX − pB)ρB + pA · 1 + (pY − pA)(1 + ρA) = pXρB + pY (1 + ρA)− pBρB − pAρA\n≥ 1 2 ρB + 1 2 (1 + ρA)− pBρB − pAρA = 1 2 + ( 1 2 − p)(ρA + ρB).\nThis implies that ρA + ρB ≤ δ(2−δ)(1−2p) . In particular, notice that even while choosing the desired probability p very close to half (e.g., p = 1/2−O( √ δ)), the cost bound still guarantees that such a p is achieved with small radii: ρA + ρB = O( √ δ). For notational convenience, we use ρ = δ(2−δ)(1−2p) to denote the upper bound for ρA + ρB, so ρB ≤ ρA + ρB ≤ ρ. The expected distortion can now be broken into terms based on the three partitions A,B,C.\nC (D,p,p) = 2pC (pA + pB)Ei∼pC ,j∼pA∪B [ri,j] + p2C · C (D,pC ,p) + p2B · C (D,pB ,p) + 2pApBEi∼pA,j∼pB [ri,j] + p 2 A · C (D,pA,p)\nWe bound the terms in the sum separately.\n• Ei∼pC ,j∼pA∪B [ri,j ] ≤ 3−δ, simply because we assumed that the worst-case pairwise distortion of any election was 3− δ.\n• The same bound of 3− δ applies to C (D,pC ,p), for the same reason. 7 Notice that such ρA, ρB exist without loss of generality. For if there were a radius ρ such that — say — B◦ = {i | di,x < ρ} had pB◦ < p, while B = {i | di,x ≤ ρ} had pB > p, we could split a point i on the boundary (that is, i satisfies di,x = ρ) into two points, without affecting any outcomes for the instance.\n• When both candidates i, j are drawn from B, assume that i wins while j has lower social cost.

Note that, for all i ∈ A and b ∈ B, we have\n1− ρB ≤ di,x − dx,b ≤ di,b ≤ di,x + dx,b ≤ 1 + ρA + ρB .\nIn the proof of Lemma 14, the three key properties were that (1) x was socially optimal, (2) any i ∈ A was at most thrice worse than x, and (3) if i ∈ A beat x in a pairwise election, then it was at most twice worse than x. The relaxed versions of these key properties are the following:\n1. Every b ∈ B is close to socially optimal: For all i ∈ A and b ∈ B,\ncb ci = pAdb,A + pBdb,B + pCdb,C pAdi,A + pBdi,B + pCdi,C ≤ (1− pB)di,b + pBdb,B pBdi,B\n≤ (1− pB)(1 + ρA + ρB) + pB2ρB pB(1− ρB) ≤ (1− p)(1 + ρ) + 2pρ p(1− ρ) = 1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ) .\nThe first inequality is obtained by bounding db,A ≤ db,i + di,A and db,C ≤ db,i + di,C , then subtracting di,ApA + di,CpC from both the numerator and denominator. The next step uses that 1 − ρB ≤ di,b ≤ 1 + ρA + ρB. This ratio is at least 1 and approaches 1 as ρ → 0 and p → 12 .\n2. For all i ∈ A and b ∈ B (regardless of who wins the pairwise election between them),\nci cb ≤ cb + di,b cb ≤ 1 + 1 + ρA + ρB cb ≤ 1 + 1 + ρ1 2(1− ρ) = 3 + ρ 1− ρ .\nThis ratio is at least 3 and approaches 3 as ρ → 0.\n3.

Without loss of generality, we assume that i wins the election against j. Throughout the analysis, as in the proof of Lemma 14, we use repeatedly that t\ncb + ci t is a convex function of t, and in particular is maximized at t = ci or\nt = cb.\n1. If the socially better candidate wins in at least two of the three elections, then ∆i,j,b ≤ 1 + 1 + 3− δ = 5− δ, because the third election can have distortion at most 3− δ.\n2. If both i and j lose to b,\n∆i,j,b ≤ 2 (\nmax i∈A,b∈B cb ci\n) + 3− δ ≤ 2 · 1− p + ρ + pρ\np(1− ρ) + 3− δ.\n3. If both i and j beat b, then we obtain\n∆i,j,b = max{ ci cb , 1} +max{cj cb , 1} +max{ ci cj , 1}.\nBecause we are not in the first case, at most one of the three maxima can be 1. There are three orderings of the social costs cb, ci, cj which are consistent with these assumptions:\n(a) If cb ≤ ci ≤ cj , then ∆i,j,b =\nci cb + cj cb + 1 ≤ 1 + 2 · 2 1− ρ .\n(b) If cb ≤ cj ≤ ci, then\n∆i,j,b = ci cb + cj cb + ci cj ≤ ci cb + 1 + ci cb ≤ 1 + 2 · 2 1− ρ .\n(c) If cj ≤ cb ≤ ci, then\n∆i,j,b = ci cb + 1 + ci cj\n≤ 1 + (\nmax i∈A,b∈B,i beats b ci cb\n)( 1 + max\nj∈A,b∈B cb cj\n)\n≤ 1 + 2 1− ρ ·\n( 1 +\n1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ)\n) .\n4. If i beats b and j loses to b, then\n∆i,j,b = max{ ci cb , 1} +max{cb cj , 1} +max{ ci cj , 1}.\nAgain, because at least two of the three pairwise elections result in the socially worse candidate winning, we have only three cost orderings consistent with the outcome:\n(a) If cj ≤ ci ≤ cb, then\n∆i,j,b = 1 + cb cj + ci cj ≤ 1 + 1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ) + 3− δ.\n(b) If cb ≤ cj ≤ ci, then\n∆i,j,b = ci cb + 1 + ci cj ≤ 1 + 2 1− ρ ·\n( 1 +\n1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ)\n) ,\nas in Case 3(c).\n(c) If cj ≤ cb ≤ ci, then\n∆i,j,b = ci cb + cb cj + ci cj ≤ 1 + 2 · ci cj\n≤ 1 + 2 (\nmax i∈A,b∈B,i beats b ci cb · max j∈A,b∈B cb cj\n) ≤ 1 + 2 · 2\n1− ρ · 1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ) ,\nwhere the first inequality again used the convexity argument on ci cb + cb cj .\n5. In the final case, i loses to b and j beats b, resulting in a cycle in the election results. We now have\n∆i,j,b = max{ cb ci , 1} +max{cj cb , 1} +max{ ci cj , 1}.\nAgain, we have three possible cost orderings consistent with the assumption that at most one of the pairwise elections agrees with the social costs:\n(a) If cj ≤ ci ≤ cb, then\n∆i,j,b = cb ci + 1 + ci cj ≤ 1 + 1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ) + 3− δ.\n(b) If ci ≤ cb ≤ cj , then\n∆i,j,b = cb ci + cj cb + 1 ≤ 1 + 1− p + ρ + pρ p(1− ρ) + 2 1− ρ .\n(c) In the final case cb ≤ cj ≤ ci, we again apply the convexity argument to bound\n∆i,j,b = 1 + cj cb + ci cj ≤ 1 + 1 + ci cb ≤ 2 + 3 + ρ 1− ρ .\nCollecting all the upper bounds in all cases, we see that they are all equal to (or immediately upper-bounded by) one of the following three terms:\n   2 · 1−p+ρ+pρ p(1−ρ) + 3− δ for cases (1), (2), (4a), (5a)\n1 + 2 · 21−ρ for cases (3a), (3b), (5b), (5c) 1 + 2 · 21−ρ · 1−p+ρ+pρ p(1−ρ) for cases (3c), (4b), (4c)\nA somewhat tedious calculation shows that because p ≤ 12 , the expressions in the first and second cases are always bounded by the expression in the third case. This completes the proof of Lemma 15."

      "text" : "We showed that under the simple model of two i.i.d. candidates and a majority election between them, government by the people is better for the people if it is also of the people: there is a constant gap between the distortion caused by voting in the case when q = p vs. q 6= p. For the case of the line, we pinned down the gap precisely, while for general metric spaces, we proved a small constant gap.\nOur results can be construed as providing some mathematical underpinnings for the benefits of lottocracy. Lottocracy (also called sortition) [16, 21, 22] refers to systems of government in which (some) political officials are chosen through lotteries instead of (or in addition to) elections. Two of the arguments put forth in favor of lottocracy are: (1) it is more inclusive [22], in the sense that the office holders will be more representative of the population as a whole and its different subgroups; (2) it leads to more responsive government [21]: because office holders are representative of the population, they will respond more directly to the preferences of the population. The definition\nof inclusiveness is very closely aligned with our notion of candidates being “of the people;” it is sometimes justified by empirical and simulation studies giving evidence that inclusive groups may be better at problem solving. The notion of responsiveness is similar to our notion of government being “for the people;” in this sense, our results could be — with some latitude — rephrased as stating that inclusiveness may lead to responsiveness.\nWhile most proponents of lottocracy argue in favor of filling offices with randomly selected citizens, our analysis applies to a process wherein voters do have a say, but the slate of candidates is random. Allowing a vote between randomly selected candidates may in fact address one of the main concerns about lottocracy, namely, the competency of candidates [21, 22]. It simultaneously addresses a concern about democratic votes: that the slate of candidates could be such that voters make a societally suboptimal choice. While the mathematical model presented here is far too simplistic to provide reliable insights into the merits (or problems) of lottocracy and its variants, it may serve as a point of departure for future more refined models.\nIn terms of more direct technical questions, the most immediate open question is to obtain the maximum expected distortion in general metric spaces. We conjecture an upper bound of 3/2. Our conjecture is based on extensive computational experiments, and on several partial results. In particular, we can show that the distortion is upper-bounded by 3/2 whenever the metric is uniform (i.e., all voters/candidates are equidistant), or when there is a location of the metric space that has half the voters/candidates. Both properties seem to naturally arise in worst-case constructions, although we are unable to prove at this point that they are necessary for worst-case metrics.\nBeyond the immediate open question, our work raises a number of other directions for future work. A first natural question is how the distortion depends on the metric space. As we saw, the distortion for the line is 4 − 2 √ 2 < 32 . What is the distortion for d-dimensional Euclidean space? Are there other natural metric spaces that are suitable models of political or similar affiliation, and may be amenable to a detailed analysis?\nIn this work, in order to isolate the issue of representativeness of candidates, we focused on a majority election between two candidates. When k > 2 candidates are running, vote aggregation becomes more complex, and indeed, a large number of different voting rules have been considered throughout history. The work of Anshelevich et al. [2, 3] analyzed the worst-case distortion of some of the most prevalent voting rules. It would be interesting to examine the performance of these voting rules under our model of candidates drawn from the voter population. In particular, would such an analysis reveal a more fine-grained stratification between some of the voting rules that perform equally well (or poorly) under worst-case assumptions?\nA further direction is to deviate from the extremes of worst-case candidates or candidates drawn from the voter distribution. How gracefully does the distortion degrade as the voter and candidate distributions become more and more dissimilar? Answering this question first requires a suitable definition of a distance metric between probability distributions. Such a definition will have to be “Earthmover-like,” yet also “scale-invariant.”"

    "abstractText" : "In light of the classic impossibility results of Arrow and Gibbard and Satterthwaite regarding voting with ordinal rules, there has been recent interest in characterizing how well common voting rules approximate the social optimum. In order to quantify the quality of approximation, it is natural to consider the candidates and voters as embedded within a common metric space, and to ask how much further the chosen candidate is from the population as compared to the socially optimal one. We use this metric preference model to explore a fundamental and timely question: does the social welfare of a population improve when candidates are representative of the population? If so, then by how much, and how does the answer depend on the complexity of the metric space? We restrict attention to the most fundamental and common social choice setting: a population of voters, two candidates, and a majority rule election. When candidates are not representative of the population, it is known that the candidate selected by the majority rule can be thrice as far from the population as the socially optimal one; this holds even when the underlying metric is a line. We examine how this ratio improves when candidates are drawn independently from the population of voters. Our results are two-fold: When the metric is a line, the ratio improves from 3 to (4 − 2 √ 2) ≈ 1.1716; this bound is tight. When the metric is arbitrary, we show a lower bound of 1.5 and a constant upper bound strictly better than 2 on the distortion of majority rule. The aforementioned positive results depend in part on the assumption that the two candidates are independently and identically distributed. However, we show that i.i.d. candidates do not suffice for our upper bounds: if the population of candidates can be different from that of voters, an upper bound of 2 on the distortion is tight for both general metric spaces and the line. Thus, we show a constant gap between representative and non-representative candidates in both cases. The exact size of this gap in general metric spaces is a natural open question.",
