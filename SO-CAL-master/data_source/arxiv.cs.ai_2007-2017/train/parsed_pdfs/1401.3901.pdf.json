Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-liteR, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond."

      "text" : "The ontologies at the core of the semantic web — as well as ontology languages such as RDF, OWL, and related Description Logics (DLs) — are founded on fragments of first-order logic and inherit strengths and weaknesses of this well-established formalism. Limitations include monotonicity, and the consequent inability to design knowledge bases (KBs) by describing prototypes whose general properties can be later refined with suitable exceptions. This natural, iterative approach is commonly used by biologists and calls for an extension of DLs with defeasible inheritance with overriding (a mechanism normally supported by object-oriented languages). Some workarounds have been devised for particular cases; however, no general solutions are currently available (Rector, 2004; Stevens, Aranguren, Wolstencroft, Sattler, Drummond, Horridge, & Rector, 2007). Another motivation for nonmonotonic DLs stems from the recent development of policy languages based on DLs (Uszok, Bradshaw, Jeffers, Suri, Hayes, Breedy, Bunch, Johnson, Kulkarni, & Lott, 2003; Finin, Joshi, Kagal, Niu, Sandhu, Winsborough, & Thuraisingham, 2008; Zhang, Artale, Giunchiglia, & Crispo, 2009; Kolovski, Hendler, & Parsia, 2007). DLs nicely capture role-based policies and facilitate the integration of semantic web policy enforcement with reasoning about semantic metadata (which is typically necessary in order to check policy conditions). However, in order to formulate standard default policies such as open and closed policies,1and support common policy language features such as authorization inheritance with exceptions (which is meant to facilitate incremental\n1. If no explicit authorization has been specified for a given access request, then an open policy permits the access while a closed policy denies it.\nc©2011 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\npolicy formulation), it is necessary to adopt a nonmonotonic semantics; Bonatti and Samarati (2003) provide further details on the matter.\nGiven the increasing size of semantic web ontologies and RDF bases, the complexity of reasoning is an influential factor that may either foster or prevent the adoption of a knowledge representation language. Accordingly, OWL2 introduces profiles that adopt syntactic restrictions (compatible with application requirements) in order to make reasoning tractable. Two of such profiles are based on the following families of DLs: DL-lite (Calvanese, De Giacomo, Lembo, Lenzerini, & Rosati, 2005), that formalizes RDFS, and EL (Baader, 2003; Baader, Brandt, & Lutz, 2005), that extensively covers important biomedical ontologies such as GALEN and SNOMED. Unfortunately, in general, nonmonotonic DL reasoning can be highly complex and reach NExpTimeNP and even 3- ExpTime (Donini, Nardi, & Rosati, 1997, 2002; Bonatti, Lutz, & Wolter, 2009). A natural question, in this context, is whether restrictions such as those adopted by DL-lite and EL help in reducing the complexity of nonmonotonic DL reasoning, too.\nAnswering this question is the main goal of this paper. We extensively investigate the complexity of reasoning in DL-lite and EL. The nonmonotonic semantics adopted is Circumscription (McCarthy, 1980), whose main appealing properties (discriminating Circumscription from other nonmonotonic DL semantics proposed in the literature) are summarized below:\n1. Circumscription is compatible with all the interpretation domains supported by classical DLs; there is no need for adopting a fixed domain of standard names;\n2. In circumscribed DLs, nonmonotonic inferences apply to all individuals, including those that are not denoted by any constants and are implicitly asserted by existential quantifiers;\n3. Circumscription naturally supports priorities among conflicting nonmonotonic axioms and can easily simulate specificity-based overriding.\nAs an attempt to simplify the usage of circumscribed DLs and simultaneously remove potential sources of computational complexity, we do not support the usage of abnormality predicates (McCarthy, 1986) in their full generality; we rather hide them within defeasible inclusions (Bonatti, Faella, & Sauro, 2009). Defeasible inclusions are expressions C vn D whose intuitive meaning is: an instance of C is normally an instance of D. Such inclusions can be prioritized to resolve conflicts. Priorities can be either explicit or automatically determined by the inclusion’s specificity, i.e. a defeasible inclusion C1 vn D1 may override C2 vn D2 if C1 is classically subsumed by C2. In this framework, we prove that restricting the syntax to DL-lite inclusions suffices—in almost all cases—to reduce complexity to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. On the contrary, circumscribed EL is still ExpTime-hard and further restrictions are needed to confine complexity within the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Syntactic restrictions will be analyzed in conjunction with other semantic parameters, such as the kind of priorities adopted (explicit or specificity-based), and which predicates may or may not be affected by Circumscription (i.e., fixed and variable predicates, in Circumscription’s jargon).\nThe paper is organized as follows: First, the basics of low-complexity description logics and their extension based on circumscription are recalled in Section 2 and Section 3, respectively. Then, some reductions that can be used to eliminate language features and work on simpler frameworks are illustrated in Section 4. After an undecidability result caused by fixed roles (Section 5), the paper focuses on variable roles: The complexity of circumscribed DL-liteR and EL/EL⊥ are investigated\nin Section 6 and Section 7, respectively. A section on related work and a final discussion conclude the paper."

      "text" : "In DLs, concepts are inductively defined with a set of constructors, starting with a set NC of concept names, a set NR of role names, and (possibly) a set NI of individual names (all countably infinite). We use the term predicates to refer to elements of NC ∪ NR. Hereafter, letters A and B will range over NC, P will range over NR, and a, b, c will range over NI. The concepts of the DLs dealt with in this paper are formed using the constructors shown in Figure 1. There, the inverse role constructor is the only role constructor, whereas the remaining constructors are concept constructors. Letters C,D will range over concepts and letters R,S over (possibly inverse) roles.\nThe semantics of the above concepts is defined in terms of interpretations I = (∆I , ·I). The domain ∆I is a non-empty set of individuals and the interpretation function ·I maps each concept name A ∈ NC to a set AI ⊆ ∆I , each role name P ∈ NR to a binary relation P I on ∆I , and each individual name a ∈ NI to an individual aI ∈ ∆I . The extension of ·I to inverse roles and arbitrary concepts is inductively defined as shown in the third column of Figure 1. An interpretation I is called a model of a concept C if CI 6= ∅. If I is a model of C, we also say that C is satisfied by I.\nA (strong) knowledge base is a finite set of (i) concept inclusions (CIs) C v D where C and D are concepts, (ii) concept assertions A(a) and role assertions P (a, b), where a, b are individual names, P ∈ NR, andA ∈ NC, (iii) role inclusions (RIs)R v R′. An interpretation I satisfies (i) a CI C v D if CI ⊆ DI , (ii) an assertion C(a) if aI ∈ CI , (iii) an assertion P (a, b) if (aI , bI) ∈ P I , and (iv) a RI R v R′ iff RI ⊆ R′I . Then, I is a model of a strong knowledge base S iff I satisfies all the elements of S. We write C vS D iff for all models I of S , I satisfies C v D.\nTerminologies are particular strong knowledge bases consisting of definitions, i.e. axioms such as A ≡ C, that abbreviate the inclusions A v C and C v A. If a terminology T contains the above definition, then we say that A is defined in T and that C is the definition of A. Each A defined in T must have a unique definition. A concept name A directly depends on B (in T ) if B occurs in A’s definition; moreover, A depends on B (in T ) if there is a chain of such direct dependencies leading from A to B. A terminology T is acyclic if no A depends on itself in T . Terminologies are conservative extensions, and the concept names defined in an acyclic terminology T can be\neliminated by unfolding them w.r.t. T , that is, by exhaustively replacing the concepts defined in T with their definition. For all expressions (i.e., concepts or inclusions) E, we denote with unf(E, T ) the unfolding of E w.r.t. T .\nThe logic DL-liteR (Calvanese et al., 2005) restricts concept inclusions to expressions CL v CR, where"

      "text" : "A general defeasible inclusion (GDI) is an expression C vn D whose intended meaning is: C’s elements are normally in D.\nExample 3.1 (Bonatti et al., 2009) The sentences: “in humans, the heart is usually located on the left-hand side of the body; in humans with situs inversus, the heart is located on the right-hand side of the body” (Rector, 2004; Stevens et al., 2007) can be formalized with the EL⊥ axioms and GDIs:\nHuman vn ∃has heart.∃has position.Left ; Situs Inversus v ∃has heart.∃has position.Right ; ∃has heart.∃has position.Left u ∃has heart.∃has position.Right v ⊥ .\n2\nA defeasible knowledge base (DKB) in a logicDL is a pair 〈K,≺〉, where K = KS∪KD, KS is a strong DL KB, KD is a set of GDIs C vn D such that C v D is a DL inclusion, and ≺ is a strict partial order (a priority relation) overKD. In the following, byC v[n] D we denote an inclusion that is either classical or defeasible. Moreover, for a DKB KB = 〈K ∪ T ,≺〉, where T is a (classical) acyclic terminology, we denote by unf(KB) = 〈K′,≺′〉 the DKB where K′ is the unfolding of all inclusions in K w.r.t. T , and, for all DIs δ, δ′ in K, the relation unf(δ, T ) ≺′ unf(δ′, T ) holds if and only if δ ≺ δ′.\nAs priority relation we shall often adopt the specificity relation ≺K which is determined by classically valid inclusions. Formally, for all GDIs δ1 = (C1 vn D1) and δ2 = (C2 vn D2), let\nδ1 ≺K δ2 iff C1 vKS C2 and C2 6vKS C1 .\nExample 3.2 The access control policy: “Normally users cannot read project files; staff can read project files; blacklisted staff is not granted any access” can be encoded with:\nStaff v User Blacklisted v Staff UserRequest v ∃subj.User u ∃target.Proj u ∃op.Read StaffRequest v ∃subj.Staff u ∃target.Proj u ∃op.Read UserRequest vn ∃decision.{Deny} StaffRequest vn ∃decision.{Grant} ∃subj.Blacklisted v ∃decision.{Deny} ∃decision.{Grant} u ∃decision.{Deny} v ⊥ .\nStaff members cannot simultaneously satisfy the two defeasible inclusions (due to the last inclusion above). With specificity, the second defeasible inclusion overrides the first one and yields the intuitive inference that non-blacklisted staff members are indeed allowed to access project files. More formally, the subsumption\n∃subj.(Staff u ¬Blacklisted) u ∃target.Proj u ∃op.Read v ∃decision.{Grant}\nholds in all the models of the above knowledge base (as defined below). 2\nIntuitively, a model of 〈K,≺〉 is a model of KS that maximizes the set of individuals satisfying the defeasible inclusions in KD, resolving conflicts by means of the priority relation ≺ whenever possible. In formalizing the notion of model, one should specify how to deal with the predicates occurring in the knowledge base: is their extension allowed to vary in order to satisfy defeasible inclusions? A discussion of the effects of letting predicates vary vs. fixing their extension can be found in the work of Bonatti, Lutz and Wolter (2006); they conclude that the appropriate choice is application dependent. So, in general, the set of predicates NC∪NR can be arbitrarily partitioned into two sets F and V containing fixed and varying predicates, respectively; we denote this semantics by Circ∗F .\nHowever, in Section 5 it is shown that fixed roles cause undecidability issues, so most of our results concern a specialized framework in which all role names are varying predicates, that is, F ⊆ NC. We use the notation CircF (rather than Circ∗F ) to indicate that F ⊆ NC.\nThe set F , the GDIs KD, and the priority relation ≺ induce a strict partial order over interpretations. As we move down the ordering we find interpretations that are more and more normal w.r.t. KD. For all δ = (C vn D) and all interpretations I let the set of individuals satisfying δ be:\nsatI(δ) = {x ∈ ∆I | x 6∈ CI or x ∈ DI} .\nDefinition 3.3 Let KB = 〈K,≺〉 be a DKB. For all interpretations I and J , and all F ⊆ NC ∪NR, let I <KB,F J iff:\n1. ∆I = ∆J ;\n2. aI = aJ , for all a ∈ NI;\n3. AI = AJ , for all A ∈ F ∩ NC, and P I = PJ , for all P ∈ F ∩ NR;\n4. for all δ ∈ KD, if satI(δ) 6⊇ satJ (δ) then there exists δ′ ∈ KD such that δ′ ≺ δ and satI(δ ′) ⊃ satJ (δ′) ;\n5. there exists a δ ∈ KD such that satI(δ) ⊃ satJ (δ).\nThe subscript KB will be omitted when clear from context. Now a model of a DKB can be defined as a maximally preferred model of its strong (i.e. classical) part.\nDefinition 3.4 Let KB = 〈K,≺〉 and F ⊆ NC ∪ NR. An interpretation I is a model of Circ∗F (KB) iff I is a (classical) model of KS and for all models J of KS, J 6<F I.\nRemark 3.5 This semantics is a special case of the circumscribed DLs introduced by Bonatti et al. (2006). The correspondence can be seen by (i) introducing for each GDI C vn D a fresh atomic conceptAb, playing the role of an abnormality predicate; (ii) replacingC vn D withCu¬Ab v D; (iii) minimizing all the predicates Ab introduced above.\nIn order to enhance readability, we will use the following notation for the special cases in which all concept names are varying and the case in which they are all fixed: <var and Circvar stand for <∅ and Circ∅, respectively; <fix and Circfix stand respectively for <NC and CircNC . For a DKB KB = 〈KS∪KD,≺〉, we say that an interpretation I is a classical model ofKB in case I is a model of KS.\nIn this paper, we consider the following standard reasoning tasks over defeasible DLs:\nKnowledge base consistency Given a DKB KB, decide whether Circ∗F (KB) has a model.\nConcept consistency Given a concept C and a DKB KB, check whether C is satisfiable w.r.t. KB, that is, whether a model I of Circ∗F (KB) exists such that CI 6= ∅.\nSubsumption Given two concepts C, D and a DKB KB, check whether Circ∗F (KB) |= C v D, that is, whether for all models I of Circ∗F (KB), CI ⊆ DI .\nInstance checking Given a ∈ NI, a concept C, and a DKB KB, check whether Circ∗F (KB) |= C(a), that is, whether for all models I of Circ∗F (KB), aI ∈ CI .\nThe following example illustrates most of the above tasks as well as the main difference between Circvar and Circfix.\nExample 3.6 Consider the following simplification of Example 3.2:\nUser vn ¬∃decision.{Grant} Staff v User Staff vn ∃decision.{Grant} BlacklistedStaff v Staff u ¬∃decision.{Grant} .\nExtend the knowledge base with the assertion Staff(John), and let the priority relation be≺K (i.e., priorities are determined by specificity). Denote the resulting knowledge base with KB. Due to the inclusion Staff v User, the GDI for Staff (third line) has higher priority than the GDI for User\n(first line). Therefore, in all models I of Circvar(KB), John belongs to ∃decision.{Grant} and hence the following entailments hold:\nCircvar(KB) |= {John} v ∃decision.{Grant} (subsumption) (1) Circvar(KB) |= ∃decision.{Grant}(John) (instance checking) (2)\nInterestingly, John does not belong to BlacklistedStaff, because this is the only way of satisfying the top-priority GDI for Staff. Analogously, in all models I of Circvar(KB), John is the only member of Staff because this setting maximizes the number of individuals satisfying both GDIs (as all the individuals in ¬Staff vacuously satisfy the GDI for Staff for all values of decision). More generally, as a side effect of the maximization of all satI(δ), Circvar induces a sort of closedworld assumption over all concepts with exceptional properties (w.r.t. some larger concept). Consequently, BlacklistedStaff is not satisfiable w.r.t. KB, and the following subsumption holds:\nCircvar(KB) |= Staff v {John} . (3)\nOn the contrary, under Circfix, User and Staff may contain any number of individuals (other than zero) because Circfix is not allowed to change the extension of any atomic concept, even if this would satisfy more GDIs. Similarly, there exist models of Circfix(KB) where John does not belong to ∃decision.{Grant} because John belongs to BlacklistedStaff and Circfix does not allow to change its extension to satisfy more GDIs. As a consequence, it can be easily verified that BlacklistedStaff is satisfiable w.r.t. Circfix(KB), and that (1), (2), and (3) do not hold if Circvar is replaced by Circfix. We only have inferences such as:\nCircfix(KB) |= User u ¬Staff v ¬∃decision.{Grant} , (4) Circfix(KB) |= Staff u ¬BlacklistedStaff v ∃decision.{Grant} . (5)\n2\nNote that in Circvar one can obtain nominals (cf. Staff in (3)) without using nominals explicitly in the knowledge base. If other axioms do not interfere, then an assertion A(a) and a GDI A vn ⊥ suffice to make A a singleton. This idea will be used in some reductions later on.\nThe next example deals with multiple inheritance, and in particular with parent concepts with conflicting properties.\nExample 3.7 Let KB consist of the axioms:\nWhale v Mammal u SeaAnimal Mammal vn ∃has organ.Lungs\nSeaAnimal vn ∃has organ.Gills ∃has organ.Lungs u ∃has organ.Gills v ⊥ ,\nwhere the priority relation is specificity. Note that mammals and sea animals have conflicting default properties. In all models of Circvar(KB) Whale is empty, because this is the only way of having both GDIs satisfied by all individuals. Now let KB′ = KB ∪ {Whale(Moby)}. In each model of\nCircvar(KB′), Moby satisfies as many GDIs as possible, that is, exactly one of the two GDIs of KB′. As a consequence, we have the reasonable inference:2\nCircvar(KB′) |= {Moby} v ∃has organ.Lungs t ∃has organ.Gills .\nThe conflict between the two default properties inherited by Moby can be settled by adding a simple axiom like Whale v ∃has organ.Lungs, that overrides the property of sea animals. In this specific example a strong axiom is appropriate; note, however, that the corresponding GDI would have the same effect under ≺K ; for instance, we have:\nCircvar(KB′ ∪ {Whale vn ∃has organ.Lungs}) |= {Moby} v ∃has organ.Lungs .\nConsider Circfix now. The expected subsumptions Mammal v ∃has organ.Lungs and SeaAnimal v ∃has organ.Gills are not entailed by Circfix(KB), because Lungs and Gills are empty in some models (as Circfix cannot change their extension to satisfy more GDIs). The two GDIs could be enabled by forcing Lungs and Gills to be nonempty. This can be done in several ways, e.g. via assertions such as Lungs(L) or inclusions such as > v ∃aux.Lungs (where aux is a new auxiliary role). Let KB′′ denote such an extension. Then\nCircfix(KB′′) |= {Moby} v ∃has organ.Lungs t ∃has organ.Gills ,\n(similarly, the aforementioned expected consequences are entailed by Circfix(KB′′)). The conflict between the properties inherited from Mammal and SeaAnimal can be settled as discussed above.\n2\nThe impossibility of forcing existentials with GDIs in Circfix, illustrated by the above example, can be exploited to check whether a concept is always nonempty. It suffices to introduce a fresh role aux (in order to prevent interference with the other axioms of the knowledge base) and a GDI > vn ∃aux.C. Clearly, the subsumption > v ∃aux.C is entailed iff C is nonempty in all models of Circfix(KB). Similar ideas will be used in the rest of the paper.\nThe next example is artificial. It is a convenient way of illustrating the interplay of specificity and multiple inheritance.\nExample 3.8 Let KB be the following set of axioms:\nA1 v A′1 (6) A2 v A′2 (7) B v A1 uA2 (8) ∃R1 u ∃R′1 v ⊥ (9) ∃R2 u ∃R′2 v ⊥ (10) ∃R1 u ∃R2 v ⊥ (11)\nA1 vn ∃R1 (12) A2 vn ∃R2 (13) A′1 vn ∃R′1 (14) A′2 vn ∃R′2 (15)\nFor all sets of concept names F , and for all models I of CircF (KB), each member x of BI (if any) satisfies exactly one of the top priority GDIs (12) and (13), that are conflicting due to (11). If x does\n2. The symbol t is description logics’ equivalent of disjunction. Formally, (C tD)I = CI ∪DI .\nnot satisfy (12) then it can satisfy the conflicting GDI (14); symmetrically, if x does not satisfy (13) then x can satisfy (15). Consequently, we have:\nCircfix(KB) |= B v (∃R1 u ∃R′2) t (∃R2 u ∃R′1).\n2\nThe last two examples show that GDIs and disjointness constraints together can express disjoint unions. Similar techniques will be used later on to simulate the law of excluded middle, negation, and 3-valued logic.\nSubsumption, instance checking, and the complement of concept satisfiability can be reduced to each other, as in the classical setting:\nTheorem 3.9 Let DL range over DL-liteR and EL⊥; let X = var, fix, F . In CircX(DL), subsumption, instance checking, and concept unsatisfiability can be reduced to each other in constant time.\nThe proof is not completely standard, due to the limited expressiveness of DL-liteR and EL⊥, as well as the peculiarities of nonmonotonic reasoning.3\nProof. First we focus on Circvar and CircF , where F consists of concept names occurring in a given KB.\nFrom unsatisfiability to subsumption. Checking unsatisfiability of a concept C can be reduced to checking the subsumptionC v ⊥. DL-liteR does not support⊥ explicitly, however an equivalent concept A⊥ can be easily defined with the inclusion A⊥ v ¬A⊥.\nFrom subsumption to unsatisfiability. Conversely, a subsumption C v D can be reduced to the unsatisfiability of C u ¬D. In DL-liteR conjunction is not supported, so the subsumption must be reduced to the unsatisfiability of a fresh variable conceptA axiomatized byA v C andA v ¬D. In EL⊥ conjunction is supported while negation is not; therefore the given subsumption can be reduced to the unsatisfiability of C u D̄ where D̄ is a fresh variable concept axiomatized with D̄ uD v ⊥.\nFrom instance checking to subsumption. An instance checking query C(a) can be reduced to subsumption as follows: Introduce a fresh variable concept A and assert A(a); then minimize A with A vn ⊥; now in all models I of Circvar, AI = {aI}. It follows that C(a) holds iff the subsumption A v C holds.\nFrom unsatisfiability to instance checking. Finally, the unsatisfiability of a concept C is equivalent to the validity of the instance checking problem ¬C(a), where a is a fresh individual constant. In EL⊥, ¬C must be suitably axiomatized with a fresh concept name C̄ and the inclusions C̄ uC v ⊥,> vn C, and> vn C̄ (these three axioms entail the subsumption> v C t C̄, thereby enforcing the law of the excluded middle). In order to preserve the semantics of the knowledge base, > vn C and > vn C̄ must be given a priority strictly smaller than the priority of all the other defeasible inclusion in the KB. This ensures that the new GDIs cannot block the application of any of the original GDIs. Clearly, the two new GDIs must have the same priority.\n3. For example, in classical logic a subsumption C v D is a logical consequence of KB iff for any fresh individual a, D(a) is a logical consequence of KB ∪ {C(a)}. This approach is not correct for Circumscription. The models of CircF (KB) can be quite different from the models of CircF (KB ∪ {C(a)}); for instance, consider the example in which nonmonotonic reasoning makes Whale empty and the assertion Whale(Moby) overrides this inference.\nThis completes the proof for Circvar and CircF . The proof for Circfix can be obtained by replacing the fresh variable concept names A, C̄, and D̄ with a corresponding (variable) concept ∃R, where R is a fresh role. 2\nNote that the above reductions still apply if priorities are specificity-based (≺K), with the exception of the reduction of concept unsatisfiability to instance checking in EL⊥. For this case, one can use Theorem 4.6 below to eliminate general priorities, and get a reduction for Circfix."

      "text" : "In some cases, nonmonotonic inferences and language features—e.g. variable predicates and explicit priorities—do not affect complexity. In this section several such results (and related lemmata) are collected; the reader is warned that, in general, they may not apply to all reasoning tasks and all language fragments. We start by observing that the logics we deal with enjoy the finite model property.\nLemma 4.1 Let KB = 〈K,≺〉 be a DKB in DL-liteR or ELHO⊥,¬. For all F ⊆ NC, CircF (KB) has a model only if CircF (KB) has a finite model whose size is exponential in the size of KB.\nProof. A simple adaptation of a result for ALCIO (Bonatti et al., 2006), taking role hierarchies into account. 2\nAs a consequence, these logics preserve classical consistency (because all descending chains of models originating from a finite model must be finite):\nTheorem 4.2 Let KB = 〈KD ∪ KS,≺〉 be a DKB in DL-liteR or ELHO⊥,¬. For all F ⊆ NC, KS is (classically) consistent iff CircF (KB) has a model.\nRemark 4.3 Obviously, a similar property holds for all circumscribed DLs with the finite model property, including ALCIO and ALCQO.\nSince knowledge base consistency is equivalent to its classical version, it will not be discussed in this paper any further.\nNext, we prove that under mild assumptions, CircF is not more expressive than Circfix (which is a special case of the former), that is, variable concept names do not increase the expressiveness of the logic and can be eliminated.4\nTheorem 4.4 If DL is a description logic fully supporting unqualified existential restrictions (∃ R),5 then, for allF ⊆ NC, concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking in CircF (DL) can be reduced in linear time to concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking (respectively) in Circfix(DL).\n4. The standard techniques for eliminating variable predicates (Cadoli, Eiter, & Gottlob, 1992) use connectives that are not fully supported in DL-liteR and EL, therefore an ad-hoc proof is needed. 5. We say that DL fully supports unqualified restrictions if they can occur wherever a concept name could.\nProof. Let KB be any given DKB in the language DL. Introduce a new role name RA for each (variable) concept name A 6∈ F . Then, replace each occurrence of A in KB with ∃RA and call KB′ the resulting KB. Recall that in Circfix(DL) all concept names are fixed and all roles are variable. Hence, the newly added roles RA behave in Circfix(KB′) exactly in the same way as concepts A 6∈ F do in CircF (KB). Formally, there is a bijection between the models of CircF (KB) and the models of Circfix(KB′), which preserves the interpretation of all role and concept names, except that the extension of concept names A 6∈ F in a model of CircF (KB) coincides with the domain of the corresponding role RA in the corresponding model of Circfix(KB′). As a consequence, the consistency of a concept C w.r.t. CircF (KB) is equivalent to the consistency of C ′ w.r.t. Circfix(KB′), where C ′ is obtained from C by replacing each occurrence of A 6∈ F with the corresponding ∃RA. Similarly for subsumption and instance checking. 2\nSymmetrically, the next theorem proves that in EL⊥ fixed predicates can be eliminated using general priorities. The reduction adapts the classical encoding of fixed predicates to the limited expressiveness of EL⊥.\nTheorem 4.5 For all F ⊆ NC, concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking in CircF (EL⊥) can be reduced in linear time to concept consistency, subsumption, and instance checking (respectively) in Circvar(EL⊥) with general priorities.\nProof. Let K = 〈KS ∪ KD,≺〉 be a given EL⊥ DKB. Fixed predicates are removed through the following transformation. For each concept name A ∈ F introduce a new concept name Ā (representing ¬A). Let K∗S be the set of all disjointness axioms A u Ā v ⊥, for each A ∈ F . Let K∗D be the set of all defeasible inclusions > vn A and > vn Ā, for each A ∈ F . Finally, let ≺′ be the minimal extension of ≺ such that for all δ∗ ∈ K∗D and all δ ∈ KD, δ∗ ≺′ δ. Define\nK′ = 〈KS ∪ K∗S ∪ KD ∪ K∗D,≺′〉 .\nClaim 1. Let J and J ′ be two classical models of KS ∪ K∗S such that J ′ <K′,var J and for all A ∈ F , ĀJ = ¬AJ . Then (i) for all δ ∈ K∗D, satJ ′ (δ) = satJ (δ) and (ii) J and J ′ agree on all A ∈ F . Proof of Claim 1: By definition of ≺′, the members of K∗D have maximal priority, therefore, for all δ ∈ K∗D, satJ ′ (δ) ⊇ satJ (δ). If there existsA ∈ F such that satJ ′(> vn A) ⊃ satJ (> vn A), then AJ ′ ⊃ AJ , and hence ĀJ ′ ⊂ ĀJ ; consequently satJ ′(> vn Ā) ⊂ satJ (> vn Ā) (a contradiction). Symmetrically, the assumption that satJ ′ (> vn Ā) ⊃ satJ (> vn Ā) leads to a contradiction. This proves (i); (ii) is a straightforward consequence of (i). Claim 2. Every model I of CircF (K) can be extended to a model J of Circvar(K′). To prove this claim, extend I to J by setting ĀJ = ¬AI , for all concept names A ∈ F . Suppose that J is not a model of Circvar(K′). Since J satisfiesKS∪K∗S by construction, there must be a J ′ that satisfies KS ∪ K∗S and such that J ′ <K′,var J . By Claim 1.(ii), J and J ′ agree on all A ∈ F ; by Claim 1.(i), the improvement of J ′ over J concerns the GDIs in KD. It follows that I ′ <K,F I, where I ′ is the restriction of J ′ to the language of K. This contradicts the assumption that I is a model of CircF (K).\nClaim 3. For all models J of Circvar(K′), the restriction of J to the language of K is a model of CircF (K).\nLet I be the restriction of J to the language ofK. Clearly I satisfiesKS. Now suppose that I is not a model of CircF (K), which means that there exists I ′ satisfying KS and such that I ′ <K,F I.\nExtend I ′ to J ′ by setting ĀJ ′ = ¬AI′ , for all concept names A ∈ F . Note that I and I ′ must agree on all A ∈ F , therefore J and J ′ agree on them, too. Consequently, for all δ ∈ K∗D, satJ ′ (δ) = satJ (δ). Moreover, I ′ improves I over the GDIs of KD, therefore J ′ improves J over KD, too. It follows that J ′ <K′,var J (a contradiction). The Theorem is now a straightforward consequence of Claims 2 and 3. 2\nNow consider priority relations and GDIs. We are going to prove that if the language fragment is sufficiently rich, then they can be simulated with the specificity-based relation ≺K and normalized defeasible inclusions A vn C (whose left-hand side is a concept name), respectively.\nLet KB = 〈K,≺〉 be any given DKB in EL⊥. First we need to define a new fixed concept Dom that encodes the domain without being equivalent to >. This requires the following transformation:"

      "text" : ">∗ = Dom (C uD)∗ = C∗ uD∗\n⊥∗ = ⊥ (C v[n] D)∗ = C∗ v[n] D∗\nObtain K∗ from K by transforming all inclusions in K and by adding a nonemptiness axiom > v ∃aux .Dom (aux a fresh role) plus an assertion Dom(a) for each a ∈ NI occurring in K. It is not hard to see that the restrictions to Dom of the classical models of K∗ correspond to the classical models of K. More precisely, let I∗ be a classical model of K∗, we obtain a classical model I of K by setting AI = AI∗ ∩ DomI∗ and RI = RI∗ ∩ (DomI∗ × DomI∗), for each concept name A and role name R occurring in K. Notice that it is necessary for DomI∗ to be non-empty for this to work. Conversely, given a classical model I of K, it is sufficient to set DomI = ∆I and auxI = ∆I ×∆I to make I a classical model of K∗.\nNow we have to remove general priorities and GDIs. For all GDIs δ = (C vn D) ∈ K∗, add two fresh predicates Aδ, Pδ and replace δ with the following axiom schemata:\nDom v Aδ Aδ′ v Aδ for all δ′ ≺ δ (16) Aδ vn ∃Pδ ∃Pδ u C v D (17)\nCall the new DKB KB′ = 〈K′,≺K′〉. By (16), the specificity-based relation≺K′ prioritizes the new GDIs according to the original priorities. Moreover, by (17), a defeasible inclusion Aδ vn ∃Pδ is satisfied by an individual if and only if the same individual satisfies the corresponding GDI δ. Then it is not difficult to verify that all the reasoning tasks such that none of the new predicates Aδ and Pδ occur in the query yield the same answer in 〈K∗,≺∗〉 and KB′. As a consequence of the above discussion, by combining the transformation ·∗ with (16) and (17), and by observing that the reduction makes use of EL⊥ constructs only, we have:\nTheorem 4.6 Reasoning in Circfix(EL⊥) with explicit priorities and GDIs can be reduced in polynomial time to reasoning in Circfix(EL⊥) with only specificity-based priority and defeasible inclusions of the form A vn ∃P .\nFinally, by Theorem 4.4, the above result can be extended to all of CircF :\nCorollary 4.7 Reasoning in CircF (EL⊥) with explicit priorities and GDIs can be reduced in polynomial time to reasoning in Circfix(EL⊥) with only specificity-based priority and defeasible inclusions of the form A vn ∃P ."

      "text" : "In Circ∗ both concept names and roles can be fixed; however, as we show in this section, fixed roles in general make reasoning tasks undecidable. To this end, the model conservative extension problem defined by Lutz and Wolter (2010) is reduced to the subsumption problem.6\nSome preliminary definitions are needed; given a signature Σ ⊆ NC ∪NR and two interpretations I and J , we say that I and J coincide on Σ if and only if ∆I = ∆J and for all predicates X ∈ Σ, XI = XJ . Then, let T1 ⊆ T2 be classical EL TBoxes, T2 is a model conservative extension of T1 if and only if for every model I of T1, there exists a model J of T2 such that I and J coincide on the signature of T1.\nLutz and Wolter (2010) prove (see Lemma 40) that there exists a class C of EL TBoxes such that the problem of checking whether a TBox in C is a model conservative extension of another TBox in C is undecidable. Moreover, the following property holds.\nLemma 5.1 Given two TBoxes T1 ⊆ T2 in C, if T2 is not a model conservative extension of T1 then there exists a model I of T1 and an interpretation J of T2 such that I and J coincide on the signature of T1 and the set of individuals in J that violate at least one concept inclusion from T2 is finite.\nFor a DKB KB = 〈KS ∪ KD,≺〉 and an interpretation I of KB, we denote by abKB(I) (for abnormal) the total number of individuals x ∈ ∆I such that x 6∈ satI(δ) for some δ ∈ KD.\nLemma 5.2 Let KB = 〈KS ∪ KD, ∅〉 be a DKB and I be a classical model of KB s.t. abKB(I) is finite. For all F ⊆ NC ∪ NR, either I is a model of CircF (KB) or there exists a model J of CircF (KB) such that J <KB,F I.\nProof. It suffices to show that each <KB,F -chain descending from I is finite. Since DIs are incomparable with each other, each step in the <KB,F -chain must improve at least one DI and leave all other DIs unchanged. Formally, if I ′ <KB,F I then there exists at least a DI δ ∈ KD such that satI(δ) ⊂ satI′(δ) and for all δ′ ∈ KD it holds satI(δ′) ⊆ satI′(δ′). Hence, abKB(I ′) < abKB(I) and the thesis follows. 2\nAssume that T1, T2 ∈ C are given, where T1 ⊆ T2, and let Σ be the signature of T1. Let F = Σ and KB = 〈K, ∅〉 where K = T1 ∪ {C vn D | C v D ∈ T2 \\ T1}.\nLemma 5.3 For all T1, T2 ∈ C, T2 is a model conservative extension of T1 iff Circ∗F (KB) |= C v D, for all C v D ∈ T2.\nProof. [if ] Suppose by contradiction that T2 is not a model conservative extension of T1 and Circ∗F (KB) |= C v D, for all C v D ∈ T2. By Lemma 5.1, we can consider a model I of T1 and an extension J of I on the signature of T2, such that the set of individuals that violate in J at least one inclusion of T2 is finite. Since J is a classical model of KB and abKB(J ) is finite, by Lemma 5.2, there exists a model J ′ of Circ∗F (KB) such that either J ′ = J or J ′ <KB,F J . Since Circ∗F (KB) entails T2 and F = Σ, J ′ is a (classical) model of T2 that coincides with J and I on Σ (absurdum).\n6. The sketch of this proof has been kindly provided by Frank Wolter in a personal communication. Any imprecision in the proof is due to the authors.\n[only if ] Suppose by contradiction that T2 is a model conservative extension of T1, and for some Ĉ v D̂ ∈ T2, it holds Circ∗F (KB) 6|= Ĉ v D̂. Since Circ∗F (KB) 6|= Ĉ v D̂, there exists a model I of Circ∗F (KB) such that satI(Ĉ vn D̂) ⊂ ∆I . Since I is a model of T1 and T2 is a model conservative extension of T1, there exists an interpretation J that (i) coincides with I on Σ and (ii) is a model of T2, i.e., for all defeasible inclusions C vn D in KB, satJ (C vn D) = ∆J . Therefore, J <KB,F I (absurdum). 2\nSince checking whether a TBox is a model conservative extension of another one has been proved to be undecidable for C ⊆ EL (Lutz & Wolter, 2010), it immediately follows that subsumption in Circ∗F (EL) is undecidable. Moreover, since subsumption can be reduced to concept unsatisfiability or instance checking (Theorem 3.9), the latter reasoning tasks are undecidable as well.\nTheorem 5.4 In Circ∗F (EL), subsumption, concept consistency and instance checking are undecidable.\n6. Complexity of Circumscribed DL-liteR In this section we focus on DL-liteR DKBs. We first prove that in Circvar(DL-liteR) the reasoning tasks are complete for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. From this, according to Theorem 4.4, we immediately obtain an hardness result for Circfix(DL-liteR) too. Then, the membership for Circfix(DL-liteR) to second level of the polynomial hierarchy is shown for the fragment of DKBs with left-fixed defeasible inclusions, i.e. defeasible inclusions of type A vn C.\n6.1 Complexity of Circvar(DL-liteR)\nIn this section we prove that Circvar(DL-liteR) subsumption, concept unsatisfiability (co-sat) and instance checking are complete for Πp2.\nOur membership results rely on the possibility of extracting a small (polynomial) model from any model of a circumscribed DKB.\nLemma 6.1 Let KB be a DL-liteR DKB. For all models I of Circvar(KB) and all x ∈ ∆I there exists a model J of Circvar(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ ∆J , (iii) for all DL-liteR concepts C, x ∈ CI iff x ∈ CJ (iv) |∆J | is polynomial in the size of KB.\nProof. Assume that KB = 〈KS ∪ KD,≺〉, I is a model of Circvar(KB), and x ∈ ∆I . Let cl(KB) be the set of all concepts occurring in KB. Choose a minimal set ∆ ⊆ ∆I containing: (i) x, (ii) all aI such that a ∈ NI ∩ cl(KB), (iii) for each concept ∃R in cl(KB) satisfied in I, a node yR such that for some z ∈ ∃RI , (z, yR) ∈ RI .\nNow define J as follows: (i) ∆J = ∆, (ii) aJ = aI (for a ∈ NI ∩ cl(KB)), (iii) AJ = AI ∩∆ (A ∈ NC ∩ cl(KB)), and (iv) PJ = {(z, yP ) | z ∈ ∆ and z ∈ ∃P I} ∪ {(yP− , z) | z ∈ ∆ and z ∈ ∃P−I} (P ∈ NR).\nNote that by construction, for all z ∈ ∆J and for all C ∈ cl(KB), z ∈ CJ iff z ∈ CI ; consequently, J is a classical model of S. Moreover, the cardinality of ∆J is linear in the size of KB (by construction). So we are only left to show that J is a <KD,var-minimal model of KB.\nSuppose not, and consider any J ′ <KD,var J . Define I ′ as follows: (i) ∆I ′ = ∆I , (ii) aI ′\n= aI , (iii)AI ′ = AJ ′ , (iv) P I ′ = PJ ′ . Note that the elements in ∆I \\∆J ′ satisfy no left-hand side of\nany DL-liteR inclusion (be it classical or defeasible), therefore all inclusions are vacuously satisfied.\nMoreover, the restriction of I ′ to ∆J ′ is <KD,var-smaller than the corresponding restriction of I in the interpretation ordering. It follows that I ′ <KD,var I, and hence I cannot be a model of Circvar(KB) (a contradiction). 2\nTo illustrate Lemma 6.1, consider the DKB KB in Figure 2(a) and the model I in Figure 2(b). Note that all individuals in I satisfy the defeasible inclusion inKB. The “small” model J , depicted in Figure 2(c), is obtained as follows. First, it contains the designated individual x; then, for each concept ∃R that occurs in KB and is satisfied in I (where R is a possibly inverse role), it contains a representative yR that receives role R in I. In our case, assume that the chosen representatives are: yQ = 6, yQ− = 4, yS = 8, and yT = 7. Hence, ∆J = {x, 6, 4, 8, 7}. The roles in J are obtained by connecting each individual z that satisfies a concept ∃P in I to the chosen representative yP . For instance, since 4 satisfies ∃S in I, we have the edge (4, 8) ∈ SJ . Moreover, the representative for an inverse role P− is connected to all nodes that satisfy the concept ∃P− in I. In our case, since 4 is the representative for Q− and 6 satisfies ∃Q−, we have the edge (4, 6) ∈ QJ . Besides, since 4 itself satisfies ∃Q−, we also have (4, 4) ∈ QJ . It can be verified by inspection that J is a model of Circvar(KB), as its individuals satisfy all classical and defeasible inclusions in KB.\nTheorem 6.2 Concept consistency over Circvar(DL-liteR) DKBs is in Σp2. Subsumption and instance checking are in Πp2.\nProof. By Lemma 6.1, it suffices to guess a polynomial size model that provides an answer to the given reasoning problem. Then, with an NP oracle, it is possible to check that the model is minimal w.r.t. <var. 2\nThe complexity upper bounds proved by Theorem 6.2 are in fact tight, as stated by Theorem 6.6. The proof of hardness is based on the reduction of the minimal-entailment problem of positive disjunctive logic programs — which has been proved to be Πp2-hard (Eiter & Gottlob, 1995).\nA clause is a formula l1 ∨ · · · ∨ lh, where the li are literals over a set of propositional variables PV = {p1, . . . , pn}. A positive disjunctive logic program (PDLP for short) is a set of clauses\nS = {c1, . . . , cm} where each cj contains at least one positive literal. A truth valuation for S is a set I ⊆ PV , containing the propositional variables which are true. A truth valuation is a model of S if it satisfies all clauses in S. For a literal l, we write S |=min l if and only if every minimal7 model of S satisfies l. The minimal-entailment problem can be then defined as follows: given a PDLP S and a literal l, determine whether S |=min l.\nFor each propositional variable pi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we introduce two concept names Pi and P̄i, where the latter encodes ¬pi. We denote by Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2n, a generic Pi or P̄i. For each clause cj ∈ S we introduce the concept name Cj . Then, two other concept names True and False represent the set of true and false literals, respectively. We employ roles RLi, RTrueCj , RFalseP̄i, RTrueP̄i, and TLi.\nIn the following, defeasible inclusions δ are assigned a numerical priority h(δ), with the intended meaning that δ1 ≺ δ2 iff h(δ1) < h(δ2).\nThe first step consists in reifying all the propositional literals, i.e., we want each of them to correspond to an individual. Therefore, we introduce the axioms:\nNonEmpty(a) (18)\nNonEmpty v ¬Li (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (19) NonEmpty v ∃RLi (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (20)\n∃RL−i v Li (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (21) Li v ¬Lj (1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2n) (22) Li vn ¬Li (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) [priority: 0] (23)\nAxioms (18-21) force the literal encodings Li to be non empty. Axioms (22) make literal encodings pairwise disjoint. Finally, defeasible inclusions (23) are used to reduce the Li to singletons. Then, we represent the set of clauses S by adding for each clause cj = lj1 ∨ · · · ∨ ljk, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, the following axioms.\nLji v Cj (1 ≤ i ≤ k) (24) Cj vn ¬Cj [priority: 0] (25)\nNonEmpty v ∃RTrueCj (26) ∃RTrueC−j v TrueCj (27)\nTrueCj v True (28) TrueCj v Cj (29)\nAxioms (24–25) ensure that each (encoding of a) clause Cj is the union of its literals Lji. Axioms (26–29) assure that each clause contains at least one true literal. In order to model the concepts\n7. With respect to set inclusion.\nTrue and False and the correct meaning of complementary literals we add the following axioms.\nTrue v ¬False (30) TruePi v ∃RFalseP̄i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (31)\n∃RFalseP̄−i v FalseP̄i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (32) TruePi v Pi (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (33) TruePi v True (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (34) FalseP̄i v False (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (35) FalseP̄i v P̄i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (36)\nThe previous schemata regard TruePi only; analogous schemata are defined for FalsePi. The following inclusions ensure that the truth of a given literal is locally visible in the individual a, through the auxiliary roles TLi.\nTrueLi v ∃TL−i (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (37) TrueLi w ∃TL−i (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (38) ∃TLi v NonEmpty (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (39)\nThe axioms defined so far encode the classical semantics of S. To represent only minimal models we add the following axioms.\nPi vn FalsePi (1 ≤ i ≤ n) [priority: 1] (40) Pi vn TruePi (1 ≤ i ≤ n) [priority: 2] (41)\nGiven a PDLP S, we call the KB defined above KBS . Given a truth assignment I ⊆ PV and a domain ∆ = {a, d1, . . . , d2n}, we define a corresponding interpretation, denoted by model(S, I,∆), whose structure mirrors I . Formally, model(S, I,∆) is the interpretation I = (∆, ·I) such that:\nI. aI = a;\nII. NonEmptyI = {a};\nIII. RLIi = {(a, di)} and TLIi = {(a, di) | I |= li};\nIV. for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, LIi = {di};\nV. for each 1 ≤ j ≤ m, CIj = {LIj1, . . . , LIjh} where cj = lj1 ∨ · · · ∨ ljh;\nVI. for each 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, di ∈ TrueLIi (resp. di ∈ FalseLIi ) iff I |= li (resp. I 6 |=li);\nVII. (X Y )I = XI ∩ Y I , where X Y is a concept name obtained by concatenating two other concept names X and Y (for instance, concept name TrueCj is obtained by concatenating concept names True and Cj); in other words, juxtaposition represents conjunction;\nVIII. (RX Y )I = ∆I × (X Y )I .\nThe following lemma, proved in the Appendix, states the relationship between I and model(S, I,∆).\nLemma 6.3 Given a PDLP S over PV = {p1, . . . , pn} and a truth assignment I ⊆ PV , I is a minimal model of S iff the interpretation model(S, I,∆) is a model of Circvar(KBS), for all domains ∆ with |∆| = 2n+ 1.\nThe following result, also proved in the Appendix, shows that any model of Circvar(KBS) in fact corresponds to a minimal model of S.\nLemma 6.4 If I is a model of Circvar(KBS), then there exist a minimal model I of S such that pi ∈ I iff P Ii ⊆ TrueI iff P̄ Ii ⊆ FalseI , for all i = 1, . . . , n.\nLemma 6.5 Given a PDLP S and a literal l represented by concept name L, the following are equivalent:\n(minimal entailment) S |=min l;\n(subsumption) Circvar(KBS) |= L v True;\n(co-sat) FalseL is not satisfiable w.r.t Circvar(KBS);\n(instance checking) Circvar(KBS) |= (∃TL)(a).\nProof. The three inference problems onKBS represent the fact that for all models I of Circvar(KBS) we have thatLI∩TrueI is not empty — co-sat in particular relies on the fact that in all Circvar(KBS) models True and False are a partition of the individuals belonging to the literal concepts. Therefore, it suffices to prove that l is true in all minimal models of S iff LI ∩ TrueI 6= ∅ in all models of Circvar(KBS).\nLemma 6.3 establishes a bijection between minimal models I of S and certain models I = model(S, I,∆) of Circvar(KBS), such that the truth of a literal l in I corresponds to the inclusion of LI into TrueI in I (see rule VI in the definition of model ). Therefore, the right-to-left direction is immediately satisfied. For the left-to-right direction, assume that l is true in all minimal models of S and let I be a model of Circvar(KBS). By Lemma 6.4, there is a minimal model I of S such that pi ∈ I iff P Ii ⊆ TrueI . If l = pi, we conclude LI ⊆ TrueI and the thesis. Similarly, for l = p̄i.\n2\nThe following theorem provides complexity lower-bounds for the main decision problems of both Circvar(DL-liteR) and Circfix(DL-liteR). The result for Circvar(DL-liteR) follows immediately from Lemma 6.5, and it extends to Circfix(DL-liteR) due to Theorem 4.4.\nTheorem 6.6 Subsumption, co-sat and instance checking over circumscribed DL-liteR DKBs with general priorities are Πp2-hard.\n6.2 Upper Bound of Circfix(DL-liteR) with Restrictions\nWe develop the same argument used for Circvar(DL-liteR) to prove similar upper bounds for Circfix(DL-liteR) DKBs with left-fixed DIs (i.e., their left-hand side is fixed or—equivalently— a concept name) or empty priority relations. Whether the same upper bounds apply to Circfix(DL-liteR) without any restriction is left as an open question.\nLemma 6.7 Let KB be a DL-liteR knowledge base whose DIs are left-fixed. For all models I of Circfix(KB) and all x ∈ ∆I there exists a model J of Circfix(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ ∆J , (iii) for all DL-liteR concepts C, x ∈ CI iff x ∈ CJ , and (iv) |∆J | is polynomial in the size of KB.\nProof. Assume that I is a model of Circfix(KB), with KB = 〈KS ∪ KD,≺〉, and x ∈ ∆I . Let cl(KB) be the set of all concepts occurring in KB. Choose a minimal set ∆ ⊆ ∆I containing: (i) x, (ii) all aI such that a ∈ NI ∩ cl(KB), (iii) for each concept ∃R in cl(KB) satisfied in I, a node yR such that yR ∈ (∃R−)I (where ∃P−− is considered equivalent to ∃P ), and finally (iv) for all inclusions C v[n] ∃R in KB such that (C u ∃R)I 6= ∅, a node z ∈ (C u ∃R)I .\nNow define J as follows: (i) ∆J = ∆, (ii) aJ = aI (for a ∈ NI ∩ cl(KB)), (iii) AJ = AI ∩∆ (A ∈ NC ∩ cl(KB)), and (iv) PJ = {(z, yP ) | z ∈ ∆ and z ∈ ∃P I} ∪ {(yP , z) | z ∈ ∆ and z ∈ ∃P−I} (P ∈ NR).\nNote that by construction, for all z ∈ ∆J and for all C ∈ cl(KB), z ∈ CJ iff z ∈ CI ; consequently, J is a classical model of KB. Moreover, the cardinality of ∆J is linear in the size of KB (by construction). So we are only left to show that J is a <fix-minimal model of KB.\nSuppose not, and consider any J ′ <fix J . Define I ′ as follows: (a) ∆I ′ = ∆I , (b) aI ′ = aI , (c) AI ′ = AI , (d) each RI ′ is a minimal set such that (d1) RI\n′ ⊇ RJ ′ , (d2) for all z ∈ ∆I \\∆J , and for all inclusions C v ∃R or C vn ∃R in KB such that z ∈ (C u ∃R)I , if RJ ′ contains a pair (v, w), then (z, w) ∈ RI′ ; finally, (d3) each P I′ is closed under the role inclusion axioms of KB. Note that, by construction,\n(*) for all z ∈ ∆I \\∆J , z ∈ ∃RI′ only if z ∈ ∃RI ;\n(**) for all z ∈ ∆I \\∆J , z ∈ ∃RI′ only if there exists v ∈ ∆J ′ such that v ∈ ∃RJ ′ .\nNow we prove that I ′ is a classical model of KB. By construction, the edges (z, w) introduced in (d2) do not change the set of existential restrictions satisfied by the members of ∆J ; as a consequence — and since J ′ is a model of KB— the members of ∆J satisfy all the classical CIs of KB.\nNow consider an arbitrary element z ∈ ∆I \\∆J and any CI γ ofKS. If γ is an inclusion without existential quantifiers, then I and I ′ give the same interpretation to γ by definition, therefore z satisfies γ. If γ is ∃R v A, ∃R v ¬A, ∃R v ¬∃S, or A v ¬∃R (and considering that I satisfies γ) z fails to satisfy γ only if for some R′ ∈ {R,S}, z 6∈ (∃R′)I and z ∈ (∃R′)I′ ; this is impossible by (*). Next, suppose γ is ∃R v ∃S. If z ∈ (∃R)I′ , then by (**) there exists a v ∈ ∆J ′ satisfying (∃R)J ′ and hence (∃S)J ′ (as J ′ is a model of KS), therefore z ∈ (∃S)I ′ (by d2). We are only left to consider γ = A v ∃R: If z ∈ AI′ = AI , then there exists wA ∈ AJ ′\n(by construction of ∆) and wA ∈ (∃R)J ′ because J ′ is a model of KB. Then z ∈ (∃R)I′ by (d2). Therefore, in all possible cases, z satisfies γ. This proves that I ′ satisfies all the strong CIs of KB. It is not hard to verify that I ′ satisfies\nalso all role inclusions of KB. Therefore, in order to derive a contradiction, we are left to show that I ′ <fix I (which implies that I is not a model of Circfix(KB)). Since by assumption J ′ <fix J , it suffices to prove the following claim: if satJ (δ) ⊆ satJ ′(δ) (resp. satJ (δ) ⊂ satJ ′(δ)), then satI(δ) ⊆ satI′(δ) (resp. satI(δ) ⊂ satI′(δ)).\nIn ∆J , I and J (resp. I ′ and J ′) satisfy the same concepts, therefore we only need to show that for all z ∈ ∆I \\ ∆J , if z ∈ satI(δ) then z ∈ satI′(δ). In all cases but those in which the\nright-hand side of δ is ∃R, the proof is similar to the proof for strong CIs (it exploits (*) and the fact that concept names are fixed).\nLet δ be A vn ∃R and consider an arbitrary z ∈ ∆I \\∆J such that z ∈ satI(δ). Since concept names are fixed, the only interesting case is that z actively satisfies δ, i.e. z ∈ (A u ∃R)I . By construction, ∆ contains an individual v ∈ (A u ∃R)J . Since by hypothesis satJ (δ) ⊆ satJ ′(δ), v ∈ (A u ∃R)J ′ and hence, by (d2), z ∈ (∃R)I′ , that is z ∈ satI′(δ). 2\nTo prove the same lemma under the assumption that the priority relation is empty we need some preliminary notions. Given a KB KB = 〈KS ∪ KD,≺〉, an interpretation I and an individual z ∈ ∆I , we denote with KB[z] the classical knowledge base:\nKB[z] = KS ∪ { C v D | (C vn D) ∈ KD and z ∈ satI(C vn D) } Then, the support of a concept C in I, supp I(C), is the set of individuals z ∈ ∆I such that, for some A, z ∈ AI and A vKB[z] C. If z ∈ supp I(C) we say that z supports C in I.\nLemma 6.8 Let KB = 〈K, ∅〉 be a DL-liteR knowledge base. For all models I of Circfix(KB) and all x ∈ ∆I there exists a model J of Circfix(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ ∆J , (iii) for all DL-liteR concepts C, x ∈ CI iff x ∈ CJ , and (iv) |∆J | is polynomial in the size of KB.\nProof. Assume that I is a model of Circfix(KB) and let ∆ ⊆ ∆I be defined as in the above proof of Lemma 6.7, except for case (iv), which is replaced by: (iv’) for all inclusions C v[n] ∃R in KB such that supp I(∃R) 6= ∅, a node w∃R ∈ supp I(∃R). That is, for each inclusion whose RHS is variable, we pick a witness that is in the support of the RHS, if such a witness exists.\nNext, define J as in the proof of Lemma 6.7. As before, J is a classical model of KB and the cardinality of ∆J is linear in the size of KB. We are left to show that J is <fix-minimal. Suppose not, and consider any J ′ <fix J . Since the priority relation is empty, for all DIs δ in KB, satJ (δ) ⊆ satJ ′(δ). Hence, for all concepts C it holds supp J (C) ⊆ supp J ′(C). Define I ′ as in the proof of Lemma 6.7, except for case (d2), which is replaced by: (d2’) for all z ∈ ∆I \\∆J , and for all inclusions C v[n] ∃R in KB such that z ∈ supp I(∃R), if RJ ′ contains a pair (v, w), then (z, w) ∈ RI′ . We prove that I ′ <fix I, contradicting the hypothesis that I is a model of Circfix(KB). The only non-trivial case consists in proving that the individuals in ∆I\n′ \\∆J ′ satisfy in I ′ the same inclusions of type C v[n] ∃S that they satisfy in I.\nAssume that z ∈ ∆I′ \\ ∆J ′ satisfies C v[n] ∃S in I; we distinguish two cases. First, if z ∈ supp I(∃S), we have that ∆J ′ contains a witnessw∃S s.t. w∃S ∈ supp J (∃S) ⊆ supp J ′(∃S). Therefore, there exists a pair (w∃S , y) ∈ SJ ′\nand, by (d2’), (z, y) ∈ SI′ . Second, assume that z 6∈ supp I(∃S). Since z ∈ satI(C v[n] D), we have that z 6∈ supp I(C). Therefore, if C = A, then z 6∈ AI = AI′ , whereas if C = ∃R, then by (d2’) z 6∈ (∃R)I′ . In both cases, z vacuously satisfies δ in I ′. 2\nTheorem 6.9 Let KB be a DKB with left-fixed DIs or an empty priority relation. Concept consistency in Circfix(KB) is in Σp2. Subsumption and instance checking are in Π p 2.\nProof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.2. 2"

      "text" : "Recall that reasoning in circumscribed EL is undecidable when roles can be fixed. Here we analyze the other cases, were F ⊆ NC.\nIn EL, that cannot express any contradictions, defeasible inclusions cannot be possibly blocked under Circvar, and circumscription collapses to classical reasoning:\nTheorem 7.1 Let KB = 〈KS ∪KD,≺〉 be an EL DKB. Then I is a model of Circvar(KB) iff I is a model of KS ∪ K̂D, where K̂D = {A v C | (A vn C) ∈ KD}.\nProof. Let I be any model of Circvar(KB), and let J be the interpretation such that (i) ∆J = ∆I , (ii) for all a ∈ NI, aJ = aI , (iii) for all A ∈ NC, AJ = ∆J , and (iv) for all P ∈ NR, PJ = ∆J ×∆J . It can be easily verified by structural induction that for all EL concepts C, CJ = ∆J and hence each domain element of J satisfies all EL inclusions (strong and defeasible). Then, clearly, J is a model of Circvar(KB). Consequently, for all δ ∈ KD, satI(δ) = ∆I , otherwise J <var I (a contradiction). It follows that I is a classical model of KS ∪ K̂D. 2\nBy the results of the work of Baader et al. (2005), it follows that in Circvar(EL), concept satisfiability is trivial, subsumption and instance checking are in P.\nRemark 7.2 Clearly, the same argument and the same result apply to Circvar(ELHO).\nIf we make EL more interesting by adding ⊥ as a source of inconsistency, then complexity increases significantly.\nTheorem 7.3 In Circvar(EL⊥), concept satisfiability, instance checking, and subsumption are ExpTime-hard. These results still hold if knowledge bases contain no assertion.8\nProof. Let EL¬A be the extension of EL where atomic concepts can be negated. We first reduce TBox satisfiability in EL¬A (which is known to be ExpTime-hard, see Baader et al., 2005) to the complement of subsumption in Circvar(EL⊥). Let T be a TBox (i.e., a set of CIs) in EL¬A. First introduce for each concept nameA occurring in T a fresh concept name Ā whose intended meaning is ¬A. Obtain T ′ from T by replacing each literal ¬A with Ā. Let KB = 〈K,≺K〉 be the DKB obtained by extending T ′ with the following inclusions, where U and UA — for all A occurring in T— are fresh concept names (representing undefined truth values), and R is a fresh role name:\nA u Ā v ⊥ (42) A u UA v ⊥ (43) Ā u UA v ⊥ (44)\nUA v U (45)\n> vn A (46) > vn Ā (47) > vn UA (48) > vn ∃R.UA (49)\nWe prove that T is satisfiable iff in some model of Circvar(KB) all UA’s are empty, which holds iff Circvar(KB) 6|= > v ∃R.U . Consequently, subsumption in Circvar(EL⊥) is ExpTime-hard. Assume that T is satisfiable and I is a model of T with domain ∆I . From I we define an interpretation\n8. Equivalently, in DL’s terminology: ABoxes are empty.\nJ that is a model of Circvar(KB) such that UJ = ∅, thus proving that Circvar(KB) 6|= > v ∃R.U . J has the same domain as I, and all concepts and roles occurring in T have the same interpretation as in I; we only need to define the interpretation of the newly introduced concepts Ā, UA, and U , and of the role R. We set ĀJ = ∆I \\AI and UJA = UJ = RJ = ∅.\nBy construction J is a model of the classical inclusions in KB, in particular CIs (42)–(45). It remains to prove that J is minimal w.r.t. <var, i.e., it is not possible to improve any DI δ without violating another DI that is either incomparable with δ, or has a higher priority than δ. Notice that defeasible inclusions (46) (resp., (47)) are violated by all individuals not inAJ (resp., all individuals in AJ ). DIs (48) and (49) are violated by all individuals. Moreover, notice that DIs (46)–(49) are mutually incomparable according to specificity.\nEach DI of type (46) or (47) can only be improved at the expenses of the corresponding DI of the other type. Moreover, improving DIs (48) or (49) requires setting UJA 6= ∅, which, due to rules (43) and (44) would damage the incomparable DIs (46) and/or (47). This proves that J is a model of Circvar(KB), and hence Circvar(KB) 6|= > v ∃R.U .\nConversely, assume that Circvar(KB) 6|= > v ∃R.U , and let I be a model of Circvar(KB) with an individual x ∈ ∆I such that x 6∈ (∃R.U)I . Due to rule (45), x 6∈ (∃R.UA)I for all atomic concepts A. Hence, x violates all DIs of type (49). If there exists a concept UA such that (UA)I is not empty, then the model obtained from I by adding an R-edge from x to an individual in (UA)I is smaller than I according to <var, which is a contradiction. Therefore, all concepts UA are empty in I.\nNext, we show that for all atomic concepts A and all individuals y ∈ ∆I , either y ∈ AI or y ∈ ĀI . Assume the contrary, i.e., there exists an individual y which belongs neither to AI nor to ĀI . Then, y violates all DIs (46)–(49). Consider the interpretation I ′, obtained from I by setting (UA) I′ = UI ′\n= {y}. By construction I ′ satisfies all CIs in KB. Compared to I, the status of the DIs is the same, except that in I ′ the individual y satisfies (48). Hence, I ′ <var I, which is a contradiction. Since each individual belongs to either AI or ĀI , we can convert I into a classical model of T , thus showing that T is satisfiable.\nSimilarly, for any given a ∈ NI, T is satisfiable iff there exists a model I of Circvar(KB) such that aI 6∈ (∃R.U)I . Therefore, instance checking in Circvar(EL⊥) is ExpTime-hard as well.\nFinally, add a fresh concept name B and all the inclusions B u ∃R.UA v ⊥; call the new DKB KB′. Note that T is satisfiable iff in some model of Circvar(KB) all UA’s are empty, which holds iff B is satisfiable w.r.t. Circvar(KB′). Consequently, concept satisfiability in Circvar(EL⊥) is ExpTime-hard. 2\nSince Circvar is a special case of CircF , and by Theorem 4.4, the above theorem applies to CircF and Circfix, too:\nCorollary 7.4 For X = F, fix, concept satisfiability checking, instance checking, and subsumption in CircX(EL⊥) are ExpTime-hard. These results still hold if ABoxes are empty (i.e. assertions are not allowed).\nFixed concept names can play a role similar to ⊥, so that the above proof can be adapted to CircF (EL).\nTheorem 7.5 Instance checking and subsumption are ExpTime-hard both in CircF (EL) and in Circfix(EL). The same holds in the restriction of EL not supporting >.\nProof. We reduce satisfiability of an EL¬A TBox T to the complement of subsumption in CircF (EL). First we have to introduce a new concept name D representing > and translate each concept C in EL¬A into a corresponding C∗ in EL, as follows:\n• C∗ = C if C is a concept name;\n• C∗ = Ā if C is ¬A (for all A, Ā is a new concept name);\n• C∗ = D u ∃R.(C∗1 uD) if C is ∃R.C1;\n• C∗ = C∗1 u C∗2 if C is C1 u C2.\nEach C1 v C2 in T is translated into C∗1 v C∗2 . Then we extend the translated TBox with the following inclusions, where Bot (representing⊥), all UA’s, and Bad are new concept names and R is a new role name:\nA v D (50) Ā v D (51) UA v D (52)\nA u Ā v Bot (53) A u UA v Bot (54) Ā u UA v Bot (55)\nD vn A (56) D vn Ā (57)\nD vn UA (58) D v D′ (59) D′ vn ∃R.UA (60) D′ vn ∃R.Bot (61)\n∃R.UA v Bad (62) ∃R.Bot v Bad (63)\nD(a) (ABox assertion) (64)\nLetKB = 〈K,≺K〉 be the resulting DKB, and set F = {D,Bot}. We prove that the following three properties are equivalent: (i) T is satisfiable, (ii) CircF (KB) 6|= D v Bad , and (iii) CircF (KB) 6|= Bad(a).\nLet us prove that (ii) implies (i). Let I be a model of CircF (KB) with an individual x s.t. x ∈ DI and x 6∈ BadI . By (62)–(63), x 6∈ (∃R.UA)I for all A, and x 6∈ (∃R.Bad)I . By (59), x ∈ (D′)I . Hence, x violates DIs (60) and (61). Assume that at least one concept UA is not empty in I (resp., Bot is not empty in I). Then, I can be improved (according to <F ) by connecting with an R-edge the individual x with the non-empty concept UA (resp., Bot), and then adding x to Bad (notice that Bad is a variable concept). This being a contradiction, we conclude that Bot and all UA’s are empty in I. Then, we prove that the restriction of I to the domain DI is a model of T .\nInclusions (50)–(51) ensure that all individuals satisfying either A or Ā are in DI . DIs (56)– (57), together with the fact that all UA’s are empty, guarantee that each individual in DI satisfies either A or Ā, for all concept names A. Rules (53), together with the fact that Bot is empty, guarantee that no individual satisfies both A and Ā. The translation from C to C∗ completes our claim.\nNext, we show that (i) implies (ii). Let I be a model of T . We extend I to become a model J of CircF (KB) such that DJ 6⊆ BadJ , because DJ 6= ∅ and BadJ = ∅. For each A, set ĀJ = ∆I \\ AI and UJA = ∅. Then, set DJ = (D′)J = ∆J = ∆I and Bot\nJ = BadJ = ∅. It is easy to verify that J satisfies all CIs of KB. It remains to prove that J is minimal w.r.t. <F .\nSince Bot is a fixed concept, inclusions (53)–(55) ensure that A, Ā and UA are mutually exclusive, for all concepts A. Hence, each DI of type (56)–(58) can only be improved at the expenses of another DI of incomparable priority, which does not count as an improvement according to <F . DI (61) cannot be improved because Bot is empty and fixed. Finally, suppose one tries to improve one of the DIs of type (60). To do so, at least one individual x must enter the concept UA. Due to the mutual exclusion property described earlier, x needs to exit from A (resp. Ā), thus violating DI (56) (resp., (57)), which has a higher priority than (60) due to (59).\nThe equivalence between (i) and (iii) can be proved along similar lines. Just notice that the fact (64) makes Bad(a) equivalent to the inclusion D v Bad . The thesis for Circfix is obtained as a consequence of Theorem 4.4. 2\nConcept consistency is simpler, instead. Call an interpretation I complete iff for all A ∈ NC, AI = ∆I , and for all P ∈ NR, P I = ∆I ×∆I . It is not hard to verify that all EL concepts and all EL inclusions (both classical and defeasible) are satisfied by all x ∈ ∆I , therefore complete models are always models of CircF (KB), for all DKBs KB and all F ⊆ NC. As a consequence we have that concept consistency is trivial:\nTheorem 7.6 For all EL concepts C, DKBs KB, and F ⊆ NC, C is satisfied by some model of CircF (KB).\n7.1 Left Local EL⊥ and Circvar In this subsection and in the next one, we prove that qualified existentials in the left-hand side of inclusions are responsible for the higher complexity of EL⊥ w.r.t. DL-liteR. In particular, qualified existentials in the left-hand side make the proof strategy of Lemma 6.7 fail: when the target of an edge which starts in x is redirected, the individual x may satisfy a qualified existential restriction that it did not satisfy before. If so, the truth value of inclusions may be affected. By limiting the occurrences of qualified existential restrictions in the left-hand side of inclusions, it is possible to reduce significantly the complexity of instance checking and subsumption in circumscribed EL⊥. Figure 3 summarizes the syntactic fragments of EL⊥ that we consider. We start with the following class of knowledge bases:\nDefinition 7.7 A defeasible knowledge base 〈K,≺〉 is in the full left local (LLf ) fragment of EL⊥ iff the left-hand sides of the inclusions of K contain no qualified existential restrictions.\nNote that this restriction rules out all the acyclic terminologies containing a qualified existential restriction, and hence most of the existing ontologies of practical interest. Therefore, we introduce the following relaxation of LLf EL⊥:\nDefinition 7.8 An EL⊥ knowledge base KB = 〈K,≺〉 is almost LL (aLL for short) iff (i) K = KLL∪Ka , (ii) KLL is in LLf , (iii) Ka is a classical acyclic terminology, and (iv) if a concept name A defined in Ka occurs in the left-hand side of an inclusion in KLL , then A does not depend (in Ka) on any qualified existential restriction.\nIn other words, by unfolding KLL with respect to Ka, we obtain a LLf knowledge base.\nExample 7.9 Example 3.1 can be reformulated in aLL EL⊥:\nHuman vn ∃has lhs heart ; ∃has lhs heart u ∃has rhs heart v ⊥ ; Situs Inversus ≡ Human u ∃has rhs heart .\nHere KLL consists of the first two axioms and Ka consists of the third axiom. Note that, in general, a concept nameA occurring in a terminology T can be extended with default properties by means of an inclusion A vn C in the following cases: A can be a primitive concept (with no definition in T ), or a concept partially defined by a one-way inclusion (e.g. Human v Mammal), or even a concept with a complete definition A ≡ D in T , provided that A does not depend on any qualified existentials. Accordingly, in this example, we could add a defeasible inclusion like Situs Inversus vn C, that would not be permitted if the definition of situs inversus depended on qualified existential restrictions as in\nSitus Inversus ≡ Human u ∃has heart. ∃has position. Right . 2\nA small model property similar to Lemma 6.7 can be proved for Circvar(aLL EL⊥) provided that the right-hand side of subsumption queries has bounded quantifier depth. It is convenient to split the proof into a proof for LLfEL⊥ and later extend it to aLL EL⊥ .\nSince in LLfEL⊥ the RHS of an inclusion may have nested qualified existential restrictions, it is difficult to prove the small model property when considering the entire language. For this reason, we prove it indirectly: first we show how to transform a knowledge base KB into another KB∗ that yields the following properties: (i) no nested formulas occur, (ii) defeasible inclusions are only of type A vn B, (iii) every model I ∈ Circvar(KB) can be extended to a model of Circvar(KB∗) on the same domain and (iv) every model of Circvar(KB∗) is a model of Circvar(KB). Then, we prove a small model property for the fragment with no nesting and, thanks to properties (iii) and (iv), we recover the small model property for the entire language.\nEach LLfEL⊥ inclusion C v[n] D is transformed in three steps. Note that C’s shape is:\nA1 u . . . uAn u ∃R1 u . . . u ∃Rm .\nIn the first step, C is replaced by a fresh concept name F0 (for convenience, we later refer to F0 also as FC) and the following axioms are added:\nFi v Ai+1 u . . . uAn u ∃R1 u . . . u ∃Rm (0 ≤ i ≤ n− 1) (65) Ai+1 u Fi+1 v Fi (0 ≤ i ≤ n− 2) (66)\nif m = 0, i.e., there are no existentials in C, add the inclusion:\nAn v Fn−1 (67)\nOtherwise, add the following inclusions:\nAn uG0 v Fn−1 (68) Gj v ∃Rj+1 u . . . u ∃Rm (0 ≤ j ≤ m− 1) (69)\nBj+1 uGj+1 v Gj (0 ≤ j ≤ m− 2) (70) Bm v Gm−1 (71) Bj v ∃Rj (1 ≤ j ≤ m) (72) ∃Rj v Bj (1 ≤ j ≤ m) (73)\nwhere the Fi, Gj and Bj are fresh concept names. At this point, the initial inclusion C v[n] D can be replaced by FC v[n] D. To eliminate the nesting in D, in the second step we replace it with a fresh concept name FD and add the inclusion FD v D∗, where ·∗ is recursively defined as\nA∗ = A (74)\n(C uD)∗ = C∗ uD∗ (75) (∃R.H)∗ = ∃R.FH and add FH v H∗, where FH is fresh. (76)\nFinally, in the third step, all inclusions of type A v D1 u . . . u Dh are split into A v Di, 1 ≤ i ≤ h. The resulting knowledge base, that we denote with KB∗, consists of instances of the following axiom schemata:\nA v[n] B A v ∃P.B A1 uA2 v B ∃P v B\nNow we prove the properties (iii) and (iv) mentioned above.\nLemma 7.10 Every model of Circvar(KB) can be extended to a model of Circvar(KB∗) on the same domain.\nProof. First, note that inclusions (65)–(73) are definitorial, that is every interpretation I of KB has exactly one extension that satisfies them. This extension, for simplicity we continue to call it I, is obtained by setting F Ii = (Ai+1 u . . . u An u ∃R1 u . . . u ∃Rm)I , GIj = (∃Rj+1 u . . . u ∃Rm)I and BIj = (∃Rj)I . Then, we can extend I by recursively setting F IH = HI , for each fresh concept FH introduced in step 2. It is straightforward to see by structural induction on H that (H∗)I = HI , and hence all inclusions in step 2 and 3 are satisfied. Thus, if I is a classical model of KB, then it is also a classical model of KB∗.\nAssume now that I is a model of Circvar(KB), we have to show that I is minimal also with respect to KB∗. Suppose not, and let J be a classical model of KB∗ such that J <KB∗,var I. By structural induction it is straightforward to see that for all C v[n] D in KB, (D∗)J ⊆ DJ . Since FJC = C\nJ holds for all fresh concept names FC occurring in the LHS of a rule, we have that for each inclusion C v[n] D in KB, satJ (FC v[n] FD) ⊆ satJ (C v[n] D) — which implies that J\nis a classical model of KB. Concerning I, for every C v[n] D in KB, we have (FC)I = CI and (FD)\nI = DI by construction, that is satI(C v[n] D) = satI(FC v[n] FD). The previous arguments entail that if satI(FC v[n] FD) ⊆ satJ (FC v[n] FD) (respectively satI(FC v[n] FD) ⊂ satJ (FC v[n] FD)), then satI(C v[n] D) ⊆ satJ (C v[n] D) (resp. satI(C v[n] D) ⊂ satJ (C v[n] D)). Therefore, it would follow that J <KB,var I, which contradicts the hypothesis. 2\nLemma 7.11 All models of Circvar(KB∗) are models of Circvar(KB).\nProof. The proof is similar to Lemma 7.10, in particular we already know that (i) if an individual satisfies an inclusion FC v[n] FD inKB∗, then it satisfies C v[n] D, and (ii) a classical model J of KB can be extended in such a way that satJ (C v[n] D) = satJ (FC v[n] FD), for each (possibly defeasible) inclusion in KB. From this, we have that every classical model of KB∗ is a classical model of KB and, by assuming that some classical model J of KB improves I (i.e. J <KB,var I), it follows that J can be extended into a classical model of KB∗ such that J <KB∗,var I. 2\nThe following result, whose proof can be found in the Appendix, represents a small model property for LLfEL⊥, which uses the above transformation of KB into KB∗.\nLemma 7.12 LetKB = 〈K,≺K〉 be an LLfEL⊥ knowledge base, and C,D be EL⊥ concepts. For all models I ∈ Circvar(KB) and for all x ∈ CI \\DI there exists a model J ∈ Circvar(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ CJ \\DJ , and (iii) |∆J | isO((|KB|2+|C|)d), where d = depth(D)+1.\nNow we have to extend the above result to aLL EL⊥ . First, we show under which conditions the concept names defined in Ka can be removed by unfolding them, using the unf operator defined in Section 2. The proofs of the following two propositions can be found in the Appendix.\nProposition 7.13 Let KB = 〈KLL ∪ Ka,≺〉 be an aLL EL⊥ knowledge base. Every model of CircF (unf(KB)) can be extended to a model of CircF (KB).\nThe converse holds only if defined predicates are variable. The reason is that by adding a definition like A ≡ ∃P where A is fixed, one fixes the expression ∃P , too, thereby changing its semantics.\nProposition 7.14 Let KB = 〈KLL ∪ Ka,≺〉 be an aLL EL⊥ knowledge base and suppose that all the concept names defined in Ka are variable. Then, for all models I of CircF (KB), the restriction of I to primitive predicates is a model of CircF (unf(KB)).\nWith these lemmata we can prove:\nLemma 7.15 Let KB = 〈K,≺K〉 be an aLL EL⊥ knowledge base (where K = Ka ∪ KLL) and let C,D be EL⊥ concepts. For all models I ∈ Circvar(KB) and for all x ∈ CI \\ DI there exists a model J ∈ Circvar(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ CJ \\ DJ , and (iii) |∆J | is O((|KB|2 + |C|)d), where d = depth(D) + 1 + |Ka|2.\nProof. Let I ∈ Circvar(KB) and x ∈ CI \\DI . Let KB′ = unf(KB), C ′ = unf(C,Ka), and D′ = unf(D,Ka). Notice that KB′ is a LLf knowledge base. By Proposition 7.14, the restriction I ′ of I to primitive predicates is a model of Circvar(KB′). In particular, it holds that x ∈ (C ′)I\n′ \\(D′)I′ . By applying Lemma 7.12 toKB′, C ′, D′, and I ′, we obtain that there exists a model J of Circvar(KB′) such that x ∈ (C ′)J \\(D′)J and |∆J | isO((|KB′|2 + |C ′|)d′), where d′ = depth(D′)+1. We have |KB′|2 + |C ′| ≤ |KB|2 + |C|, since replacing defined terms with their definitions can only decrease the total number of subformulas. Finally, depth(D′) ≤ depth(D) + ∑ (A≡E)∈Ka depth(E) ≤ depth(D) + |Ka|2, hence the thesis. 2\nConsequently we have that:\nTheorem 7.16 In Circvar(aLL EL⊥) concept satisfiability is in Σp2. Moreover, deciding EL⊥ subsumptions C v D or instance checking problems D(a) with a constant bound on the quantifier depth of D’s unfolding w.r.t. the given DKB is in Πp2.\nProof. Similar to the proof of Theorem 6.2. 2\nCurrently, we do not know whether the bound on quantifier nesting is necessary to the above upper complexity bounds.\nNext we prove that the Σp2 and Π p 2 upper bounds for Circvar are tight. Actually, a much simpler\nfragment suffices to reach that complexity:\nDefinition 7.17 An EL⊥ knowledge base is left local (LL) if its concept inclusions are instances of the following schemata:\nA v[n] ∃P.B A1 uA2 v B ∃P v B ∃P1 v ∃P2.B ,\nwhere A and B are either concept names or ⊥. An LL EL⊥ concept is any concept that can occur in the above inclusions.\nSchema A v[n] B can be emulated in LL EL⊥ by the inclusions A v[n] ∃R, ∃R v B and B v ∃R, for a fresh role R. Note the similarity of LL schemata with the normal form of EL inclusions (Baader et al., 2005) that, however, would allow the more general inclusions ∃P.A v B and ∃P1.A v ∃P2.B (that are forbidden by left locality).\nNow we prove that reasoning in Circvar(LL EL⊥) is hard (and hence complete) for Σp2 and Π p 2.\nFor this purpose, we provide a reduction of minimal entailment over positive, propositional disjunctive logic programs (PDLP), defined in Section 6.1. For each propositional variable pi, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, introduce two concept names Pi and P̄i – where the latter encodes ¬pi. In the following we will denote by Lj , 1 ≤ j ≤ 2n, a generic Pi or P̄i. For each clause cj ∈ S introduce a concept name Cj . Then, two other concept names True and False represent the set of true and false literals respectively. Finally, the concept names Lit and Min are used to model minimal propositional assignments; we need also an auxiliary role R.\nFirst, literals are reified, i.e. modeled as individuals, with the axioms:\n> v ∃R.Li (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (77) Li u Lj v ⊥ (1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2n) (78)\nLi vn ⊥ (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (79)\nThe first axiom makes all Li nonempty. Axioms (78) make them pairwise disjoint. Finally, axioms (79) minimize the concepts Li and make them singletons. Then, we represent S by adding for each clause cj = lj1 ∨ · · · ∨ ljh, 1 ≤ j ≤ m, the axioms\nLji v Cj (1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ i ≤ h) (80) Cj vn ⊥ (1 ≤ j ≤ m) (81)\n> v ∃R.(Cj u True) (1 ≤ j ≤ m) (82)\nBy axioms (80) and (81), Cj equals the set of (encodings of) literals in cj . Axioms (82) make sure that each clause holds.\nIn order to model the concepts True and False and the correct meaning of complementary literals we add the axioms\nTrue u False v ⊥ (83) Pi u True v ∃R.(P̄i u False) (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (84) Pi u False v ∃R.(P̄i u True) (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (85) P̄i u True v ∃R.(Pi u False) (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (86) P̄i u False v ∃R.(Pi u True) (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (87)\nThe axioms defined so far encode the classical semantics of S. To minimize models, add the following axioms:\nMin u Pi v False (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (88) Min u P̄i v True (1 ≤ i ≤ n) (89)\nLi v Lit (1 ≤ i ≤ 2n) (90) Cj v Lit (1 ≤ j ≤ m) (91)\nLit vn Min (92)\nBy (88) and (89), Min collects false positive literals and true negative literals. By (90) and (91), Lit contains all the (representations of) literals and clauses. The purpose of these axioms is giving defeasible inclusions (79) and (81) higher (specificity-based) priority than (92), so that model minimization cannot cause any Li to be larger than a singleton, nor any Cj to be different from the set of literals of cj . Now (92) prefers those models where as many Pi as possible are in False .\nIn the following, given a PDLP S, let KBS be the Tbox defined above.\nLemma 7.18 Given a PDLP S, a literal l in S’s language, and the encoding L of l, the following are equivalent:\n(minimal entailment) S |=min l;\n(subsumption) Circvar(KBS) |= > v ∃R.(True u L);\n(co-sat) False u L is not satisfiable w.r.t Circvar(KBS);\n(instance checking) Circvar(KBS) |= (∃R.(True u L))(a).\nThis lemma can be proved by analogy with the proof of Lemma 6.5; the details are left to the reader. The conjunctions (u) nested in ∃ can be easily replaced with a new atom A by adding the equivalence A ≡ True u L, that can itself be encoded in LL EL⊥, so we have:\nTheorem 7.19 Subsumption and instance checking over Circvar(LL EL⊥) are Πp2-hard; concept satisfiability is Σp2-hard. These results hold even if the three reasoning tasks are restricted to LL EL⊥ concepts, and priorities are specificity-based.\n7.2 Left Local EL⊥ and Circfix By a reduction of the validity problem for quantified Boolean formula, we can show that Circfix(aLL EL⊥) is more complex than Circvar(aLL EL⊥), unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Computing the truth of a quantified Boolean formula\nψ = Q1p1 . . . Qnpn.ϕ\n(where the Qi’s are quantifiers) can be reduced in polynomial time to subsumption checking in Circfix(aLL EL⊥) as follows. Introduce concept names A0, . . . , An, Ti and Fi for i = 1 . . . n, and concept names Eji for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Introduce role names R, bad , good , and Ui for i = 1 . . . n.\nWe define a aLLEL⊥ knowledge base 〈K,≺K〉, where K = KLL ∪Ka. The left-local part KLL consists of the following groups of axioms. Notice that, in the following description, i is always an arbitrary index in {1, . . . , n}. First, we encode the negation normal form ϕ̄ of ¬ϕ. Let Bpi = Ti and B¬pi = Fi. For all subformulas F ∧G of ϕ̄ introduce a new concept name BF∧G and add the inclusion BF uBG v BF∧G. For all subformulas F ∨G of ϕ̄ introduce a new concept name BF∨G and add the inclusions BF v BF∨G and BG v BF∨G.\nThe second group of axioms of KLL constrains Ti and Fi to avoid inconsistencies. Intuitively ∃Ui means “pi is undefined”:\nTi u Fi v ⊥ (93) Ti u ∃Ui v ⊥ (94)\nFi u ∃Ui v ⊥ (95)\nThe third group of axioms of KLL defines a tree that encodes the truth assignments needed to evaluate the QBF:\nfor all i 6= j Ai uAj v ⊥ (96) for all i s.t. Qi = ∀ Ai−1 v ∃R.(Ti uAi) u ∃R.(Fi uAi) (97) for all i s.t. Qi = ∃ Ai−1 v ∃R.Ai (98)\nThe fourth group of axioms of KLL detects misrepresentations by forcing role bad to point to the nodes of the evaluation tree where something is going wrong (i.e. the truth assignment is incomplete, or some predicate changes value along a branch, or ϕ is false in a leaf).\n> vn ∃bad .∃Ui (99) > vn ∃bad .Eji (100) > vn ∃bad .Êji (101) > vn ∃bad .(Bϕ̄ uAn) (102)\n(Eji and Ê j i are defined in Ka below). Finally, good captures the absence of bad :\n∃bad u ∃good v ⊥ . (103)\nThe acyclic terminology Ka has the only purpose of detecting whether some propositional symbol changes its value along a path:\nEji ≡ Aj−1 u Ti u ∃R.(Aj u Fi) (104) Êji ≡ Aj−1 u Fi u ∃R.(Aj u Ti) . (105)\nLemma 7.20 Let I be a model of Circfix(KB) that satisfies A0 u ∃good . For all i = 1 . . . n, all the individuals in ∆I are contained in either T Ii or F I i .\nProof. First, by contradiction, assume that for some i = 1 . . . n and x ∈ ∆Ii , x is neither in F Ii nor in T Ii . Since axioms (93)-(95) do not prevent x from satisfying ∃Ui and I must be minimal w.r.t. axiom (99), then the entire domain ∆I satisfies ∃bad .∃Ui. However, by axiom (103), this means that A0 u ∃good is unsatisfiable against the hypothesis. 2\nLemma 7.21 Let I be a model of Circfix(KB) that satisfies A0 u ∃good . If for some i = 1 . . . n, xi ∈ (Ai uTi)I (respectively, x ∈ (Ai uFi)I), then all paths {xi, xi+1, . . . , xn} such that xj ∈ Aj and (xj−1, xj) ∈ RI , where i < j ≤ n, are contained in T Ii (resp., y ∈ F Ii ).\nProof. Assume that xi ∈ (AiuTi)I and {xi, xi+1, . . . , xn} 6⊆ T Ii . This means that xi 6= xn and for some i < j ≤ n, xj−1 ∈ (Aj−1 u Ti)I and xj ∈ (Aj−1 u Fi)I . Then, by axiom (104), xj−1 ∈ Eji and since I must be minimal w.r.t. axiom (100) the entire domain ∆I satisfies ∃bad .Eji . However, by axiom (103), this means that A0 u ∃good is unsatisfiable against the hypothesis. 2\nTheorem 7.22 Concept satisfiability, subsumption checking, and instance checking are PSPACEhard in Circfix(aLL EL⊥). The result still holds if the nesting level of existential restrictions is bounded by a constant, and the priority relation is empty.\nProof. In order to prove the theorem it suffices to show that the QBF ψ is true iff A0 u ∃good is satisfiable w.r.t. the above KB. [if ] Let I be a model of Circfix(KB) that satisfies A0 u ∃good . Due to axioms (96)-(98), I must contain a DAG that starts with x (which is in (A0 u∃good)I) and, following the R-edges, proceeds through the concepts Ai of increasing index, up to An. In this DAG, for all i = 1 . . . n such that Qi = ∀, individuals belonging to a AIi have two successors: one in AIi+1 ∩ T Ii+1 and the other in AIi+1 ∩ F Ii+1. Individuals in AIi , where Qi = ∃, have only one successor, in AIi+1. Due to Lemma 7.20, such a successor is either in T Ii+1 or F I i+1.\nNow, consider any truth assignment v to the universally quantified variables of ψ. In the DAG, follow the unique path from x to a leaf z ∈ AIn, that for each level i corresponding to a Qi = ∀ proceeds withAIi+1∩T Ii+1 orAIi+1∩F Ii+1 in accordance with v. By Lemma 7.20, for all i = 1 . . . n z is in either Ti or Fi, moreover, by Lemma 7.21, membership of z in Ti or Fi is consistent with v. Therefore, z represents a full truth assignment of the variables in ψ which extends v.\nNow, since I minimizes the set of abnormal individuals w.r.t. the defeasible inclusion (99) and in all models ∃good and ∃bad are disjoint, x ∈ ∃goodI implies that z 6∈ BIϕ̄. But then, it is straightforward to conclude that this truth assignment satisfies ϕ.\n[only if ]. Assume that ψ is true. Assume w.l.o.g. that odd quantifiersQ1, Q3, . . . , Qn−1 are universal and even quantifiers are existential. For each existential quantifier Qi, let fi : {T, F}i/2 → {T, F} be the function such that for all values v1, v3, . . . , vn−1 of the universally quantified variables, ϕ(v1, f2(v1), v3, f4(v1, v3), . . . , fn(v1, v3, . . . , vn−1)) is true.\nWe define a tree-like model I of KB that satisfies A0 u ∃good . We start with a root individual x, such that x |=I A0 u ∃good . We proceed inductively as follows. For even i (including 0), each individual y ∈ AIi has two R-successors y′, y′′ ∈ AIi+1, such that y′ ∈ T Ii and y′′ ∈ F Ii (see axioms (97)). For odd i, each individual y ∈ AIi has one R-successor y′ ∈ AIi+1 (see axioms (98)), such that y′ satisfies either Ti or Fi, according to the value of fi when applied to the truth values that can be read along the path from the root to y. Along each R − path x0 . . . xi . . . xn the same concept Ti or Fi assigned to xi is assigned to all xj , with i < j ≤ n, and indifferently either Ti or Fi is assigned to the xh with 1 ≤ h ≤ i. The model is completed by assigning to xn (i) BF∧G, for all subformulas F ∧G of ϕ̄, such that F and G are assigned to xn, and (ii) BF∨G, for all subformulas F ∨G of ϕ̄, such that F or G are assigned to xn.\nWe leave to the reader the proof that the structure just defined satisfies the classical part of KB. Regarding minimality w.r.t. the defeasible inclusions in KB, we remark the following. All the individuals violate inclusions (99). However, due to rules (94) and (95), the situation cannot be improved by simply modifying the roles. Similarly, all the individuals violate inclusions (100)- (101). However, since the Eji are all empty these defeasible inclusions cannot be improved.\nFinally, since each leaf z ∈ An represents a truth assignment that satisfies φ, then Bϕ̄ is empty and hence our model is also minimal w.r.t. the inclusion (102). 2\nThe LL fragment of EL⊥, unlike LLf , does not fully support unqualified existential. Consequently, Theorem 4.4 cannot by used to transfer the hardness results of Theorem 7.19 from var to fix.9 The above hardness results hold only for the more general framework Circvar(LLf EL⊥) and hence, by Theorem 4.4,for Circfix(LLf EL⊥):\nProposition 7.23 Subsumption and instance checking over Circfix(LLf EL⊥) are Πp2-hard; concept satisfiability is Σp2-hard. These results hold even if queries contain only LL EL⊥ concepts, and priorities are specificity-based.\nThe following result, whose proof can be found in the Appendix, shows a context in which the above lower bounds are tight: namely, the case in which the priority relation is empty (i.e., DIs are mutually incomparable) and, for subsumption queries C v D or instance checking queries D(a), the quantifier depth of D is bounded by a constant.\nLemma 7.24 LetKB = 〈KS∪KD, ∅〉 be an LLfEL⊥ knowledge base, andC,D be EL⊥ concepts. For all models I ∈ Circfix(KB) and for all x ∈ CI \\DI there exists a model J ∈ Circfix(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ CJ \\DJ (iii) |∆J | is O((|KB|+ |C|)d) where d = depth(D).\nGoing back to the LL fragment, in the following we prove that Circfix is less complex than Circvar (unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses). In particular, we show that Circfix(LLEL⊥) is tractable. Algorithm 1 takes as input a knowledge base KB and two concepts C and D (we may assume without loss of generality that C = AC u dn i=1 ∃Pi.Bi) and checks whether Circfix(KB) |= C v D.\n9. We will prove below that in LL EL⊥, Circfix is actually less complex than Circvar.\nAlgorithm 1: Data: C = AC u dn 1 ∃Pi.Bi, D, KB = 〈K,≺〉.\nA := {A vn ∃P.B | C |= A}; X := C; while A 6= ∅ do\nremove from A a defeasible inclusion A vn ∃P.B; if SupCls(∃P.B) ⊆ SupCls(C) and NonEmpty(∃P.B,KS) ⊆ NonEmpty(C,KS) then\nX := X u ∃P.B; return X vKS D;\nWith SupCls(H) we mean the set of superclasses of a concept H , i.e., the set of B ∈ NC ∪ {⊥} such that H vKS B.\nGiven a concept H , the operator NonEmpty(H,KS) represents the set of concepts that are forced to be non empty whenever H is. Note that this set includes some concepts that are forced to be non empty by the ABox in KB, independently from H . We write H ; A iff H vKS ∃R.A for some R, and we denote by +; the transitive closure of ;. Then, NonEmpty(H,KS) is formally defined as follows:\nNE Kernel = {H} ∪ ⋃ a∈NI{A | KS |= A(a)} ∪ ⋃ a∈NI,R∈NR{A | KS |= (∃R.A)(a)}\nNonEmpty(H,KS) = ⋃ A∈NE Kernel{A′ | A + ; A′}.\nRoughly speaking, the algorithm accumulates the RHS of defeasible inclusions actively satisfied by a witness of C. Then, it tries to derive D. In particular, a defeasible inclusion A vn ∃R.B is actively satisfied just in the case (i) does not entail locally ⊥ or a concept name not subsumed by C, and (ii) does not entail globally the non-emptiness of a concept name that should be empty. The rationale is that concept names are fixed and circumscription cannot change their extension as the application of A vn ∃R.B could instead require.\nLemma 7.25 Circfix(KB) |= C v D holds iff Algorithm 1 returns true.\nProof. [if ] It suffices to show that for all models of Circfix(KB), X subsumes C, where X is the formula obtained after the while statement. Assume per absurdum that for some model I and an individual x ∈ ∆I , x ∈ CI \\XI . This means that for some defeasible inclusionA ⊆n ∃P.B (i) x 6∈ satI(A ⊆n ∃P.B) and (ii) from line 1, SupCls(∃P.B) ⊆ SupCls(C) and NonEmpty(∃P.B,KS) ⊆ NonEmpty(C,KS).\nNote that, since NonEmpty(∃P.B,KS) ⊆ NonEmpty(C,KS), whenever ∃R.B vKS ∃S.B̄ there exists an individual yB̄ ∈ B̄I . Let I ′ be the interpretation obtained from I by adding all such (x, yB̄). Clearly, by adding new arcs the set of individuals that satisfied a defeasible inclusion δ cannot decrease, therefore for all δ ∈ KD, satI(δ) ⊆ satI′(δ). Moreover, since x ∈ (∃R.B)I ′ , satI(A ⊆n ∃P.B) ⊂ satI′(A ⊆n ∃P.B) and hence I ′ <fix I. From condition (ii) and the fact that defeasible inclusions do not conflict with each other, it is easy to verify that I ′ is also a classical model of KB, but this would mean that I is not a model of Circfix(KB) against the hypothesis.\n[only if ] Assume that Algorithm 1 returns false. Let I be the following interpretation:\n• ∆I = {xC} ∪ {xA | A ∈ NonEmpty(C,KS)} ∪ {xa | a ∈ NI};\n• for all B ∈ NC, BI is the union of: (i) {xC} if B ∈ S1, (ii) the set of xA, with A ∈ S2, such that A |=KS B, and (iii) the set of xa, with a ∈ NI, such that KS |= B(a);\n• for all R ∈ NR, RI is the union of the pairs (i) (xA, xB) where A,B ∈ S2 and A vKS ∃R.B, (ii) (xa, xb) where a, b ∈ NI and KS |= R(a, b), (iii) (xa, xB) where a ∈ NI, B ∈ S2 and KS |= ∃R.B(a), (iv) (xC , xB) where B ∈ S2 and X vKS ∃R.B; other arcs are not relevant.\nBy construction I is a (classical) model of KS and xC ∈ CI \\ DI , hence in order to prove I ∈ Circfix(KB) it remains to show that I is minimal. Note that, since defeasible inclusions do not contain nested roles on the right side, the set of defeasible inclusions satisfied by an individual does not affect the set of defeasible inclusions satisfied by another individual. Therefore, an interpretation can be improved point-wise and we can assume w.l.o.g. that all the individuals in I, except xC , cannot be further improved. Assume now that there exists an interpretation J that improves I in xC , this means in particular that for some δ = A vn ∃P.B, xC ∈ satJ (δ) \\ satI(δ).\nThe assumption xC 6∈ satI(δ) means that ∃P.B does not satisfy the condition in line 1 and, since concept names are fixed, δ cannot be satisfied in J . 2\nTheorem 7.26 In Circfix(LL EL⊥) DKBs, LL EL⊥ subsumption, instance checking, and concept consistency are in P.\nProof. Since SupCls(H) and NonEmpty(H,KS) are based on classical reasoning, they can be performed in polynomial time. Moreover, the number of iterations in Algorithm 1 is bounded by the number of defeasible inclusions. Therefore, due to Lemma 7.25, the subsumption problem is tractable. By Theorem 3.9, instance checking and concept inconsistency can be reduced to subsumption. 2\nComplexity is low under Circfix because in this context LL axioms are not general enough to simulate quantifier nesting nor conjunctions of existential restrictions. In Circvar these features can be simulated by abbreviating compound concepts C with concept names A using equivalences A ≡ C such that C does not depend on qualified existentials (hence the LL restriction is preserved). With Circfix, such equivalences change the semantics of C whenever C is (or contains) an existential restriction, because A is fixed and prevents C from varying freely. As we reintroduce the missing features, complexity increases again.\nLet LL2EL⊥ support the schemata: A v[n] ∃P.B ∃P1 u ∃P2 v ∃P3.B ∃P v B\nOne may easily verify that LL2EL⊥ is equivalent to LL EL⊥ plus schema ∃P1 u ∃P2 v ∃P3.B. The missing axioms can be reformulated using fresh roles R and suitable equivalences ∃R ≡ C (that preserve C’s semantics because R is a varying predicate)10.\nWith these additional schemata, one can create conflicts between variable concepts, as in ∃P1 u ∃P2 v ⊥. Then different defeasible inclusions may block each other, thereby creating a potentially exponential search space.\nTheorem 7.27 Subsumption and instance checking over Circfix(LL2EL⊥) are coNP-hard; concept satisfiability is NP-hard. These results hold even if the three reasoning tasks are restricted to LL2EL⊥ concepts, and priorities are specificity-based. 10. In particular, schema A1uA2 v B can be emulated by the inclusions A1 v ∃R1, A2 v ∃R2, B v ∃R3, ∃R1 v A1, ∃R2 v A2, ∃R3 v B, and ∃R1 u ∃R2 v ∃R3.\nProof. By reduction of SAT. For each propositional variable pi introduce the concept names Ai, Āi, and role Ui, representing pi’s truth value (resp. true, false, and undefined). These alternatives are made mutually inconsistent with:\nAi u Āi v ⊥ Ai u ∃Ui v ⊥ Āi u ∃Ui v ⊥\nFor each given clause cj = lj,1 ∨ · · · ∨ lj,n, introduce a concept name C̄j representing cj’s falsity, and for each L̄j,k representing the complement of lj,k add L̄j,1 u · · · u L̄j,n v C̄j .\nDefine a concept name F̄ representing the falsity of the given set of clauses, and a disjoint concept F with:\nC̄j v F̄ (for all input clauses cj) F̄ u F v ⊥ .\nNow, with a defeasible inclusion, ∃Ui is forced to be true for all individuals that satisfy neither Ai nor Āi; moreover, a role U detects undefined literals:\n> vn ∃Ui ∃Ui v ∃U .\nLet K be the above set of inclusions and KB = 〈K,≺K〉. It can be proved that the given set of clauses S is unsatisfiable iff Circfix(KB) |= F v ∃U , therefore subsumption checking is coNPhard.\nSimilarly, it can be proved that S is unsatisfiable iff Circfix(KB′) |= (∃U)(a), where KB′ = 〈K′,≺K′〉 and K′ = K ∪ {F (a)}; therefore instance checking is coNP-hard.\nFinally, it can be proved that S is satisfiable iff F u∃OK is satisfiable w.r.t. Circfix(KB′′), where KB′′ = 〈K′′,≺K′′〉 and K′′ = K∪ {∃U u ∃OK v ⊥}; therefore satisfiability checking is NP-hard.\nWe are only left to remark that K can be easily encoded in LL2EL⊥. 2\nWe prove that this bound is tight using Algorithm 2. The algorithm non-deterministically looks for an individual x (in some model) that satisfies C and not D. S1 guesses any additional fixed concept names satisfied by x; S2 guesses the concept names that are satisfied somewhere in the model (not necessarily by x) and finally ≺′ guesses a total extension of ≺ that determines the application order of GDIs.\nSimilarly to Algorithm 1, Algorithm 2 selects the defeasible inclusions that are active in x and accumulates in the formula X the RHS of those that are not blocked, i.e. do not require to change the interpretation of the concept names neither locally nor globally. The major differences are that (i) defeasible inclusions are extracted according to ≺′ and (ii) in line 2 the entire accumulated formula X u ∃P.B is used to check that a defeasible inclusion is not blocked.\nFinally, note that the variable part of C (i.e. dn i=1 ∃Pi.Bi) is introduced in X only in line 8, after all defeasible inclusions have been applied, because defeasible inclusions can influence the variable part (e.g. by forcing it to be empty).\nLemma 7.28 Circfix(KB) |= C v D holds iff all the runs of Algorithm 2 return true.\nProof. [if ] Assume per absurdum that there exists an interpretation I ∈ Circfix(KB) and an individual x ∈ ∆I such that x ∈ CI \\ DI . Let S1 and S2 be the set of concept names in NC that I satisfies respectively locally in x and globally – i.e., for some individual. Let≺′ be a linearization of ≺ compatible with I, i.e. for all δ, δ′ ∈ KD (i) either δ ≺′ δ′ or δ′ ≺′ δ, (ii) δ ≺ δ′ implies δ ≺′ δ′, (iii) if δ and δ′ are not comparable according to ≺ (δ 6≺ δ′ and δ′ 6≺ δ) and x ∈ satI(δ) \\ satI(δ′), then δ ≺′ δ′.\nAlgorithm 2: Data: C = AC u dn 1 ∃Pi.Bi, D, KB = 〈K,≺〉.\nGuess S1, S2 ⊆ NC, where uS1 |= AC and S1 ⊆ S2, and a linearization ≺′ of ≺; A := {A vn ∃P.B | uS1 |= A}; X := d S1; while A 6= ∅ do remove from A the ≺′-minimal inclusion A vn ∃P.B; if SupCls(X u ∃P.B) ⊆ S1 and NonEmpty(X u ∃P.B,KS) ⊆ S2 then\nX := X u ∃P.B;\nX := X u dn\n1 ∃Pi.Bi; return SupCls(X) 6⊆ S1 or NonEmpty(X,KS) 6⊆ S2 or X vKS D;\nLet X be the result of running Algorithm 2 on guesses S1, S2, and ≺′. It is straightforward to see that for all δ = A vn ∃P.B ∈ KD such that ∃P.B occurs in X, x ∈ satI(δ). This, together with the fact that x ∈ CI , implies that 1) SupCls(X) ⊆ S1; 2) NonEmpty(X,KS) ⊆ S2 and, since x 6∈ DI , 3) X 6vKS D. But this means that on this run Algorithm 2 should return false.\n[only if ] Assume that for some guess of S1, S2 and ≺′ Algorithm 2 returns false. Let I be defined as in Lemma 7.25. In a similar way it can be proved that I is a classical model of KS and xC ∈ CI \\DI . Assume now that I is improved by an interpretation J , w.l.o.g. we can also assume that (i) for some δ = A vn ∃P.B, xC ∈ satJ (δ) \\ satI(δ) and (ii) for all δ′ with higher priority than δ or not comparable with it, we have xC ∈ satJ (δ′) iff xC ∈ satI(δ′).\nIf X′ is the value of X when δ is extracted on line 2 of Algorithm 2, since δ′ ≺ δ implies δ′ ≺′ δ, all the δ′ already extracted have higher priority or are not comparable with δ. Since (ii) holds and by construction xC ∈ X′I , xC ∈ X′J . However, the assumption xC 6∈ satI(δ) means that X′ u ∃P.B does not satisfy the condition in line 2 and since concept names are fixed δ cannot be satisfied in J .\n2\nTheorem 7.29 LL2EL⊥ subsumption and instance checking over Circfix(LL2EL⊥) are in coNP; LL2EL⊥ concept satisfiability is in NP.\nProof. It is analogous to Theorem 7.26 and left to the reader. 2\nIt can be verified that the LL2 fragment does not support quantifier nesting. With quantifier nesting, one would obtain LLf EL⊥ (i.e. full LL)."

An articulated comparison of these approaches can be found in the work of Bonatti, Lutz, and Wolter (2009).\nMost of these approaches concern logics whose reasoning tasks’ complexity lies beyond PH (unless the hierarchy collapses). For example, the logics considered by Donini et al. (1997, 2002) range from PSPACE to 3-ExpTime. The circumscribed DLs studied by Cadoli et al. (1990) as well\nas Bonatti et al. (2009) range from NPNExp to NExpNP. Some logics are undecidable (Baader & Hollunder, 1995a; Bonatti et al., 2009).\nA pioneering approach to low-complexity, circumscribed description logics was presented by Cadoli et al. (1990). That approach applies non-prioritized circumscription to a fragment of the description logic ALE . Decidability of reasoning is shown by a reduction to propositional reasoning under the Extended Closed World Assumption (ECWA), which is in Πp2. To the best of our knowledge, that was the first effective reasoning method for a nonmonotonic description logic.\nA hybrid of Circfix(EL⊥) and closed world assumption has been proved to be in PTIME (Bonatti et al., 2010). On the one hand, that approach imposes less restrictions on the structure of inclusions; on the other hand, it cannot be fully extended to variable predicates without affecting tractability.\nA recent approach that is similar in spirit to circumscription has been taken by Giordano et al. (2008). They extend ALC with a modal operator T representing typicality, and maximize T ’s extension to achieve nonmonotonic inferences. Decidability is proved via a tableau algorithm that also establishes a co-NExpTimeNP upper bound for subsumption. No matching lower bounds are given; it is proved that reasoning in the underlying monotonic logic is NP-hard.\nFinally, an approach based on rational closures andALC can be found in the work of Casini and Straccia (2010). An appealing feature of this approach is that reasoning can be reduced to classical inference. Complexity is not increased by nonmonotonic reasoning: it ranges from PSPACE to ExpTime."

However, the general case is still an open question.\nOn the contrary, restricting the language to EL or EL⊥ does not in general suffice to bring complexity within PH.

DL-liteR) has been identified by introducing a further restriction called full left locality (LLf ) that suffices to confine complexity within the second level of PH under Circvar with specificity-based priorities, provided that the quantifier nesting level in subsumption queries and instance checking queries is suitably bounded (no restrictions are needed on concept satisfiability).\nSince the left locality restriction rules out acyclic terminologies (which are commonly used in ontologies), it has been relaxed to almost left local (aLL) knowledge bases, that support acyclic terminologies with the restriction that unfolding (i.e., the process of replacing the atoms defined in the acyclic terminology with their definition) should yield a LLf knowledge base. Reasoning becomes PSPACE-hard, in general; however in the aLL fragment of Circvar (and under the same assumptions needed for LLf ), reasoning remains complete for the second level of PH. In particular, the assumption that the priorities are determined by specificity is essential: By Theorem 4.5, general priorities make Circvar at least as complex as Circfix, that is, PSPACE-hard.\nWe have also analyzed the complexity of several fragments lying between LL and aLL under Circfix. These results provide some further information about the complexity sources in circumscribed DLs. For example, quantifier nesting in the KB is partially responsible for complexity (presumably because it enables conflicts between the default properties of different individuals): in particular, by removing quantifier nesting (i.e., by restricting KBs to the LL2 fragment) complexity drops to the first level of PH. The other source of complexity, of course, is due to the conflicts between defeasible inclusions concerning each individual in isolation; in Circfix(LLEL⊥) a defeasible inclusion can never block another inclusion (because fixed predicates prevent this) and—as a consequence—complexity drops within PTIME.\nWe have also proved that in all fragments that fully support unqualified existential restrictions, variable concept names can be eliminated. Moreover, in EL⊥ and its various left local fragments, compound concepts can be replaced with concept names in the left-hand side of defeasible inclusions, without affecting expressiveness. In the same fragments, general priorities can be simulated using only specificity-based priorities.\nWe have to leave several interesting questions open: First, it is not clear whether general priorities are necessary to the hardness results for DL-liteR; in particular, it would be interesting to establish the exact complexity of DL-liteR with specificity-based priorities. Other gaps in the complexity of circumscribed DL-liteR concern the complexity of Circfix with unrestricted GDIs or nonempty priority relations, and the complexity of reasoning with fixed roles. The next interesting question is whether the bound on quantifier nesting in the queries is actually needed to confine complexity of circumscribed EL⊥ within the second level of PH. Finally, there is no exact charcterization of the complexity of Circfix(LLf EL⊥) and of the fragments whose complexity lies beyond PH.\nFor the fragments that do belong to the second level of PH, we see an interesting opportunity of encoding reasoning in ASP and use some well-engineered engine such as DLV (Eiter, Leone, Mateis, Pfeifer, & Scarcello, 1997) to test scalability. In order to evaluate implementations experimentally, it is necessary to set up suitable benchmarks that, in a first stage, must necessarily be\nsynthetic problems, since nonmonotonic KBs have not been supported so far. Of course, identifying meaningful criteria for problem generation is a nontrivial issue. Therefore, systematic experimental evaluations still require a significant body of work."

Given a PDLP S over PV = {p1, . . . , pn} and a truth assignment I ⊆ PV , I is a minimal model of S iff the interpretation model(S, I,∆) is a model of Circvar(KBS), for all domains ∆ with |∆| = 2n+ 1.\nProof. [only if ] Let I = model(S, I,∆), we first show that I is a model of the classical part of KBS . Since I-V, the Abox (18) and all axioms (20-24) are satisfied. Whereas, axioms (33-36) follow directly from VII.\nSince I is an interpretation, VI assures that if TrueP I 6= ∅, then FalseP̄ I 6= ∅. Together with VIII, axioms (31-32) are satisfied, whereas together with VII, True and False reflect in I the truth values of I; therefore TrueI ∩ FalseI = ∅ and hence axiom (30) is satisfied. Moreover, as I is a model of S, for each c ∈ S there exists at least one literal li occurring in c such that I |= li. Due to V-VII, CIj ∩ TrueI 6= ∅ and, due to VII and VIII (where X = True and Y = Cj), I satisfies axioms (26-29).\nIt remains to prove that there exists no interpretation J such that J <var I. As ∆I is finite, we can assume w.l.o.g. that J is a model of KBS . Assume that for some 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, satI(Li vn ¬Li) ⊂ satJ (Li vn ¬Li), this is equivalent to saying that LJi ⊂ LIi , but since LIi is a singleton, LJi would be empty contradicting axioms (18-23). Similarly, satI(Cj vn ¬Cj) ⊂ satJ (Cj vn ¬Cj) iff CJj ⊂ CIj . Thus, due to V some axiom Lji v Cj would not be satisfied in J . Therefore the defeasible inclusions with highest priority cannot be improved.\nNow assume that for each literal and clause concept it holds LJi = L I i = {di} and C J j = C I j . Since I reflects the truth values of I , all the di’s that are not included in FalseLIi are included in TrueLIi . Thus, if for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, satI(Pi vn FalsePi) were equal to satJ (Pi vn FalsePi) then there would be no way for J to improve a defeasible inclusion Pi vn TruePi. Therefore, the only possibility so far is that J improves some instance of (40).\nNote that TrueJ and FalseJ are a partition of ⋃ i P J i . Otherwise, we could set a P J i without truth value (i.e., di 6∈ TruePJi ∪FalseP J i ) to FalsePi — since no classical inclusion is jeopardized we would obtain an improvement of J according to (40), against the hypothesis that J is a model. Due to (31-36), TrueJ and FalseJ are a partition of all {d1, . . . , d2n}.\nThus, we can consider the propositional assignment J such that pi ∈ J iff PJi ⊆ TrueJ . First, for all clauses cj , since J satisfies axioms (26-29), for some 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n we have\nLJi ⊆ C J j ∩TrueJ . As L J i = L I i and C J j = C I j , ljl occurs in cj . But this means that J |= li, and\nhence J |= cj . Thus, J is a model of S. Finally, as said before, if J <var I, then the intersection of⋃ i P I i and False I is strictly contained in the intersection of ⋃ i P J i and False\nJ . This implies that J ⊂ I , against the hypothesis that I is a minimal model.\n[if ] Assume that I = model(S, I,∆) is a model of Circvar(KBS). First we show that I is a model of S, i.e., for all cj ∈ S, I |= cj . As I satisfies axioms (26-29), for some 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n it holds di ∈ CIj ∩ TrueI . Due to IV and V, di belongs to some LIi such that the corresponding literal li occurs in cj . According to VI, this implies that I |= li, and hence I |= cj .\nIt remains to show that I is a minimal model. Assume that there exists a model J of S such that J ⊂ I , without loss of generality we can assume that J is minimal model. Let J = model(S, J,∆), from the above arguments J is a model of KBS . Furthermore, satJ (δ) = satI(δ) for each δ of type Li vn ¬Li or Cj vn ¬Cj . Finally, as TrueJ and FalseJ reflect the truth values of J ,⋃ i P I i ∩ FalseI ⊂ ⋃ i P J i ∩ FalseJ and hence J <var I due to the improvement of DIs (40). 2\nLemma 6.4. If I is a model of Circvar(KBS), then there exist a minimal model I of S such that pi ∈ I iff P Ii ⊆ TrueI iff P̄ Ii ⊆ FalseI , for all i = 1, . . . , n.\nProof. Let I be a model of Circvar(KBS). First, we show that LIi is a singleton, for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n. Assume the contrary. Clearly, to satisfy (18–21), each LIi has to be nonempty. Therefore, for some 1 ≤ k ≤ n, LIk contains at least two individuals. We will show that there exists an interpretation I ′ that improves I.\nFor all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, let di be an arbitrary element of LIi , and let ∆ = {d1, . . . , d2n} ∪ {aI}. As the LIi are disjoint with each other (see axioms (22)) and NonEmpty\nI is disjoint with any LIi , we have |∆| = 2n+ 1.\nAll PDLP are satisfiable, thus there exists a model Î of S. Let Î = model(S, Î,∆). Let I ′ be an interpretation such that: (i) ∆I ′ = ∆I , (ii) for all roles R, RI ′ = ∆I × ∆I , (iii) I ′ coincides with Î on ∆ with respect to all concept names, and (iv) all the other individuals d ∈ ∆I \\∆ do not belong to any concept name. It is straightforward to see that I ′ satisfies the classical part of KBS . Furthermore, by construction, (a) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n, LI′i ⊆ LIi ; (b) for all 1 ≤ j ≤ m, CI ′ j ⊆ CIj ; (c) for some 1 ≤ l ≤ 2n, LI′l ⊂ LIl . Thus, I ′ <var I, due to the improvement of DI (23). By the above argument, we have LIi = {di}. Define the truth valuation I = {pi | di ∈ TrueI}. It remains to prove that I is a minimal model of S. The fact that I is a model of S is ensured by axioms (24–29). Then, assume by contradiction that there exists a model J of S that is smaller than I (i.e., J ⊂ I), and let J = model(S, J,∆). From J we can build an interpretation J ′ with ∆J ′ = ∆I and such that J ′ is a classical model of KBS and J ′ <var I, thus contradicting the hypothesis that I is a model of Circvar(KBS). We define J ′ by copying from J all the properties (concepts and roles) of the individuals in ∆J = ∆, and by leaving all the individuals in ∆I \\∆ out of concept and role extensions. 2\nA.2 Proofs for Section 7\nGiven a KB K, an interpretation I, and an individual z, recall the definition of KB[z] from Section 6.2. Redefine the notion of “support” as follows: supp I(C) is the set of individuals z ∈ ∆I such that > vKB[z] C holds.\nLemma 7.12. LetKB = 〈K,≺K〉 be an LLfEL⊥ knowledge base, and C,D be EL⊥ concepts. For all models I ∈ Circvar(KB) and for all x ∈ CI \\DI there exists a model J ∈ Circvar(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ CJ \\DJ , and (iii) |∆J | isO((|KB|2+|C|)d), where d = depth(D)+1.\nProof. Given two individuals x and y in ∆I , the distance d(x, y) is the minimal length of role-paths from x to y. Let KB∗ be the knowledge base obtained from KB by applying the transformation presented in Section 7. Notice that |KB∗| ≤ |KB|2.\nBy Lemma 7.10, I can be extended into a model of Circvar(KB∗), which we continue to call I for convenience. We define a small model J of Circvar(KB∗) such that x ∈ CJ \\ DJ . Then, we obtain the thesis by Lemma 7.11.\nWe start from an initial domain ∆J that contains (i) x; (ii) all aI , where a ∈ NI occurs in KB∗; (iii) for all concepts H ∈ cl(KB∗) ∪ cl(C) such that HI 6= ∅, a witness yH ∈ HI ; (iv) for all concepts H ∈ cl(KB∗) ∪ cl(C) such that supp I(H) 6= ∅, a witness wH ∈ supp I(H).\nWe expand J by exhaustively applying the following rule (where ∃P is a special case of ∃P.H with H = >):\nLet y ∈ ∆J and ∃P.H ∈ cl(KB∗) ∪ cl(C) be such that y ∈ (∃P.H)I and y 6∈ (∃P.H)J . If d(x, y) < d, then add z to ∆J and (y, z) to PJ , where z is such that (y, z) ∈ P I and z ∈ HI . Otherwise, add (y, yH) to PJ .\nFinally, for each concept name A, set AJ = ∆J ∩AI . With respect to the cardinality of ∆J , note that initially the number of individuals in ∆J is O(|KB∗|+ |C|). During the expansion, for each individual whose distance from x is less than d, at most O(|KB∗| + |C|) new individuals are added. This means that |∆J | = O((|KB∗| + |C|)d) = O((|KB|2 + |C|)d).\nBy construction for each individual y ∈ ∆J andH ∈ cl(KB∗)∪cl(C) if y ∈ HI , then y ∈ HJ . In particular, in caseH = ∃P , also the inverse holds, if y ∈ ∃PJ , then y ∈ ∃P I . From the previous two facts it immediately follows that J is a classical model of KB∗ and x ∈ CJ . Moreover, since up to a distance d from x, PJ is contained in P I , for all P ∈ NR, it is easy to see that x 6∈ DJ .\nIt remains to show that J is minimal. Assume by contradiction that for some classical model J ′ of KB∗, it holds J ′ <var J , we show that there exists a classical model I ′ of KB∗ such that I ′ <var I — against the hypothesis that I ∈ Circvar(KB∗).\nWe distinguish two cases: in the first cas, all individualswH introduced in clause (iv) still satisfy the corresponding concept H in J ′; in the second case, at least one wH does not satisfy its concept H . We define I ′ as follows. In both cases, individual names are interpreted as in I and concept names for individuals in ∆J are interpreted as in J ′.\nIn the first case, an individual z ∈ ∆I \\∆J satisfies a concept name A, that is z ∈ AI′ , if and only if z ∈ supp I(A). Moreover, for each P ∈ NR, P I ′ is the minimal set such that:\n1. PJ ′ ⊆ P I′ ;\n2. if z ∈ ∆I \\∆J and z ∈ supp I(∃P.H), and y ∈ HJ ′ then (z, y) ∈ P I′ .\nWe prove that I ′ is a classical model of KB∗. Since I ′ is a copy of J ′ over ∆J and J ′ is a classical model, we only need to show that the individuals z ∈ ∆I \\ ∆J satisfy all the strong inclusions in KS. Note that if z satisfies in I ′ the LHS H of a strong inclusion, then z supports H in I. By definition, z supports also the RHS in I. If the RHS is a concept name B, then z ∈ BI′ by construction. Otherwise, i.e., if the RHS is ∃P.H , by step 2 above, it suffices to show that HJ ′\nis not empty. However, by assumption, the witness of ∃P.H introduced in clause (iv) still satisfies ∃P.H in J ′. Therefore, there exists an individual y satisfying H in J ′.\nNext, we prove that I ′ <var I. Since J ′ <var J , it suffices to show that an individual z ∈ ∆I\\∆J satisfies in I ′ all the defeasible inclusions it satisfies in I. Assume that a DI δ = (A vn B)\nis satisfied by z in I. If z ∈ AI′ , then by construction z ∈ supp I(A). Clearly, if z ∈ supp I(A) and z ∈ satI(A vn B), then z ∈ supp I(B). Therefore, z ∈ BI ′ .\nWe are left to prove the theorem for the second case, i.e.: at least one wH does not satisfy its concept H . Clearly, wH does not support H in J ′ anymore. In particular, there must be a DI δ such that wH ∈ satJ (δ) \\ satJ ′(δ). From J ′ <var J , it follows that there must be a DI δ′ such that δ′ ≺K δ and satJ (δ′) ⊂ satJ ′(δ′). Now, in I ′ we can safely violate all DIs whose priority is lower than δ′, and in particular all DIs whose LHS classically subsumes >. Then, complete the definition of I ′ as follows. Each basic concept A holds in an individual z ∈ ∆I \\∆J if and only if> vKS A. For each P ∈ NR, P I ′ is the minimal set such that\n1. PJ ′ ⊆ P I′ ;\n2. if z ∈ ∆I \\∆J , > vKS ∃P.H , and y ∈ HJ ′ then (z, y) ∈ P I′ .\nIt is easy to verify that I ′ is a classical model of KB∗. In order to prove that I ′ <var I, note that the following two facts hold.\nFirst, an individual z ∈ ∆I \\∆J satisfies all the DIs whose priority is not minimal. Assume that δ1 ≺K δ2, for some DIs δ1 and δ2, this means that the LHS of δ2 subsumes the LHS of δ1 but not the vice versa. Then, the LHS of δ1 does not subsume > and hence, by construction, z vacuously satisfies δ1.\nSecond, if z violates a DI δ′′ = (A vn B), then δ′ ≺K δ′′. As before, since δ′ ≺K δ, its LHS does not subsume >. However, since z violates δ′′, z ∈ AI′ and hence A subsumes >. Therefore, δ′ ≺K δ′′.\nFrom the first fact it immediately follows that satI(δ′) ⊂ satI′(δ′). Assume now, that for some δ′′, satI(δ′′) 6⊆ satI′(δ′′). If there exists an individual z ∈ ∆I \\ ∆J such that z ∈ satI(δ′′) \\ satI′(δ\n′′), then by the second fact δ′ ≺K δ′′. Otherwise, there must exist an individual w ∈ ∆J such that w ∈ satI(δ′′) \\ satI′(δ′′). However, in ∆J the set of DIs that an individual satisfies in I (resp. I ′) is the same set of DIs it satisfies in J (resp. J ′). This means that there exists a defeasible inclusion δ′′′ such that δ′′′ ≺K δ′′ and satJ (δ′′′) ⊂ satJ ′(δ′′′). Due to the first fact, δ′′′ is satisfied in all ∆I \\∆J , and hence satI(δ′′′) ⊂ satI′(δ′′′). 2\nProposition 7.13. Let KB = 〈KLL ∪ Ka,≺〉 be an aLL EL⊥ knowledge base. Every model of CircF (unf(KB)) can be extended to a model of CircF (KB).\nProof. Let Kunf = unf(KB) = 〈K′,≺′〉. Let I be any model of CircF (Kunf). Extend it to a classical model J of K′ ∪ Ka by setting AJ = DJ for all definitions A ≡ D in Ka. Note that K′ ∪ Ka is classically equivalent to KLL ∪ Ka. Now suppose that J is not a model of CircF (KB). Since by construction J is a classical model of Ka and the strong axioms of KLL, there must be a classical model J ′ of the same axioms such that J ′ <F J . By restricting J ′ to primitive predicates (i.e., predicates that are not defined in Ka), we obtain a classical model I ′ of K′. Note that for all defeasible inclusions δ ∈ KLL, it holds satJ ′(δ) = satJ ′(unf(δ,Ka)) = satI′(unf(δ,Ka)) and satJ (δ) = satJ (unf(δ,Ka)) = satI(unf(δ,Ka)). It follows that I ′ <F I, a contradiction. 2\nProposition 7.14. Let KB = 〈KLL ∪ Ka,≺〉 be an aLL EL⊥ knowledge base and suppose that all the concept names defined in Ka are variable. Then, for all models I of CircF (KB), the restriction of I to primitive predicates is a model of CircF (unf(KB)).\nProof. Let Kunf = unf(KB) = 〈K′,≺′〉. Let J be the restriction of I to primitive predicates. In other words, J is obtained from I by dropping the interpretation of all concept names defined in Ka, which are all variable. It can be easily verified that J is a classical model of K′. Suppose by contradiction that J is not a model of CircF (Kunf); then there exists a classical model J ′ of K′ such that J ′ <F J . Now extend J ′ to a model I ′ of KLL ∪ Ka by setting AI ′ = DI ′ for all definitions A ≡ D in Ka. Since the predicates defined in Ka are variable, all fixed predicates preserve their extensions across I, J , J ′, and I ′. Moreover, for all defeasible inclusions δ ∈ KLL, we have satI′(δ) = satI′(unf(δ,Ka)) = satJ ′(unf(δ,Ka)) and satI(δ) = satI(unf(δ,Ka)) = satJ (unf(δ,Ka)). It follows that I ′ <F I, a contradiction. 2\nGiven a knowledge base KB, an interpretation I and a concept D, again we have to override the notion of support; supp I(D) is the set of z ∈ ∆I such that( l\nz∈AI A ) vKB[z] D .\nClearly, if I is a classical model of KB and z ∈ supp I(D), then z ∈ DI .\nLemma 7.24. LetKB = 〈KS∪KD, ∅〉 be an LLfEL⊥ knowledge base, andC,D be EL⊥ concepts. For all models I ∈ Circfix(KB) and for all x ∈ CI \\DI there exists a model J ∈ Circfix(KB) such that (i) ∆J ⊆ ∆I , (ii) x ∈ CJ \\DJ (iii) |∆J | is O((|KB|+ |C|)d) where d = depth(D).\nProof. Define the “small” model J as in the proof of Lemma 7.12, using the new definition of support. Regarding the size of J and the fact that it is a classical model of KB, the same arguments as in the proof of Lemma 7.12 apply. In particular, it holds |∆J | = O((|KB|+ |C|)d).\nIt remains to show that J is<fix-minimal. Assume by contradiction that for some interpretation J ′, it holds J ′ <fix J ; as usual, we show that there exists I ′, such that I ′ <fix I. Let I ′ be defined as follows: ∆I ′ = ∆I ; aI ′ = aI , for all a ∈ NI; AI ′ = AI , for all A ∈ NC; P I ′ is the minimal set such that:\n• PJ ′ ⊆ P I′ , and\n• for all z ∈ ∆I′ \\ ∆J ′ , for all y ∈ ∆J ′ and for all ∃P.H ∈ cl(KB) such that z ∈ supp I(∃P.H), if y ∈ HI ′ , then (z, y) ∈ P I′ (∃P can be seen as a special case where\nH = >).\nFirst, we prove that I ′ is a classical model of KB. In particular, it suffices to show that classical inclusions are satisfied in ∆I\n′ \\ ∆J ′ . Given a classical inclusion C1 v D1 of KB, assume that z ∈ CI′1 , and recall that C1 is of the type\nA1 u . . . uAn u ∃R1 u . . . u ∃Rm.\nIt suffices to show that there exists an individual w ∈ ∆J ′ that satisfies C1 as well. By construction, for all ∃R occurring in C1, z ∈ supp I(∃R), therefore z ∈ supp I(C1). This means that there exists a witness w ∈ supp I(C1) in ∆J . Since for each concept E, w ∈ EI implies w ∈ EJ , it follows that w ∈ supp J (C1). Since the priority relation is empty, for each DI δ in KD it holds satJ (δ) ⊆ satJ ′(δ). As a consequence, for each concept E it holds supp J (E) ⊆ supp J ′(E). In\nparticular, w ∈ supp J ′(C1) and hence w ∈ CJ ′ 1 and w ∈ D J ′ 1 . By construction, we obtain that z ∈ DI′1 . It remains to prove that I ′ improves I according to <fix. Let δ = (C1 vn D1) be a defeasible inclusion in KB. Since J ′ <fix J , it suffices to prove that for all z ∈ ∆I ′ \\ ∆J ′ , if z ∈ satI(δ) then z ∈ satI′(δ). Suppose first that z vacuously satisfies δ in I (i.e., it violates C1). Atomic concepts have the same extension in I and I ′, and z satisfies an unqualified existential in I ′ only if it satisfies the same existential in I. Hence, z vacuously satisfies δ in I ′ as well.\nSuppose instead that z actively satisfies δ in I. If z 6∈ supp I(C1), then z 6∈ CI ′\n1 , and so z vacuously satisfies δ in I ′. Otherwise, z ∈ supp I(C1) and z ∈ supp I(D1). By construction, there is a witness w ∈ ∆J ′ such that w ∈ supp J (D1) ⊆ supp J ′(D1). This implies that w ∈ DJ ′\n1 and, considering the construction of P I\n′ , z ∈ DJ ′1 . Therefore, z ∈ satJ ′(δ) and we obtain the thesis. 2"

Nonmonotonic description logics have been studied for many years, however no practical such knowledge representation languages exist, due to a combination of semantic difficulties and high computational complexity. Independently, low-complexity description logics such as DL-lite and EL have been introduced and incorporated in the OWL standard. Therefore, it is interesting to see whether the syntactic restrictions characterizing DL-lite and EL bring computational benefits to their nonmonotonic versions, too. In this paper we extensively investigate the computational complexity of Circumscription when knowledge bases are formulated in DL-liteR, EL, and fragments thereof. We identify fragments whose complexity ranges from P to the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, as well as fragments whose complexity raises to PSPACE and beyond.",
