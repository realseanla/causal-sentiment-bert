These data consist of page images taken from the Bentham collection, a well-known transScriptorium project dataset.\nOur neural networks have basically been used previously in the international handwriting competition OpenHaRT 2013 attached to the ICDAR 2013 conference, see [LLS13]. Moreover, with a system very similar to the one presented here, the CITlab team also took part in ICFHR’s ANWRESH-2014 competition on historical data tables, see [LGSL14] for the according system description.\nAffiliated with the Institute of Mathematics at the University of Rostock, CITlab3 hosts joint projects of the Mathematical Optimization Group and PLANET intelligent systems GmbH4, a small/medium enterprise focusing on computational intelligence technology and applications. The work presented here is part of a common text recognition project 2014 – 2016 and is extensively based upon PLANET’s ARGUS software modules and the respective framework for development, testing and training."

      "text" : "We worked on line polygon images, see 2.4.1 for further explanation of the data. Firstly it were applied certain standard preprocessing routines, i.e.\n• image normalization: contrast, size; • writing normalization: line bends, line slope, script slant.\nThen, images were further unified by CITlab’s proprietary writing normalization, thus ensuring a fixed 96px image height with the writing’s main body part appropriately placed into and stretched to cover the essential central part of the line image. These were finally the input images for the subsequent processing with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)."

      "heading" : "2.3.1 Recurrent Neural Network",
      "text" : "The resulting line images were fed into the engine’s first core component which we call a Sequence Processing Recurrent Neural Network (SPRNN). Note that we processed entire line images with no further segmentation.\nThe SPRNN’s output then consists of a certain number of vectors. This number is related to the line length because every vector contains information about a particular image position. More precisely, the entries are understood as to estimate the probabilities of every alphabet character at the position under consideration. Hence, the vector lengths all equal the alphabet size, and putting all vectors together leads to the so-called confidence matrix. This is the intrinsic recognition result which will subsequently be used for the decoding.\nNote further that, for HTRtS-2015, we worked with the alphabet containing\n• all digits, lowercase and uppercase letters of the standard latin alphabet • special characters /&£§+-\\_.,:;!?’\"=[]() and ␣, whereby different types of quotation\nmarks and hyphens were mapped to one of the respective symbols.\nFinally, the above alphabet is augmented by an artificial, non-character symbol, which we denote by NaC. In particular, it may be used to detect character boundaries because, generally speaking, our SPRNNs emit high NaC confidences in uncertain situations.\nCITlab only participates in the Restricted Track of HTRtS-2015, i.e. for training and testing our systems, we exclusively used data provided within the contest:"

Using proprietary CITlab tools we extracted 3 968 more line polygons, s.t. altogether, trn-2 finally contained 14 479 training samples.\nNote in particular, that from the data provided in HTRtS-2015, we did not use the line images itself because those covered more distortions between adjacent text lines."

      "heading" : "2.4.2 Network Training",
      "text" : "In both training schemes, various networks have been trained similarly: The number of training epochs slightly varied between 50 and 60, and the decrease of the learning rates was chosen correspondingly. Moreover, different tries differ in certain hyper-parameters (number of neurons, subsampling rate) and random choices of the initial values for weights that were then optimized by gradient descent procedures.\nOut of a larger number of tries, finally 10 networks have been chosen by monitoring the training success on a validation data set which, due to the lack of separate data, was selected from the available training data, see 2.4.1. Note that the same approach has been used for ranking the 10 final nets in order to choose the best and certain committees, see 2.5 for details."

      "heading" : "2.5 Decoding Schemes",
      "text" : "2.5.1 Dec-BP: Best Path decoding\nFor decoding the confidence matrix, one starts with the sequence of the most confident character per matrix vector. But in order to get a proper character string over the given alphabet, then two basic transformations have to be applied:\n1. Replace repeated occurrences of the same character by just one! 2. Delete all NaC symbols!\nserves for distinguishing between proper character repetition vs. just repeatedly seeing the same character while traversing the line image.\nNote also that these operations are commonly applied in all decoding schemes! Thus in the following, we know how to proceed from a character sequence from (or path through) the confidence matrix to a valid string interpretation as a required recognition result.\n2.5.2 Dec-CE: CITlab Expression decoding\nThe details of this decoding developed at CITlab will be presented in upcoming publications. Basically it tries to find the most confident string subject to additional restrictions on the internal structure of valid result strings. In HTRtS-2015, the decoded string should be build from expressions which, e.g., look like usual words, have punctuation marks attached to word expressions, have sentences beginning with capital letters . . . But note particularly, that this decoding scheme only considers expression syntax – it does not yet incorporate a dictionary!\n2.5.3 Dec-DM: Dictionary Model decoding\nAt this next stage, we include a rather simple language model into the decoding scheme: We try to find the most confident string transcription which belongs to a dictionary. Moreover, besides the string confidences from the recognition result itself, also word frequencies are taken into consideration. For HTRtS-2015, the dictionary with word frequencies was extracted from the available training data.\n2.5.4 Dec-E<n>: n Experts Committee decoding\nThe above Dec-DM scheme is further extended by simultaneously processing the network output of n different SPRNNs. These were choosen by descending recognition quality on the validation dataset, see 2.4.2. For coming to the committee decision, we followed the algorithm proposed in [Fis97]. In HTRtS-2015, we submitted four systems with this decoding scheme type, namely for n ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5}."
