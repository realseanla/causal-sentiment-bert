      "text" : "Recent decades have seen a number of nonmonotonic reasoning (NMR) formalisms advanced (see e.g. (Brewka, Niemelä, and Truszczyński 2007) for an overview). Since preferences are ubiquitous in commonsense reasoning, there has been a considerable effort to integrate preference information within NMR formalisms (cf. e.g. (Brewka, Truszczyński, and Niemelä 2008; Delgrande et al. 2004; Domshlak et al. 2011; Kaci 2011)). To evaluate distinct formalisms, various properties of both non-monotonic inference and preference handling have been proposed, see e.g. (Makinson 1988; Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990; Brewka and Eiter 1999; Brewka, Truszczyński, and Woltran 2010; Šimko 2014).\nMeanwhile, argumentation (as overviewed in (Rahwan and Simari 2009)) has become an established branch of AI widely used for NMR (see e.g. (Dung 1995; Bondarenko et al. 1997; Modgil and Prakken 2013)). Broadly speaking, information in argumentation is represented via arguments, while attacks among them indicate conflicts. Procedures, known as argumentation semantics, are employed to select extensions, i.e. sets of collectively acceptable arguments. Preferences in argumentation also play a significant role (cf. e.g. (Simari and Loui 1992; Kaci 2011)), by allowing to, for instance, discriminate among arguments or extensions. Over the years, numerous formalisms of argumentation with preferences have been presented (see Section 7) and some properties for argumentation with preferences indicated (e.g. (Brewka, Truszczyński, and Woltran 2010; Modgil and Prakken 2013; Amgoud and Vesic 2014; Dung 2016)).\nNMR properties are also adaptable to argumentation setting. For example, the well known nonmonotonic inference properties of Cautious Monotonicity and Cumulative Transitivity (cf. (Makinson 1988; Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990)) concern what happens when a conclusion reached through a reasoning process is added to the knowledge base to reason with anew. These properties have been cast with respect to extensions in argumentation, in e.g. (Čyras and Toni 2015; Dung 2016).\nPreference handling properties for NMR can be phrased in terms of extensions in argumentation too. For instance, the well known Principle I from (Brewka and Eiter 1999) regarding preferred answer sets can be applied to argumentation semantics thus: if two extensions E1 and E2 coincide except for two arguments A ∈ E1 \\ E2 and B ∈ E2 \\ E1 such that A is preferred over B, then E2 should not be chosen as a ‘preferable’ extension. Likewise, a common property of NMR says that, in the absence of preference information, a formalism extended with a preference handling mechanism should return the same extensions as the preference-free version of the formalism (see e.g. (Brewka, Truszczyński, and Woltran 2010; Šimko 2014)).\nIn this paper, drawing from the above mentioned works, we investigate various properties of a recently proposed NMR formalism ABA+ (Čyras and Toni 2016). ABA+ extends with a preference handling mechanism a well established argumentation formalism, AssumptionBased Argumentation (ABA) (Bondarenko et al. 1997; Toni 2014). Whereas a common way to approach preferences in argumentation is to use preference information to discard the attacks from arguments that are less preferred than the ones they attack (see e.g. (Amgoud and Cayrol 2002; Bench-Capon 2003; Kaci and van der Torre 2008; Brewka et al. 2013; Besnard et al. 2014)), ABA+ instead reverses such attacks. We show that ABA+’s method of accounting for preferences satisfies (arguably) desirable properties.\nOn the one hand, we consider preference handling properties from (Brewka and Eiter 1999; Brewka, Truszczyński, and Woltran 2010; Amgoud and Vesic 2014) and show their satisfaction under various ABA+ semantics. On the other hand, building on the investigations of Cumulative Transitivity and\nCautious Monotonicity for ABA (Čyras and Toni 2015), we analyse ABA+ in the light of these non-monotonic inference properties, and show that results obtained for ABA carry over to ABA+. In addition, we make use of the well known principle of Contraposition of rules (see e.g. (Modgil and Prakken 2013)) and prove it guarantees that ABA+ semantics satisfy desirable properties akin to those in e.g. (Dung 1995; Bondarenko et al. 1997; Modgil and Prakken 2013).\nThe paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 give preliminaries on ABA and ABA+. In Section 4 ABA+ semantics are analysed. Preference handling properties of ABA+ are studied in Section 5, while Section 6 concerns ABA+ and non-monotonic inference properties. After discussing related work (Section 7), we conclude in Section 8."

      "heading" : "2 Preliminaries",
      "text" : "We base the following ABA background on (Toni 2014).\nDefinition 1. An ABA framework is a tuple (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄), where: • (L,R) is a deductive system with a language L and a set R of rules of the form ϕ0 ← ϕ1, . . . , ϕm with m > 0 and ϕi ∈ L for i ∈ {0, . . . ,m}; ϕ0 is referred to as the head of the rule, and ϕ1, . . . , ϕm is referred to as the body of the rule; if m = 0, then the rule ϕ0 ← ϕ1, . . . , ϕm is written as ϕ0 ← ⊤ and is said to have an empty body; • A ⊆ L is a non-empty set, whose elements are referred to as assumptions; • ¯̄̄ : A → L is a total map: for α ∈ A, the L-formula α is referred to as the contrary of α.\nWe focus on flat ABA frameworks, where no assumption is the head of any rule. Flat ABA frameworks are very common, and capture, as instances, widely used paradigms of non-monotonic reasoning, such as Logic Programming and Default Logic (see e.g. (Bondarenko et al. 1997)).\nDefinition 2. A deduction for ϕ ∈ L supported by S ⊆ L andR ⊆ R, denoted by S ⊢R ϕ, is a finite tree with the root labelled by ϕ, leaves labelled by ⊤ or elements from S, the children of non-leaf nodes ψ labelled by the elements of the body of some rule from R with head ψ, and R being the set of all such rules. For E ⊆ L, the conclusions Cn(E) of E is the set of elements with deductions supported by S ⊆ E and some R ⊆ R, i.e. Cn(E) = {ϕ ∈ L : ∃ S ⊢R ϕ, S ⊆ E, R ⊆ R}.\nAssumption-level attacks in ABA are defined thus.\nDefinition 3. A set A ⊆ A attacks a set B ⊆ A, denoted A B, if there is a deduction A′ ⊢R β, for some β ∈ B, supported by some A′ ⊆ A and R ⊆ R. For E ⊆ A, also called an extension, we say that: • E is conflict-free if E 6 E; • E defendsα ∈ A if for allB {α} it holds thatE B; • E is admissible if E is conflict-free and defends all α ∈ E.\nThe most standard ABA semantics are as follows.\nDefinition 4. A conflict-free set E ⊆ A is: • stable, if E {β} for every {β} ⊆ A \\ E;\n• complete if E is admissible and contains every assumption it defends; • preferred if E is ⊆-maximally admissible; • grounded if E is ⊆-minimally complete; • ideal if E is ⊆-maximal such that E is admissible and\ncontained in all preferred extensions.\nExample 5. Let L = {α, β, α, β}, R = {α ← β} and A = {α, β}. In (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄), {β} attacks both {α} and {α, β}, while {α, β} attacks itself and {α}. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ) can be graphically represented via its assumption framework, pictured below (in illustrations of assumption frameworks, nodes hold sets of assumptions while directed edges indicate attacks):\n∅ {α} {β} {α, β}\nThis (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄) has a unique complete extension {β}, which is also grounded, ideal, preferred and stable, and has conclusions Cn({β}) = {α, β}.\n3 ABA+\nABA+ (Čyras and Toni 2016) extends ABA with preferences as follows.\nDefinition 6. An ABA+ framework is any tuple (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), where (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄) is an ABA framework and 6 is a preorder (i.e. a transitive and reflexive binary relation) on A.\nDifferently from e.g. (Modgil and Prakken 2013; Modgil and Prakken 2014; Garcı́a and Simari 2014), ABA+ considers preferences on assumptions rather than (defeasible) rules. This is not, however, a conceptual difference, since assumptions are the only defeasible component in ABA+.\nUnless stated differently, we consider a fixed, but otherwise arbitrary ABA+ framework (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), and implicitly assume (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄) to be its underlying ABA framework. The strict counterpart < of 6 is defined as α < β iff α 6 β and β α, for any α and β.\nABA+ attack relation is given thus.\nDefinition 7. A set A ⊆ A of assumptions <-attacks a set B ⊆ A of assumptions, written as A < B, if: • either there is a deduction A′ ⊢R β, for some β ∈ B,\nsupported by A′ ⊆ A, and ∄α′ ∈ A′ with α′ < β; • or there is a deduction B′ ⊢R α, for some α ∈ A, sup-\nported by B′ ⊆ B, and ∃β′ ∈ B′ with β′ < α. The first type of attack is called normal, and the second one reverse.\nABA+ requires a standard ABA attack to be reversed whenever the attacker has an assumption less preferred than the one attacked. The following example illustrates.\nExample 8. Recall (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄) from Example 5. Suppose β < α. In the ABA+ framework (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), {β} ‘tries’ to attack {α}, but is prevented by the preference β < α. Instead, {α} <-attacks {β}, and likewise {α, β}, via reverse attack, and the latter <-attacks both itself and {β} via reverse attack. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) can be represented graphically\nas follows (reverse attacks in assumption frameworks will be denoted by dotted arrows):\n∅ {α} {β} {α, β}\nIn contrast with the ABA framework, where {β} is unattacked and generates an attack on {α}, in the ABA+ framework, {α} is <-unattacked and <-attacks all sets of assumptions that contain β. This concords with the intended meaning of the preference β < α, that the conflict should be resolved in favour of α.\nThis concept of <-attack reflects the interplay between deductions, contraries and preferences, by representing inherent conflicts among sets of assumptions while accounting for preference information. Normal attacks follow the standard notion of attack in ABA, additionally, preventing the attack to succeed when the attacker uses assumptions less preferred than the one attacked. Reverse attacks, meanwhile, resolve the conflict between two sets of assumptions by favouring the one containing an assumption whose contrary is deduced, over the one which uses less preferred assumptions to deduce that contrary.\nThe notions of conflict-freeness and defence w.r.t. <, and ABA+ semantics are given as follows.\nDefinition 9. For E ⊆ A we say that: • E is <-conflict-free if E 6 < E; • E <-defends α ∈ A if for all B < {α} it holds that E < B; and • E is <-admissible if E is <-conflict-free and <-defends every α ∈ E.\nIn Example 8, ∅, {α} and {β} are conflict-free in (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄) and<-conflict-free in (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), whereas {α, β} is not (<-)conflict-free in either framework.\nDefinition 10. A <-conflict-free extension E ⊆ A is: • <-stable if E < {α} for every {α} ⊆ A \\E; • <-complete if E is <-admissible and contains every as-\nsumption it <-defends; • <-preferred if E is ⊆-maximally<-admissible; • <-grounded if E is ⊆-minimally <-complete; • <-ideal if E is ⊆-maximal such that E is <-admissible\nand contained in all <-preferred extensions.\nIn Example 8, {α} is a unique <-stable, <-complete, <- preferred,<-grounded and <-ideal extension.\nHenceforth, we assume σ ∈ {stable, complete, preferred, grounded, ideal} and use <-σ to denote any ABA+ semantics.\nWe recall several features that ABA+ possesses and that will be used later.\nLemma 1. Let A′ ⊆ A ⊆ A and B′ ⊆ B ⊆ A be given. If A′ < B ′, then A < B.\nLemma 2. For any A,B ⊆ A: • if A B, then either A < B or B < A; • if A < B, then either A B or B A.\n4 Properties of ABA+ Semantics To ensure that the familiar relations between semantics carry from ABA over to ABA+, we want to guarantee the so-called Fundamental Lemma (Dung 1995; Bondarenko et al. 1997) (see below). To this end, we follow the well established structured argumentation formalism ASPIC+ (Modgil and Prakken 2013; Modgil and Prakken 2014) and impose the principle of Contraposition, reformulated for ABA+ as follows. Axiom 11. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition if for all A ⊆ A, R ⊆ R and β ∈ A it holds that if A ⊢R β, then for every α ∈ A, there is Rα ⊆ R with (A \\ {α}) ∪ {β} ⊢Rα α.\nThis axiom requires that if an assumption plays a role in deriving the contrary of another assumption, then it should contrapositively be possible for the latter to induce a derivation of the contrary of the former assumption too. The following example illustrates the effect Contraposition has in ABA+. Example 12. Let R = {β ← α, γ}, A = {α, β, γ} and α < β, α < γ. (The language and the contrary mapping are implicit from R and A.) This ABA+ framework (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) does not satisfy the Axiom of Contraposition. Its assumption framework (omitting ∅, A and<-attacks to and from A) is shown below:\n{α}\n{β}\n{γ}\n{α, β}\n{α, γ}\n{β, γ}\nThere are no extensions under, for instance, <-complete semantics, because all the singletons {α}, {β} and {γ} are <-unattacked, but {α, β, γ} is not <-conflict-free.\nIf the rules α ← β, γ and γ ← α, β are added to R to constitute R′, then the resulting (L,R′,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition and its assumption framework looks as follows (<-attacks that are both normal and reverse are depicted as solid directed edges):\n{α}\n{β}\n{γ}\n{α, β}\n{α, γ}\n{β, γ}\nHere, {β, γ} is a unique<-complete extension.\nWe prove next that in the presence of Contraposition, the Fundamental Lemma is guaranteed to hold in ABA+. Lemma 3. Suppose that (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition. Let S ⊆ A be <-admissible and assume that S <-defends α, α′ ∈ A. Then S ∪ {α} is <-admissible and <-defends α′.\nProof. Note that if α ∈ S, then S ∪ {α} is trivially <- admissible. So assume α 6∈ S and suppose for a contradiction that S ∪ {α} is not <-admissible. Then it is either not\n<-conflict-free, or does not <-defend itself. Suppose first S ∪ {α} < S ∪ {α} via either (1) normal or (2) reverse attack. We show that either leads to a contradiction.\n1. S ∪ {α} < S ∪ {α} via normal attack. As S is <- conflict-free and<-defendsα, this <-attack must involve α. I.e. S′ ∪ {α} ⊢R β for some S′ ⊆ S and β ∈ S ∪ {α}, and ∀s′ ∈ S′ ∪ {α} we find s′ 6< β. If β = α, then S′ ∪ {α} < {α}, and so S < S′ ∪ {α}. Else, if β ∈ S′, then S′ ∪ {α} < S, and so S < S′ ∪ {α} as well. We show that we can similarly obtain S < S′ ∪{α} in case (2) too.\n2. S∪{α} < S∪{α} via reverse attack. As in 1., this<attack must involve α, i.e. S′ ∪ {α} ⊢R β for some S′ ⊆ S and β ∈ S ∪ {α}, and ∃s′ ∈ S′ ∪ {α} such that s′ < β. If β ∈ S, then S < S′∪{α}. Else, if β = α, then s′ 6= α (by asymmetry of<), and using the Axiom of Contraposition we findA ⊢R ′\ns′ forA ⊆ (S′∪{α})\\{s′}, so that S′∪{α} S. Then, by Lemma 2, either S′ ∪ {α} < S or S < S′ ∪ {α}, which yields S < S′ ∪ {α} in any case.\nIn either (1) or (2), S < S′ ∪ {α}, and as S is <- conflict-free and<-defends α, this<-attack must be reverse and involve α: A1 ∪ {α} ⊢R1 s1, s1 ∈ S, A1 ⊆ S′, and ∃s′1 ∈ A1 with s ′ 1 < s1. Without loss of generality take s′1 to be 6-minimal such. By the Axiom of Contraposition, there is S1 ∪ {α} ⊢R ′ 1 s′1 with S1 ⊆ (A1 \\ {s ′ 1}) ∪ {s1} and ∀x ∈ S1 x 6< s′1 (by 6-minimality of s ′ 1). That is, S1 ∪ {α} < A1, so we find S < S1 ∪ {α}, again via reverse attack involving α: A2 ∪ {α} ⊢R2 s2, s2 ∈ S, A2 ⊆ S1, and ∃s′2 ∈ A2 with s ′ 2 < s2. We again impose 6-minimality on s′2 and by the Axiom of Contraposition get S2 ∪ {α} ⊢R ′ 2 s′2, S2 ⊆ (A2 \\ {s ′ 2}) ∪ {s2} and ∀x ∈ S2 x 6< s′2. As deductions are finite and< asymmetric, the procedure described above will eventually exhaust pairs of s′ k ∈ Ak and sk ∈ Sk such that s′k < sk, so that S < Sk ∪{α} will have to be a normal attack, for some k. But this leads to a contradiction to S being <-admissible and <-defending α.\nHence, by contradiction, S ∪ {α} is <-conflict-free. We now want to show that S ∪ {α} <-defends itself. So let B < S ∪ {α}. As S is <-admissible and <-defends α, we consider this <-attack to be reverse and involving α: S′ ∪ {α} ⊢R β1, S′ ⊆ S, β1 ∈ B, and ∃s′ ∈ S′ ∪ {α} with s′ < β1. By the Axiom of Contraposition, S1 ⊢R ′ 1 s′, S1 ⊆ ((S′ ∪ {α}) \\ {s′}) ∪ {β1}. Thus, S1 {s′}, whence S ∪ {α} < S1. This <-attack cannot be normal on (S′ ∪{α}) \\ {s′}, due to <-conflict-freeness of S ∪{α}; while, if it is normal on β1, then S∪{α} < B, as required. Else, S ∪ {α} < S1 via reverse attack: B1 ⊢R1 s1, s1 ∈ S ∪ {α}, B1 ⊆ S1, and ∃s′1 ∈ B1 with s ′ 1 < s1. Due to <-conflict-freeness of S ∪ {α}, we find β1 ∈ B1. Then again, by the Axiom of Contraposition, we find S2 ⊢R ′\n2 s′1, S2 ⊆ (B1 \\ {s ′ 1}) ∪ {s1}, and β1 ∈ S2. Like with the proof of <-conflict-freeness, this process must terminate with a normal attack S ∪ {α} < B, so that S ∪ {α} eventually <-defends itself.\nFinally, given that S <-defends α′ to begin with, using Lemma 1 we conclude that S ∪ {α} <-defends α′ too.\nFor the rest of this section, we assume that (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6)\nsatisfies the Axiom of Contraposition. We can now define the <-defence operator Def, inspired by (Dung 1995).\nDefinition 13. Def : ℘(A) → ℘(A) is defined as follows: for A ⊆ A, Def(A) = {α ∈ A : A <-defends α}.\nBy Lemma 1, Def is monotonic: if A ⊆ B ⊆ A, then Def(A) ⊆ Def(B). Hence, Def has a unique least fixed point, which is in addition a unique <-grounded extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), as shown next.\nProposition 4. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits a unique <- grounded extension.\nProof. First, observe that ∅ is <-admissible in (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6). The least fixed point G can be given as ⋃ i∈N\nDef i(∅). By Lemma 3, G is <-admissible. It is clearly <-complete (as G = Def(G)) and unique ⊆- minimal such (as the least fixed point). Hence,G is a unique <-grounded extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6).\nAs a consequence of Proposition 4, we get the following.\nCorollary 5. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits a <-complete extension.\nUsing Lemma 3, we can prove the following results.\nProposition 6. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits a <-preferred extension.\nProof. By Lemma 3, the collection of <-admissible supersets of ∅ is partially ordered by subset inclusion ⊆, so any sequence ∅ ⊆ A1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ An ⊆ . . . of <-admissible sets of assumptions (for n an ordinal) has an upper bound A = ⋃ i>0 Ai. Then A ⊆ A is <-admissible: if it were not <-conflict-free, then some An would not be either; and for any B < A we have B < An, for some n, so that An < B, and hence A < B too. Since every chain ∅ ⊆ A1 ⊆ . . . ⊆ An ⊆ . . . admits an <-admissible upper bound, every such chain has a ⊆-maximally <-admissible set of assumptions, according to Zorn’s Lemma. As ∅ is <- admissible, (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits at least one ⊆-maximally <-admissible—i.e. a <-preferred—extension.\nProposition 7. Every <-preferred extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) is a <-complete extension too.\nProof. Let E be a <-preferred extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) and suppose for a contradiction that it is not <-complete. Let E <-defend some α ∈ A \\ E. As E is <-admissible, E∪{α} is <-admissible, by Lemma 3. But then E is not ⊆- maximally <-admissible, contrary to E being <-preferred. Hence, by contradiction,E must be <-complete.\nFurther, as in ABA, <-stable semantics is subsumed by both<-preferred and<-complete semantics, as shown next.\nProposition 8. Any<-stable extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) is a <-preferred extension too.\nProof. Let E be a<-stable extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6). As E <-attacks every {β} * E, it must be ⊆-maximally <- admissible. Hence, E is <-preferred.\nProposition 9. Any<-stable extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) is a <-complete extension too.\nProof. LetE be a<-stable extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6). For any β 6∈ E, <-stability of E means that E < {β}, and if E <-defended β as well, it would mean that E < E, contradicting its <-conflict-freeness. Hence, E contains every assumption it <-defends, and so is <-complete.\nFinally, we consider <-ideal semantics.\nProposition 10. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits a unique <-ideal extension.\nProof. From Proposition 6 we know that (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits <-preferred extensions, so let S be their intersection. If S = ∅, then it is <-admissible, and so an <-ideal extension (unique). If S 6= ∅ is <-admissible, then it is an <- ideal extension (unique as well). Else, assume S 6= ∅ is not <-admissible. Then its ⊆-maximally <-admissible subsets I ( S are <-ideal extensions of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6). Suppose I and I ′ are two distinct <-admissible subsets of S. Then their union I ∪ I ′ is a subset of S too, and so <-conflictfree. By Lemma 3, I ∪ I ′ <-defends its assumptions, so must be <-admissible. Consequently, there can be only one ⊆-maximally<-admissible subset of S, i.e. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) has a unique <-ideal extension.\nProposition 11. Any<-ideal extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) is a <-complete extension too.\nProof. By Proposition 10, it has a unique <-ideal extension I . Suppose for a contradiction that I is not<-complete. Then there is α ∈ A \\ I <-defended by I . Such α must be contained in the intersection S of <-preferred extensions of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), because I ⊆ S <-defends α and every <- preferred extension E of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) is <-complete (by Proposition 7). But then, I ∪ {α} is <-admissible, according to Lemma 3, so that I is not <-ideal—a contradiction. Therefore, I must be <-complete.\nThese properties that ABA+ exhibits in the presence of Contraposition will be used to show, in the coming sections, that ABA+ satisfies certain principles of preference handling and non-monotonic reasoning."

(L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for <-σ semantics if for all <-σ extensions E ⊆ A of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), it holds that M ⊆ E.\nAs an illustration, in Example 8, α is a unique 6- maximal element in A, and {α} is a unique<-σ extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), whence (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for any semantics <-σ.\nOur next result shows that in general, ABA+ satisfies this principle under <-stable and <-complete semantics.\nProposition 16. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for <-stable and <-complete semantics.\nProof. Let the preference ordering 6 of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) be total and suppose M = {α ∈ A : ∄β ∈ A with α < β} is <-conflict-free. We first show that M is not <-attacked.\nFix α ∈M and suppose for a contradiction that for some S ⊆ A it holds that S < {α}. So either (i) ∃B ⊢R α with B ⊆ S and ∀β ∈ B α 6 β or β α, or (ii) {α} ⊢R β for some β ∈ S with α < β. Note that the case (ii) cannot happen, because α is6-maximal. So consider case (i). Since 6 is total, it follows that α 6 β ∀β ∈ B. But as α is 6- maximal, it must also hold that β 6 α, for any β ∈ B. From here, we show B ⊆ M . Indeed, fix β ∈ B and assume for a contradiction that β 6∈ M . Then ∃γ ∈ A such that β < γ. By transitivity, α < γ, contradicting α’s 6-maximality. So we must have β ∈M , and consequently,B ⊆M .\nBut now, since α ∈ M, B ⊆ M and B < {α}, this contradicts <-conflict-freeness of M . Therefore, by contradiction, S 6 < {α}, for any S ⊆ A. Since α ∈ M was arbitrary, we have M <-unattacked, as required.\nIf (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) admits no <-stable or <-complete extensions, then the principle is fulfilled trivially. Otherwise, let E ⊆ A be <-stable in (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6). Pick α ∈ M and suppose for a contradiction that α 6∈ E. Then E < {α}, which is a contradiction. Thus, α ∈ S, and hence M ⊆ S.\nNow let E be a <-complete extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) and suppose for a contradiction M * E. Then E does not <-defend some α ∈M . This means that S < M for some S ⊆ A, which is a contradiction. Hence, M ⊆ E.\nThis principle may, however, be violated under, say, <-preferred semantics: in Example 12, the framework (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) to begin with, admits {α, β} as a <- preferred extension, while γ 6∈ {α, β} is a 6-maximal element. However, assuming Contraposition, the Principle of Maximal Elements is satisfied under the remaining semantics too.\nCorollary 17. If (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition, then it fulfils the Principle of Maximal Elements for <-preferred/<-ideal/<-grounded semantics.\nProof. Follows from Propositions 4, 7, 11 and 16."

ABA+ satisfies this principle under<-stable semantics.\nProposition 18. (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) fulfils Principle I for <- stable semantics.\nProof. Suppose for a contradiction that both E = E0 ∪ {α} andE′ = E0∪{α′}, where α′ < α, are<-stable extensions of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6). As E′ is <-stable and α 6∈ E′, we get E′ < {α}. As E is <-conflict-free, we find E0 6 < {α}, so (from E′ < {α} we get that): (i) either there is E′′ ∪ {α′} ⊢R α with E′′ ⊆ E0 and ε 6< α ∀ε ∈ E′′ ∪ {α′}; (ii) or {α} ⊢R α′ is such that α < α′. As α′ < α, both cases lead to a contradiction, so that E′ is not a <-stable extension, provided E is.\nIn Example 8, E = {α} is a unique<-stable extension of (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), which illustrates the principle as follows: take E0 = ∅ so that E = {α} and E′ = {β}, where β < α. It is important that Principle I is satisfied under <-stable semantics, because (Brewka and Eiter 1999) investigated (preferred) answer sets of logic programs, and answer sets in Logic Programming correspond to stable extensions in ABA (Bondarenko et al. 1997). Satisfaction of the principle gives hope that preferred answer set semantics can be captured in ABA+, as answer set semantics is captured in ABA.\nPrinciple I, however, may be violated under <-preferred semantics: in Example 12, (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) has two <- preferred extensions {α, β} and {β, γ}, and yet α < γ. Note, though, that (L,R′,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition and has a unique <-σ extension {β, γ}, and thus fulfils Principle I for any semantics <-σ. Based on our investigations, we conjecture that assuming Contraposition, ABA+ frameworks fulfil the principle for the remaining semantics as well. Verifying this is left as future work."

      "text" : "(Čyras and Toni 2015) proposed and studied the well known non-monotonic inference properties of Cautious Monotonicity (MON henceforth) and Cumulative Transitivity (CUT henceforth) for ABA. Here, we investigate some of those properties for ABA+. We first recall (some of) the properties considered and results obtained.1\nAssume as given a fixed, but otherwise arbitrary (flat) ABA framework F = (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ). Let E be a σ extension of F . In what follows,E′ will denote a σ extension of a newly constructed ABA framework F ′. To avoid trivialities, we consider cases only where each of F and F ′ has at least one σ extension—E and E′ respectively.\n1In (Čyras and Toni 2015), instead of sceptical/credulous (see below) the words strong/weak were used, respectively; we have altered the names to adhere to the more common terminology.\nWe first recall the STRICT setting regarding strengthening of information. Given ψ ∈ Cn(E) \\ A, define F ′ = (L,R∪ {ψ ← ⊤},A,̄¯). There are four properties:\nSCEPTICAL STRICT CUT :\nFor all extensions E′ of F ′ we have Cn(E′) ⊆ Cn(E);\nCREDULOUS STRICT CUT :\nThere is an extension E′ of F ′ with Cn(E′) ⊆ Cn(E);\nSCEPTICAL STRICT MON :\nFor all extensions E′ of F ′ we have Cn(E) ⊆ Cn(E′);\nCREDULOUS STRICT MON :\nThere is an extension E′ of F ′ with Cn(E) ⊆ Cn(E′).\nTable 1 summarizes results pertaining to ABA (sceptical and credulous versions coincide under grounded and ideal semantics, and for other semantics the status of the credulous property is indicated in parentheses).\nWe now recall the ASM setting, where conclusions that are themselves assumptions are being confirmed. Given ψ ∈ Cn(E) ∩ A, define F ′ = (L,R ∪ {ψ ← ⊤},A \\ {ψ},̄¯).2 The properties are as follows:\nSCEPTICAL ASM CUT :\nFor all extensions E′ of F ′ we have Cn(E′) ⊆ Cn(E);\nCREDULOUS ASM CUT :\nThere is an extension E′ of F ′ with Cn(E′) ⊆ Cn(E);\nSCEPTICAL ASM MON :\nFor all extensions E′ of F ′ we have Cn(E) ⊆ Cn(E′);\nCREDULOUS ASM MON :\nThere is an extension E′ of F ′ with Cn(E) ⊆ Cn(E′).\nTable 2 summarizes results regarding ABA in the ASM setting (notation as before).\nThe non-monotonic inference properties CUT and MON can be readily applied to ABA+. Take F to be an ABA+ framework (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), let E be its <-σ extension, and given ψ ∈ Cn(E), define F ′ as follows:\n2For brevity reasons, the same symbol ¯̄̄ is used for both contrary mappings, and in the new framework F ′, the contrary mapping¯̄̄ is implicitly restricted to a diminished set of assumptions.\n• STRICT setting: F ′ = (L,R ∪ {ψ ← ⊤},A,̄¯,6); • ASM setting: F ′ = (L,R ∪ {ψ ← ⊤},A \\ {ψ},̄¯,6′),\nwhere6′ is a restriction of 6 to A \\ {ψ}. We can then analyse whether the non-monotonic inference properties in question are satisfied in ABA+. Trivially, as ABA+ is a conservative extension of ABA (cf. Theorem 14), properties violated in ABA will remain violated in ABA+. Therefore, we will focus on those that are satisfied in ABA; in particular, the credulous versions except for MON under ideal semantics.\nExample 18. As an illustration of the properties, recall Example 12. The ABA+ frameworkF = (L,R′,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) (that satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition) has a unique<-σ extension {β, γ} with Cn({β, γ}) = {α, β, γ}. • STRICT setting: take α and let F ′ = (L,R ∪ {α ←\n⊤},A,̄¯,6). ThenF ′ has a unique<-σ extension {β, γ}. • ASM setting: take β and let F ′ = (L,R ∪ {β ← ⊤},A \\\n{β},̄¯,6′) with α <′ γ. Then F ′ likewise has a unique <-σ extension {β, γ}. As conclusions of extensions of both F and F ′ are actually the same, the credulous versions of the properties are indeed satisfied in both settings.\nIn what follows, we assume that (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6) satisfies the Axiom of Contraposition and show that ABA+ retains the same satisfaction results of CUT and MON from ABA in both STRICT and ASM settings.\nProposition 19. <-complete semantics satisfies CREDULOUS STRICT CUT and CREDULOUS STRICT MON.\nProof. Let E be a <-complete extension of F = (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), fix ψ ∈ Cn(E) \\ A, and let F ′ = (L,R ∪ {ψ ← ⊤},A,̄¯,6). For ease of reference, we will denote by < and ′< the <-attack relations in F and F\n′ respectively. We claim that E is a <-complete extension of F ′ too. First, E is clearly <-conflict-free in F ′. Second, let α ∈ E and suppose thatB′ ′< {α} for someB\n′ ⊆ A withB′\\E. There are two possibilities.\nPossibility 1: this <-attack uses the rule ψ ← ⊤. We split into cases. • First, assume B′ ′< {α} via normal attack. I.e., ∃B ⊢ R\nα with B ⊆ B′, R ⊆ R, and such that ∀β ∈ B β 6< α. Consider some E0 ⊆ E with E0 ⊢R0 ψ, for some R0 ⊆ R. We have B ∪ E0 ⊢R∪R0 α. – If ∀ε ∈ E0 we have ε 6< α, then B ∪ E0 < {α}, so\nthat E < B ∪ E0, and thus (as E is <-admissible in F and E0 ⊆ E) we find E < B, whence E ′< B as well. Thus, E < B′, as required. – Else, if ∃ε ∈ E0 with ε < α, take 6-minimal such. Then by the Axiom of Contraposition, there is (B∪E0\\ {ε}) ∪ {α} ⊢R ′\nε, and by 6-minimality of ε, we find that ∄x ∈ (B∪E0\\{ε})∪{α} such that x < ε. Hence, (B ∪E0 \\ {ε})∪ {α} < {ε}, so that E < B ∪E, and hence E ′< B, as in the previous case.\n• Now assume B′ ′< {α} is a reverse attack, i.e., {α} ⊢ R\nβ, β ∈ B′, R ⊆ R and α < β. By the Axiom of Contraposition, {β} ⊢R ′\nα via normal attack. Hence, we are back in the first case above.\nIn any case, E <-defends α in F ′. Possibility 2: the <-attack B′ ′< {α} does not involve the rule ψ ← ⊤. That is, we actually have B′ < {α}. Then, E < B′, and hence E ′< B\n′. In any event, E <-defends α in F ′. Since α ∈ E was arbitrary, we conclude that E is <-admissible in F ′. It now suffices to show that E contains every assumption it <-defends in F ′. To this end, suppose E <-defends α in F ′, and suppose for a contradiction that α 6∈ E. Then E does not <-defend α in F . That is, there is B < {α} such that E 6 < B. But now, we also have B ′< {α}, so that E ′< B, whence it must be that E ′ < B is a normal attack that does not use some assumption ε ∈ E (which is used to deduce ψ, i.e. E0 ⊢R0 ψ, ε ∈ E0 ⊆ E, R0 ⊆ R) such that ε < β for some β ∈ B. Taking 6- minimal such ε (and accordingly some βinB), the Axiom of Contraposition guarantees that (E \\ {ε})∪{β} < {ε} via normal attack, and since ε ∈ E, it must be that E < {β}, giving E < B, which is a contradiction. Hence, α ∈ E after all, and so E is <-complete in F ′, as required.\nProposition 20. <-preferred semantics satisfies CREDULOUS STRICT CUT and CREDULOUS STRICT MON.\nProof. Like in the proof of Proposition 19, we claim that a <-preferred extension E of F is a <-preferred extension of F ′. Indeed, if E were not ⊆-maximally<-admissible in F ′, then for some β ∈ A \\ E, E ∪ {β} would be <-admissible in F ′. Verbatim to the proof for <-complete semantics, we could show that E ∪ {β} is <-admissible in F too, contradicting E being <-preferred in F .\nProposition 21. <-stable semantics satisfies CREDULOUS STRICT CUT and CREDULOUS STRICT MON.\nProof. Like in the proof of Proposition 19, we claim that a <-stable extension E of F is a <-stable extension of F ′. Indeed, let β 6∈ E. Then E < {β}. Whether it is a normal or reverse attack, we clearly have E ′< {β} too. Hence,E is <-stable in F ′, provided E is <-stable in F .\nProposition 22. <-grounded semantics satisfies CREDULOUS STRICT CUT and CREDULOUS STRICT MON.\nSketch. Using the argument as in Proposition 19, it can be proven by induction on the construction of the <-grounded extension G of F (cf. Proposition 4) that G is the <- grounded extension of F ′.\nCorollary 23. <-ideal semantics satisfies CREDULOUS STRICT CUT.\nProof. This follows by definition of the <-ideal extension and Proposition 20.\nNow, in the ASM setting, the came results can be obtained as in the STRICT setting, with essentially the same proofs.\nProposition 24. <-complete/<-preferred/<-stable/<grounded semantics satisfies CREDULOUS ASM CUT and CREDULOUS ASM MON, and <-ideal semantics satisfies CREDULOUS ASM CUT.\nSketch. Let E be a <-complete extension of F = (L,R,A,̄ ¯̄ ,6), fix ψ ∈ Cn(E) ∩ A, and let F ′ = (L,R ∪ {ψ ← ⊤},A \\ {ψ},̄¯,6′), where 6′ is a restriction of 6 to A \\ {ψ}. It can be shown that E is a <-complete extension of F ′, by replacing, in the proof of Proposition 19, E0 and E0 ⊢R0 ψ with {ψ} and {ψ} ⊢∅ ψ respectively. Other claims follow the same line of reasoning as for the proofs in the STRICT setting.\nTable 3 summarizes this section’s results (sceptical and credulous versions coincide under <-grounded and <-ideal semantics; for other semantics the credulous version is indicated in parentheses.)"

      "text" : "The principle of Contraposition of (strict) rules (see e.g. (Caminada and Amgoud 2007; Modgil and Prakken 2013)) is notably employed in the well studied structured argumentation formalism ASPIC+ (Modgil and Prakken 2013; Modgil and Prakken 2014). The principle as such is also inherently present in classical logic-based approaches to structured argumentation such as (Gorogiannis and Hunter 2011; Besnard and Hunter 2014). Similarly as in ASPIC+, ABA+ utilizes Contraposition to ensure the Fundamental Lemma (cf. Lemma 3). As a consequence, Contraposition paves way to satisfaction of desirable properties of ABA+ semantics, as well as preference handling and non-monotonic inference properties discussed in Sections 5 and 6. Whether the Axiom of Contraposition can be relaxed for ABA+ to obtain the same results is a line of future research.\nThe preference handling principle discussed in Section 5.4 was originally proposed, along with some other properties, by (Brewka and Eiter 1999) for answer set programming (ASP) with preferences. To the best of our knowledge, reformulation of Principle I for ABA+ is the first application of this principle to argumentation with preferences. Building on (Brewka and Eiter 1999), (Šimko 2014) discussed an extended set of principles for ASP with preferences, most of which focus on preferences over rules. Whether those principles can be applied to ABA+ is a future work direction.\nRegarding preference handling in argumentation, along with the Principle of Maximal Elements discussed in Sec-\ntion 5.3, (Amgoud and Vesic 2014) suggested several arguably desirable properties of argumentation with preferences. Those properties are exhibited in ABA+ as Proposition 12 and Theorem 14. Referring to those properties, (Brewka, Truszczyński, and Woltran 2010) also hinted at other properties regarding selection among extensions, as possible principles of preference handling in argumentation. Relating those principles to ABA+ is left for future work.\nIn terms on non-monotonic reasoning properties, Cautious Monotonicity and Cumulative Transitivity (studied in Section 6) are traced to (Makinson 1988; Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor 1990) and fall into the well studied area of analysing non-monotonic reasoning with respect to information change (cf. (Rott 2001)). In argumentation setting, the latter is also known as argumentation dynamics, and has recently been a topic of interest in the argumentation community (see e.g. (Cayrol, de Saint-Cyr, and Lagasquie-Schiex 2010; Falappa et al. 2011; Baroni et al. 2014; Coste-Marquis et al. 2014; Booth et al. 2014; Diller et al. 2015; Baumann and Brewka 2015)). In particular, non-monotonic inference properties were investigated in (Hunter 2010) with respect to argument– claim entailment in logic-based argumentation systems; in (Čyras and Toni 2015) for ABA; and with regards to ASPIC+-type-of argumentation systems in (Dung 2016). Only the latter of the three works concerns argumentation with preferences. In addition to considering different structured argumentation setting and different preference handling mechanisms, it diverges from our analysis in Section 6 in that (Dung 2016) regards Cumulative Transitivity plus Cautious Monotonicity as a single property of Cumulativity and studies it only for stable and complete semantics. Other argumentation-related properties from (Dung 2016) will be studied for ABA+ in the future.\nSeveral other topics of interest are left for future work. For instance, integrating dynamic preferences (see e.g. (Prakken and Sartor 1999; Zhang and Foo 1997; Brewka and Woltran 2010)) within ABA+ and studying their interaction with the properties of preference handling as well as of non-monotonic inference. Also, relation of ABA+ to Logic Programming with preferences (e.g. (Sakama and Inoue 1996; Zhang and Foo 1997; Brewka and Eiter 1999)) and non-monotonic reasoning formalisms equipped with preferences in general (e.g. (Brewka 1989; Baader and Hollunder 1995; Rintanen 1998; Brewka and Eiter 2000; Delgrande and Schaub 2000; Stolzenburg et al. 2003; Kakas and Moraitis 2003)) is left for future research.\nThere are as well numerous approaches to integrating reasoning with preferences within argumentation, e.g. (Amgoud and Cayrol 2002; Bench-Capon 2003; Kaci and van der Torre 2008; Modgil 2009; Modgil and Prakken 2010; Baroni et al. 2011; Dunne et al. 2011; Brewka et al. 2013; Amgoud and Vesic 2014; Besnard and Hunter 2014; Garcı́a and Simari 2014; Wakaki 2014; Modgil and Prakken 2013; Modgil and Prakken 2014;\nDung 2016). It would be interesting to study these formalisms with respect to the properties considered in this paper, where it has not already been done. We leave this as future work."
