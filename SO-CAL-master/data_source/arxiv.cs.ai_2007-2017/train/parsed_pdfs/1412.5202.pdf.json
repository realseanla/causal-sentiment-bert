      "text" : "The concept of neutrosophic set developed by Smarandache ([16], [17]) is a more general platform which generalizes the concept of the classic set, fuzzy set [34], intuitionistic fuzzy set [1] and interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets ([2],[3]). In contrast to intuitionistic fuzzy sets and also interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets, indeterminacy is characterized explicitly in the neutrosophic set. A neutrosophic set has three basic components such that truth membership, indeterminacy membership and falsity membership, and they are independent. However, the neutrosophic set generalizes the above mentioned sets from philosophical point of view and its functions \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65) are real standard or nonstandard subsets of ]0−, 1+[ and are defined by \uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65): \uD835\uDC4B → ]0 −, 1+[ , \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65): \uD835\uDC4B → ]0−, 1+[ and \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC34(\uD835\uDC65): \uD835\uDC4B → ]0 −, 1+[ . That is, its components \uD835\uDC47(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC3C(\uD835\uDC65), \uD835\uDC39(\uD835\uDC65) are non-standard subsets included in the unitary nonstandard interval ]0−, 1+[ or standard subsets included in the unitary standard interval [0, 1] as in the intuitionistic fuzzy set. Furthermore, the connectors in the intuitionistic fuzzy set are only defined by \uD835\uDC47(\uD835\uDC65) and \uD835\uDC39(\uD835\uDC65) (i.e. truth-membership and falsity-membership), hence the indeterminacy \uD835\uDC3C(\uD835\uDC65) is what is left from 1, while in the neutrosophic set, they can be defined by any of them (no restriction) [16]. For example, when we ask the opinion of an expert about certain statement, he/she may say that the possibility in which the statement is true is 0.6 and the statement is false is 0.5 and the degree in which he/she is not sure is 0.2. For neutrosophic notation, it can be expressed as\n\uD835\uDC65(0.6,0.2,0.5) . For another example, suppose there are 10 voters during a voting process. Five vote “aye”, two vote “blackball” and three are undecided. For neutrosophic notation, it can be expressed as \uD835\uDC65(0.5,0.3,0.2) . However, these expressions are beyond the scope of the intuitionistic fuzzy set. Therefore, the notion of neutrosophic set is more general and overcomes the aforementioned issues. But, a neutrosophic set will be difficult to apply in real scientific and engineering fields. Therefore, Wang et al. ([25], [26]) proposed the concepts of interval neutrosophic set INS and single valued neutrosophic set (SVNS), which are an instance of a neutrosophic set, and provided the set- theoretic operators and various properties of INSs and SVNSs, respectively. Then, SVNSs (or INSs) present uncertainty, imprecise, inconsistent and incomplete information existing in real world. Also, it would be more suitable to handle indeterminate information and inconsistent information. Majumdar et al. [11] introduced a measure of entropy of SVNSs. Ye [32] and proposed the correlation coefficients of SVNSs and developed a decision-making method under single valued neutrosophic environment. Broumi and Smarandache [14] extended this idea in INSs. Ye [33] also introduced the concept of simplified neutrosophic sets (SNSs), and applied the sets in an MCDM method using the aggregation operators of SNSs. Peng et al. [44] showed that some operations in Ye [33] may also be unrealistic. They defined the novel operations and aggregation operators and applied them to MCDM problems. Ye [30,31] proposed the similarity measures between SVNSs\nand INSs based on the relationship between similarity measures and distances. Şahin and Küçük [15] proposed the concept of neutrosophic subsethood based on distance measure for SVNSs.\nWe usually need the decision making methods because of the complex and uncertainty under the physical nature of the problems. By the multi-criteria decision making methods, we can choose the optimal alternative from multiple alternatives according to some criteria. The proposed set theories have provided the different multi-criteria decision making methods. Some authors ([7],[8],[9],[10],[18],[19],[ 23],[27]) studied on multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making methods based on intuitionistic fuzzy sets while some authors ([5],[13],[20],[21],[22],[28],[29]) proposed the multi-criteria fuzzy decision-making methods based on interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environment.\nXu and Yager [23] defined some geometric aggregation operators named the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric operator, the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric operator, and applied the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric operator to a multi-criteria decision making problem under intuitionistic fuzzy environment. Then Xu [19] proposed the arithmetic aggregation operators which are arithmetic types of above mentioned ones. Xu and Chen [20] generalized the arithmetic aggregation operators to interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy such that the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted geometric operator, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric operator and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid weighted geometric operator, and applied the aggregation operators to a multi-criteria decision making problems by using the score function and accuracy function of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers. The geometric aggregation operators for interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are also proposed in [18].\nBut, until now there have been no many studies on multicriteria decision making methods based on score-accuracy functions in which criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets or interval neutrosophic sets. Ye [30] proposed a multi-criteria decision making method for interval neutrosophic sets by means of the similarity measure between each alternative and the ideal alternative. Also, Ye [31] presented the correlation coefficient of SVNSs and the crossentropy measure of SVNSs and applied them to single valued neutrosophic decision-making problems. Recently, Zhang et al. [6] established two interval neutrosophic aggregation operators such as interval neutrosophic weighted arithmetic operator and interval neutrosophic weighted geometric operator and presented a method for multi-criteria decision making problems based on the aggregation operators. Therefore the main purposes of this paper were (1) to define two measurement functions such that score function and accuracy function to rank single valued neutrosophic numbers and extend the idea in interval neutrosophic numbers, (2) to establish a multi-criteria decision\nmaking method by use of the proposed functions and neutrosophic aggregation operators for neutrosophic sets, and (3) to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the developed methods by some numerical examples.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The definitions of neutrosophic sets, single valued neutrosophic sets, interval neutrosophic sets and some basic operators on them as well as arithmetic and geometric aggregation operators are briefly introduced in section 2. In section 3, the score function and the accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic numbers are introduced and studied by giving illustrative properties. Also the concepts is extended to interval neutrosophic sets in section 4. This is followed by applications of the proposed this functions to multi-criteria decision making problems in Section 5. The section 6 includes a comparison analyze. This paper is concluded in Section 7."

To demonstrate the relationships, we utilize the same examples adapted from [32] and [30].\nThe score and accuracy functions has extremely important for process of multi criteria decision making. But, until now there have been no many studies on multi-criteria decision making method based on accuracy-score functions, which are criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets or interval neutrosophic sets. Ye [30] defined the similarity measures between INSs based on the relationship between similarity measures and distances and proposed the similarity measures between each alternative and the ideal alternative to\nestablish a multi criteria decision making method for INSs. After, Zhang et al. [6] presented a method based on the aggregation operators for multi criteria decision making under interval neutrosophic environment. By obtaining the different results than given in [30], they showed that the method proposed is more precise and reliable than the result produced in [30]. Although the same ranking results with [6] are obtained in here, the decision making method proposed in this paper has less calculation and it is more flexible and more sustainable for the multi criteria decision making with SVN or IVN information."

In this paper a score function and an accuracy function for single valued neutrosophic sets is firstly proposed to make the distinction between them. Then the idea is extended to interval neutrosophic sets. A multi-criteria decision making method based on the developed score-accuracy functions is established in which criterion values for alternatives are single valued neutrosophic sets and interval neutrosophic sets. In decision making process, the neutrosophic weighted aggregation operators (arithmetic and geometric average operators) are adopted to aggregate the neutrosophic information related to each alternative. Thus, we can rank all alternatives and make the selection of the best of one(s) according to the score-accuracy functions. Finally, some illustrative examples are presented to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.",
