      "text" : "We introduce two novel non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests. The first test, called the relative test of dependency, enables us to determine whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on a first target variable or a second. Dependence is measured via the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The second test, called the relative test of similarity, is use to determine which of the two samples from arbitrary distributions is significantly closer to a reference sample of interest and the relative measure of similarity is based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). To construct these tests, we have used as our test statistics the difference of HSIC statistics and of MMD statistics, respectively. The resulting tests are consistent and unbiased, and (being based on U -statistics) have favorable convergence properties. The effectiveness of the relative dependency test is demonstrated on several real-world problems: we identify languages groups from a multilingual parallel corpus, and we show that tumor location is more dependent on gene expression\n∗.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "This article is based upon and extends Bounliphone et al. (2015, 2016). We address two related problems using analogous tools based on estimating correlated U -statistics for dependency and similarity in a non-parametric setting.\nThe first problem (called the relative dependency test) is to compare multiple dependencies to determine which of two variables most strongly influences the third, by proposing a statistical test of the null hypothesis that a source variable is more dependent to a first target variable against the alternative hypothesis that a source variable is more dependent to a second target variable. Much recent research on dependence measurement has focused on non-parametric measures of dependence, which apply even when the dependence is nonlinear, or the variables are multivariate or non-Euclidean (for instance images, strings, and graphs). The statistics for such tests are diverse, and include kernel measures of covariance (Gretton et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2011) and correlation (Dauxois and Nkiet, 1998; Fukumizu et al., 2008), distance covariances (which are instances of kernel tests) (Székely et al., 2007; Sejdinovic et al., 2013), kernel regression tests (Cortes et al., 2009; Gunn and Kandola, 2002), rankings (Heller et al., 2013), and space partitioning approaches (Gretton and Gyorfi, 2010; Reshef et al., 2011; Kinney and Atwal, 2014). Specialization of such methods to univariate linear dependence can yield similar tests to classical approaches such as Darlington (1968); Bring (1996). For many problems in data analysis, however, the question of whether dependence exists is secondary: there may be multiple dependencies, and the question becomes which dependence is the strongest. For the dependence measure, we use as our test statistic between each of the target and the source is computing using the Hilbert-Schmidt Independent Criterion (HSIC) (Gretton et al., 2005b, 2008) which is the distance between embeddings of the joint distribution and the product of the marginals in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). When the RKHSs are characteristic, the variables are independent iff HSIC = 0.\nThe second problem (called the relative similarity test) is to compare samples from three probability distributions by proposing a statistical test of the null hypothesis that a first candidate probability distribution is closer to a reference probability distribution against the alternative hypothesis that the second candidate probability distribution is closer. We have developed an application of this test to model selection for generative models.\nGenerative models based on deep learning techniques aim to provide sophisticated and accurate models of data, without expensive manual annotation. This is especially of interest as deep networks tend to require comparatively large training samples to achieve a good result. Model selection within this class of techniques can be a challenge, however. First, likelihoods can be difficult to compute for some families of recently proposed models based on deep learning (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Li et al., 2015). The current best method to evaluate such models is based on Parzen-window estimates of the log likelihood (Goodfellow et al., 2014, Section 5). Second, if we are given two models with similar likelihoods, we\ntypically do not have a computationally inexpensive hypothesis test to determine whether one likelihood is significantly higher than the other. Permutation testing or other generic strategies are often computationally prohibitive, bearing in mind the relatively high computational requirements of deep networks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). So in this work, we provide an alternative strategy for model selection, based on our non-parametric hypothesis test of relative similarity. We treat the two trained networks being compared as generative models (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2006; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009), and test whether the first candidate model generates samples significantly closer to a reference validation set. For the metric on the space of probability distribution, we use as our test statistic the difference of two the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2006, 2012a), where MMD is the difference between mean embeddings of the distributions in a RKHS. When the RKHS is equal to the unit ball in a characteristic RKHS, the probability measures are equal iff MMD = 0. For both tests, care must be taken in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the test statistics, since the measure of dependence and the measure of similarity will themselves be correlated: they are both computed with respect to the same source. Thus, we derive the joint asymptotic distribution of both dependencies and similarities. The derivation of our test utilizes classical results of U -statistics (Hoeffding, 1963; Serfling, 2009; Arcones and Gine, 1993). In particular, we make use of results by Hoeffding (1963) and Serfling (2009) to determine the asymptotic joint distributions of the statistics (see Theorems 5 & 11). Consequently, we derive the lowest variance unbiased estimator of the test statistic. We prove our approach to have greater statistical power than constructing two uncorrelated statistics on the same data by subsampling, and testing on these. Our paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we formalize the two proposed problems and introduce the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independent Criterion (HSIC). We provide unbiased estimators, as well as asymptotic distributions based on the theory of U -statistics. In Section 3 and Section 4 we derive the joint asymptotic distribution of the correlated HSICs and the correlated MMD and prove that our approach is strictly more powerful than a test that does not exploit the covariance between the correlated statistics. Finally, in Section 6, we demonstrate the performance of the relative test of dependency on problems from multilingual corpus and neurosciences and we demonstrate the performance of the relative test of similarity in different scenarios where a pair of model output is compare to a validation set over a range of training regimes and settings."

      "heading" : "2.1 Kernel Mean Embedding of Distributions",
      "text" : "This section presents the notion of kernel mean embeddings (Berlinet and Thomas-Agnan, 2011; Smola et al., 2007), where the idea is to generalize the Hilbert-space embedding of distributions by the kernel feature map of a distribution to Dirac measures. The kernel mean embedding has been used to define metrics for probability distributions which is important for many problems in statistics and machine learning. First, we briefly review the properties of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert-space (RKHS) (Aronszajn, 1950). A RKHS H with a reproducing kernel k(x, y) is a Hilbert space of functions f : X → R with inner product 〈·, ·〉H. Its element k(x, ·) satisfies the reproducing property: 〈f, k(x, ·)〉H = f(x) for any f ∈ H and consequently, 〈k(x, ·), k(y, ·)〉H = k(x, y). We define the feature map φ : X → H by φ(x) = k(x, ·) and using the reproducing property, we obtain that k(x, y) = 〈φ(x), φ(y)〉H. We extend the notion of feature map to the mean embedding of probability measure : Suppose that a space P(X ) consists of all Borel probability measures P on some input space X . we define the mean embedding µ of P associated with a reproduction kernel k by a mapping µ : P(X ) → H, by µP = EX∼P [k(x, ·)] = ∫ X k(·, x)dP(x). The distribution P is mapped to its expected feature map, i.e., to a point in a potentially infinite-dimensional and implicit feature space. The mean embedding µ has the property that Ex∼P [f(X)] = 〈µP, f〉H for any f ∈ H. The notion of universal kernels and characteristic kernels are essential to the study of kernel mean embeddings (Fukumizu et al., 2008). The kernel k is said to be universal if the corresponding RKHS H is dense in the space of bounded continuous functions on X (Steinwart, 2002). It was shown that for a universal kernel k, ‖µP−µQ‖H iff P = Q, i.e. the map µ is injective. The kernel k is said to be characteristic if the map µ is injective and the RKHS H is said to be characteristic if its reproducing kernel is characteristic. This notion was introduced by Fukumizu et al. (2008) and it was shown that Gaussian and Laplacian kernels are characteristic on Rd. Furthermore, the notion of mean embedding can be generalized to joint distributions of two variables using tensor product feature spaces. Let (x, y) be random variables on X × Y and F be a RKHS with measurable kernel k on X and H be a RKHS with measurable\nkernel l on Y. We assume that Ex[k(x, x)] < ∞ and Ey[l(y, y′)] < ∞, the cross-covariance operator (see Baker (1973) and Fukumizu et al. (2004)) Cyx : H → F is defined as Cyx := Eyx [φ(y)⊗ φ(x)]−µPx⊗µPy = µPyx−µPy⊗µPx . The unique bounded operator Cyx satisfies 〈g, Cyxf〉 = Cov[f(x), g(y)] for all f ∈ F and g ∈ H."

(15) is constructed with the definition of variance of a U-statistic as given by Serfling (2009, Ch. 5) where one variable is fixed. Eq. (14) follows from the application of Hoeffding (1963, Theorem 7.1), which gives the joint asymptotic distribution of U-statistics.\nBased on the joint asymptotic distribution of HSIC described in Theorem 5, we can now describe a statistical test to solve Pb. 1 described in Section 2.3. This is achieved by projecting the distribution to 1D using the statistic HSICu [F ,G, (Xm, Ym)]−HSICu [F ,H, (Xm, Zm)], and determining where the statistic falls relative to a conservative estimate of the the 1−α quantile of the null HHSIC0 . We now derive this conservative estimate. A simple way of\nachieving this is to rotate the distribution by π4 counter-clockwise about the origin, and to integrate the resulting distribution projected onto the first axis (cf. Fig. 3). Let denote the asymptotically normal distribution ofm1/2 HSICu [F ,G, (Xm, Ym)] HSICu [F ,H, (Xm, Zm)]]T as N (µ,Σ). The distribution resulting from rotation and projection is\nN ( [Qµ]1, [QΣQ T ]11 ) , (16)\nwhere Q =\n√ 2\n2 ( 1 −1 1 1 ) is the rotation matrix by π4 and\n[Qµ]1 =\n√ 2\n2 (HSICu [F ,G, (Xm, Ym)]−HSICu [F ,H, (Xm, Zm)]) , (17)\n[QΣQT ]11 = 1\n2 (σ2XY + σ 2 XZ − 2σXYXZ). (18)\nFollowing the empirical distribution from Eq. (16), a test with statistic HSICu [F ,G, (Xm, Ym)]− HSICu [F ,H, (Xm, Zm)] has p-value\np ≤ 1−Φ (HSICu [F ,G, (Xm, Ym)]−HSICu [F ,H, (Xm, Zm)])√ σ2XY + σ 2 XZ − 2σXYXZ  , (19) where Φ is the CDF of a standard normal distribution, and we have made the most conservative possible assumption that HSIC [F ,G,Pxy] − HSIC [F ,H,Pxz] = 0 under the null (the null also allows for the difference in population dependence measures to be negative). To implement the test in practice, the variances of σ2XY , σ 2 XZ and σ 2 XYXZ may be replaced by their empirical estimates. The test will still be consistent for a large enough sample size, since the estimates will be sufficiently well converged to ensure the test is calibrated. Eq. (15) is expensive to compute näıvely, because even computing the kernels hijqr and gijqr of the U -statistic itself is a non trivial task. Following Song et al. (2012, Section 2.5), we first form a vector hXY with entries corresponding to ∑ (j,q,r)∈im3 \\{i} hijqr, and a vector\nhXZ with entries corresponding to ∑\n(j,q,r)∈im3 \\{i} gijqr. Collecting terms in Eq. (13) related\nto kernel matrices K̃ and L̃, hXY can be written as hXY = (m− 2)2 ( K̃ L̃ ) 1−m(K̃1) (L̃1) (20)\n+ (m− 2) ( (Tr(K̃L̃))1− K̃(L̃1)− L̃(K̃1) )\n+ (1T L̃1)K̃1 + (1T K̃1)L̃1− ((1T K̃)(L̃1))1\nwhere denotes the Hadamard product. Then RXYXZ in Eq. (15) can be computed as RXYXZ = (4m) −1(m − 1)−23 hXY ThXZ. Using the order of operations implied by the parentheses in Eq. (20), the computational cost of the cross covariance term is O(m2). Combining this with the unbiased estimator of HSIC in Eq. (8) leads to a final computational complexity of O(m2). Code for performing the test is available at https://github.com/ wbounliphone/reldep. In addition to the asymptotic consistency result, we provide a finite sample bound on the deviation between the difference of two population HSIC statistics and the difference of two empirical HSIC estimates.\nTheorem 6 (Generalization bound on the difference of empirical HSIC statistics) Assume that k, l, and d are bounded almost everywhere by 1, and are non-negative. Then for m > 1 and all δ > 0 with probability at least 1−δ, for all Pxy and Pxz, the generalization bound on the difference of empirical HSIC statistics is∣∣ (HSIC [F ,G,Pxy]−HSIC [F ,H,Pxz])− (HSICu [F ,G, (Xm, Ym)] HSICu [F ,H, (Xm, Zm)]) ∣∣\n≤ 2\n{√ log(6/δ)\nα2m + C m\n} (21)\nwhere α > 0.24 and C are constants.\nProof In Gretton et al.

We can now estimate the joint distribution of m1/2[HSICu [ F ,G, ( Xm/2, Ym/2 )] ,HSICu [ F ,H, ( Xm/2, Zm/2 )] ]T as\nN ((\nHSIC [F ,G,Pxy] HSIC [F ,H,Pxz]\n) , ( σ2X′Y ′ 0\n0 σ2X′′Z′′\n)) , (22)\nwhich we will write as N (µ′,Σ′). Given this joint distribution, we need to determine the distribution over the half space defined by HSIC [F ,G,Pxy] < HSIC [F ,H,Pxz] . As in the previous section, we achieve this by rotating the distribution by π4 counter-clockwise about the origin, and integrating the resulting distribution projected onto the first axis (cf. Fig. 3). The resulting projection of the rotated distribution onto the primary axis is\nN ([ Qµ′ ] 1 , [ QΣ′QT ] 11 ) (23)\nwhere\n[Qµ′]1 =\n√ 2\n2 (HSIC [F ,G,Pxy]−HSIC [F ,H,Pxz]) , [QΣ′QT ]11 =\n1 2 (σ2X′Y ′ + σ 2 X′′Z′′).\n(24)\nFrom this empirically estimated distribution, it is straightforward to construct a consistent test (cf.

      "text" : "While discarding half the samples leads to a consistent test, we might expect some loss of power over the approach in Section 3.1, due to the increase in variance with lower sample size. In this section, we prove the Section 3.1 test is more powerful than that of Section 3.2, regardless of Pxy and Pxz. We call the simple and consistent approach in Section 3.2, the independent approach, and the lower variance approach in Section 3.1, the dependent approach. The following theorem compares these approaches.\nTheorem 8 The asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) of the independent approach relative to the dependent approach is always greater than 1.\nRemark 9 The asymptotic relative efficiency is defined in e.g. Serfling (2009, Chap. 5, Section 1.15.4). If mA and mB are the sample sizes at which tests ”perform equivalently” (i.e. have equal power), then the ratio mAmB represents the relative efficiency. When mA and mB tend to +∞ and the ratio mAmB → L (at equivalent performance), then the value L represents the asymptotic relative efficiency of procedure B relative to procedure A. This example is relevant to our case since we are comparing two test statistics with different asymptotically normal distributions.\nThe following lemma is used for the proof of Thm. 8.\nLemma 10 (Lower Variance) The variance of the dependent test statistic is smaller than the variance of the independent test statistic.\nProof From the convergence of moments in the application of the central limit theorem (von Bahr, 1965), we have that σ2X′Y ′ = 2σ 2 XY . Then the variance summary in Eq. (18) is 1 2(σ 2 XY + σ 2 XZ − 2σXYXZ) and the variance summary in Eq. (24) is 1 2(2σ 2 XY + 2σ 2 XZ) where\nin both cases the statistic is scaled by √ m. We have that the variance of the independent test statistic is smaller than the variance of the dependent test statistic when\n1 2 (σ2XY + σ 2 XZ − 2σXYXZ) < 1 2 (2σ2XY + 2σ 2 XZ)\n⇐⇒ −2σXYXZ < σ2XY + σ2XZ (25)\nwhich is implied by the positive definiteness of Σ.\nProof [Proof of Thm 8] The Type II error probability of the independent test at level α is\nΦ Φ−1(1− α)− m−1/2(HSIC [F ,G,Pxy]−HSIC [F ,H,Pxz] )√ σ2X′Y ′ + σ 2 X′′Z′′  , (26) where we again make the most conservative possible assumption that HSIC [F ,G,Pxy] − HSIC [F ,H,Pxz] = 0 under the null. The Type II error probability of the dependent test at level α is\nΦ Φ−1(1− α)− m−1/2(HSIC [F ,G,Pxy]−HSIC [F ,H,Pxz] )√ σ2XY + σ 2 XZ − 2σXYXZ  (27) where Φ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. The numerator in Eq. (26) is the same as the numerator in Eq. (27), and the denominator in Eq. (27) is smaller due to Lemma 10. The lower variance dependent test therefore has higher ARE, i.e., for a sufficient sample size m > τ for some distribution dependent τ ∈ N+, the dependent test will be more powerful than the independent test."

We choose 3000 random documents in common written in: Finnish (fi), Italian (it), French (fr), Spanish (es), Portuguese (pt), English (en), Dutch (nl), German (de), Danish (da) and Swedish (sv). These languages can be broadly categorized into either the Romance, Germanic or Uralic groups (Gray and Atkinson, 2003). In this dataset, we considered each language as a random variable and each document as an observation.\nOur first goal is to test if the statistical dependence between two languages in the same group is greater than the statistical dependence between languages in different groups. For pre-processing, we removed stop-words (http://www.nltk.org) and performed stemming (http://snowball.tartarus.org). We applied the TF-IDF model as a feature representation and used a Gaussian kernel with the bandwidth σ set per language as the median pairwise distance between documents.\nIn Tab. 1, a selection of tests between language groups (Germanic, Romance, and Uralic) is given: all p-values strongly support that our relative dependence test finds the different language groups with very high significance.\nFurther, if we focus on the Romance family, our test enables one to answer more fine-grained questions about the relative similarity of languages within the same group. As before, we determine the ground truth similarities from the topology of the tree of European languages determined by the linguistics community Gray and Atkinson (2003); Bouckaert et al. (2012) as illustrated in Fig. 4 for the Romance group. We have run the test on all triplets from the corpus for which the topology of the tree specifies a correct ordering of the dependencies. In a fraction of a second (excluding kernel computation), we are able to recover certain features of the subtree of relationships between languages present in the Romance language group (Tab. 3). The test always indicates the correct relative similarity of languages when nearby languages (e.g. Portuguese and Spanish: pt, es) are compared with those further away\n(e.g. Portuguese and Danish: pt, da), however errors are sometimes made when comparing triplets of languages for which the nearest common ancestor is more than one link removed.\nIn our next tests, we evaluate our more general framework for testing relative dependencies with more than two HSIC statistics. We chose four languages, and tested whether the average dependence between languages in the same group is higher than the dependence between groups. The results of these tests are in Tab. 2.

Despite advances in multimodality therapy, children with pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGG) invariably have an overall survival of around 20% at 5 years. Depending on their location (e.g. brainstem, central nuclei, or supratentorial), pHGG present different characteristics in terms of radiological appearance, histology, and prognosis. The hypothesis is that pHGG have different genetic origins and oncogenic pathways depending on their location. Thus, the biological processes involved in the development of the tumor may be different from one location to another.\nIn order to evaluate such hypotheses, pre-treatment frozen tumor samples were obtained from 53 children with newly diagnosed pHGG from Necker Enfants Malades (Paris, France) from Puget et al. (2012). The 53 tumors are divided into 3 locations: supratentorial (HEMI), central nuclei (MIDL), and brain stem (DIPG). The final dataset is organized in 3 blocks of variables defined for the 53 tumors: X is a block of indicator variables describing the\nlocation category, the second data matrix Y provides the expression of 15 702 genes (GE). The third data matrix Z contains the imbalances of 1229 segments (CGH) of chromosomes. For X, we use a linear kernel, which is characteristic for indicator variables, and for Y and Z, the kernel was chosen to be the Gaussian kernel with σ selected as the median of pairwise distances. The p-value of our relative dependency test is < 10−5. This shows that the tumor location in the brain is more dependent on gene expression than on chromosomal imbalances. By contrast with Section 6.1.1, the independent test was also able to find the same ordering of dependence, but with a p-value that is three orders of magnitude larger (p = 0.005). Fig. 5 shows iso-curves of the Gaussian distributions estimated in the independent and dependent tests. The empirical relative dependency is consistent with findings in the medical literature, and provides additional statistical support for the importance of tumor location in Glioma (Gilbertson and Gutmann, 2007; Palm et al., 2009; Puget et al., 2012)."

      "text" : "An important potential application of the RelativeMMD problem (Pb. 2) can be found in recent work on unsupervised learning with deep neural networks (Kingma and Welling, 2014; Bengio et al., 2014; Larochelle and Murray, 2011; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009; Li et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2014). As noted by several authors, the evaluation of generative models is a challenging open problem (Li et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2014), and the distributions of samples from these models are very complex and difficult to evaluate. The RelativeMMD performance can be used to compare different model settings, or even model families, in a statistically valid framework. To compare two models using our test, we generate samples from both, and compare these to a set of real target data samples that were not used to train either model.\nIn the experiments in the sequel we focus on the recently introduced variational autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma and Welling, 2014) and the generative moment matching networks (GMMN) (Li et al., 2015). The former trains an encoder and decoder network jointly\nminimizing a regularized variational lower bound (Kingma and Welling, 2014). While the latter class of models is purely generative minimizing an MMD based objective, this model works best when coupled with a separate auto-encoder which reduces the dimensionality of the data. An architectural schematic for both classes of models is provided in Fig. 10. Both these models can be trained using standard backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1988). Using the latent variable prior we can directly sample the data distribution of these models without using MCMC procedures (Hinton et al., 2006; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009).\nWe use the MNIST and FreyFace datasets for our analysis (LeCun et al., 1998; Kingma and Welling, 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2014). We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our test in a setting where we have a theoretical basis for expecting superiority of one unsupervised model versus another. Specifically, we use a setup where more training samples were used to create one model versus the other. We find that the RelativeMMD framework agrees with the expected results (models trained with more data generalize better). We then demonstrate how the RelativeMMD can be used in evaluating network architecture choices, and we show that our test strongly agrees with other established metrics, but in contrast can provide significance results using just the validation data while other methods may require an additional test set.\nSeveral practical matters must be considered when applying the RelativeMMD test. The selection of kernel can affect the quality of results, particularly more suitable kernels can give a faster convergence. In this work we extend the logic of the median heuristic (Gretton et al., 2012b) for bandwidth selection by computing the median pairwise distance between samples from Px and Py and averaging that with the median pairwise distance between samples from Px and Pz, which helps to maximize the difference between the two MMD statistics. Although the derivations for the variance of our statistic hold for all cases, the estimates require asymptotic arguments and thus a sufficiently large m. Selecting the kernel bandwidth in an appropriate range can therefore substantially increase the power of the test at a fixed sample size. While we observed the median heuristic to work well in our experiments, there are cases where alternative choices of kernel can provide greater power: for instance, the kernel can be chosen to maximize the expected test power on a held-out dataset (Gretton et al., 2012b).\nVariational Auto-Encoder Sample Size and Architecture Experiments We use the architecture from Kingma and Welling (2014) with a hidden layer at both the encoder and decoder and a latent variable layer as shown in Fig. 10a. We use sigmoidal activation for the hidden layers of encoder and decoder. For the FreyFace data, we use a Gaussian prior on the latent space and data space. For MNIST, we used a Bernoulli prior for the data space. We fix the training set size of the second auto-encoder to 300 images for the FreyFace data and 1500 images for the MNIST data. We vary the number of training samples for the first auto-encoder. We then generate samples from both auto-encoders and compare them using Relative MMD to a held out set of data. We use 1500 FreyFace samples as the target in Relative MMD and 15000 images from MNIST. Since a single sample of the data might lead to better generalization performance by chance, we repeat this experiment multiple times and record whether the relative similarity test indicated a network is preferred or if it failed to reject the null hypothesis. The results are shown in Fig. 11 which demonstrates that we are closely following the expected model preferences. Additionally for MNIST we use\nanother separate set of supervised training and test data. We encode this data using both auto-encoders and use logistic regression to obtain a classification accuracy. The indicated accuracies closely match the results of the relative similarity test, further validating the test. We consider model selection between networks using different architectures. We train two encoders, one a fixed reference model (400 hidden units and 20 latent variables), and the other varying as specified in Tab. 4. 25000 images from the MNIST data set were used for training. We use another 20000 images as the target data in Relative MMD. Finally, we use a set of 10000 training and 10000 test images for a supervised task experiment. We use the labels in the MNIST data and perform training and classification using an `2-regularized logistic regression on the encoded features. In addition we use the supervised task test data to evaluate the variational lower bound of the data under the two models (Kingma and Welling, 2014). We show the result of this experiment in Tab. 4. For each comparison we take a different subset of training data which helps demonstrate the variation in lower bound and accuracy when re-training the reference architecture. We use a significance value of 5% and indicate when the test favors one auto-encoder over another or fails to reject the null hypothesis. We find that Relative MMD evaluation of the models closely matches performance on the supervised task and the test set variational lower bound.\nGenerative Moment Matching Networks Architecture Experiments We demonstrate our hypothesis test on a different class of deep generative models called Generative Moment Matching Networks (GMMN) (Li et al., 2015). This recently introduced model has shown competitive performance in terms of test set likelihood on the MNIST data.

Li et al. (2015) proposes to use that model along with an auto-encoder, which is the setup we employ in this work. Here a standard auto-encoder model is trained on the data to obtain a low dimensional representation, then a GMMN network is trained on the latent representations (Fig. 10).\nWe use the relative similarity test to evaluate various architectural choices in this new class of models. We start from the baseline model specified in Li et al. (2015) and associated software. The details of the reference model are specified in Fig. 10.\nWe vary the number of auto-encoder hidden layers (1 to 4), generative model layers(1, 4, or 5), the number of network nodes (all or 50% of the reference model), and use of drop-out on the auto-encoder. We use the same training set of 55000, validation set of 5000 and test set of 10000 as in (Li et al., 2015; Goodfellow et al., 2014). In total we train 48 models. We use these to compare 4 simplified binary network architecture choices using the Relative MMD: using dropout on the auto-encoder, few (1) or more (4 or 5) GMMN layers, few (1 or 2) or more (3 or 4) auto-encoder layers, and the number of network nodes. We use our test to compare these model settings using the validation set as the target in the relative similarity test, and samples from the models as the two sources. To validate our results we compare it to likelihoods computed on the test set. The results are shown in Tab. 5. We see that the likelihood results computed on a separate test set follow the conclusions obtained from MMD on the validation set. Particularly, we find that using fewer hidden layers for the GMMN and more hidden nodes generally produces better models."

Comparisons to other metrics are important for verifying our test is sensible, but it can occlude the fact that MMD is a valid evaluation technique on its own. When evaluating only sample generating models where likelihood computation is not possible, MMD is an appropriate and tractable\nmetric to consider in addition to Parzen-Window log likelihoods and visual appearance of the samples. In several ways it is potentially more appropriate than Parzen-windows as it allows one to consider directly the discrepancy between the test data samples and the model samples while allowing for significance results. In such a situation, comparing the performance of several models using the MMD against a single set of test samples, the RelativeMMD test can provide an automatic significance value without expensive crossvalidation procedures.\nGaussian kernels are closely related to Parzen-window estimates, thus computing an MMD in this case can be considered related to comparing Parzen window log-likelihoods. The MMD gives several advantages, however. First, the asymptotics of MMD are quite different to Parzen-windows, since the Parzen-window bandwidth shrinks as m grows. Asymptotics of relative tests with shrinking bandwidth are unknown: even for two samples this is challenging (Krishnamurthy et al., 2015). Other two sample tests are not easily extendable to relative tests (Rosenbaum, 2005; Friedman and Rafsky, 1979; Hall and Tajvidi, 2002). This is because the tests above rely on graph edge counting or nearest neighbor-type statistics, and null distributions are obtained via combinatorial arguments which are not easily extended from two to three samples. MMD is a U -statistic, hence its asymptotic behavior is much more easily generalized to multiple dependent statistics.\nThere are two primary advantages of the MMD over the variational lower bound, where it is known (Kingma and Welling, 2014): first, we have a characterization of the asymptotic behavior, which allows us to determine when the difference in performance is significant; second, comparing two lower bounds produced from two different models is unreliable, as we do not know how conservative either lower bound is."

      "text" : "We have described two novel non-parametric statistical hypothesis tests using analogous mathematical derivation based on the estimation of two correlated U -statistics. The first test of relative dependency determines whether a source random variable is significantly more strongly dependent on one target random variable or another. The test is based on\nthe Hilbert-Schmidt Independent Criterion. And the second test of relative similarity determines whether one model generates samples significantly closer to the reference distribution than the other. The criterion is based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy. We have shown that both test are consistent, are strictly more powerful than a test with uncorrelated statistics, and the computation requirements of the tests is quadratic in the sample size. We have applied the test of relative dependency to the problem of identifying relative dependencies between languages using a multilingual corpus, and for discovering the relative relationships between gliomas and genetic information. Additionally, we have shown the application of relative test of similarity to the problem of model selection in deep generative models, and currently an important question in machine learning. Code for our methods is available."

This formulation agrees with the derivation of the covariance matrix and subsequent projection, and provides extra insights. Let D := (d1, ..., dm) be m iid random variables where d := (x, y, z) ∼ Px × Py × Pz. Then the difference of the unbiased estimators of MMD2 [F ,Px,Py] and MMD2 [F ,Px,Pz] is given\nby\nMMD2u [F , x, y]−MMD2u [F , x, z] = 1\nm(m− 1) m∑ i 6=j f(di, dj) (44)\nwith f , the kernel of MMD2 [F ,Px,Py]−MMD2 [F ,Px,Pz] of order 2 as follows\nf(d1, d2) = (k(x1, x2) + k(y1, y2)− k(x1, y2)− k(x2, y1)) (45) − (k(x1, x2) + k(z1, z2)− k(x1, z2)− k(x2, z1))\n= (k(y1, y2)− k(x1, y2)− k(x2, y1))− (k(z1, z2)− k(x1, z2)− k(x2, z1)) (46)\nEq. (44) is a U -statistic and thus we can apply Eq. (39) to obtain its variance. We first note\nEd1(f(d1, d2)) :=〈φ(y1), µy〉 − 〈φ(x1), µy〉 − 〈µx, φ(y1)〉 (47) − (〈φ(z1), µz〉 − 〈φ(x1), µz〉 − 〈µx, φ(z1)〉)\nEd1,d2(f(d1, d2)) := MMD 2 [F ,Px,Py]−MMD2 [F ,Px,Pz]\nWe are now ready to derive the dominant leading term,ζ1, in the variance expression (39).\nTerm ζ1\nζ1 : = Var(Ed1(f(d1, d2))) (48) = Ex1,y1,z1 [(〈φ(y1), µy〉 − 〈φ(x1), µy〉 − 〈µx, φ(y1)〉 − ( 〈φ(z1), µz〉 − 〈φ(x1), µz〉 − 〈µx, φ(z1)〉 )2 ] −(MMD2 [F ,Px,Py]−MMD2 [F ,Px,Pz])2\nWe note many terms in expansion of the squares above cancel out due to independence. For example Ey1,z1 [〈φ(y1), µy〉〈φ(z1), µz〉]− Ey1 [〈φ(y1), µy〉]Ez1 [〈φ(z1), µz〉] = 0. We can thus simplify to the following expression for ζ1\nζ1 = Ey1 [〈φ(y1), µy〉2]− Ey1 [〈φ(y1), µy〉]2 (49) + Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µy〉2]− Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µy〉]2\n+ Ey1 [〈µx, φ(y1)〉2]− Ey1 [〈µx, φ(y1)〉]2 + Ez1 [〈φ(z1), µz〉2]− Ez1 [〈φ(z1), µz〉]2 + Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µz〉2]− Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µz〉]2 + Ez1 [〈µx, φ(z1)〉2]− Ez1 [〈µx, φ(z1)〉]2 − 2(Ey1 [〈φ(y1), µy〉〈µx, φ(y1)〉]− Ey1 [〈φ(y1), µy〉] Ey1 [〈µx, φ(y1)〉]) − 2(Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µy〉〈φ(x1), µz〉]− Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µy〉] Ex1 [〈φ(x1), µz〉]) − 2(Ez1 [〈φ(z1), µz〉〈µx, φ(z1)〉]− Ez1 [〈φ(z1), µz〉] Ez1 [〈µx, φ(z1)〉])\nWe can empirically approximate these terms as follows:\nζ1 ≈ 1\nn(n− 1)2 1T K̃yyK̃yy1−\n( 1\nn(n− 1) 1T K̃yy1\n)2 (50)\n+ 1\nn2m 1TKTxyKxy1−\n( 1\nnm 1TKxy1 )2 + 1\nnm2 1TKxyK T xy1−\n( 1\nnm 1TKxy1 )2 + 1\nr(r − 1)2 eT K̃zzK̃zz1−\n( 1\nr(r − 1) 1T K̃zz1 )2 + 1\nrm2 1TKxzK T xz1−\n( 1\nrm 1TKxz1 )2 + 1\nr2m 1TKTxzKxz1−\n( 1\nrm 1TKxz1 )2 − 2 ( 1\nn(n− 1)m 1T K̃yyKyx1−\n1\nn(n− 1) 1T K̃yy1×\n1\nnm 1TKxy1 ) − 2 ( 1\nnmr 1T K̃TxyKxz1−\n1\nnm 1TKxy1×\n1\nrm 1TKxz1 ) − 2 ( 1\nr(r − 1)m 1T K̃zzK T xz1−\n1\nn(n− 1) 1T K̃yy1×\n1\nnm 1TKxy1\n)\nA.4 Equality\nIn this section, we prove that Eq.

The kernel mean embedding has been used to define metrics for probability distributions which is important for many problems in statistics and machine learning. First, we briefly review the properties of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert-space (RKHS) (Aronszajn, 1950). A RKHS H with a reproducing kernel k(x, y) is a Hilbert space of functions f : X → R with inner product 〈·, ·〉H. Its element k(x, ·) satisfies the reproducing property: 〈f, k(x, ·)〉H = f(x) for any f ∈ H and consequently, 〈k(x, ·), k(y, ·)〉H = k(x, y). We define the feature map φ : X → H by φ(x) = k(x, ·) and using the reproducing property, we obtain that k(x, y) = 〈φ(x), φ(y)〉H. We extend the notion of feature map to the mean embedding of probability measure : Suppose that a space P(X ) consists of all Borel probability measures P on some input space X . we define the mean embedding μ of P associated with a reproduction kernel k by a mapping μ : P(X ) → H, by μP = EX∼P [k(x, ·)] = ∫ X k(·, x)dP(x). The distribution P is mapped to its expected feature map, i.e., to a point in a potentially infinite-dimensional and implicit feature space. The mean embedding μ has the property that Ex∼P [f(X)] = 〈μP, f〉H for any f ∈ H. The notion of universal kernels and characteristic kernels are essential to the study of kernel mean embeddings (Fukumizu et al., 2008). The kernel k is said to be universal if the corresponding RKHS H is dense in the space of bounded continuous functions on X (Steinwart, 2002). It was shown that for a universal kernel k, ‖μP−μQ‖H iff P = Q, i.e. the map μ is injective. The kernel k is said to be characteristic if the map μ is injective and the RKHS H is said to be characteristic if its reproducing kernel is characteristic. This notion was introduced by Fukumizu et al. (2008) and it was shown that Gaussian and Laplacian kernels are characteristic on Rd.",

The first test, called the relative test of dependency, enables us to determine whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on a first target variable or a second. Dependence is measured via the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). The second test, called the relative test of similarity, is use to determine which of the two samples from arbitrary distributions is significantly closer to a reference sample of interest and the relative measure of similarity is based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). To construct these tests, we have used as our test statistics the difference of HSIC statistics and of MMD statistics, respectively. The resulting tests are consistent and unbiased, and (being based on U -statistics) have favorable convergence properties. The effectiveness of the relative dependency test is demonstrated on several real-world problems: we identify languages groups from a multilingual parallel corpus, and we show that tumor location is more dependent on gene expression ∗.
