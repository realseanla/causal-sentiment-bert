    "abstractText" : "A method is presented for the rhythmic pars­<lb>ing problem: Given a sequence of observed<lb>musical note onset times, we simultaneously<lb>estimate the corresponding notated rhythm<lb>and tempo process. A graphical model is<lb>developed that<lb>represents the evolution of<lb>tempo and rhythm and relates these hid­<lb>den quantities to an observable performance.<lb>The rhythm variables are discrete and the<lb>tempo and observation variables are contin­<lb>uous. We show how to compute the<lb>glob­<lb>ally most likely configuration of the tempo<lb>and rhythm variables given an observation of<lb>note onset times. Preliminary experiments<lb>are presented on a small data set. A gen­<lb>eralization to computing MAP estimates for<lb>arbitrary conditional Gaussian distributions<lb>is outlined.",
