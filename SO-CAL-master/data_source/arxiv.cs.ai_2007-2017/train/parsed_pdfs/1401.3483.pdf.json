      "text" : "The 3-SAT problem is the archetypical NP-complete problem, and the difficulty of solving random 3-SAT instances has been shown to be related to the clause to variable ratio, α=M/N , where M is the number of clauses and N the number of variables. A phase transition occurs at the critical value of αc ≈ 4.267: random 3-SAT instances with α<αc are generally satisfiable, while instances with α>αc are not. Instances close to the phase transition are generally hard to solve using local search algorithms (Mezard & Zecchina, 2002; Braunstein, Mezard, & Zecchina, 2005).\nThe survey propagation (SP) algorithm was invented in the statistical physics community using approaches used for analyzing phase transitions in spin glasses (Mezard & Zecchina, 2002). The SP algorithm has surprised computer scientists by its ability to solve efficiently extremely large and difficult Boolean satisfiability (SAT) instances in the phase transition region. The algorithm has also been extended to the SP-y algorithm to handle the maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) problem (Battaglia, Kolar, & Zecchina, 2004).\nProgress has been made in understanding why the SP algorithm works well. Braunstein and Zecchina (2004) first showed that SP can be viewed as the belief propagation (BP) algorithm (Pearl, 1988) on a related factor graph where only clusters of solutions represented by covers have non-zero probability. It is not known whether a similar interpretation can be given to the SP-y algorithm. In this paper, we extend the SP algorithm to handle weighted\nc©2009 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\nMax-SAT instances in a way that preserves the cover interpretation, and we call this new algorithm the Relaxed Survey Propagation (RSP) algorithm. Empirically, we show that RSP outperforms SP-y and other state-of-the-art solvers on random Max-SAT instances. It also outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on a few benchmark Max-SAT instances. On random weighted Max-SAT instances, it outperforms state-of-the-art weighted Max-SAT solvers.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the background literature and mathematical notations necessary for understanding this paper. This includes a brief review of the definition of joint probability distributions over factor graphs, an introduction to the SAT, Max-SAT and the weighted Max-SAT problem, and how they can be formulated as inference problems over a probability distribution on a factor graph. In Section 3, we give a review of the BP algorithm (Pearl, 1988), which plays a central role in this paper. In Section 4, we give a description of the SP (Braunstein et al., 2005) and the SP-y (Battaglia et al., 2004) algorithm, explaining them as warning propagation algorithms. In Section 5, we define a joint distribution over an extended factor graph given a weighted Max-SAT instance. This factor graph generalizes the factor graph defined by Maneva, Mossel and Wainwright (2004) and by Chieu and Lee (2008). We show that, for solving SAT instances, running the BP algorithm on this factor graph is equivalent to running the SP algorithm derived by Braunstein, Mezard and Zecchina (2005). For the weighted Max-SAT problem, this gives rise to a new algorithm that we call the Relaxed Survey Propagation (RSP) algorithm. In Section 7, we show empirically that RSP outperforms other algorithms for solving hard Max-SAT and weighted Max-SAT instances."

      "text" : "First, we will define notations and concepts that are relevant to the inference problems over factor graphs. Factor graphs provide a framework for reasoning and manipulating the joint distribution over a set of variables. In general, variables could be continuous in nature, but in this paper, we limit ourselves to discrete random variables.\nIn this paper, we denote random variables using large Roman letters, e.g., X,Y . The random variables are always discrete in this paper, taking values in a finite domain. Usually, we are interested in vectors of random variables, for which we will write the letters in bold face, e.g., X,Y. We will often index random variables by the letters i, j, k..., and write, for example, X = {Xi}i∈V , where V is a finite set. For a subset W ⊆ V , we will denote\nXW = {Xi}i∈W . We call an assignment of values to the variables in X a configuration, and will denote it in small bold letters, e.g. x. We will often write x to represent an event X = x and, for a probability distribution p, write p(x) to mean p(X = x). Similarly, we will write x to denote the event X = x, and write p(x) to denote p(X = x).\nA recurring theme in this paper will be on defining message passing algorithms for joint distributions on factor graphs (Kschischang, Frey, & Loeliger, 2001). In a joint distribution defined as a product of local functions (functions defined on a small subset of variables), we will refer to the local functions as factors. We will index factors, e.g. ψβ, with Greek letters, e.g., β, γ (avoiding α which is used as the symbol for clause to variable ratio in SAT instances). For each factor ψβ, we denote V (β) ⊆ V as the subset of variables on which ψβ is defined, i.e. ψβ is a function defined on the variables XV (β). In message passing algorithms, messages are vectors of real numbers that are sent from factors to variables or vice versa. A vector message sent from a variable Xi to a factor ψβ will be denoted as Mi→β, and a message from ψβ to Xi will be denoted as Mβ→i."

      "text" : "Given a large set of discrete, random variables X = {Xi}i∈V , we are interested in the joint probability distribution p(X) over these variables. When the set V is large, it is often of interest to assume a simple decomposition, so that we can draw conclusions efficiently from the distribution. In this paper, we are interested in the joint probability distribution that can be decomposed as follows\np(X = x) = 1 Z ∏ β∈F ψβ(xV(β)), (1)\nwhere the set F indexes a set of functions {ψβ}β∈F . Each function ψβ is defined on a subset of variables XV (β) of the set X, and maps configurations xV (β) into non-negative real numbers. Assuming that each function ψβ is defined on a small subset of variables XV (β), we hope to do efficient inference with this distribution, despite the large number of variables in X. The constant Z is a normalization constant, which ensures that the distribution sums to one over all configurations x of X.\nA factor graph (Kschischang et al., 2001) provides a useful graphical representation illustrating the dependencies defined in the joint probability distribution in Equation 1. A factor graph G = ({V, F}, E), is a bipartite graph with two sets of nodes, the set of variable nodes, V , and the set of factor nodes, F . The set of edges E in the factor graph connects variable nodes to factor nodes, hence the bipartite nature of the graph. For a factor graph representing the joint distribution in Equation 1, an edge e = (β, i) is in E if and only if\nthe variable Xi is a parameter of the factor ψβ (i.e. i ∈ V (β)). We will denote V (i) as the set of factors depending on the variable Xi, i.e.\nV (i) = {β ∈ F | i ∈ V (β)} (2)\nWe show a simple example of a factor graph in Figure 1. In this small example, we have for example, V (β) = {1, 2} and V (2) = {β, β′′}. The factor graph representation is useful for illustrating inference algorithms on joint distributions in the form of Equation 1 (Kschischang et al., 2001). In Section 3, we will describe the BP algorithm by using the factor graph representation.\nEquation 1 defines the joint distribution as a product of local factors. It is often useful to represent the distribution in the following exponential form:\np(x) = exp ( ∑ β∈F φβ(xV (β))− Φ) (3)\nThe above equation is a reparameterization of Equation 1, with ψβ(xV (β)) = exp(φβ(xV (β))) and Φ = lnZ. In statistical physics, the exponential form is often written as follows:\np(x) = 1 Z exp(− 1 kBT E(x)), (4)\nwhere E(x) is the Hamiltonian or energy function, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature. For simplicity, we set kBT = 1, and Equations 3 and 4 are equivalent with E(x) = − ∑ β∈F φβ(xV (β)).\nBayesian (belief) networks and Markov random fields are two other graphical representations often used to describe multi-dimensional probability distributions. Factor graphs are closely related to both Bayesian networks and Markov random fields, and algorithms operating on factor graphs are often directly applicable to Bayesian networks and Markov random fields. We refer the reader to the work of Kschischang et al. (2001) for a comparison between factor graphs, Bayesian networks and Markov random fields."

      "heading" : "2.3 Inference on Joint Distributions",
      "text" : "In the literature, “inference” on a joint distribution can refer to solving one of two problems. We define the two problems as follows:\nProblem 1 (MAP problem). Given a joint distribution, p(x), we are interested in the configuration(s) with the highest probability. Such configurations, x∗, are called the maximuma-posteriori configurations, or MAP configurations\nx∗ = arg max x p(x) (5)\nFrom the joint distribution in Equation 4, the MAP configuration minimizes the energy function E(x), and hence the MAP problem is sometimes called the energy minimization problem.\nProblem 2 (Marginal problem). Given a joint distribution, p(x), of central interest are the calculation or estimation of probabilities of events involving a single variable Xi = xi. We refer to such probabilities as marginal probabilities:\npi(xi) = ∑ x\\xi p(x). (6)\nThe notation ∑\nx\\xi means summing over all configurations of X with the variable Xi set to xi. Marginals are important as they represent the underlying distribution of individual variables.\nIn general, both problems are not solvable in reasonable time by currently known methods. Naive calculation of pi(xi) involves summing the probabilities of all configurations for the variables X for which Xi = xi. For example, in a factor graph with n variables of cardinality q, finding the marginal of one of the variables will involve summing over qn−1 configurations. Furthermore, NP-complete problems such as 3-SAT can be simply coded as factor graphs (see Section 2.4.1). As such, the MAP problem is in general NP-complete, while the marginal problem is equivalent to model counting for 3-SAT, and is #P-complete (Cooper, 1990). Hence, in general, we do not expect to solve the inference problems (exactly) in reasonable time, unless the problems are very small, or have special structures that can be exploited for efficient inference.\nOf central interest in this paper is a particular approximate inference method known as the (sum-product) belief propagation (BP) algorithm. We defer the discussion of the BP algorithm to the next section. In the rest of this section, we will describe the SAT, Max-SAT and weighted Max-SAT problems, and how they can be simply formulated as inference problems on a joint distribution over a factor graph."

      "heading" : "2.4 The SAT and Max-SAT Problem",
      "text" : "A variable is Boolean if it takes values in {FALSE,TRUE}. In this paper, we will follow conventions in statistical physics, where Boolean variables take values in {−1,+1}, with −1 corresponding to FALSE, and +1 corresponding to TRUE.\nThe Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is given as a Boolean propositional formula written with the operators AND (conjunction), OR (disjunction), NOT (negation), and parenthesis. The objective of the SAT problem is to decide whether there exists a configuration such that the propositional formula is satisfied (evaluates to TRUE). The SAT problem is the first problem shown to be NP-complete in Stephen Cook’s seminal paper in 1971 (Cook, 1971; Levin, 1973).\nThe three operators in Boolean algebra are defined as follows: given two propositional formulas A and B, OR(A,B) is true if either A or B is true; AND(A,B) is true only if both A and B are true; and NOT(A) is true if A is false. In the rest of the paper, we will use the standard notations in Boolean algebra for the Boolean operators: A ∨B means OR(A,B), A ∧ B means AND(A,B), and A means NOT(A). The parenthesis is available to allow nested application of the operators, e.g. (A ∨B) ∧ (B ∨ C).\nThe conjunctive normal form (CNF) is often used as a standard form for writing Boolean formulas. The CNF consists of a conjunction of disjunctions of literals, where a literal is either a variable or its negation. For example, (X1 ∨ X2) ∧ (X3 ∨ X4) is in CNF, while\nX1 ∨X2 and (X1∧X2)∨(X2∧X3) are not. Any Boolean formula can be re-written in CNF using De Morgan’s law and the distributivity law, although in practice, this may lead to an exponential blowup in the size of the formula, and the Tseitin transformation is often used instead (Tseitin, 1968). In CNF, a Boolean formula can be considered to be the conjunction of a set of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of literals. Hence, a SAT problem is often given as (X,C), where X is the vector of the Boolean variables, and C is a set of clauses. Each clause in C is satisfied by a configuration if it evaluates to TRUE for that configuration. Otherwise, it is said to be violated by the configuration. We will use Greek letters (e.g. β, γ) as indices for clauses in C, and denote by V (β) as the set of variables in the clause β ∈ C. The K-SAT problem is a SAT problem for which each clause in C consists of exactly K literals. The K-SAT problem is NP-complete, for K ≥ 3 (Cook, 1971).\nThe maximum satisfiability problem (Max-SAT) problem is the optimization version of the SAT problem, where the aim is to minimize the number of violated constraints in the formula. We define a simple working example of the Max-SAT problem that we will use throughout the paper:\nExample 1. Define an instance of the Max-SAT problem in CNF with the following clauses β1 = (x1∨x2), β2 = (x2∨x3), β3 = (x3∨x1), β4 = (x1∨x2∨x3), β5 = (x1∨x2∨x3) and β6 = (x1 ∨ x2). The Boolean expression representing this problem would be\n(x1 ∨ x2) ∧ (x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (x3 ∨ x1) ∧ (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3) ∧ (x1 ∨ x2). (7)\nThe objective of the Max-SAT problem would be to find a configuration minimizing the number of violated clauses."

      "text" : "The SAT problem in CNF can easily be represented as a joint distribution over a factor graph. In the following definition, we give a possible definition of a joint distribution over Boolean configurations for a given SAT instance, where the Boolean variables take values in {−1,+1}.\nDefinition 1. Given an instance of the SAT problem, (X,C) in conjunctive normal form, where X is a vector of N Boolean variables. We define the energy, E(x), and the distribution, p(x), over configurations of the SAT instance (Battaglia et al., 2004)\n∀β ∈ C, Cβ(xV (β)) = ∏\ni∈V (β)\n1 2 (1 + Jβ,ixi), (8)\nE(x) = ∑ β∈C Cβ(xV (β)), (9)\np(x) = 1 Z exp(−E(x)), (10)\nwhere x ∈ {−1,+1}N , and Jβ,i takes values in {−1,+1}. If Jβ,i = +1 (resp. −1), then β contains Xi as a negative (resp. positive) literal. Each clause β is satisfied if one of its variables Xi takes the value −Jβ,i. When a clause β is satisfied, Cβ(xV (β)) = 0. Otherwise Cβ(xV (β)) = 1.\nWith the above definition, the energy function is zero for satisfying configurations, and equals the number of violated clauses for non-satisfying configuration. Hence, satisfying configurations of the SAT instance are the MAP configurations of the factor graph.\nIn this section, we make some definitions that will be useful in the rest of the paper. For a clause β containing a variable Xi (associated with the value of Jβ,i), we will say that Xi satisfies β if Xi = −Jβ,i. In this case, the clause β is satisfied regardless of the values taken by the other variables. Conversely, we say that Xi violates β if Xi does not satisfy β. In this case, it is still possible that β is satisfied by other variables.\nDefinition 2. For a clause β ∈ C, we define uβ,i (resp. sβ,i) as the value of Xi ∈ {−1,+1} that violates (resp. satisfies) clause β. This means that sβ,i = −Jβ,i and uβ,i = +Jβ,i. We define the following sets\nV +(i) = {β ∈ V (i); sβ,i = +1}, V −(i) = {β ∈ V (i); sβ,i = −1}, V sβ (i) = {γ ∈ V (i) \\ {β}; sβ,i = sγ,i}, V uβ (i) = {γ ∈ V (i) \\ {β}; sβ,i 6= sγ,i}.\n(11)\nIn the above definitions, V +(i) (resp. V −(i)) is the set of clauses that contain Xi as a positive literal (resp. negative literal). V sβ (i) (resp. V u β (i)) is the set of clauses containing Xi that agrees (resp. disagrees) with the clause β concerning Xi. These sets will be useful when we define the SP message passing algorithms for SAT instances.\nThe factor graph representing the Max-SAT instance given in Example 1 is shown in Figure 2. For this example, V +(1) = {β3, β5, β6}, V −(1) = {β1, β4}, V sβ3(1) = {β5, β6}, and V uβ3(1) = {β1, β4}. The energy for this example is as follows:\nE(x) = 1 4 (1 + x1)(1− x2) + 1 4 (1 + x2)(1− x3) + 1 4\n(1 + x3)(1− x1) + 1 8 (1 + x1)(1 + x2)(1 + x3) + 1 8 (1− x1)(1− x2)(1− x3) + 1 4 (1− x1)(1− x2) (12)"

      "text" : "The SAT problem is well studied in computer science: as the archetypical NP-complete problem, it is common to reformulate other NP-complete problems such as graph coloring as a SAT problem (Prestwich, 2003). SAT solvers are either complete or incomplete. The best known complete solver for solving the SAT problem is probably the Davis-PutnamLogemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm (Davis & Putnam, 1960; Davis, Logemann, & Loveland, 1962). The DPLL algorithm is a basic backtracking algorithm that runs by choosing a literal, assigning a truth value to it, simplifying the formula and then recursively checking if the simplified formula is satisfiable; if this is the case, the original formula is satisfiable; otherwise, the same recursive check is done assuming the opposite truth value. Variants of the DPLL algorithm such as Chaff (Moskewicz & Madigan, 2001), MiniSat (Een & Sörensson, 2005), and RSAT (Pipatsrisawat & Darwiche, 2007) are among the best performers in recent SAT competitions (Berre & Simon, 2003, 2005). Solvers such as satz (Li & Anbulagan, 1997) and cnfs (Dubois & Dequen, 2001) have also been making progress in solving hard random 3-SAT instances.\nMost solvers that participated in recent SAT competitions are complete solvers. While incomplete or stochastic solvers do not show that a SAT instance is unsatisfiable, they are often able to solve larger satisfiable instances than complete solvers. Incomplete solvers usually start with a randomly initialized configuration, and different algorithms differ in the way they flip selected variables to move towards a solution. One disadvantage of such an approach is that in hard SAT instances, a large number of variables have to be flipped to move a current configuration out of a local minimum, which acts as a local trap. Incomplete solvers differ in the strategies used to move the configuration out of such traps. For example, simulated annealing (Kirkpatrick, Jr., & Vecchi, 1983) allows the search to move uphill, controlled by a temperature parameter. GSAT (Selman, Levesque, & Mitchell, 1992) and WalkSAT (Selman, Kautz, & Cohen, 1994) are two algorithms developed in the 1990s that allow randomized moves when the solution cannot be improved locally. The two algorithms differ in the way they choose the variables to flip. GSAT makes the change which minimizes the number of unsatisfied clauses in the new configuration, while WalkSAT selects the variable that, when flipped, results in no previously satisfied clauses becoming unsatisfied. Variants of algorithms such as WalkSAT and GSAT use various strategies, such as tabusearch (McAllester, Selman, & Kautz, 1997) or adapting the noise parameter that is used, to help the search out of a local minima (Hoos, 2002). Another class of approaches is based on applying discrete Lagrangian methods on SAT as a constrained optimization problem (Shang & Wah, 1998). The Lagrange mutlipliers are used as a force to lead the search out of local traps.\nThe SP algorithm (Braunstein et al., 2005) has been shown to beat the best incomplete solvers in solving hard random 3-SAT instances efficiently. SP estimates marginals on all variables and chooses a few of them to fix to a truth value. The size of the instance is then reduced by removing these variables, and SP is run again on the remaining instance. This iterative process is called decimation in the SP literature. It was shown empirically that SP rarely makes any mistakes in its decimation, and SP solves very large 3-SAT instances that are very hard for local search algorithms. Recently, Braunstein and Zecchina (2006) have\nshown that by modifying BP and SP updates with a reinforcement term, the effectiveness of these algorithms as solvers can be further improved."

      "text" : "The weighted Max-SAT problem is a generalization of the Max-SAT problem, where each clause is assigned a weight. We define an instance of the weighted Max-SAT problem as follows:\nDefinition 3. A weighted Max-SAT instance (X,C,W) in CNF consists of X, a vector of N variables taking values in {−1,+1}, C, a set of clauses, and W, the set of weights for each clause in C. We define the energy of the weighted Max-SAT problem as\nE(x) = ∑ β∈C ∏ i∈V (β) wβ 2 (1 + Jβ,ixi), (13)\nwhere x ∈ {−1,+1}N , and Jβ,i takes values in {−1,+1}, and wβ is the weight of the clause β. The total energy, E(x), of a configuration x equals the total weight of violated clauses.\nSimilarly to SAT, there are also complete and incomplete solvers for the weighted MaxSAT problem. Complete weighted Max-SAT solvers involve branch and bound techniques by calculating bounds on the cost function. Larrosa and Heras (2005) introduced a framework that integrated the branch and bound techniques into a Max-DPLL algorithm for solving the Max-SAT problem. Incomplete solvers generally employ heuristics that are similar to those used for SAT problems. An example of an incomplete method is the min-conflicts hillclimbing with random walks algorithm (Minton, Philips, Johnston, & Laird, 1992). Many SAT solvers such as WalkSAT can be extended to solve weighted Max-SAT problems, where the weights are used as a criterion in the selection of variables to flip.\nAs a working example in this paper, we define the following instance of a weighted Max-SAT problem:\nExample 2. We define a set of weighted Max-SAT clauses in the following table:\nId Clause Weight - - - - - + - + - - + + + - - + - + + + - + + + β1 x1 ∨ x2 1 3 3 3 3 5 5 3 3 β2 x2 ∨ x3 2 3 3 5 3 3 3 5 3 β3 x3 ∨ x1 3 3 5 3 5 3 3 3 3 β4 x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 β5 x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3 5 5 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 β6 x1 ∨ x2 6 5 5 3 3 3 3 3 3\nEnergy 1 9 2 3 1 1 2 4\nThis weighted Max-SAT example has the same variables and clauses as the Max-SAT example given in Example 1. In the above table, we show the clauses satisfied (a tick) or violated (a cross) by each of the 8 possible configurations of the 3 variables. In the first\nrow, the symbol − corresponds to the value −1, and + corresponds to +1. For example, the string “−−+ ” corresponds to the configuration (X1, X2, X3) = (−1,−1,+1). The last row of the table shows the energy of the configuration in each column.\nThe factor graph for this weighted Max-SAT example is the same as the one for the Max-SAT example in Example 1. The differences between the two examples are in the clause weights, which are reflected in the joint distribution, but not in the factor graph. The energy for this example is as follows:\nE(x) = 1 4 (1 + x1)(1− x2) + 2 4 (1 + x2)(1− x3) + 3 4\n(1 + x3)(1− x1) + 4 8 (1 + x1)(1 + x2)(1 + x3) + 5 8 (1− x1)(1− x2)(1− x3) + 6 4 (1− x1)(1− x2)(14)"

      "heading" : "2.6 Phase Transitions",
      "text" : "The SP algorithm has been shown to work well on 3-SAT instances near its phase transition, where instances are known to be very hard to solve. The term “phase transition” arises from the physics community. To understand the notion of “hardness” in optimization problems, computer scientists and physicists have been studying the relationship between computational complexity in computer science and phase transitions in statistical physics. In statistical physics, the phenomenon of phase transitions refers to the abrupt changes in one or more physical properties in thermodynamic or magnetic systems with a small change in the value of a variable such as the temperature. In computer science, it has been observed that in random ensembles of instances such as K-SAT, there is a sharp threshold where randomly generated problems undergo an abrupt change in properties. For example, in K-SAT, it has been observed empirically that as the clause to variable ratio α changes, randomly generated instances change abruptly from satisfiable to unsatisfiable at a particular value of α, often denoted as αc. Moreover, instances generated with a value of α close to αc are found to be extremely hard to solve.\nComputer scientists and physicists have worked on bounding and calculating the precise value of αc where the phase transition for 3-SAT occurs. Using the cavity approach, physicists claim that αc ≈ 4.267 (Mezard & Zecchina, 2002). While their derivation of the value of αc is non-rigorous, it is based on this derivation that they formulated the SP algorithm. Using rigorous mathematical approaches, the upper bounds to the value of αc can be derived using first-order methods. For example, in the work of Kirousis, Kranakis, Krizanc, and Stamatiou (1998), αc for 3-SAT was upper bounded by 4.571. Achlioptas, Naor and Peres (2005) lower-bounded the value of αc using a weighted second moments method, and their lower bound is close to the upper bounds for K-SAT ensembles for large values of K. However, their lower bound for 3-SAT is 2.68, rather far from the conjectured value of 4.267. A better (algorithmic) lower bound of 3.52 can be obtained by analyzing the behavior of algorithms that find SAT configurations (Kaporis, Kirousis, & Lalas, 2006).\nPhysicists have also shown rigorously using second moment methods that as α approaches αc, the search space fractures dramatically, with many small solution clusters appearing relatively far apart from each other (Mezard, Mora, & Zecchina, 2005). Clusters of solutions are generally defined as a set of connected components of the solution space, where two adjacent solutions have a Hamming distance of 1 (differ by one variable). Daude,\nMezard, Mora, and Zecchina (2008) redefined the notion of clusters by using the concept of x-satisfiability: a SAT instance is x-satisfiable if there exists two solutions differing by Nx variables, where N is the total number of variables. They showed that near the phase transition, x goes from around 12 to very small values, without going through a phase of intermediate values. This clustering phenomenon explains why instances generated with α close to αc are extremely hard to solve with local search algorithm: it is difficult for the local search algorithm to move from a local minimum to the global minimum."

For example, in the speech recognition community, the BP algorithm is known as the forward-backward procedure (Rabiner & Juang, 1993). On tree-structured factor graphs, the BP algorithm is simply a dynamic programming approach applied to the tree structure, and it can be shown that BP calculates the marginals for each variable in the factor graph (i.e. solving Problem 2). In loopy factor graphs, the BP algorithm has been found to provide a reasonable approximation to solving the marginal problem when the algorithm converges. In this case, the BP algorithm is often called the loopy BP algorithm. Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2005) have shown that the fixed points of the loopy BP algorithm correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe free energy, and is hence a sensible approximate method for estimaing marginals.\nIn this section, we will first describe the BP algorithm as a dynamic programming method for solving the marginal problem (Problem 2) for tree-structured factor graphs. We will also briefly describe how the BP algorithm can be applied to factor graphs with loops, and refer the reader to the work of Yedidia et al. (2005) for the underlying theoretical justification in this case.\nGiven a factor graph representing a distribution p(x), the BP algorithm involves iteratively passing messages from factor nodes β ∈ F to variable nodes i ∈ V , and vice versa. Each factor node β represents a factor ψβ, which is a factor in the joint distribution given in Equation 1. In Figure 3, we give an illustration of how the messages are passed between factor nodes and variable nodes. Each Greek alphabet (e.g. β ∈ F ) in a square represents a factor (e.g. ψβ) and each Roman alphabet (e.g. i ∈ V ) in a circle represents a variable (e.g. Xi).\nThe factor to variable messages (e.g. Mβ→i), and the variable to factor messages (e.g. Mi→β) are vectors of real numbers, with length equal to the cardinality of the variable Xi.\nWe denote by Mβ→i(xi) or Mi→β(xi) the component of the vector corresponding to the value Xi = xi.\nThe message update equations are as follows:\nMj→β(xj) = ∏\nβ′∈V (j)\\β Mβ′→j(xj) (15)\nMβ→i(xi) = ∑\nxV (β)\\xi\nψβ(xV (β)) ∏\nj∈V (β)\\i Mj→β(xj), (16)\nwhere ∑\nxV (β)\\xi means summing over all configurations XV (β) with Xi set to xi. For a tree-structured factor graph, the message updates can be scheduled such that after two parses over the tree structure, the messages will converge. Once the messages converge, the beliefs at each variable node are calculated as follows:\nBj(xj) = ∏\nβ∈V (j) Mβ→j(xj). (17)\nFor a tree-structured graph, the normalized beliefs for each variable will be equal to its marginals.\nINPUT: A joint distribution p(x) defined over a tree-structured factor graph ({V, F}, E), and a variable Xi ∈ X.\nOUTPUT: Exact marginals for the variable Xi.\nALGORITHM :\nThe algorithm for calculating the exact marginals of a given variable Xi, is given in Figure 4. This algorithm is simply a dynamic programming procedure for calculating the marginals, pi(Xi), by organizing the sums so that the sums at the leaves are done first. For the simple example in Figure 1, for calculating p1(x1), the sum can be ordered as follows:\np1(x1) = ∑\nx2,x3,x4\np(x)\n= ψβ(x1, x2) ∑ x2 . ∑ x3 ψβ′(x1, x3) ∑ x4 ψβ′′(x2, x4)\nThe BP algorithm simply carries out this sum by using the node for X1 as the root of the tree-structured factor graph in Figure 1.\nThe BP algorithm can also be used for calculating marginals for all variables efficiently, with the message passing schedule given in Figure 5. This schedule involves selecting a random variable node as the root of the tree, and then passing the messages from the leaves to the root, and back down to the leaves, After the two parses, all the message updates required in the algorithm in Figure 4 for any one variable would have been performed, and the beliefs of all the variables can be calculated from the messages. The normalized beliefs for each variable will be equal to the marginals for the variable.\nINPUT: A joint distribution p(x) defined over a tree-structured factor graph (V, F ).\nOUTPUT: Exact marginals for all variables in V .\nALGORITHM :\nIf the factor graph is not tree-structured (i.e. contains loops), then the message updates cannot be scheduled in the simple way described in the algorithm in Figure 5. In this case, we can still apply BP by iteratively updating the messages with Equations 15 and 16, often in a round-robin manner over all factor-variable pairs. This is done until all the messages converge (i.e. the messages do not change over iterations). There is no guarantee that all the messages will converge for general factor graphs. However, if they do converge, it was observed that the beliefs calculated with Equation 17 are often a good approximation of the exact beliefs of the joint distribution (Murphy, Weiss, & Jordan, 1999). When applied in this manner, the BP algorithm is often called the loopy BP algorithm. Recently, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2001, 2005) have shown that loopy BP has an underlying variational principle. They showed that the fixed points of the BP algorithm correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe free energy. This fact serves in some sense to justify the BP algorithm even when the factor graph it operates on has loops, because minimizing the Bethe free energy is a sensible approximation procedure for solving the marginal problem. We refer the reader to the work of Yedidia et al. (2005) for more details.\n4. Survey Propagation: The SP and SP-y Algorithms\nRecently, the SP algorithm (Braunstein et al., 2005) has been shown to beat the best incomplete solvers in solving hard 3-SAT instances efficiently. The SP algorithm was first derived from principles in statistical physics, and can be explained using the cavity approach (Mezard & Parisi, 2003). It was first given a BP interpretation in the work of Braunstein and Zecchina (2004). In this section, we will define the SP and the SP-y algorithms for solving SAT and Max-SAT problems, using a warning propagation interpretation for these algorithms."

      "text" : "In Section 2.4.1, we have defined a joint distribution for the SAT problem (X,C), where the energy function of a configuration is equal to the number of violated clauses for the configuration. In the factor graph ({V, F}, E) representing this joint distribution, the variable nodes in V correspond to the Boolean variables in X, and each factor node in F represents a clause in C. In this section, we provide an intuitive overview of the SP algorithm as it was formulated in the work of Braunstein et al. (2005).\nThe SP algorithm can be defined as a message passing algorithm on the factor graph ({V, F}, E). Each factor β ∈ F passes a single real number, ηβ→i to a neighboring variable Xi in the factor graph. This real number ηβ→i is called a survey. According to the warning propagation interpretation given in the work of Braunstein et al. (2005), the survey ηβ→i corresponds to the probability1 of the warning that the factor β is sending to the variable Xi. Intuitively, if ηβ→i is close to 1, then the factor β is warning the variable Xi against taking a value that will violate the clause β. If ηβ→i is close to 0, then the factor β is indifferent over the value taken by Xi, and this is because the clause β is satisfied by other variables in V (β).\nWe first define the messages sent from a variable Xj to a neighboring factor β, as a function of the inputs from other factors containing Xj , i.e. {ηβ′→j}β′∈V (j)\\β. In SP, this message is a vector of three numbers, Πuj→β,Π s j→β, and Π 0 j→β, with the following interpretations:\nΠuj→β is the probability that Xj is warned (by other clauses) to take a value that will violate the clause β. Πsj→β is the probability that Xj is warned (by other clauses) to take a value that will satisfy the clause β. Π0j→β is the probability that Xj is free to take any value.\nWith these defintions, the update equations are as follows: Πuj→β = [1− ∏\nβ′∈V u β (j)\n(1− ηβ′→j)] ∏\nβ′∈V s β (j)\n(1− ηβ′→j), (18)\nΠsj→β = [1− ∏\nβ′∈V s β (j)\n(1− ηβ′→j)] ∏\nβ′∈V u β (j)\n(1− ηβ′→j), (19)\n1. SP reasons over clusters of solutions, and the probability of a warning in this section is used loosely in the SP literature to refer to the fraction of clusters for which the warning applies. In the next section, we will define a rigorous probability distribution over covers for the RSP algorithm.\nΠ0j→β = ∏\nβ′∈V (j) (1− ηβ′→j), (20)\nηβ→i = ∏\nj∈V (β)−i\nΠuj→β Πuj→β + Π s j→β + Π 0 j→β\n(21)\nThese equations are defined using the sets of factors V uβ (j) and V s β (j), which has been defined in Section 2.4.1. For the event where the variable Xj is warned to take on a value violating β, it has to be (a) warned by at least one factor β′ ∈ V uβ (j) to take on a satisfying value for β′, and (b) all the other factors in V sβ (j) are not sending warnings. In Equation 18, the probability of this event, Πuj→β, is a product of two terms, the first corresponding to event (a) and the second to event (b). The definitions of Πsj→β and Π 0 j→β are defined in a similar manner. In Equation 21, the final survey ηβ→i is simply the probability of the joint event that all incoming variables Xj are violating the clause β, forcing the last variable Xi to satisfy β.\nThe SP algorithm consists of iteratively running the above update equations until the surveys converge. When the surveys converged, we can then calculate local biases as follows:\nΠ+j = [1− ∏\nβ∈V +(j) (1− ηβ′→j)] ∏ β∈V −(j) (1− ηβ→j), (22)\nΠ+j = [1− ∏\nβ∈V −(j) (1− ηβ′→j)] ∏ β∈V +(j) (1− ηβ→j), (23)\nΠ0j = ∏\nβ∈V (j) (1− ηβ→j), (24)\nW+i = Π+j\nΠ+j + Π − j + Π 0 j\n(25)\nW−i = Π−j\nΠ+j + Π − j + Π 0 j\n(26)\nTo solve an instances of the SAT problem, the SP algorithm is run until it converges, and a few variables that are highly constrained are set to their preferred values. The SAT instance is then reduced to a smaller instance, and SP can be run again on the smaller instance. This continues until SP fails to set any more variables, and in this case, a local search algorithm such as WalkSAT is run on the remaining instance. This algorithm, called the survey inspired decimation algorithm (Braunstein et al., 2005), is given in the algorithm in Figure 6.\n4.2 The SP-y Algorithm\nIn contrast to the SP algorithm, the SP-y algorithm’s objective is to solve Max-SAT instances, and hence clauses are allowed to be violated, at a price. The SP algorithm can be understood as a special case of the SP-y algorithm, with y taken to infinity (Battaglia et al., 2004). In SP-y, a penalty value of exp(−2y) is multiplied into the distribution for each violated clause. Hence, although the message passing algorithm allows the violation of clauses, but as the value of y increases, the surveys will prefer configurations that violate a minimal number of clauses.\nINPUT: A SAT problem, and a constant k.\nOUTPUT: A satisfying configuration, or report FAILURE.\nALGORITHM :\nThe SP-y algorithm can still be understood as a message passing algorithm over factor graphs. As in SP, each factor, β, passes a survey, ηβ→i, to a neighboring variable Xi, corresponding to the probability of the warning. To simplify notations, we define η+β→i (resp. η−β→i) to be the probability of the warning against taking the value +1 (resp. −1), and we define η0β→i = 1 − η + β→i − η − β→i. In practice, since a clause can only warn against either +1 or −1 but not both, either η+β→i or η − β→i equals zero: η Jβ,i β→i = ηβ→i, and η −Jβ,i β→i = 0, where Jβ,i is defined in Definition 1. Since clauses can be violated, it is insufficient to simply keep track of whether a variable has been warned against a value or not. It is now necessary to keep track of how many times the variable has been warned against each value, so that we know how many clauses will be violated if the variable was to take a particular value. Let H+j→β (resp. H − j→β) be the number of times the variable Xj is warned by factors in {β′}β′∈V (j)\\β against the value +1 (resp. −1). In SP-y, the variable Xj will be forced by β to take the value +1 if H+j→β is smaller than H−j→β, and the penalty in this case will be exp(−2yH + j→β). In notations used in the work of Battaglia et al. (2004) describing SP-y, let hj→β = H+j→β −H − j→β.\nBattaglia et al. (2004) defined the SP-y message passing equations that calculate the probability distribution over hj→β, based on the input surveys,\n{ηβ′→j}β′∈V (j)\\β = {ηβ1→j , ηβ2→j , ..., ηβ(|V (j)|−1)→j}, (27)\nwhere |V (j)| refers to the cardinality of the set V (j). The unnormalized distributions P̃j→β(h) are calculated as follows:\nP̃ (1) j→β(h) = η 0 β1→iδ(h) + η + β1→iδ(h− 1) + η − β1→iδ(h+ 1), (28)\n∀γ ∈ [2, |V (j)| − 1], P̃ (γ)j→β(h) = η 0 βγ→iP̃ (γ−1) j→β (h)\n+η+βγ→iP̃ (γ−1) j→β (h− 1) exp [−2yθ(−h)] +η−βγ→iP̃ (γ−1) j→β (h+ 1) exp [−2yθ(h)], (29)\nP̃j→β(h) = P̃ (|V (j)|−1) j→β (h), (30)\nwhere δ(h) = 1 if h = 0, and zero otherwise, and θ(h) = 1 if h ≥ 0, and zero otherwise. The above equations take into account each neighbor of j excluding β, from γ = 1 to γ = |V (j)|−1. The penalties exp(−2y) are multiplied every time the value of hj→β decreases in absolute value, as each new neighbor of Xj , βγ , is added. At the end of the procedure, this is equivalent to multiplying the messages with a factor of exp(−2y×min(H+j→β, H − j→β)).\nThe P̃j→β(h) are then normalized into Pj→β(h) by computing P̃j→β(h) for all possible values of h in [−|V (j)|+ 1, |V (j)| − 1]. The message updates for the surveys are as follows:\nW+j→β = |V (j)|−1∑ h=1 Pj→β(h), (31)\nW−j→β = −1∑\nh=−|V (j)|+1 Pj→β(h), (32)\nη −Jβ,i β→i = 0, (33)\nη Jβ,i β→i = ∏ j∈V (j)\\i W Jβ,j j→β, (34)\nη0β→i = 1− η Jβ,i β→i, (35)\nThe quantity W+j→β (resp. W − j→β) is the probability of all events warning against the value +1 (resp. −1). Equation 34 reflects the fact that a warning is sent from β to the variable Xi if and only if all other variables in β are warning β that they are going to violate β.\nWhen SP-y converges, the preference of each variable is calculated as follows:\nW+j = |V (j)|∑ h=1 Pj(h), (36)\nW−j = −1∑\nh=−|V (j)| Pj(h), (37)\nwhere the Pj(h) are calculated in a similar manner as the Pj→β(h), except that it does not exclude β in its calculations.\nWith the above definitions for message updates, the SP-y algorithm can be used to solve Max-SAT instances by a survey inspired decimation algorithm similar to the one for\nSP given in the algorithm in Figure 6. At each iteration of the decimation process, the SP-y decimation procedure selects variables to fix to their preferred values based on the quantity\nbfix(j) = |W+j −W − j | (38)\nIn the work of Battaglia et al. (2004), an additional backtracking process was introduced to make the decimation process more robust. This backtracking process allows the decimation procedure to unfix variables already fixed to their values. For a variable Xj fixed to the value xj , the following quantities are calculated:\nbbacktrack(j) = −xj(W+j −W − j ) (39)\nVariables are ranked according to this quantity and the top variables are chosen to be unfixed. In the algorithm in Figure 7, we show the backtracking decimation algorithm for SP-y (Battaglia et al., 2004), where the value of y is either given as input, or can be determined empirically.\nINPUT: A Max-SAT instance and a constant k. Optional input: yin and a backtracking probability r.\nOUTPUT: A configuration.\nALGORITHM :"

However, their formulation cannot be generalized to explain the SP-y algorithm which is applicable to Max-SAT problems. In a previous paper (Chieu & Lee, 2008), we extended the formulation in the work of Maneva et al. (2004) to address the Max-SAT problem. In this section, we will modify the formulation in our previous paper (Chieu & Lee, 2008) to address the weighted Max-SAT problem, by setting up an extended factor graph on which we run the BP algorithm. In Theorem 3, we show that this formulation generalizes the BP interpretation of SP given in the work of Maneva et al. (2004), and in the main theorem (Theorem 2), we show that running the loopy BP algorithm on this factor graph estimates marginals over covers of configurations violating a set of clauses with minimal total weight.\nWe will first define the concept of covers in Section 5.1, before defining the extended factor graph in Section 5.2. In the rest of this section, given a weighted Max-SAT problem (X,C,W), we will assume that variables in X take values in {−1,+1, ∗}: the third value is a “don’t care” state, corresponding to a no-warning message for the SP algorithm defined in the Section 4."

      "text" : "First, we need to define the semantics of the value ∗ as a “don’t care” state.\nDefinition 4. (Maneva et al., 2004) Given a configuration x, we say that a variable Xi is the unique satisfying variable for a clause β ∈ C if it is assigned sβ,i whereas all other variables Xj in the clause are assigned uβ,j (see Definition 2 for the definitions of sβ,i and uβ,i). A variable Xi is said to be constrained by the clause β if it is the unique satisfying variable for β. A variable is unconstrained if it is not constrained by any clauses. Define\nCONi,β(xβ) = Ind(xi is constrained by β), (40)\nwhere Ind(P ) equals 1 if the predicate P is true, and 0 otherwise.\nAs an illustration, consider the configuration X = (+1,−1,−1) in Example 2. In this configuration, X1 = +1 is constrained by the clauses β5 and β6, X2 = −1 is constrained by β2, while X3 = −1 is unconstrained: flipping X3 to +1 will not violate any additional clauses for the configuration.\nIn the following definition, we redefine when a configuration taking values in {−1,+1, ∗} satisfies or violates a clauses.\nDefinition 5. A configuration satisfies a clause β if and only if (i) β contains a variable Xi set to the value sβ,i, or (ii) when at least two variables in β take the value ∗. A configuration violates a clause β if all the variables Xj in β are set to uβ,j. A configuration x is invalid for clause β if and only if exactly one of the variables in β is set to ∗, and all the other remaining variables in β are set to uβ,i. A configuration is valid if it is valid for all clauses in C.\nThe above definition for invalid configurations reflects the interpretation that the ∗ value is a “don’t care” state: clauses containing a variable Xi = ∗ should already be satisfied by\nother variables, and the value of Xi does not matter. So Xi = ∗ cannot be the last remaining possibility of satisfying any clause. In the case where a clause contains two variables set to ∗, the clause can be satisfied by either one of these two variables, so the other variable can take the “don’t care” value.\nWe define a partial order on the set of all valid configurations as follows (Maneva et al., 2004):\nDefinition 6. Let x and y be two valid configurations. We write x ≤ y if ∀i, (1) xi = yi or (2) xi = ∗ and yi 6= ∗.\nThis partial order defines a lattice, and Maneva et al. (2004) showed that SP is a “peeling” procedure that peels a satisfying configuration to its minimal element in the lattice. A cover is a minimal element in the lattice. In the SAT region, a cover can be defined as follows (Kroc, Sabharwal, & Selman, 2007):\nDefinition 7. A cover is a valid configuration x ∈ {−1,+1, ∗}N that satisfies all clauses, and has no unconstrained variables assigned -1 or +1.\nThe SP algorithm was shown to return marginals over covers (Maneva et al., 2004). In principle, there are two kinds of covers: true covers which correspond to satisfying configurations, and false covers which do not. Kroc et al. (2007) showed empirically that the number of false covers is negligible for SAT instances. For RSP to apply to weighted Max-SAT instances, we introduce the notion of v-cover:\nDefinition 8. A v-cover is a valid configuration x ∈ {−1,+1, ∗}N such that\n1. the total weight of clauses violated by the configuration equals v,\n2. x has no unconstrained variables assigned -1 or +1.\nHence the covers defined in Definition 7 are simply v-covers with v = 0 (i.e. 0-covers)."

      "text" : "In this section, we will define a joint distribution over an extended factor graph that is positive only over v-covers. First, we will need to define functions that will be used to define the factors in the extended factor graph.\nDefinition 9. For each clause, β ∈ C, the following function assigns different values to configurations that satisfy, violate or are invalid (see Definition 5) for β:\nVALβ(xV (β)) =  1 if xV (β) satisfies β exp(−wβy) if xV (β) violates β 0 if xV (β) is invalid\n(41)\nIn the above definition, we introduced a parameter y in the RSP algorithm, which plays a similar role to the y in the SP-y algorithm. The term exp(−wβy) is the penalty for violating a clause with weight wβ.\nDefinition 10. (Maneva et al., 2004) Given a configuration x, we define the parent set Pi(x) of a variable Xi to be the set of clauses for which Xi = xi is the unique satisfying variable in a configuration x, (i.e. the set of clauses constraining Xi to its value). Formally,\nPi(x) = {β ∈ C|CONi,β(xV(β)) = 1} (42)\nIn Example 2, for the configuration x = (+1,−1,−1), the parent sets are P1(x) = {β5, β6}, P2(x) = {β2}, and P3(x) = ∅.\nGiven the weighted Max-SAT instance (X,C,W) and its factor graph, G = ({V, F}, E), we now construct another distribution with an associated factor graph Gs = ({V, Fs}, Es) as follows. For each i ∈ V , let P (i) be the set of all possible parent sets of the variable Xi. Due to the restrictions imposed by our definition, Pi(x) must be contained in either V +(i) or V −(i), but not both. Therefore, the cardinality of P (i) is 2|V +(i)|+2|V −(i)|−1. Our extended factor graph is defined on set of the variables Λ = (Λ1,Λ2, ...,Λn) ∈ X1 × X2 × ... × Xn, where Xi := {−1,+1, ∗} × P (i). Hence this factor graph has the same number of variables as the original SAT instance, but each variable has a large cardinality. Given configurations x for the SAT instance, we denote configurations of Λ as λ(x) = {λi(x)}i∈V , where λi(x) = (xi, Pi(x)).\nThe definitions given so far define the semantics of valid configurations and parent sets, and in the rest of this section, we will define factors in the extended factor graph Gs to ensure that the above definitions are satisfied by configurations of Λ.\nThe single variable compatibilities (Ψi) are defined by the following factor on each variable λi(x):\nΨi(λi(x) = {xi, Pi(x)}) =  0 if Pi(x) = ∅, xi 6= ∗ 1 if Pi(x) = ∅, xi = ∗ 1 for any other valid (xi, Pi(x)) . (43)\nThe first case in the above definition for Pi(x) = ∅ and xi 6= ∗ corresponds to the case where the variable Xi is unconstrained, and yet takes a value in {−1,+1}. Valid configurations that are not v-covers (with unconstrained variables set to −1 or +1) have a zero value in the above factor. Hence only v-covers have a positive value for these factors. In the last case in the above definition, the validity of (xi, Pi(x)) simply means that if xi = +1 (resp. xi = −1), Pi(x) ⊆ V +(i) (resp. Pi(x) ⊆ V −(i).).\nThe clause compatibilities (Ψβ) are:\nΨβ(λ(x)V (β)) = VALβ(xV(β)) ∏ k∈V (β) Ind ( [β ∈ Pk(x)] = CONβ,k(xV (β)) ) , (44)\nwhere Ind is defined in Definition 4. These clause compatibilities introduce the penalties in VALβ(xV (β)) into the joint distribution. The second term in the above equation enforces that the parent sets Pk(x) are consistent with the definitions of parent sets in Definition 10 for each variable Xk in the clause β.\nThe values of x determines uniquely the values of P = {Pi(x)}i∈V , and hence the distribution over λ(x) = {xi, Pi(x)}i∈V is simply a distribution over x.\nTheorem 1. Using the notation UNSAT(x) to represent the set of all clauses violated by x, the underlying distribution p(Λ) of the factor graph defined in this section is positive only\nover v-covers, and for a v-cover x, we have:\np(X = x) = p(Λ = λ(x)) ∝ ∏\nβ∈UNSAT(x) exp(−wβy), (45)\nProof. Configurations that are not v-covers are either invalid or contains unconstrained variables set to −1 or +1. For invalid configurations, the distribution is zero because of the definition of VALβ, and for configurations with unconstrained variables set to −1 or +1, the distribution is zero due to the definition of the factors ψi. For each v-cover, the total penalty from violated clauses is the product term in Equation 45.\nThe above definition defines a joint distribution over a factor graph. The RSP algorithm is a message passing algorithm defined on this factor graph:\nDefinition 11. The RSP algorithm is defined as the loopy BP algorithm applied to the extended factor graph Gs associated with a MaxSAT instance (X,C,W).\nIn Section 6, we will formulate the message passing updates for RSP, as well as a decimation algorithm for using RSP as a solver for weighted Max-SAT instances. As an example, Figure 8 shows the extended factor graph for the weighted Max-SAT instance defined in Example 1.\nDefinition 12. We define a min-cover for a weighted Max-SAT instance as the m-cover, where m is the minimum total weight of violated clauses for the instance.\nTheorem 2. When y is taken to ∞, RSP estimates marginals over min-covers in the following sense: the stationary points of the RSP algorithm correspond to the stationary points of the Bethe free energy on a distribution that is uniform over min-covers.\nProof. The ratio of the probability of a v-cover to that of a (v + )-cover equals exp( y). When y is taken to ∞, the distribution in Equation 45 is positive only over min-covers. Hence RSP, as the loopy BP algorithm over the factor graph representing Equation 45, estimates marginals over min-covers.\nIn the application of RSP to weighted Max-SAT instances, taking y to ∞ would often cause the RSP algorithm to fail to converge. Taking y to a sufficiently large value is often sufficient for RSP to be used to solve weighted Max-SAT instances.\nIn Figure 9, we show the v-covers of a small weighted Max-SAT example in Example 2. In this example, there is a unique min-cover with X1 = +1, X2 = −1, and X3 = ∗.\nManeva et al. (2004) formulated the SP-ρ algorithm, which is equivalent to the SP algorithm (Braunstein et al., 2005) for ρ = 1. The SP-ρ algorithm is the loopy BP algorithm on the extended factor graph defined in the work of Maneva et al. (2004). Comparing the definitions of the extended factor graph and factors for RSP and SP-ρ, we have (Chieu & Lee, 2008):\nTheorem 3. By taking y →∞, RSP is equivalent to SP-ρ with ρ = 1.\nProof. The definitions of the joint distribution for SP-ρ for ρ = 1 (Maneva et al., 2004), and for RSP in this paper differ only in Definition 9, and with y → ∞ in RSP, their definitions become identical. Since SP-ρ and RSP are both equivalent to the loopy BP on the distribution defined on their extended factor graphs, the equivalence of their joint distribution means that the algorithms are equivalent.\nTaking y to infinity corresponds to disallowing violated clauses, and SP-ρ was formulated for satisfiable SAT instances, where all clauses must be satisfied. For SP-ρ, clause weights are inconsequential as all clauses have to be satisfied.\nIn this paper, we disallow unconstrained variables to take the value ∗. In the Appendix A, we give an alternative definition for the single variable potentials in Equation 43. With\nthis definition, Maneva et al. (2004) defines a smoothing interpretation for SP-ρ. This smoothing can also be applied to RSP. See Theorem 6 in the work of Maneva et al. (2004) and the Appendix A for more details."

We believe that the presence of large clusters help the SP algorithm to converge well, but as long as the SP algorithm converges, the presence of clusters is not necessary for good performance.\nWhen covers are simply Boolean configurations (with no variables taking the ∗ value), they represent singleton clusters. We call such covers degenerate covers. In many structured and non random weighted Max-SAT problems, we have found that the covers we found are often degenerate. In a previous paper (Chieu, Lee, & Teh, 2008), we have defined a modified version of RSP for energy minimization over factor graphs, and we show in Lemma 2 in that paper that configurations with * have zero probability, i.e. all covers are degenerate. In that paper, we showed that the value of y can be tuned to favor the convergence of the RSP algorithm.\nIn Section 7.3, we show the success of RSP on a few benchmark Max-SAT instances. In trying to recover the covers of the configurations found by RSP, we found that all the benchmark instances used have degenerate covers. The fact that RSP converged on these instances is sufficient for RSP to outperform local search algorithms."

In the definition of the BP algorithm, we have stated that the message vector passed between factors and variables are of length equal to the cardinality of the variables. In this section, we show that the messages passed in RSP can be grouped into a few groups, so that each message passed between variables and factors has only three values.\nIn RSP, the factor to variable messages are grouped as follows:\nM sβ→i if xi = sβ,i, Pi(x) = S ∪ {β}, where S ⊆ V sβ (i), (all cases where the variable xi is constrained by the clause β),\nMuβ→i if xi = uβ,i, Pi(x) ⊆ V uβ (i), (all cases where the variable xi is constrained to be uβ,i by other clauses),\nM s∗β→i if xi = sβ,i, Pi(x) ⊆ V sβ (i), (all cases where the variable xi = sβ,i is not constrained by β. At least one other variable xj in β satisfies β or equals ∗. Otherwise xi will be constrained),\nM∗∗β→i if xi = ∗, Pi(x) = ∅.\nThe last two messages are always equal:\nM∗β→i = M s∗ β→i = M ∗∗ β→i.\nThis equality is due to the fact that for a factor that is not constraining its variables, it does not matter whether a variable is satisfying or is ∗, as long as there are at least two variables that are either satisfying or is ∗. In the following, we will consider the two equal messages as a single message, M∗β→i.\nThe variable to factor messages are grouped as follows:\nRsi→β:= ∑ S⊆V s β (i)Mi→a(sβ,i, S ∪ {β}),\nVariable xi is constrained by β to be sβ,i,\nRui→β:= ∑ Pi(x)⊆V uβ (i)\nMi→a(uβ,i, Pi(x)), Variable xi is constrained by other clauses to be uβ,i,\nRs∗i→β:= ∑ Pi(x)⊆V sβ (i)\nMi→a(sβ,i, Pi(x)), Variable xi is not constrained by β, but constrained by other clauses to be sβ,i,\nR∗∗i→β:= Mi→β(∗, ∅), Variable xi unconstrained and equals *.\nThe last two messages can again be grouped as one message (as was done in our previous paper, Chieu & Lee, 2008) as follows,\nR∗i→β = R s∗ i→β +R ∗∗ i→β,\nsince in calculating the updates of the Mβ→j messages from the Ri→β messages, only R∗i→β is required.

Both algorithms\n1. include a multiplicative penalty into the distribution for each violated clause.\n2. contain a mechanism for a “don’t care” state. For SP-y, this occurs when a variable receives no warnings from neighboring factors.\nHowever, there are a number of significant differences in the two algorithms.\n1. In RSP, the penalties are imposed as each factor passes a message to a variable. For SP-y, the penalties are imposed when a variable compiles all the incoming warnings, and decides how many factors it is going to violate.\n2. Importantly, in RSP, variables participating in violated clauses can never take the * value. For SP-y, a variable receiving an equal number of warnings from the set of factors {β′}β′∈V (i)\\β against taking the +1 and the −1 value (i.e. hj→β = H+j→β − H−j→β = 0) will decide to pass a message with no warning to β. Hence for SP-y, it is possible for variables in violated clauses to take a “don’t care” state.\n3. In the work of Battaglia et al. (2004) where SP-y was formulated with the cavity approach, it was found that the optimal value of y for a given Max-SAT problem is y∗ = δΣδe , where Σ is the complexity in statistical physics, and e is the energy density (Mezard & Zecchina, 2002). They stated that y∗ is a finite value when the energy of the Max-SAT problem is not zero. In Theorem 2, we show that for RSP, y should be as large as possible so that the underlying distribution is over min-covers. In our experimental results in Figure 12, we showed that this is indeed true for RSP, as long as it converges.\nINPUT: A (weighted) Max-SAT instance, a constant k, and yin\nOUTPUT: A configuration.\nALGORITHM :"

Comparing Figure 11 to Figure 7 for SP-y, the condition used in SPy to check for a paramagnetic solution is replaced by the condition given in Step (2) in Figure 11. In the experimental results in Section 7.1, we used the SP-y implementation\navailable online (Battaglia et al., 2004), which contains a mechanism for backtracking on decimation decisions (see Figure 7).

The random instances are generated by the SP-y code available online (Battaglia et al., 2004). In Figure 12, we compare SP-y and RSP on random Max-3-SAT with different clause-to-variable ratio, α. We vary α from 4.2 to 5.2 to show the performance of SP-y and RSP in the UNSAT region of 3-SAT, beyond its phase transition at αc ≈ 4.267. For each value of α, the number of violated clauses (y-axis) is plotted against the value of y used.\nWe perform the decimation procedure in Figure 11 for RSP, for a fixed value of yin, decimating 100 variables at a time (i.e. k = 100). For SP-y, we run the SP-y code available on line, with the option of decimating 100 variables at each iteration, and with two different settings: with and without backtracking (Battaglia et al., 2004). Backtracking is a procedure used in SP-y to improve performance, by unfixing previously fixed variables at a rate r = 0.2, so that errors made by the decimation process can be corrected. For RSP, we do not run backtracking. Note that the y in our formulation equals to 2y in the formulation in the work of Battaglia et al. (Battaglia et al., 2004).\nBoth SP-y and RSP fail to converge when y becomes large enough. When this happens, the output of the algorithm is the result returned by WalkSAT on the original instance. In Figure 12, we see this happening when a curve reaches a horizontal line, signifying that the algorithm is returning the same configuration regardless of y (we “seed” the randomized WalkSAT so that results are identical when instances are identical). From Figure 12, we see RSP performs more consistently than SP-y: as y increases, the performance of RSP improves, until a point where RSP fails to converge. Interestingly for Max-3-SAT instances, we observed that once RSP converges for a value of y for a given instance, it will continue to converge for the same value of y throughout the decimation process. Hence, the best value of y for RSP is obtainable without going through the decimation process: we can commence decimation at the largest value of y for which RSP converges. In Table 1, we show that RSP outperforms SP-y for α ≥ 4.7, despite the fact that we did not allow backtracking for RSP. We also compare RSP and SP-y with the local search solvers implemented in UBCSAT (Tompkins & Hoos, 2004). We run 1000 iterations of each of the 20 Max-SAT solvers in UBCSAT, and take the best result among the 20 solvers. The results are shown in Table 1. We see that the local solvers in UBCSAT does worse than both RSP and SP-y. We have also tried running complete solvers such as toolbar (de Givry, Heras, Zytnicki, & Larrosa, 2005) and maxsatz (Li, Manyà, & Planes, 2006). They are unable to deal with instances of size 104."

Among the 27 instances, we use the seven largest instances with more than 7000 variables. We run RSP in two settings: decimating either 10 or 100 variables at a time. We run RSP for increasing values of y: for\neach y, RSP fixes a number of spins, and we stop increasing y when the number of spins fixed decreases over the previous value of y. For UBCSAT, we run 1000 iterations for each of the 20 solvers. Results are shown in Table 2. Out of the seven instances, RSP fails to fix any spins on the first one, but outperforms UBCSAT on the rest. Lardeux et al. (2005) did not show best performances in their paper, but their average results were an order of magnitude higher than results in Table 2. Figure 12 shows that finding a good y for SP-y is hard. On the benchmark instances, we run SP-y with the “-Y” option (Battaglia et al., 2004) that uses dichotomic search for y: SP-y failed to fix any spins on all 7 instances.\nThe success of the SP family of algorithms on random ensembles of SAT or Max-SAT problem are usually due to the clustering phenomenon on such random ensembles. As the benchmark instances are not random instances, we attempted to see if the configurations found by RSP do indeed belong to a cover representing a cluster of solutions. Rather disappointingly, we found that for all 6 solutions where RSP outperformed local search algorithms, the variables in the solutions are all constrained by at least one clause. Hence, the v-covers found are degenerate covers, i.e. the covers do not contain variables set to ∗. It appears that the success of RSP on these benchmark instances is not due to the clustering phenomenon, but simply because RSP manages to converge for these instances, for some value of y. Kroc, Sabharwal, and Selman (2009) made a similar observation: the convergence of BP or SP like algorithms is often sufficient for obtaining a good solution to a given problem. As discussed in Section 5.3, the ability to vary y to improve convergence is a useful feature of RSP, but one that is distinct from its ability to exploit the clustering phenomenon."

In the Max-SAT competition 2007 (Argelich, Li, Manya, & Planes, 2007), the largest Max-3-SAT instances used have only 70 variables. For large instances, complete solvers are still not practical, and local search procedures have been the only feasible alternative. SP-y, generalizing SP, has been shown to be able to solve large Max-3-SAT instances at its phase transition, but lacks the theoretical explanations that recent work on SP has generated.\nFor 3-SAT, there is an easy-hard-easy transition as the clause-to-variable ratio increases. For Max-3-SAT, however, it has been shown empirically that beyond the phase transition of satisfiability, all instances are hard to solve (Zhang, 2001). In this paper, we show that\nRSP outperforms SP-y as well as other local search algorithms on Max-SAT and weighted Max-SAT instances, well beyond the phase transition region.\nBoth RSP and SP-y do well on Max-SAT instances near the phase transition. The mechanisms behind SP-y and RSP are similar: both algorithms impose a penalty term for each violated constraint, and both reduce to SP when y → ∞. SP-y uses a population dynamics algorithm, which can also be seen as a warning propagation algorithm. In this paper, we have formulated the RSP algorithm as a BP algorithm over an extended factor graph, enabling us to understand RSP as estimating marginals over min-covers."

For ρ = 1, the SP-ρ algorithm corresponds to the SP algorithm, while for ρ = 0, the SP-ρ algorithm corresponds to the BP algorithm. In this section, we develop a more general version of the extended factor graph defined in Section 5, that incorporates the ρ in SP-ρ. We will call the corresponding RSP algorithm on this new factor graph the RSP-ρ algorithm.\nThe only difference between the factor graph for RSP-ρ and the one in Section 5 is the definition of the variable compatibilities in Equation 43. Following notations in the work of Maneva et al. (2004), we introduce the parameters ω0 and ω∗, and we restrict ourselves to the case where ω0 + ω∗ = 1 (The ρ in SP-ρ or RSP-ρ is equal to ω∗). We redefine the variable compatibilities as follows\nΨi(λi(x) = {xi, Pi(x)}) =  ω0 if Pi(x) = ∅, xi 6= ∗ ω∗ if Pi(x) = ∅, xi = ∗ 1 for any other valid (xi, Pi(x)) , (55)\nwith ω0 + ω∗ = 1. The definition in Equation 43 corresponds to the particular case where ω0 = 0 and ω∗ = 1. In Section 5, we have defined the factor graph so that unconstrained variables must take the value ∗. With the new definition of Ψi above, unconstrained variables are allowed to take on the values −1 or +1 with weight ω0, and the ∗ value with weight ω∗.\nWith the above definition, the joint distribution in Equation 45 is redefined as follows:\nP (x) = P ({xk, Pk}k) ∝ ω n0(x) 0 ω n∗(x) ∗ ∏ β∈UNSAT(x) exp(−wβy). (56)\nwhere n0(x) is the number of unconstrained variables in x taking +1 or −1, and n∗(x) the number of unconstrained variables taking ∗ in x.\nCase ω∗ = 1: we have studied this case in the main paper: the underlying distribution is a distribution which is positive only over v-covers.\nCase ω∗ = 0: in this case, only configurations x with n∗(x) = 0 have non-zero probability in the distribution given in Equation 56. Hence, the value ∗ is forbidden, and all variables take values in −1,+1. A Boolean configuration violating clauses with total weight W has a probability proportional to exp(−yW ). Hence we retreive the weighted Max-SAT energy defined in Equation 13. In this case, the factor graph is equivalent to the original weighted Max-SAT factor graph defined in Definition 3, and hence RSP-ρ is equivalent to the loopy BP algorithm on the original weighted Max-SAT problem.\nCase ω∗ 6= 1 and ω∗ 6= 0: in this case, all valid configurations x violating clauses with a total weight W has a probability proportional to ωn0(x)0 ω n∗(x) ∗ exp(−yW ). Hence, the probability of v-covers in the case where ω∗ = 1 are spread over the lattice for which it is the minimal element.\nWith the above formulation, RSP-ρ can be seen as a family of algorithms that include the BP and the RSP algorithm, moving from BP to RSP as ρ (or ω∗) varies from 0 to 1."

In this paper, we formulate the relaxed survey propagation (RSP) algorithm, which extends the SP algorithm to apply to the weighted Max-SAT problem. We show that RSP has an interpretation of estimating marginals over covers violating a set of clauses with minimal weight. This naturally generalizes the cover interpretation of SP. Empirically, we show that RSP outperforms SP-y and other state-of-the-art Max-SAT solvers on random Max-SAT instances.
