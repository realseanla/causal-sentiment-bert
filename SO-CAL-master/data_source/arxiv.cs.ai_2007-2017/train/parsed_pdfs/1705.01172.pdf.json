      "text" : "From the perspective of classical (Boolean) belief change, the work of Alchourrón et al. (1985) is regarded as the foundation theory for belief revision (AGM theory). Typically, belief change (in a static world) can be categorized as expansion, revision or contraction, and is performed on a belief set, the set of sentences K closed under logical consequence. Revision is when new information α is (possibly) inconsistent with K and K is (minimally) modified so that the new K remains consistent and entails α. Revision is the process which takes place when an agent modifies its beliefs due to receiving new information not previously known or which is more relevant or trustworthy. Except for the movement of information, the physical world is assumed to be completely unchanging.\nWhereas belief revision is considered to take place in a static environment, belief update is thought to be the change in beliefs which takes place due to a dynamic environment. Update refers to the process of bringing beliefs up to date precisely because the world has changed and the agent needs a new, ‘matching’ view on the world.\nFrom the perspective of classical (Boolean) belief change, Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992) developed the first serious theory of update (KM theory). Their theory is different from that of AGM in that their rationality postulates are derived from the understanding that update occurs in a dynamic environment.\nHowever, simply applying AGM theory for revision and KM theory for update has been (indirectly) challenged (Friedman and Halpern, 1999; Kern-Isberner, 2001; Nayak, 2011; Lang, 2007). Further, how to categorize a belief change operator is more challenging when notions of uncertainty are considered, for instance, when using probabilities and rankings. The very definition of belief revision and belief update become more problematic under notions of uncertainty.\nOne kind of probabilistic belief change operation which could potentially ‘relax’ the tension between revision and update is imaging. David Lewis (1976) first proposed imaging to analyse conditional reasoning in probabilistic settings, and it has recently been the focus of several works on probabilistic belief change (Ramachandran et al., 2010; Chhogyal et al., 2014; Rens et al., 2016). Imaging is the approach of moving the belief in worlds possible at one moment to similar worlds compatible with evidence received at a next moment. In other words, the ‘belief-mass’ is shifted to the ‘images’ of the worlds currently believed possible, where the images are the worlds related via new evidence to the currently believed worlds.\nOne of the main benefits of imaging is that it overcomes the problem with Bayesian conditioning, namely, being undefined when evidence is inconsistent with current beliefs. Gärdenfors (1988) and Rens et al. (2016) proposed generalizations of Lewis’s original definition. In this paper we propose a new generalization of imaging – or a family\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n01 17\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 M\nay 2\nof imaging-based belief change operators – and analyse other probabilistic belief change methods with respect to it. In particular, we propose a version of imaging based on the movement of probability mass weighted by the inverse of distances between possible worlds.\nWhether imaging is applicable to revision or update (or both) is still an open question. Gärdenfors (1988) says \"...the imaging method is a general revision method because it gives nontrivial results when...the new information to be accommodated...[contradicts the current beliefs]\". Chhogyal et al. (2014) explore the use of Lewis imaging as a means to construct probabilistic belief revision. They present explicit constructions of three candidates strategies based on imaging and investigate their properties. (Rens et al., 2016) define an imaging operation which relaxes the unique-closest-world assumption of Lewis imaging, and they provide a method of revising (via imaging) a potentially infinite set of belief states in a finite procedure. On the other hand, some researchers have considered imaging to be the probabilistic version of update (Katsuno and Mendelzon, 1992; Dubois and Prade, 1993; Nayak, 2011). Ramachandran et al. (2010) propose a version of imaging for probabilistic belief erasure. In fact, Lewis (1976) himself never said that imaging was meant to be interpreted as one or the other. In this paper we continue to investigate the relationship of imaging to revision and update.\nThe paper makes four contributions. 1) We define Expected Distance Imaging (EDI) and show how Bayesian conditioning, Lewis imaging and generalized imaging can be couched as EDI operations. 2) We define four (new) instantiations of the EDI operation. 3) We define a weight function (as used in EDI), and several properties such a function might have, and explore which of these properties are satisfied by different instantiations of weight functions (for different versions of the EDI operator). 4) We propose a set of rationality postulates for probabilistic belief update.\nDue to space limitations, all proofs of propositions have been omitted.

      "heading" : "2 Background",
      "text" : "We shall work with a finitely generated classical propositional logic. Let P be a finite set of n atoms. Formally, a world w is a unique assignment of truth values to all the atoms in P . There are thus 2n conceivable worlds. An agent may consider some non-empty subset W of the conceivable worlds; W is called the possible worlds. The classical notion of satisfaction is used. World w satisfies (is a model of) α is written w α. Let L be all propositional formulae which can be formed from P and the logical connectives ∧ and ¬, with > abbreviating tautology and ⊥ abbreviating contradiction. Let β be a sentence in L. Mod(β) denotes the set of models of β. β entails α (denoted β |= α) iff Mod(β) ⊆ Mod(α). β is equivalent to α (denoted β≡α) iff Mod(β) = Mod(α).\nOften, in the exposition of this paper, a world will be referred to by its truth vector. For instance, if a two-atom vocabulary is placed in order 〈q,r 〉 and w3 ¬q ∧ r , then w3 may be referred to as 01.\nIn this work, the basic semantic element of an agent’s beliefs is a probability distribution or a belief state\nb = {(w1, p1), (w2, p2), . . . , (wn , pn)},\nwhere {w1, w2, . . . , wn} = W and pi is the probability (real number) that wi is the actual world in which the agent is, with ∑ (w,p)∈b p = 1. For parsimony, let b = 〈p1, . . . , pn〉 be the probabilities that belief state b assigns to w1, . . . , wn where, for instance, 〈w1, w2, w3, w4〉 = 〈11,10,01,00〉, and 〈w1, w2, . . . , w8〉 = 〈111,110, . . . ,000〉. b(α) abbreviates∑ w∈Mod(α) b(w).\nIt is not yet universally agreed what belief change means in a probabilistic setting. One school of thought says that probabilistic expansion (restricted revision) is equivalent to Bayesian conditioning (Gärdenfors (1988, Chap. 5) and Voorbraak (1999) mention this, but no not necessarily agree with it). This is evidenced by Bayesian conditioning (BC) being defined only when b(α) 6= 0, thus making BC expansion equivalent to BC revision. In other words, one could define expansion to be bBCα= {(w, p) | w ∈W, p = b(w |α),b(α) 6= 0}, where b(w |α) can be defined as b(φw ∧α)/b(α) and φw is a sentence identifying w (i.e., a complete theory for w). Note that bBCα=; iff b(α) = 0. This implies that BC is ill-defined when b(α) = 0.\nWe may write b ∗α as b∗α so that we can write b∗α(w), where ∗ is an arbitrary belief change operator. The technique of Lewis imaging for the revision of belief states requires a notion of similarity between worlds. In fact, he implicitly assumes the availability of a mapping of worlds to a total order ≤w on worlds for every fixed w ∈W . Let wα be the least α-world with respect to ≤w . That is, wα α and: if w 6 α, then wα ≤w w ′′ for all w ′′ ∈ Mod(α), and if w α, then wα = w .\nIf we indicate Lewis’s original imaging operation with LI, then his definition can be stated as\nbLIα := {(w, p) | w ∈W, p = 0 if w 6 α, else p = ∑ w ′∈W,w ′α=w b(w ′)}.\nHe calls bLIα the image of b on α. In words, bLIα(w) is zero if w does not model α, but if it does, then w retains all the probability it had and accrues the probability mass from all the non-α-worlds closest to it. This form of imaging only shifts probabilities around; no probabilities are magnified or shrunk. The probabilities in bLIα thus sum to 1 without the need for any normalization."

      "heading" : "3 Non-unique-closest-world Approaches",
      "text" : "Every world having a unique closest α-world is quite a strong requirement. We now mention an approach which relaxes the uniqueness requirement.\nGärdenfors (1988) describes his generalization of Lewis imaging (which he calls general imaging) as “... instead of moving all the probability assigned to a world W i by a probability function P to a unique (“closest”) A-world W j , when imaging on A, one can introduce the weaker requirement that the probability of W i be distributed among several A-worlds (that are “equally close”).” If we interpret Gärdenfors’ approach correctly, he does not provide a constructive method but insists that b#α(α) = 1, where b#α is the image (change) of b on α.\nRens et al. (2016) introduced generalized imaging via a constructive method. It is a particular instance of Gärdenfors’ general imaging. They use a pseudo-distance measure between worlds, as defined by Lehmann et al. (2001) and adopted by Chhogyal et al. (2014).\nDefinition 3.1. A pseudo-distance function d : W ×W → Z satisfies the following four conditions: for all worlds w, w ′, w ′′ ∈W ,\n1. d(w, w ′) ≥ 0 (Non-negativity) 2. d(w, w) = 0 (Identity) 3. d(w, w ′) = d(w ′, w) (Symmetry) 4. d(w, w ′)+d(w ′, w ′′) ≥ d(w, w ′′) (Triangular\nInequality)\nNote that d induces a mapping from worlds to total preorders ≤dw on worlds as follows. w ′ ≤dw w ′′ iff d(w, w ′) ≤ d(w, w ′′). Note that conditions 2 and 4 make ≤dw a total preorder, and that adding conditions 1 and 3 do not necessarily make ≤dw a (total) partial order. This makes it possible for a world to have more than one closest worlds. One may also want to impose a condition on a distance function such that any two distinct worlds must have some distance between them: For all w, w ′ ∈W , if w 6= w ′, then d(w, w ′) > 0 (Faithfulness).\nLet Min(α, w,d) be the set of α-worlds closest to w with respect to pseudo-distance d . Formally,\nMin(α, w,d) := {w ′ α | ∀w ′′ α,d(w ′, w) ≤ d(w ′′, w)},\nwhere d(·) is some pseudo-distance measure between worlds (e.g., Hamming or Dalal distance). For instance, using Hamming distance for d and vocabulary {q,r },\n• Min(¬q,11,d) = {01} • Min(¬q,10,d) = {00} • Min(¬q,01,d) = {01} • Min(¬q,00,d) = {00} Generalized imaging (denoted GI) is defined as\nbGIα := {(w, p) | w ∈W, p = 0 if w 6 α,else p = ∑ w ′∈W\nw∈Min(α,w ′,d)\nb(w ′)/|Min(α, w ′,d)|}.\nb GIα is the new belief state produced by taking the generalized image of b on α. In words, the probability mass of non-α-worlds is shifted to their closest α-worlds, such that if a non-α-world w× with probability p has n closest α-worlds (equally distant), then each of these closest α-worlds gets p/n mass from w×.\nAs an example, let belief state b1.0 := 〈1,0,0,0〉 and let belief state b.3/.7 := 〈0.3,0.7,0,0〉 for vocabulary {q,r }. Then • b0.3/0.7 GI¬q(11) = b0.3/0.7 GI¬q(10) = 0 • b0.3/0.7 GI¬q(01) = 0.3/1+0/1 = 0.3 • b0.3/0.7 GI¬q(00) = 0.7/1+0/1 = 0.7\nand\n• b1.0 GI¬q(11) = b1.0 GI¬q(10) = 0 • b1.0 GI¬q(01) = 1/1+0/1 = 1 • b1.0 GI¬q(00) = 0/1+0/1 = 0"

      "heading" : "4.1 Definition and Properties",
      "text" : "Rens and Meyer (2015) proposed determining the new probability of an α-world wα as the weighted average of the current probabilities of all worlds w ′, where the weights are (inversely) proportional to the distance between wα and the w ′. The reason for bringing in weights is that the probability of worlds w ′ less (more) similar to the α-world wα under consideration, should contribute less (more) to the new probability mass of wα. (Distance and similarity are taken to be inversely proportional in this context.) Building on that idea, we introduce an imaging framework based on weighted distances. The weight functions are defined in terms of inverse-distance functions, which are defined in terms of the pseudo-distance function.\nFirst, we introduce potentially inverse-distance functions ιd : W ×W → R and propose considering the following seven postulates for such functions. For all w, w ′, w ′′, w ′′′ ∈W and all pseudo-distance functions d ,\n1. ιd (w, w ′) ≥ 0 (Non-negativity) 2. ιd (w, w) = 1 (Identity) 3. ιd (w, w ′) = ιd (w ′, w) (Symmetry) 4. if d(w, w ′) ≥ d(w ′′, w ′′′), then ιd (w, w ′) ≤ ιd (w ′′, w ′′′) (Weak Inversity) 5. if d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′), then ιd (w, w ′) < ιd (w ′′, w ′′′) (Strict Inversity) 6. if d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′), then ιd (w, w ′) = ιd (w ′′, w ′′′) (Equi-distance). 7. if w 6= w ′, then ιd (w, w ′) < 1 (Faithfulness)\nDefinition 4.1. A weight function is a function δd : L ×W ×W → R. We say that postulate non-negativity, identity, symmetry, weak inversity, strict inversity, equi-distance or faithfulness is satisfied by δd (α, w, w ′) iff the respective postulate is satisfied by ιd (w, w ′).\nTo start off with, weight functions should be in the range [0,1] so as to support the notion of the expectation of probability. A weight function should thus be non-negative and have a maximum of 1. Moreover, a world’s probability should carry the maximum weight when compared with itself (identity). Symmetry seems like a very natural property to expect of a weight function, especially given the close relationship that such functions have with distance. Weak inversity seems to be the weakest property that promotes some sort of inversity. It would be a useful distinction to be able to say that a weight function is weakly inverse, but not strictly so. Hence the definition of strict inversity. Knowing whether the property of equi-distance holds also seems useful and interesting. Note that equidistance implies symmetry due to symmetry of the pseudo-distance function, and by logic, equi-distance implies weak\ninversity. Finally, whether a weight function is faithfulness seems like a natural question to ask. And note that identity together with strict inversity implies faithfulness.\nDefinition 4.2. Let b be an epistemic state and α a new piece of information. Then the new epistemic state changed with α via EDI is defined as\nbEDIα := {(w, p) | p = 0 if w 6 α, else p = 1 γ ∑ w ′∈W b(w ′)δd (α, w, w ′)},\nwhere γ :=∑w∈Mod(α) ∑w ′∈W b(w ′)δd (α, w, w ′) is a normalizing factor. We may write EDI∗ to indicate that δd is instantiated as δ∗d . For any probabilistic belief change operator ∆, we say that ∆ is EDI-compatible if and only if there exists a function δ∗d such that b∆α= bEDI∗α for all b and α. In the rest of the paper, we shall omit the subscript from δd as long is it is clear from the context or unnecessary to specify for which pseudo-distance function δ is defined.\nDefinition 4.3. A weight function is an inverse-distance weight function iff it satisfies postulates 1-4 above.\nConsider the following three properties a weight function might have.\n• ∀α ∈ L,∀w, w ′ ∈W , if w α and w ′ α, then δ(α, w, w ′) 6= 0 (Evidence Relaxation) • ∀α ∈ L,∀w, w ′ ∈W , if w α and w ′ 6 α, then δ(α, w, w ′) 6= 0 (Non-evidence Relaxation) • ∀α ∈ L,∀w, w ′ ∈W , if w α and w ′ α and w 6= w ′, then δ(α, w, w ′) = 0 (Retention)\n(In the following, an α-world is a world satisfying the new evidence α.) We shall call a weight function e-relaxed iff it satisfies evidence relaxation, and n-e-relaxed iff it satisfies non-evidence relaxation. We shall say that a weight function is relaxed iff it is both e-relaxed and n-e-relaxed. Later, we shall show how α-worlds ‘share’ their mass with other α-worlds during the change process if EDI is applied with an e-relaxed weight function. In such operations, belief mass tends to ‘spread’ among worlds consistent with the same evidence (after repeated change operations). Bayesian conditioning and the versions of imaging mentioned so far are not like this. In the latter operations, α-worlds never give up their mass; they are ‘retentive’. The idea captured by the retention condition says that when collecting probability mass for w (because it is an α world), then do not collect anything from other α worlds. This rule affects equi-distance, weak and strict inversity. In Section 5.1, the reader will see that n-e-relaxed weight functions are also useful.\nDefinition 4.4. The EDI operation is said to be relaxed or retentive iff it satisfies the relaxation, respectively, retention property.\nObserve that a weight functions which satisfy e-relaxation cannot satisfy retention, and vice versa."

It is, however, ill-defined because it is undefined when d(w, w ′) = 0 or d(w, w ′′) = 0 (i.e., when w = w ′ or w = w ′′).1 We thus adapt their definition based on the reciprocal of distance as follows.

This implies that δrcp is weakly and strictly inverse. Equi-distance: Assume d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′). Then δrcp(w, w ′) = η/(d(w, w ′) + η) = η/(d(w ′′, w ′′′) + η = δrcp(w ′′, w ′′′).

Hence, d max+η−d(w,w)d max+η = 1. Equi-distance: Assume d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′). Then d max+η−d(w,w ′)d max+η = d max+η−d(w ′′,w ′′′) d max+η .\nSymmetry is implied by equi-distance.

For all w, w ′, w ′′, w ′′′ ∈W : Clearly, δBC (w, w ′) is non-negative. Identity follows directly from the definition. Weak Inversity: Assume d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′). There are two cases to consider: Either d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′) = 0 or d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′) 6= 0. Assume d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′) = 0. Then w ′′ = w ′′′ and w 6= w ′, in which case, 0 = δBC (w, w ′) < δBC (w ′′, w ′′′) = 1. Now assume d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′) 6= 0. Then w ′′ 6= w ′′′ and w 6= w ′, in which case, δBC (w, w ′) = δBC (w ′′, w ′′′) = 0. By combining the two cases, one sees that the desired result follows. δBC is thus an inverse-distance weight function.\nEqui-distance: Assume d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′). There are two cases to consider: Either d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′) = 0 or d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′) 6= 0. Assume d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′) = 0. Then w = w ′ and w ′′ = w ′′′, in which case, δBC (w, w ′) = δBC (w ′′, w ′′′) = 1. Now assume d(w, w ′) = d(w ′′, w ′′′) 6= 0. Then w 6= w ′ and w ′′ 6= w ′′′, in which case, δBC (w, w ′) = δBC (w ′′, w ′′′) = 0.\nSymmetry is implied by equi-distance. Faithfulness follows directly from the definition. Assume again that d(w, w ′) > d(w ′′, w ′′′) 6= 0. Then w ′′ 6= w ′′′ and w 6= w ′, in which case, δBC (w, w ′) =\nδBC (w ′′, w ′′′) = 0. Thus strict inversity does not hold. Proposition 4.5. δBC is retentive.\nProof. For all w, w ′, w ′′, w ′′′ ∈W : Assume w α and w ′ α and w 6= w ′. Then, immediately, by the definition of δBC , δBC (w, w ′) = 0."

We provide an example for which weak inversity must fail. δLI is thus not an inverse-distance weight function for this example, nor in general.\nRecall that d LI is such that for every α, for each of the worlds, a unique closest α-world can be identified. Observe that EDILI is retentive: Recall the retention property: if w α and w ′ α and w 6= w ′, then δLI (α, w, w ′) = 0.

The proposition is thus entailed by Proposition 4.7.\nLemma 4.1. Let w α. Then, ∀w ∈W,Min(w,α,d) = {w} iff d is faithful.\nProof. Recall that Min(α, w,d) = {w ′ α | ∀w ′′ α,d(w ′, w) ≤ d(w ′′, w)}. Assume d is faithful. Then for all w, w ′ ∈W , if w 6= w ′, then d(w, w ′) > 0. By identity of d , d(w, w) = 0. Hence, Min(w,α,d) = {w}. Assume d is not faithful. Then there exists a pair of worlds w, w ′ ∈ W , such that if w 6= w ′, then d(w, w ′) = 0. Hence, {w, w ′} ⊆ Min(w,α,d). Therefore, it is not the case that Min(w,α,d) = {w}.

      "text" : "To summarize, δrcp and δdfr are relaxed, and δBC and δLI are retentive, and δGI is retentive iff the associated pseudodistance function is faithful.\nLet δrlx be δrcp or δdfr . Let α be a particular piece of evidence and bt the belief state resulting from the t-th repeated application of EDIrlx on the resulting belief states for α. That is, b1 = bEDIrlxα, b2 = b1EDIrlxα, and so on. By running multiple experiments on a computer, we noticed that, as t increases, bt settles on a particular belief state, that is, bt−1 ≈ bt . (Belief states had eight worlds.) We ran 100 trials for each of the four combinations of choices for δrlx and η = 1 or η = 0.0001. For each trial, an initial belief state and evidence was chosen randomly. α ≡ > and α ≡ ⊥ were ignored. Per trial, operation EDI was applied to the resulting belief state ten times with the α selected for that trial. The difference between the probabilities of a world at successive applications of EDI were recorded, and the difference of all worlds averaged. See Figure 1. The figure shows the average for the 100 trials of the average difference at each application of the change operation. Note how the differences asymptotically decrease. Note that these results do not imply that belief states become uniform distributions over α-worlds. In fact, distributions are typically not uniform; distributions seem to be dictated by the mutual reinforcement of α-world probabilities and their corresponding distances from each other. However, whenever exactly two worlds model α, the probability is eventually divided exactly (uniformly) between the two worlds.\nProposition 4.12. Let α be a particular piece of evidence and bt the belief state resulting from the t-th repeated application of EDIrtv on the resulting belief states for α, where δrtv is a retentive inverse-distance weight function. That is, b1 = bEDIrtvα, b2 = b1EDIrtvα, and so on. Then bt = b1 for all t > 1. Proof. By definition of EDIrtv, if w 6 α, then b1(w) = 0, that is, if b1(w) > 0, then w α. Therefore, we are only interested in the potential change in probability of α-worlds. Hence, we consider only δrtv(w, w ′) such that w α. And because w ′ contributes no mass to w if w ′ 6 α, we consider only δrtv(w, w ′) such that w, w ′ α. Then by retention and identity of an inverse-distance weight function, δrtv(w, w ′) = 1 iff w = w ′, else it equals 0. Hence, for all w α, bt (w) =∑w ′∈W bt−1(w ′)δrtv(w, w ′) = bt−1(w) for all t > 1.\nThe difference between retention and relaxation seems important, from the perspective of (formal) epistemology. Suppose w1 α and w2 β have probabilities 0.4, respectively, 0.6. Now if α∧β is successively observed, then according to, for instance, Bayesian conditioning and Lewis imaging, the probabilities of w1 and w2 will not change. We argue that there are situations when their probabilities should be allowed to change. One could argue that if α and β are always observed together, then the probabilities of w1 and w2 should become equal. To put it differently, the fact that the same information is continually received should make a difference to the spread of the likelihood of the constituent parts (atoms) of the information. Nonetheless, information received in a static environment has a different flavor to information received in a dynamic environment (giving rise to belief revision, resp., belief update): Repeated observation of the same piece of information α′ should not change beliefs therein, beyond the first revision.\nThe first in the series of observations revises beliefs, but subsequent observations of α′ have no effect because it is ‘old news’/already learnt. In this sense, revision corresponds to retentive belief change. On the other hand, when the same signal is observed in the environment, every new observation is a further confirmation of the truth of α′, thus modifying one’s belief in the atoms of α′ with every new observation instance (of the same α′). In this sense, update corresponds to evidence-relaxed belief change."

One of the specializations in each case will have the following pattern: Apply the classical operation to determine the newly believed worlds, and then use EDI to determine a probability distribution over them. The other specialization in each case will be a more direct use of EDI. We shall also check, for each of the four operations, which properties the corresponding weight function satisfies. We end this section with a discussion of what it takes to translate classical belief change as EDI in terms of uniform probability distributions.\nKatsuno and Mendelzon (1992) use an example involving a room with a table, a book and a magazine in it to illustrate the difference between revision and update. Suppose we only know that either the book is on the table or the magazine is on the table, but not both. Let book mean the book is on the floor and mag mean the magazine is on the floor. Then our belief state can reasonably be represented as b = 〈0,0.5,0.5,0〉, that is b(book ∧¬mag) = b(¬book∧mag) = 0.5 and b(book∧mag) = b(¬book∧¬mag) = 0. Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992) argued that after revision with book, one should believe book∧¬mag. We thus want\nbEDI◦ book = 〈0,1,0,0〉,\nwhere ◦ indicates revision. And they argued that after update with book, one should believe book. We thus want\nbEDI¦ book = 〈0.5,0.5,0,0〉,\nwhere ¦ indicates update. This is the case when ◦ is BC, and when ¦ is rcp or dfr after an infinite number of EDI¦ with book. However, in this example, b(book) > 0. The question is, What should probabilistic revision (and update) correspond to when b(book) = 0? For instance, what if α = book ↔ mag, given the agent currently believes book ↔ ¬mag? Furthermore, we would like the same operation to be applicable whether or not the evidence contradicts current beliefs."

Finally, assume that ◦ is defined such that Mod(ψb ◦α) = {111,011,010}. Note that Mod(ψb ◦α) ⊆ Mod(α).\nThen d(010,000) = d(110,010) = 1, δClsRev(α,010,000) = δ(α,010,000) = δrcp(α,010,000) = 1/2 and δClsRev(α,110,010) = 0. Therefore, d(010,000) ≥ d(110,010), but δClsRev(α,010,000) 6≤ δClsRev(α,110,010). Hence, weak inversity fails for δClsRev.

Assume “w ′′, w ′′′ α if b(α) = 0” holds, but that “w, w ′ α if b(α) = 0” does not hold. Then δDctRev(α, w, w ′) = δ(α, w, w ′) and δDctRev(α, w ′′, w ′′′) = 0. Now, it could be that δ(α, w, w ′) > 0. Hence, if d(w, w ′) ≥ d(w ′′, w ′′′) it is not in general the case that δDctRev(α, w, w ′) ≤ δDctRev(α, w ′′, w ′′′). Thus, weak inversity fails. This case also shows that equi-distance and strict inversity fail.\nProposition 5.9. δDctRev is faithful iff δ is.\nProof. Assume w 6= w ′. Assume δ is not faithful. Assume b(α) = 0 and w ′ 6 α. Then only the third line is applicable. It could happen that δ(α, w, w ′) = 1, making δDctRev(α, w, w ′) = 1, making δDctRev unfaithful. Now assume δ is faithful. Only the second and third lines are applicable. In both cases, δDctRev(α, w, w ′) < 1 (particularly, δ(α, w, w ′) < 1, because w 6= w ′)."

      "text" : "This approach is the same as we took for probabilistic revision via classical revision; to determine the new knowledge base exactly as one would in classical belief update, and then to assign probabilities to the newly believed worlds.\nRecall that W b := {w ∈W | (w, p) ∈ b, p 6= 0} and ψb is a sentence modeled by all worlds in W b and no others. Let δClsUpd be defined as follows.\nδClsUpd(α, w, w ′) :=  1 if w = w ′ δ(α, w, w ′) if w ∈ Mod(ψb ¦α) 0 otherwise,\nwhere ¦ is some (acceptable) update operator and δ is a relaxed inverse-distance weight function. Proposition 5.10. If Mod(ψb ¦α) = Mod(α), then δClsUpd is relaxed. Proof. Assume Mod(ψb ¦α) = Mod(α). Assume w α. If w = w ′, then only the first line of the definition of δClsUpd is applicable, and δClsUpd(α, w, w ′) 6= 0. If w 6= w ′, then only the second and third lines are applicable. But actually, by the two assumptions, only the second line is applicable. This implies that for all w, w ′ ∈ W , if w α, then δClsUpd(α, w, w ′) 6= 0. Therefore, δClsUpd is relaxed. Proposition 5.11. δClsUpd satisfies non-negativity, identity and symmetry.\nProof. Non-negativity and identity follow directly from the definition of δClsUpd. We look at the three cases (lines) which make up the definition of δClsUpd. If w = w ′, then δClsUpd(α, w, w ′) = δClsRev(α, w ′, w) = 1. If w ∈ Mod(ψb ¦α), then δClsUpd(α, w, w ′) = δ(α, w, w ′). But δ(α, w, w ′) is assumed to be an inverse-distance weight function, which implies that δ(α, w, w ′) is symmetrical. For all other cases (third line), it must be that δClsUpd(α, w, w ′) = δClsUpd(α, w ′, w) = 0.\nProposition 5.12. δClsUpd does not satisfy weak inversity, strong inversity nor equi-distance.\nProof. Suppose the vocabulary has three atoms, the distance function is Hamming and δ is δrcp with η= 1. Assume Mod(ψb) = {101,001,000} and 111,110,011,010 α and all other worlds do not model α. Finally, assume that ¦ is defined such that Mod(ψb ¦α) = {111,011,010}. Note that Mod(ψb ¦α) ⊆ Mod(α).\nThen d(010,000) = d(110,010) = 1, δClsUpd(α,010,000) = δrcp(α,010,000) = 1/2 and δClsUpd(α,110,010) = 0. Therefore, d(010,000) ≥ d(110,010), but δClsUpd(α,010,000) 6≤ δClsUpd(α,110,010). Hence, weak inversity fails for δClsUpd. This case also proves that equi-distance fails.\nDue to strict inversity implying weak inversity, by contraposition, strict inversity fails.\nCorollary 5.2. Because δClsUpd is not weakly inverse, it is not an inverse-distance weight function.\nProposition 5.13. δClsUpd is faithful iff δ is.\nProof. Assume w 6= w ′. Assume δ is not faithful. Next, assume that w ∈ Mod(ψb ¦α). It could thus happen that δ(α, w, w ′) = 1, implying that δClsUpd is not faithful. Now assume δ is faithful. Only the second and third lines are applicable. In both cases, δClsUpd(α, w, w ′) < 1 (particularly, δ(α, w, w ′) < 1, because w 6= w ′)."

Conventionally, (classical) expansion (denoted +) is the logical consequences of K ∪ {α}, where α is new information and K is the current belief set. Or if the current beliefs can be captured as a single sentence β, expansion is defined simply as β+α≡β∧α. We denote the expansion of belief state b with α as b+α .\n(Unless stated otherwise, it is assumed that α is logically satisfiable.) The probabilistic belief revision postulates (adapted from (Gärdenfors, 1988)) in our notation are\n(P◦1) b◦α is a belief state (P◦2) b◦α(α) = 1 (P◦3) If α≡β, then b◦α = b◦β\n(P◦4) If b(α) > 0, then b◦α = b+α (P◦5) If b◦α(β) > 0, then b◦α∧β = (b◦α)+β\nWe take P◦1 - P◦3 to be self explanatory, and to be the three core postulates. P◦4 is an interpretation of the AGM postulate which says that if the evidence is consistent with the currently held beliefs, then revision amounts to expansion.\nP◦5 says that if β is deemed possible in the belief state revised with α, then expanding the revised belief state with β should be equal to revising the original belief state with the conjunction of α and β.\nWe propose adding this postulate:\n(P◦6) If β |=α, then b◦α(β) ≥ b(β) P◦6 says that the belief in an α-world cannot decrease due to the reception of information that α.\nRecall that\nδClsRev(α, w, w ′) :=  1 if w = w ′ δ(α, w, w ′) if w ∈ Mod(ψb ◦α) 0 otherwise,\nwhere ◦ is some (acceptable) revision operator and δ is a non-evidence relaxed and retentive inverse-distance weight function.\nProposition 6.1. (P◦1) is satisfied for EDIClsRev.\nProof. Due to normalization (via γ) in the definition of EDI (Def. 4.2), b◦α is a belief state whenever there exists at least one world w ∈ W s.t. if w α, then ∑w ′∈W b(w ′)δClsRev(α, w, w ′) > 0. Assume that w α. It must be shown that there exists at least one world w ′ for which b(w ′) > 0 and δClsRev(α, w, w ′) > 0.\nProof by contradiction: Let w be an arbitrary world in W . (Main assumption) Assume there exists no world w ′ for which b(w ′) > 0 and δClsRev(α, w, w ′) > 0. Assume w = w ′. Then the first line of the definition of δClsRev is applicable and it must be that b(w ′) = 0. But this is impossible because it implies that for all worlds w , b(w) = 0 (b is implicitly assumed to be well-defined). Therefore, it must be that w 6= w ′.\nLet w ∈ Mod(ψb ◦α) (there must exists at least one such w). Then the second line is applicable. Let b(w ′) > 0 (there must exist at least on such w ′). This implies that δClsRev(α, w, w ′) = 0, which implies that δ(α, w, w ′) = 0. Now, either w ′ α or w ′ 6 α.\nAssume w ′ α. Recall that b(w ′) > 0. Note that the first line will eventually become applicable, making δClsRev(α, w ′, w ′) = 1 and contradicting the main assumption. Therefore, it must be the case that w ′ 6 α. Recall that δ is n-e-relaxed, that is, ∀w, w ′ ∈ W , if w α and w ′ 6 α, then δ(α, w, w ′) 6= 0. This also contradicts the main assumption.\nThere is no other way to satisfy the main assumption. It must thus be the case that there exists some world w ′ for which b(w ′) > 0 and δClsRev(α, w, w ′) > 0, implying that there exists at least one world w ∈ W s.t. if w α, then∑\nw ′∈W b(w ′)δClsRev(α, w, w ′) > 0.

(Main assumption) Assume there exists no world w ′ for which b(w ′) > 0 and δDctRev(α, w, w ′) > 0.\nEither b(α) = 0 or b(α) > 0. Assume b(α) > 0. Then there exists at least one α-world with probability greater than zero. Let w be that world. Thus, when w = w ′, δDctRev(α, w, w ′) = 1 (first line of definition) and the main assumption fails in this case. Assume b(α) = 0. Then there exists at least one non-α-world with probability greater than zero. Let w ′ be that world. Hence, the first and second lines are inapplicable, because “w, w ′ α if b(α) = 0” fails. Therefore, only the third line is applicable. δ is n-e-relaxed, so ∀w, w ′ ∈ W , if w α and w ′ 6 α, then δ(α, w, w ′) 6= 0. By the main assumption, this implies that for all worlds w ′, b(w) = 0. But this contradicts our deduction that there exists some w ′ for which b(w ′) > 0.\nThere is no other way to satisfy the main assumption.

      "text" : "We have proposed probabilistic belief revision and belief update operators, both within an imaging framework. The role of a weight function – usually expected to be inversely proportional to the ’distance’ between worlds – is central to the Expected Distance Imaging (EDI) framework. In this paper, we have only begun the investigation into the behavior or properties of various instantiations of a general form of imaging. There is still much work to be done. For instance, what is the effect of retention versus relaxation and when is one more appropriate than the other? We have worked with the hypothesis that retention relates to revision and that relaxation relates to update, but to what degree is this hypothesis true? What is the meaning of the effect of the size of η in δrcp and δdfr?\nWe would like to make a deeper study of the probabilistic rationality postulates, especially those for update (as they have not been given much attention in the literature). We would then like to test various EDI instantiations against the postulates and use the results to perhaps design new EDI operators. We hope that these insights might lead to further insights in order to better understand the relationship between revision and update, whether classical or not."
