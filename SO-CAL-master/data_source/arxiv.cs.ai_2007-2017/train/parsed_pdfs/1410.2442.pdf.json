      "text" : "RCC8 is a popular fragment of the region connection calculus, in which qualitative spatial relations between regions, such as adjacency, overlap and parthood, can be expressed. While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or threedimensional physical space. In this paper, however, we are mainly interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented using convex regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations. First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Most surprisingly, we find that if the relation ‘partially overlaps’ is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 networks can be convexly realized in 4D. If instead refinements of the relation ‘part of’ are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly realized in 3D. We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8 network with 2n + 1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nKeywords: Qualitative spatial reasoning, Region connection calculus, Convexity, Conceptual spaces\nEmail addresses: s.schockaert@cs.cardiff.ac.be (Steven Schockaert), sanjiang.li@uts.edu.au (Sanjiang Li)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier October 20, 2014\nar X\niv :1\n41 0.\n24 42\nv2 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\n7 O\nct 2"

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "RCC8 is a well-known constraint language for modelling and reasoning about the qualitative spatial relationships that hold between regions [1]. It is based on eight relations which are jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint: equals (EQ), partially overlaps (PO), externally connected (EC), disconnected (DC), tangential proper part (TPP) and its inverse (TPP−1), and non-tangential proper part (NTPP) and its inverse (NTPP−1). The intended meaning of these and a number of related relations is summarized in Table 1. RCC5 is a variant of RCC8 which is instead based on the following five coarser basic relations: equals (EQ), partially overlaps (PO), disjoint (DR), proper part (PP) and its inverse (PP−1). In general, constraint networks over RCC8 (or RCC5) relations could be realized using regions from arbitrary topological spaces that satisfy the axioms of the RCC [1].\nIn practice, most applications use RCC8 to reason about two-dimensional or three-dimensional Euclidean space. For example, [2] uses RCC8 to encode how different objects in a video are spatially related to each other, and how these relations change over time. This high-level representation is then used to recognize particular types of events. On the semantic web, RCC8 is used to encode geographic information in OWL ontologies [3, 4] and linked data [5, 6], and to reason about the integrity of spatial databases [7]. It can be shown that focusing on Euclidean spaces of fixed dimension does not affect the notion of consistency which is used in RCC8 [8] (see Section 2).\nRCC8 could potentially also play a crucial role in reasoning about higherdimensional Euclidean spaces. In such applications, however, it is often natural to consider convex regions only. For example, in the theory of conceptual spaces proposed in [9], the meaning of natural properties and concepts is represented using convex regions in a suitable metric space, which is most often taken to be Euclidean [9]. The concepts car and vehicle would both correspond to convex regions and the constraint carPP vehicle then means that every car is a vehicle, while vehiclePOwooden-object means that some but not all vehicles are wooden objects (e.g. a dugout canoe) and not all wooden objects are vehicles. While the idea that natural concepts tend to be convex is a conjecture, among other examples, [9] points to evidence from cognitive studies on color spaces, showing that natural language terms for colors tend to correspond to convex regions in a suitable conceptual space . Requiring convexity is also closely related to prototype theory [10]. Indeed, a common approach is to represent prototypes as points in a feature space\nand to define the extension of concepts as the cells of the Voronoi diagram induced from these points, which are convex. In machine learning, convex hull based classifiers have been proposed [11], which are explicitly based on the assumption that categories tend to correspond to convex regions in a feature space. In particular, in a convex hull based classifier, every category Ci is represented geometrically as the convex hull of the points (i.e. entitites) that are known to belong to Ci. A test item x is then assigned to the category whose convex hull is closest. While such classifiers are often effective, classification decisions require solving a quadratic program and is thus computationally expensive. As an alternative, in [12] a classifier is introduced which encodes the intuition that when x is located between two items from class Ci in the feature space, then x is also likely to belong to class Ci. Such a betweenness based classifier also implicitly uses the assumption that categories correspond to convex regions, while being more efficient than a convex hull based classifier.\nIn computational linguistics, methods are studied to learn representations for the meaning of natural language terms as convex regions from large corpora [13]. In the context of conceptual spaces, EC and TPP relate to some notion of conceptual neighborhood (cf. [14]). For example, orangeEC red means that there is a continuous transition from colors which are considered red to colors which are considered orange, without passing through any other\ncolors. This also entails that while orange and red are considered as separate colors, there may exist borderline colors for which it is hard to judge whether they are red or orange. This notion of conceptual neighborhood has proven useful for defining commonsense reasoning approaches to merge conflicting propositional knowledge bases [15]. Alternatively, the exact boundaries of what it means for an object to be orange may be considered to be vague, but we may still use an RCC8 based representation in such a case [9], e.g. by relying on the Egg-Yolk calculus [16] or on a fuzzy region connection calculus [17]. In any case, qualitative spatial reasoning based on (a variant of) RCC8 is well-suited for formalising particular forms of commonsense reasoning about natural language concepts [9]. This application is likely to inspire further extensions and variants of RCC8 and RCC5; e.g. in [18], RCC5 is combined with a notion of betweenness to formalize interpolation, a particular form of commonsense reasoning.\nAs another example of qualitative reasoning about convex regions in higher-dimensional Euclidean spaces, we consider species distribution models [19], which are used in ecology to specify the environmental parameters within which the occurrence of a given species can be sustained. Typically, the distribution model of a given organism is encoded as a convex region in a Euclidean space in which the dimensions correspond to environmental parameters (e.g. related to climate and land cover). Several ecological constraints can naturally be expressed using RCC8 relations between these models. For example, knowing that the mountain lion is a predator of the bighorn sheep1, we know that mountain-lionPO bighorn-sheep needs to hold for the corresponding distribution models. Similarly, since a harlequin ladybird is a kind of ladybird, we should require harlequin-ladybirdPP ladybird. RCC8 could thus allow us to reason about ecological information extracted from text (e.g. the encyclopedia of life2), which could be useful to derive constraints that can be taken into account when learning distribution models from sparse data.\nAs a final example, we consider imprecise probability theory [20], which is a theory of uncertainty in which the beliefs of an agent are encoded as a convex region called a credal set. Specifically, these regions are subsets of the\n1http://umyosemite22.wikispaces.com/Biotic+Factors, accessed 29 November 2013.\n2http://eol.org, accessed 29 November 2013\nstandard simplex and each point of this simplex corresponds to a probability distribution in the domain of discourse. For example if A and B are the regions encoding the beliefs of agents a and b, then aPP b means that a is better informed than b, i.e. the beliefs of a and b are compatible and a could not learn anything by sharing its information with b. Similarly, aDC b means that the beliefs of a and b are incompatible. RCC8 could thus be used as the basis for a qualitative counterpart to the theory of imprecise probabilities.\nA natural question is then: how does the requirement that all regions be convex affect the realizability of RCC8 constraint networks? It is easy to see that deciding whether an RCC8 network has a convex solution in R can be reduced to consistency checking in the interval algebra [21], which is NP-complete [22]. It is moreover well known that many consistent RCC8 constraint networks cannot be realized by convex regions in R2.\nExample 1. Consider the following set of constraints:\naEC b xTPP a yTPP a uTPP b vTPP b\nxDC y uDC v xECu xEC v yECu yEC v\nFigure 1 shows a configuration which satisfies all of these constraints except for xEC v. Since a ∩ u, a ∩ v, x ∩ b and y ∩ b are necessarily all intervals of the same line, it is easy to show that additionally satisfying xEC v is not possible (see Section 5.2).\nIn [23] it was shown that deciding whether an RCC8 constraint network can be realized as convex regions in R2 is decidable, but computationally hard. Specifically, this problem was shown to be as hard as deciding consistency in the existential theory of the real numbers [24]. From this result, we can derive a similar result for regions in Rk, for any fixed k ≥ 2. We provide a proof in the appendix. Moreover, [23] shows that any RCC8 network which has a convex solution in Rk can be realized using convex polytopes.\nIn this paper, we show that despite these intractability results, RCC8 can still be used to efficiently reason about convex regions. The key insight is that every consistent RCC8 constraint network can be realized using convex regions, provided that the number of dimensions is sufficiently high. Note that as the required number of dimensions depends on the number of variables in the constraint network, this result does not contradict the result from [23], which applies only if the number of dimensions k is fixed in advance. In particular, we make the following contributions:\n1. For all subsets of the RCC8 relations, we derive the minimal number of dimensions k which are needed to guarantee that all consistent constraint networks which only use relations from this subset can be realized by convex regions in Rk. For the full RCC8, it is clear that a finite bound k does not exist. However, among others we show that if PO is not allowed, all consistent networks can be realized in R4. If only the relations in {PO,EC,DC,EQ} or only the relations in {EC, DC,NTPP,NTPP−1,EQ} are allowed, all consistent networks can be realized in R3.\n2. We analyze how the required number of dimensions relates to the number of variables. Among others we show that all consistent RCC8 constraint networks with 2n + 1 regions can be realized using convex regions in Rn.\nIn this way, we establish important sufficient conditions to use standard RCC8 reasoners for sound and complete reasoning about convex regions. In computational linguistics, for instance, it is common to consider highdimensional Euclidean spaces of 100 to 500 dimensions to represent the meaning of natural language terms [13, 25]. If we use RCC8 to reason about convex regions in these spaces, we can use standard RCC8 reasoners [26] if the number of considered regions is at most 2n + 1 = 1001 (in the case of 500 dimensions). In fact, 2n + 1 is the worst-case bound we obtain, and for most problem instances with more than 1001 regions, the methodology from Section 5 will still allow us to derive that convex solutions in Rn must exist.\nIn other words, the aim of this paper is to identify sufficient conditions on the required number of dimensions to guarantee that a convex solution exists. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we recall some basic results about RCC8 and RCC5. Then in Section 3, we give an overview of the results that are established in this paper. The remainder of the paper focuses on the proofs of these results. In particular, in Section 4, we derive the minimal number of dimensions that are needed to guarantee convex solutions when only a subset of the RCC8 relations is allowed. Based on these results, we then show in Section 5 how the number of regions and the number of occurrences of particular RCC8 relations can be used to derive finite bounds on the number of regions even for RCC8 constraint networks in which all RCC8 relations are used.\nFinally note that Section 5 of this paper presents a substantially revised and extended version of the results from [27]. The results presented in Section\n4 are completely new."

For convenience, we also use the following abbreviations:\nPP = {TPP,NTPP} PP−1 = {TPP−1,NTPP−1}\nP = {PP,EQ} P−1 = {PP−1,EQ} O = {TPP,NTPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1,PO,EQ} C = {TPP,NTPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1,PO,EC,EQ}\nLet V = {v1, ..., vm} be a fixed set of variables. An RCC8 constraint is an expression of the form viRvj where R is an RCC8 relation. Intuitively, such a constraint imposes that the spatial relation between vi and vj is among those in R. If R = {r} is base relation, we usually write vi r vj instead of vi{r}vj. A set of RCC8 constraints is called an RCC8 network. An RCC8 network Θ is called atomic if for each i 6= j it contains a constraint of the form viRvj or vj Rvi where R is a singleton, i.e. an atomic network explicitly specifies for each pair of variables what is the corresponding RCC8 base relation. Let R be a non-empty subset of R8. If every constraint viRvj is such that R ⊆ R, then we call Θ a network over R. For V ′ ⊆ V , we write Θ↓V ′ for the restriction of Θ to the variables in V ′. i.e.\nΘ↓V ′ = {viRvj | (viRvj) ∈ Θ, vi ∈ V ′, vj ∈ V ′}\nRecall that a set X is called regular closed if cl(i(X) = X, where cl and i are the closure and interior operators. We say that an RCC8 network Θ is consistent iff there exists a mapping S from V to the set of nonempty regular closed subsets of Rn, for a given n ≥ 1, such that:\n• For each v ∈ V , S(v) is regular closed.\n• For each constraint viRvj in Θ, it holds that the unique RCC8 base relation which holds between S(vi) and S(vj) in the sense of Table 1 is among those in R.\nIn such a case, S is called an n-dimensional solution of Θ. If Θ has an n-dimensional solution, we also say that Θ is realizable in Rn. It can be shown that the number of dimensions does not affect consistency: if Θ is realizable in Rn, it is realizable in Rk for any k ≥ 1 [8]. Moreover, there are\nseveral alternative ways of defining consistency, e.g. in terms of topological spaces or algebras [29], which are equivalent to the aforementioned notion of consistency [30].\nFor atomic networks, consistency can be decided in O(n3) by checking path consistency. Specifically, it suffices to check for each i, j, k whether ρik is among the relations in ρij◦ρjk, where the composition ρij◦ρjk of ρij and ρjk is defined by the RCC8 composition table, shown in Table 2. For example, Θ = {v1 TPP v2, v2 PO v3, v1 EQ v3} is not consistent, because EQ is not among TPP ◦ PO = {DC,EC,PO,TPP,NTPP}. For arbitrary RCC8 networks, consistency can be decided by using a combination of backtracking and path consistency checking [31].\nWe say that Θ entails a constraint viRvj, written Θ |= viRvj, if every solution of Θ is also a solution of {viRvj}. Similarly, we say that Θ entails a network Ψ, written Θ |= Ψ if Θ entails every constraint in Ψ. If Θ |= Ψ and Ψ |= Θ, we say that Θ and Ψ are equivalent, written Θ ≡ Ψ. For atomic networks, it holds that Θ |= viRvj iff Θ contains a constraint vi {r} vj such that r ∈ R or a constraint vj {r} vi such that r−1 ∈ R, where we define DC−1 = DC, EC−1 = EC, PO−1 = PO, EQ−1 = EQ, (TPP−1)−1 = TPP and (NTPP−1)−1 = NTPP.\nThe notion of realizability can be refined by imposing additional requirements on the kind of regions which are considered. For example, if all regions are required to be internally connected (i.e. no region is the union of two disjoint non-empty regions), some consistent RCC8 networks cannot be realized in R or in R2, although all consistent RCC8 networks can be realized using internally connected regions in R3 [8]. In this paper, we analyze the realizability of consistent RCC8 networks when all regions are required to be convex. A solution of a network Θ which maps every region to a convex set in Rn is called a convex solution. If such a convex solution exists, we say that Θ is convexly realizable in Rn.\nA non-empty subset R ⊆ R5 is called an RCC5 relation. Entirely analogously as for RCC8 relation, we can define the notion of RCC5 constraint, RCC5 network, consistency, entailment and equivalence."

A convex polytope V in Rn is the intersection of a finite set of half-spaces,\ni.e.\nV = n⋂ i=1 {x |hi · x ≤ ci, x ∈ Rn}\nwhere hi ∈ Rn is a vector and ci ∈ R is a constant. The corresponding hyperplanesHi = {x |hi·x = ci,x ∈ Rn} are called the bounding hyperplanes of V . We call F an n− 1 dimensional face of V if F = Hi∩V and dim(F ) = n− 1, where Hi is one of the bounding hyperplanes of V . A family of convex polytopes {V1, ..., Vm} in Rn is called neighborly if dim(Vi ∩ Vj) = n − 1 for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m. It is well known that neighborly families in R2 can have at most 3 elements. A key result which we will use in this paper (cf. Propositions 13 and 14) is that there exist neighborly families of arbitrary size in R3 [32].\nThe Voronoi diagram induced by a set of points p1, ..., pm in Rn is the set of convex polytopes V1, ..., Vm defined as follows:\nVi = {q | d(q, pi) ≤ min j 6=i d(q, pj)}\nThe n-dimensional moment curve is the set of points {(t, t2, ..., tn) | t ∈ R}. Let us write M(t) for the point (t, t2, ..., tn). Note that the two-dimensional moment curve is a parabola. In higher dimensional spaces, the moment curve has a number of interesting properties. For any n ≥ 3, it can be shown that the Voronoi diagram of the points {(t, t2, ..., tn) | t ∈ {1, ...,m}} is a neighborly family [32], and more generally that the Voronoi diagram of any finite set of points on the positive half of the moment curve is a neighborly family [33]. Using a similar construction based on the helix {(t, cos t, sin t) | t ∈ R}, [34] shows that an arbitrarily large neighborly family of congruent convex polyhedra in R3 can be constructed.\nIn particular, it can be shown that any n points on the n-dimensional moment curve are linearly independent (i.e. in general linear position). Moreover, a hyperplane H intersects the moment curve in at most n points ([35], Lemma 6.4) and if H intersects the moment curve in exactly n points, the moment curve crosses H in each of these points ([36], Lemma 1.6.4)."

      "heading" : "3. Overview of the results",
      "text" : "In some applications, particular RCC8 relations do not occur. For example, when modelling natural language concepts, it is often possible to organize\nconcepts in a single subsumption hierarchy. It is common to interpret such hierarchies in the following way: if concept A is a descendant of concept B, then A{TPP,NTPP}B and if A is (the descendant of) a sibling of B, then A{EC,DC}B. In particular, in such applications, there are no concepts which partially overlap. As we will show, any consistent atomic RCC8 network without PO has a convex realization in R4. When different (sets of) base relations are excluded, similar upper bounds on the required number of dimensions can be found. Figure 2 presents an overview of the results which will be established in Section 4. For completeness, we also consider subsets of RCC5 base relations, for which the results are summarized in Figure 3. For some fragments, we will show that there exists no finite upper bound on the number of dimensions.\nNote that throughout this paper we will not consider RCC8 and RCC5 networks in which the relation EQ occurs, as we can easily avoid using this relation by appropriately renaming variables. Furthermore, note that if NTPP is allowed then we also need to allow NTPP−1, and similarly if TPP is allowed then TPP−1 needs to be allowed. This means that the total number of non-empty subsets of RCC8 relations that we need to consider is 25 − 1 = 31. Figure 2 shows the result for each of these subsets. Similarly, for RCC5, the total number of subsets to consider is 23 − 1 = 7, all of which are shown in Figure 3.\nRemark 1. The results from Figures 2 and 3 only apply to atomic networks. For example, as shown in [23], it is possible to encode an RCC8 network using only EC and TPP which is not realizable in R2. Indeed, let Θ be an arbitrary network over {EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1} which is not realizable in R2 (we will show in Section 4.5 that such networks exist), then we can construct a set of constraints Ψ as follows.\n• For each pair of variables a, b such that Θ |= aTPP b, we add to Ψ the constraint aTPP b.\n• For each pair of variables a, b such that Θ |= aEC b, we add to Ψ the constraint aEC b.\n• For each pair of variables a, b such that Θ |= aPO b, we add to Ψ the constraints xTPP a, xEC b, yTPP b, yEC a, zTPP a and zTPP b, where x, y and z are fresh variables.\nIt is clear that Ψ only contains the relations TPP and EC. Since Θ is not convexly realizable in R2 and Ψ |= Θ it must moreover be the case that Ψ is not convexly realizable in R2 either.\nThe correctness of the results which are summarized in Figures 2 and 3 is shown in Section 4. These results are then used in Section 5 to obtain an upper bound for general RCC8 networks. The idea is to identify a subset V ′ ⊆ V such that the restriction Θ↓V ′ belongs to one of the fragments from Figure 2 which is guaranteed to have a convex solution in R, R2, R3 or R4. This partial solution of Θ is then incrementally extended to a full solution, based on the following key property, which is shown in Section 5:\nLet Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. Suppose that Θ↓V ′ has a k-dimensional convex solution in which every O-clique3 in Θ↓V ′ has a common part, and suppose that Θ entails the following constraints:\na1 NTPP a2 a2 NTPP a3 ... al−1 NTPP ar\n3We say that a subnetwork Θ↓Z (Z ⊆ V ) is an O-clique if Θ |= z1Oz2 for every z1, z2 ∈ Z.\nb1 NTPP b2 b2 NTPP b3 ... bl−1 NTPP bs\narDC bs\nIt holds that Θ↓(V ′∪{a1, ..., ar, b1, ..., bs}) has a (k+1)-dimensional convex solution in which every O-clique has a common part.\nAmong others, this property allows us to show that if V ′ ⊆ V is such that Θ↓V ′ does not contain any occurrences of PO, Θ has a convex solution in R|V \\V ′|+4. Moreover, we can also establish that every consistent RCC8 network with 2n + 1 variables, for n ≥ 2, can be convexly realized by using at most n dimensions."

For an atomic network over {DC,NTPP,NTPP−1} we can partition the set of variables V as follows:\n• A1 = {a11, ..., a1n1} corresponds to the set of regions which are not contained in any of the other regions, i.e. for any a ∈ A1 and any v ∈ V \\ {a}, it holds that Θ 6|= aNTPP v.\n• Ai = {ai1, ..., aini} (i ≥ 2) corresponds to the set of regions which are contained in some region of Ai−1 and which are not contained in any region from V \\ (A1 ∪ ... ∪Ai−1), i.e. for any ai ∈ Ai there is an ai−1 ∈ Ai−1 such that Θ |= aiNTPP ai−1, and for any ai ∈ Ai and any v ∈ V \\ (A1 ∪ ... ∪ Ai−1 ∪ {ai}), it holds that Θ 6|= aiNTPP v.\nNote that if a, b ∈ Ai, a 6= b, it holds that Θ |= aDC b. As a result, for any variable a ∈ Ai (i > 1) there is a unique b ∈ Ai−1 such that Θ |= aNTPP b. We define a convex solution S as follows. The variables a11, ..., a1n1 from A 1 are realized as: S(a1j) = [2j, 2j + 1] Assume that S has been defined for all variables in A1 ∪ ... ∪ Ai−1. Now consider the variables in Ai. Let aij ∈ Ai and let ai−1k ∈ Ai−1 be the unique variable for which\nΘ |= aij NTPP ai−1k\nLet S(ai−1k ) = [l, u]. We realize aij as follows:\nS(aij) = [l + 2j 2 · |Ai|+ 2 · (u− l), l + 2j + 1 2 · |Ai|+ 2 · (u− l)]\nIt is straightforward to verify that S is indeed a convex solution of Θ.\nCorollary 1.

It is easy to see that the following atomic network is consistent, but it cannot be realized by intervals:\nΘ = {aTPP d, bTPP d, cTPP d, aDC b, aDC c, bDC c}\nIndeed, if S(d) were an interval, then aTPP d, bTPP d and cTPP d mean that S(a), S(b) and S(c) all share one of the two end points of the interval S(d), which means that S(a), S(b) and S(c) cannot all be disconnected from each other.\nProposition 5.

We now show that a convex solution in R does not exist. Suppose S were a convex solution of Θ in R. Let S(a) = [a−, a+] and similar for b, c, d, e, f . Due to the symmetry of the problem, we can assume that d− ≤ min(e−, f−) and e+ ≥ max(d+, f+). Because d and e are both contained in a, this would mean that f were also contained in a, a contradiction since f PO a is required.\nThe previous results remains valid if we replace PP by either NTPP or TPP. Hence we obtain the following corollaries.\nCorollary 3. There exists a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {PO, TPP,TPP−1} which has no convex solution in R.\nCorollary 4.

From a1 TPP a2 we derive that either u1 = u2 or v1 = v2. Assume for instance u1 = u2 (the other case is entirely analogous). Then we also have v1 < v2. From a2 TPP a3 we moreover find v1 < v2 ≤ v3. Since a1 TPP a3, this means that u1 = u2 = u3 and thus v2 < v3. Similarly, from a2 TPP a4 we find u2 = u4. However, since u1 = u2 it follows that u1 = u4 and thus S violates the constraint a1 NTPP a4.\nProposition 7.

To show this, we first consider of a weakened version Ψ of Θ, in which TPP and TPP−1 are weakened to PP and PP−1. From Proposition 3 we know that Ψ can be realized using intervals of the real line. Let [li, ui] be the realization of vi and assume that li, ui ≥ 0. We can then construct a convex solution T of Θ as follows:\nT (vi) = CH( ⋃ {Sθij(lj, l2j ) ∪ Sθij(uj, u2j) |Θ |= vj P vi}\nwhere CH denotes the convex hull and Sθij(lj, l 2 j ) is the disc with radius θij and center (lj, l 2 j ). By carefully choosing the values of θij we can ensure that T is indeed a solution of Θ, as we show in the proof of the following proposition. Note that the points (li, l 2 i ) and (ui, u 2 i ) are on the positive half of the twodimensional moment curve. Sections 4.3 and 4.4 will use constructions that are based on choosing points on the three-dimensional and four-dimensional moment curve, respectively.\nWe say that a region v ∈ V ′ is at level t if there is a chain of t − 1 regions u1, ..., ut−1 in V\n′ such that Θ |= {u1 NTPPu2, ..., ut−2 NTPPut−1, ut−1 NTPP v} and there is no chain of t regions for which this is the case. Let ∆(v) be the level of region v ∈ V ′. Note that ∆(v) = 1 iff there is no region u ∈ V ′ such that Θ |= uNTPP v.\nProposition 8. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {DC,TPP, TPP−1,NTPP,NTPP−1} has a convex solution in R2.\nProof. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {DC,TPP,TPP−1, NTPP,NTPP−1}. We show that Θ can be convexly realized in R2. Let Ψ be the atomic RCC8 network which is obtained from Θ by replacing every constraint of the form viTPP vj by viNTPP vj and every constraint of the form viTPP −1 vj by viNTPP −1 vj. Clearly, Ψ is consistent, and hence by Proposition 3, we know that Ψ has a convex solution S in R. Let S(vi) = [li, ui]. Without loss of generality, we can assume that li > 0 for each i. With each region vi we associate two points pi, qi ∈ R2:\npi = (li, l 2 i ) qi = (ui, u 2 i )\nLet θ > 0 be a constant. We can then define a convex solution T as follows: T (vj) = CH ( Sθ(pj) ∪ Sθ(qj) ∪ ⋃ {Sθ(pl) ∪ Sθ(ql) |Θ |= vlTPP vj}\n∪ ⋃ {S∆(vj)·θ(pl) ∪ S∆(vj)·θ(ql) |Θ |= vlNTPP vj} ) where for a point p, Sθ(p) = {q | d(q, p) ≤ θ} is a disc with radius θ > 0 centered around p. By choosing θ sufficiently small, we can ensure that Sm·θ(p\n′)∩Sm·θ(q′) = ∅ if p′ 6= q′, where m denotes the number of regions in Θ. Accordingly, we can assume that T (vi)DC T (vj) holds for any regions vi, vj such that Θ |= viDC vj. By construction, it is immediate that T (vi)P T (vj) if Θ |= viP vj. If θ is sufficiently small, Sθ(pj) and Sθ(qj) will not be included\nin CH( ⋃ l 6=j Sm·θ(pl)∪Sm·θ(ql)), for any j. Then we have that T (vi)PP T (vj) if Θ |= viPP vj. If Θ |= viNTPP vj we have that ∆(vj) > ∆(vi), from which it is easy to see that T (vi)NTPP T (vj) will hold. Finally, if Θ |= viTPP vj, T (vi) and T (vj) will share a boundary point of Sθ(pi) and Sθ(qi), and thus we can assume that T (vi)TPP T (vj).\nThe next fragment we consider is {PO,TPP,TPP−1,NTPP,NTPP−1}.

We can then draw K3,3 in the plane as follows. For the nodes of K3,3, we can choose arbitrary points pa, pb, pc, pu, pv, pw in the interiors of respectively S(a),S(b), S(c),S(u),S(v),S(w). To connect pa with pu, first, we connect pa by a line segment to an arbitrary point of δ(S(a))∩ i(S(rau)), where δ(X) denotes the boundary of X and i(X) is the interior of X. This point is connected by a line segment to an arbitrary point of δ(S(u)) ∩ i(S(rau)). The latter point\nis finally connected with a line segment to pu. In a similar way we connect each of pa, pb, pc to each of pu, pv, pw. It is clear that the edges thus drawn can only intersect at their endpoints, i.e. we have shown that K3,3 is planar, a contradiction.\nNote that this proof moreover shows that there are RCC5 networks over {DR,PO} which have no solution in R2 using internally connected regions. The previous proof remains valid if we replace DR by either EC or DC, hence we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 8.

For the nodes of K3,3, we choose arbitrary points pa, pb, pc, pu, pv, pw in the interiors of respectively S(a),S(b),S(c),S(u),S(v),S(w). For x ∈ {a, b, c} and y ∈ {u, v, w}, let qxy be an arbitrary point from S(x)∩S(y) (which must exist because of the constraint xEC y). Note that qxy /∈ S(x′) and qxy /∈ S(y′) for x′ ∈ {a, b, c} \\ {x} and y′ ∈ {u, v, w} \\ {y} because of the constraints xDCx′ and yDC y′. Then we can connect x and y as follows: draw a line segment from px to qx,y and a second line segment from qx,y to py. It is clear that the edges thus drawn can only intersect at their endpoints, which means that K3,3 would be planar, a contradiction.\nAgain the proof shows a slightly stronger property than what we need, i.e. that there are consistent RCC8 networks over {EC,DC} which have no solution in R2 using internally connected regions."

Where the results in Section 4.2.2 rely on a construction based on the two-dimensional moment curve, here we will use a property of the three-dimensional moment curve.\nProposition 13. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, PO} has a convex solution in R3.\nProof. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC,PO} involving the variables in V = {v1, ..., vm}. Let {A1, ..., Am} be a neighborly family of convex polytopes in R3 such that each two polytopes Ai, Aj share a face. It is known that an arbitrarily large family of this kind is obtained by taking the cells of the Voronoi diagram induced by any set of points on the positive half of the three-dimensional moment curve (see Section 2.2).\nNote that AiECAj holds for any i 6= j. We now modify these polytopes A1,...,An to obtain a solution of Θ. Let Hij be the unique plane which contains Ai ∩ Aj. Let Hεij be the plane which is parallel to Hij, at distance ε from Hij and which is in the same half-space (induced by Hij) as Ai. Let H≥εij be the half-space induced by H ε ij which does not contain Hij. Let cij be an arbitrary interior point of Ai ∩Aj. Finally, let Lij be the line through cij which is orthogonal to Hij and let c ε ij = Lij ∩ Hεij. In the following we assume that ε > 0 is chosen small enough such that cεij ∈ i(Ai). If Θ |= aiDC aj, we replace Ai by Ai∩H≥εij ; the region Aj can be similarly replaced by a smaller region, but it is sufficient that one of Ai, Aj is modified. It is clear that then AiDCAj and that this operation does not affect the RCC8 relations that hold between the other pairs of regions (assuming ε is sufficiently small). Indeed, if AiECAz then Ai and Az are sharing a twodimensional face (z 6= i, j). By replacing Ai by Ai ∩ H≥εij , this face may be replaced by a smaller face, but provided that ε is sufficiently small, Ai ∩ Az will still be non-empty, and a two-dimensional shared face.\nOnce all DC relations have been made to hold using this process, we turn to the relations of the form PO. If Θ |= aiPO aj, we replace Aj by CH(Aj ∪ {cεij}); we may similarly replace Ai by a larger region, but it is again sufficient that one of Ai, Aj is modified. Then we have that c ε ij is an interior point of Aj and thus AiPOAj, and this operation does not affect the RCC8 relations that hold between the other pairs of regions if we choose ε to be sufficiently small. Indeed, for a sufficiently small ε it\nholds that CH(Aj ∪ {cεij}) ⊆ Aj ∪ i(Ai), from which it easily follows that (Aj∪{cεij})ECAz iff Aj ECAz and (Aj∪{cεij})DCAz iff Aj DCAz, for any Az (z 6= i, j).\nCorollary 9. Every consistent atomic RCC5 network over {DR,PO} has a convex solution in R3.\nProposition 14. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, NTPP,NTPP−1} has a convex solution in R3.\nProof. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC,NTPP, NTPP−1}. We show this proposition by induction on the number k of NTPP or NTPP−1 relations in Θ. If k = 0, then the result follows from Proposition 13. Assume that k > 0. Let V ′ be the set of regions which are not contained in any other region, i.e. v ∈ V ′ iff there is no region u ∈ V such that Θ |= vNTPPu. The network Ψ = Θ↓V ′ satisfies the conditions of Proposition 13 and thus has a convex solution S in R3. We extend S to a solution of Θ as follows. Let v ∈ V ′ and let Uv = {u ∈ V |Θ |= uNTPP v}. Then Θ↓Uv has strictly fewer occurrences of NTPP and NTPP−1 and thus has a convex solution Tv by induction. We can modify this solution Tv by a linear transformation to a solution Sv such that for all u ∈ Uv it holds that Sv(u) ⊆ i(S(v)). Indeed, any linear transformation will preserve convexity and topological relations (including those in RCC8). Noting that Θ |= u1 DCu2 for u1 ∈ Uv1 and u2 ∈ Uv2 , with v1 6= v2, it follows easily that S and {Sv | v ∈ V ′} together define a convex solution of Θ."

Assume that a convex solution S in R3 existed. For each i, let Hi be a plane separating S(xi) from S(yi) and let Gi be a plane separating S(ui) from S(vi). Let K be a plane separating S(a) and S(b).\nFor i 6= j, let pij be a point inHi∩Gj∩K∩S(zi)∩S(wj). To see why such a point exists, note that because of the constraints xiECuj, xiEC vj, yiECuj,\nyiEC vj there exist points pxiuj ∈ S(xi)∩S(uj)∩K, pxivj ∈ S(xi)∩S(vj)∩K, pyiuj ∈ S(yi)∩S(uj)∩K and pyivj ∈ S(yi)∩S(vj)∩K. Since pxiuj and pxivj are at different sides of the hyperplane Gj and both points are contained in the convex region S(xi)∩S(wj), there exists a point q1 ∈ S(xi)∩Gj ∩K ∩S(wj) which is collinear with and between pxiuj and pxivj . Similarly we find that there must exist a point S(q2) ∈ S(yi) ∩ Gj ∩ K ∩ S(wj) which is between pyiuj and pyivj . Moreover, the points q1 and q2 are at opposite sides of Hi and both points are contained in the convex set zi. It follows that there must be a point pij ∈ Hi ∩Gj ∩K ∩ S(zi) ∩ S(wj).\nWe define the line segments Li = CH({pij | j 6= i}) ⊆ Hi ∩ K ∩ S(zi) and Mj = CH({pij | i 6= j}) ⊆ Gj ∩ K ∩ S(wj). It is clear that the line segments L1, ..., L5 are all disjoint and that the line segments M1, ...,M5 are all disjoint. Indeed, if Li ∩ Lj for i 6= j contained a point q, we would have q ∈ S(zi)∩S(zj), contradicting the assumption S(zi)DCS(zi) and similarly Mi ∩Mj 6= ∅ would contradict S(zi)DCS(zi).\nThe points pi1, ..., pi5 occur in the same order on each line segment Li. Indeed, assume that this were not the case, and e.g. on the line segment L4 the points p41, p42, p43 occur in that order, while on L5 the corresponding points occur in the order p51, p52, p53. Since the points p41, p42, p43, p51, p52, p53 are coplanar, this means that at least two of the line segments p41p51, p42p52, p43p53 would have a non-empty intersection, contradicting the fact that the line segments M1, M2 and M3 are disjoint. Similarly, we find that the points p1j, ..., p5j occur in the same order on each line segment Mj.\nIn particular, there exists a permutation σ1, ..., σ5 of {1, ..., 5} such that the points piσ1 , ..., piσ5 occur in that order on each line segment Li (where piσj for σj = i is excluded). Similarly, there exists a permutation τ1, ..., τ5 such that the points pτ1j, ..., pτ5j occur in that order on each line segment Mj (excluding pτij for τi = j). First assume that {σ1, σ5} ∩ {τ1, τ5} = ∅ and let l ∈ {1, ..., 5} \\ {σ1, σ5, τ1, τ5}. By the previous construction, the following betweenness relations hold:\n• pσ1l is between pσ1τ1 and pσ1τ5 .\n• pσ5l is between pσ5τ1 and pσ5τ5 .\n• plτ1 is between pσ1τ1 and pσ5τ1 .\n• plτ5 is between pσ1τ5 and pσ5τ5 .\nIt follows that Ll (which contains plτ1 and plτ5) intersects with Ml (which contains pσ1l and pσ5l), and thus that S(zl)ECS(wl), a contradiction since Θ contains the constraint zlDCwl. Now suppose τ1 ∈ {σ1, σ2} but {τ2, τ5} ∩ {σ1, σ2} = ∅, then we can choose l ∈ {1, ..., 5} \\ {σ1, σ5, τ2, τ5} and derive that S(zl)ECS(wl) by replacing τ1 by τ2 in the preceding argument. In general, we can always find τ, τ ′ ∈ {1, ..., 5} such that {σ1, σ5}∩{τ, τ ′} = ∅ and such that l is (strictly) between τ and τ ′."

      "text" : "The main aim of this section is to prove the following result.\nProposition 16. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, TPP,TPP−1} has a convex solution in R4.\nA similar result for networks over {EC,DC,TPP,TPP−1,NTPP,NTPP−1} will then follow easily.\nBefore we present the details of the proof, we briefly sketch its intuition. We will assume that the variables in V can be organized in a binary tree, such that the descendants of a region x are those regions that are contained in x. It is always possible to ensure that such a binary tree exists by introducing additional regions in a way which does not affect the consistency of Θ.\nThen we will associate each region x with a point M(tx) on the fourdimensional moment curve. Let x and y be siblings in the tree, and let Xx and Xy be the cells of the Voronoi diagram that is induced by {M(tx), M(ty)}. Then, as we will show in Lemma 3, we can choose the values ta such that M(ta) ∈ Xx for any descendant a of x (for any choice of x).\nFor each x, we can then consider the set Yx = Xx∩{Xu |u is an ancestor of x}. For each region a and each region b such that a is not a descendant of b and vice versa, it is clear that YaDRYb. We will show in Lemmas 4 and 5 that for each such regions a and b, we can find a point qab which belongs to Ya∩Yb, showing that YaECYb. The proof of these lemmas crucially relies on a property of the moment curve which we show in Lemma 1, being a variant of the well-known property that for any four points on the four-dimensional moment curve there exists a hyperplane that intersects the moment curve at exactly these points, and moreover crosses the moment curve at these points.\nThe points qab will allow us to construct a convex solution of Θ by realizing each leaf node a as the convex hull of a small sphere centered around M(ta) and the points {qab |Θ |= aEC b}. The realization of a non-leaf node is defined as the convex hull of the union of the realizations of its children,\nwhich trivially guarantees that all required TPP relations are satisfied. A key result is shown in Lemma 6, which guarantees that these convex hulls cannot introduce spurious EC relations.\nThe remainder of this section is organized in three parts. First we show two properties of the four-dimensional moment curve which we will rely on in the proof. Then we discuss how the points M(ta) and qab are chosen, and we show that they have the required properties. Finally, we show how we can use these points to define a convex solution of Θ.\nPreliminaries. The proof of Proposition 17 below relies on a number of properties about the moment curve in R4 (see Section 2.2). We will also use the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let m1 < t1 < t2 < m2 and consider the hyperplane H = {x |h · x = θ}. It is possible to choose h and θ such that H intersects the four-dimensional moment curve at M(t1) and M(t2) and such that the function f : R → R defined by f(t) = h ·M(t) − θ reaches an extremum at m1 and m2.\nProof. The function f takes the following form (a, b, c, d ∈ R):\nf(t) = a · t+ b · t2 + c · t3 + d · t4 − θ\nNote in particular that f is a polynomial in t of degree 4. The required conditions are that f(t1) = f(t2) = f ′(m1) = f ′(m2) = 0. To see why a suitable polynomial f exists, consider the family g(δ1,δ2) of quartic polynomials defined as (δ1, δ2 ≥ 0):\ng(δ1,δ2)(t) = (t− (m1 − δ1)) · (t− t1) · (t− t2) · (t− (m2 + δ2))\nClearly g′(δ1,δ2) has exactly one root c − (δ1,δ2) between m1−δ1 and t1 and exactly one root c+(δ1,δ2) between t2 and m2 + δ2. From the root dragging theorem [37], we know that increasing the value of δ1 will continuously decrease the values of c−(δ1,δ2) and c + (δ1,δ2) . From the polynomial root motion theorem [38], we moreover know that c−(δ1,δ2) will decrease faster than c + (δ1,δ2) . Similarly, when increasing the value of δ2, c + (δ1,δ2) will increase faster than c−(δ1,δ2). Since the values of the c−(δ1,δ2) and c + (δ1,δ2) depend continuously on θ1 and θ2, and c−0 ≥ m1 and c+0 ≤ m2, it follows that values of θ1 and θ2 must exist such that c−(δ1,δ2) = m1 and c + (δ1,δ2) = m2.\nNote that if ‖h‖ = 1, f(t) is the signed distance between M(t) and H, i.e. |f(t)| = d(M(t), H). Also note that in the case of the previous lemma, H will also intersect the moment curve at some points M(t0) and M(t3) such that t0 < m1 < t1 < t2 < m2 < t3 and f will reach another extremum between t1 and t2. We will also use the following lemma.\nLemma 2. Let P and Q be sets of points in Rn which are separated by the hyperplane H, with Q ∩H = ∅. Let r ∈ H and let h 6= 0 be a vector which is orthogonal to H such that r+h is in the same half-space induced by H as P . For sufficiently large λ > 0 it holds that\nmax p∈P d(p, r + λ · h) < min q∈Q d(q, r + λ · h)\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume that ‖h‖ = 1. Let p ∈ P and q ∈ Q. Let p0, q0 ∈ H, λp ≥ 0 and λq > 0 be such that p = p0 + λp · h and q = q0 − λq · h. It holds that\nd(q, r + λ · h)2 − d(p, r + λ · h)2 = d(q0, r)2 + (λ+ λq)2 − d(p0, r)2 − (λ− λp)2\n= d(q0, r) 2 + λ2q − d(p0, r)2 − λ2p + 2λ(λp + λq)\nSince λp + λq > 0 it follows that by taking λ sufficiently large the latter expression can always be made positive, in which case we have:\nd(p, r + λ · h)2 < d(q, r + λ · h)2\nNote that in the lemma above we do not require P ∩H = ∅.\nCorollary 10. Let H be a hyperplane, r ∈ H, h 6= 0 a vector which is orthogonal to H. Let p and q be two points which are both in the opposite half-space induced by H as r+h. If d(p,H) < d(q,H), it holds for sufficiently large λ > 0 that d(p, r + λ · h) < d(q, r + λ · h).\nProof. Indeed, we can consider a hyperplane H ′ which is parallel to H and which separates p and q. The result then easily follows from the previous lemma by taking H := H ′, P = {p} and Q = {q}.\nCorollary 11. Let H be a hyperplane, r ∈ H, h 6= 0 a vector which is orthogonal to H. Let p and q be two points which are both in the same halfspace induced by H as r + h. If d(p,H) > d(q,H), it holds for sufficiently large λ > 0 that d(p, r + λ · h) < d(q, r + λ · h).\nAssociating variables with points on the moment curve. Let Θ be a network over {EC,DC,TPP,TPP−1}. The set of variables V can then be organized in a set of ordered trees T1, ..., Tk, such that a is a descendant of b in a given tree iff Θ |= {aTPP b}. For the ease of presentation, we will consider a single ordered tree T (whose root does not correspond to any region) which has the trees T1, ..., Tk as its subtrees directly below the root. For example, Figure 10 shows the tree corresponding to a network Θ containing the following constraints:\nv1 TPP v5 v3 TPP v2 v4 TPP v2 v2 TPP v5 v3 TPP v5 v4 TPP v5\nv7 TPP v9 v8 TPP v9 v9 TPP v6 v10 TPP v6 v7 TPP v6 v8 TPP v6\nas well as viTPP v11 for all i ∈ {1, ..., 10} and either the constraint viEC vj or viDC vj for every pair of regions vi, vj not mentioned. Without loss of generality, we can make the following assumptions.\nAssumption 1. Every non-leaf node in this tree has exactly two children.\nAssumption 2. If Θ |= aEC b and a is not a leaf node, then there is a leaf node c such that Θ |= {cTPP a, cEC b}.\nAssumption 3. If Θ |= aEC b and a is a leaf node, then there is a non-leaf node c such that Θ |= {aTPP c, cEC b}.\nAssumption 4. There are regions z1, z2, z3 in V such that z1 and z2 are leaf nodes, Θ |= {z1 TPP z3, z2 TPP z3} and for every other region a, it holds that Θ |= {z1 EC a, z2 EC a, z3 EC a}.\nIndeed, we can always make Assumption 1 satisfied by adding extra regions (e.g. if a has three children x, y, z, we could add a new region u together with the constraints yTPPu, zTPPu and uTPP a). Assumption 2 can be made satisfied by introducing two new regions c1 and c2 (to ensure that Assumption 1 remains satisfied) and adding the constraints c1 TPP a, c2 TPP a, c1 DC c2 and c1 EC b to Θ. Similarly, we can always satisfy Assumption 3, by introducing new regions c and a′ and adding the constraints aTPP c, a′TPP c, aDC a′ and cEC b as well as cTPP v for every region v ∈ V such that Θ |= aTPP v. Note that Assumption 3 implies that when a and b are siblings and leaf nodes, it follows that Θ |= aDC b. Finally, Assumption 4 can be satisfied by introducing new regions z1, z2, z3 and adding to Θ the constraints z1 TPP z3, z2 TPP z3, z1 DC z2, as well as z1 EC a,\nz2 EC a and z3 EC a for every other region a in V . It is clear that adding these latter relations cannot introduce any inconsistencies, as Θ does not contain any relations of the form NTPP or NTPP−1 and the composition R ◦ EC includes EC for any other RCC8 base relation R (see Table 2).\nEach variable v in V will be associated with a point M(tv) on the fourdimensional moment curve (with tv > 0). To choose the values tv we use the following recursive procedure Assign starting with x = root and arbitrary values for λ1 and λ2 satisfying 0 < λ1 < λ2:\nAssign(x,λ1,λ2)\n• If x is not a leaf node: – Let a and b be the two children of x.\n– choose values δx and εx such that λ1 < λ1 + δx < λ2 − εx < λ2; as will be explained further, the values δx and εx will need to be chosen sufficiently small in some sense. – choose values ta and tb such that λ1 < ta < tb < λ1 + δx. – Assign(a,λ1,ta) – Assign(b,v − εx,λ2)\nThe variables in the tree in Figure 10 are labelled such that they reflect the order in which the corresponding points occur on the moment curve, i.e. the following condition is satisfied:\ntv1 < tv2 < ... < tvm\nBelow, we will impose particular constraints on the values δx and εx. For now, the main observation is that for every left child x and its sibling y, it holds that the points corresponding to regions which are contained in x occur before M(tx) on the moment curve and the points corresponding to regions which are contained in y occur after M(ty) on the moment curve. In other words, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 3. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x and let b be a descendant of y. It holds that ta < tx < ty < tb.\nCorollary 12. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x and let b be a descendant of y. It holds that d(M(ta), M(tx)) < d(M(ta),M(ty)) and d(M(tb),M(ty)) < d(M(tb),M(tx)).\nLet x be an ancestor of a (a 6= x) and y an ancestor of b (b 6= y) such that x and y are siblings and ta < tx < ty < tb. Let Hab = {w |hab ·w = θab, w ∈ R4}, for given hab ∈ R4 and θab ∈ R, be a hyperplane intersecting the moment curve at M(tx) and M(ty) and such that the function fab : R → R defined by fab(t) = hab ·M(t)− θab reaches an extremum at ta and tb. Note that the hyperplane Hab is guaranteed to exist by Lemma 1. Let λ\n∗ > 0. We define:\nqab = pxy + λ ∗ · hab (2)\nwhere\npxy = M(tx) +M(ty)\n2 (3)\nWithout loss of generality, we can assume that hab is such that M(ta) and M(tb) are at the same side of Hab as qab.\nLemma 4. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x (a 6= x) and let b be a descendant of y (b 6= y). Let u be a descendant of x (u 6= a, u 6= x). If λ∗ is sufficiently large, it holds that\nd(qab,M(ta)) < d(qab,M(tu)) (4)\nSimilarly, if v is a descendant of y (v 6= b, v 6= y), then for a sufficiently large λ∗ we have\nd(qab,M(tb)) < d(qab,M(tv)) (5)\nProof. Because of the way in which Hab was chosen, we have that fab reaches its only extremum left of tx at ta. Since tv < tx, one of the following cases must hold:\n1. tv and ta are located at the same side of Hab (which is the side at which qab is located), and d(tv, Hab) < d(ta, Hab); or 2. tv is located at the opposite side of H as ta and qab.\nIn the former case, (4) follows from Corollary 11, while in the latter case, (4) follows from Lemma 2. In entirely the same way, we can also show (5).\nLemma 5. Let x and y be siblings in T , with x being left of y. Let a be a descendant of x (a 6= x) and let b be a descendant of y (b 6= y). Let u 6= a be an ancestor of a or b and let v be the sibling of u. If λ∗ is chosen to be sufficiently large, it holds that\nd(qab,M(tu)) ≤ d(qab,M(tv)) (6)\nProof. Let x and y be defined as before. We consider the following cases:\n• If tu < ta, then a, b, x and y are all descendants of u. It follows that tv < tu < ta. Then (6) easily follows from the fact that ta is the only maximum of fab left of tx (as in the proof of Lemma 4).\n• If ta < tu < tx, then by construction, u is a descendant of x and an ancestor of a. It then holds that ta < tu < tv < tx. Again we obtain (6)from the fact that ta is the only maximum of fab left of tx.\n• If tu = tx then tv = ty and it follows that d(qab,M(tu)) = d(qab,M(tv)) by construction of qab.\n• The case where tx < tu < ty is not possible.\n• If tu = ty then tv = tx and it again follows that d(qab,M(tu)) = d(qab, M(tv)).\n• If ty < tu < tb then u is a descendant of y and an ancestor of b, and we have ty < tv < tu < tb, and (6) follows from the fact that tb is the only maximum of fab right of ty.\n• If tb < tu then a, b, x and y are all descendants of u and it follows that tb < tu < tv, from which we can show (6) using the fact that tb is the only maximum of fab right of ty.\nIn the following, we assume that λ∗ is chosen sufficiently large such that (4)–(6) hold for every a and b.\nWe now turn to the question how the values δx and εx in the procedure Assign need to be chosen. Intuitively, if x and y are siblings in the tree T such that x is left of y, we want to ensure that the values tv corresponding to the descendants of y are sufficiently close to each other, and that they are sufficiently far from the values tv corresponding to the descendants of x. In particular, the hyperplane Hab intersects the moment curve at points M(sab), M(tx), M(ty) and M(rab), where sab < ta and rab > tb. Let z be the parent of x and y in the tree T . Note that sab and rab depend on the choice of ta and tb: the smaller ta and tb, the smaller the values of sab and rab will be. However, from the polynomial root motion theorem ([38], see also the proof of Lemma 1), we know that moving ta will have a greater impact on sab than on rab. In particular, if rab is sufficiently far from sab, tx and ty, the impact on rab of moving the value of ta will be negligible. By choosing δz sufficiently small, we can ensure that the points ra1b, ..., rakb, where a1, ..., ak are the descendants of x, are arbitrarily close to each other. This means that the vectors ha1b, ...,hakb are all approximately located in (i.e. arbitrarily close to) the same two-dimensional plane G. As a result, it is clear that the following assumption will be satisfied.\nAssumption 5. Let a1, a2 and c be descendants of x such that tc < ta1 or tc > ta2. Let d be a descendant of y and let h\n∗ be a vector bisecting ha1d and ha2d. It holds that\ncos(h∗,hcd) < min(cos(h ∗,ha1d), cos(h ∗,ha2d))\nIf moreover εz is sufficiently small, the angles (hab,hab′) will be negligible compared to (hab,ha′b), where a and a ′ are descendants of x and b and b′ are descendants of y. This means that the following stronger assumption will also be satisfied.\nAssumption 6. Let a1, a2 and c be descendants of x such that tc < ta1 or tc > ta2. Let d be a descendant of y and let h\n∗ be a vector bisecting ha1d and ha2d. It holds that\ncos(h∗,hcd) < min(cos(h ∗,ha1d′), cos(h ∗,ha2d′))\nfor every descendant d′ of y.\nThis latter assumption allows us to prove the following lemma.\nLemma 6. Let x and y be siblings such that tx < ty and let a be a descendant of x (or a = x). Consider the following regions:\nA+ = CH{qcd | c is a descendant of a (or c = a), c 6= x, d is a descendant of y (d 6= y)} A− = CH{qcd | c is a descendant of x (c 6= x) but not a descendant of a (c 6= a), d is a descendant of y (d 6= y)}"

      "text" : "Proof. There exist values t−a and t + a such that for every region c, it holds that c is a descendant of a iff tc ∈ [t−a , t+a ]. Fix a descendant d∗ of y. Let h∗ be the unique vector of unit length bisecting ha−d∗ and ha+d∗ and let q∗ = pxy + λ\n∗ · h∗. Let H∗ be the hyperplane which is orthogonal to h∗ and which contains pxy (where pxy is defined as in (3)). Furthermore, we define H∗θ as the hyperplane which is parallel to and at distance θ from H\n∗, where H∗θ for θ > 0 is located in the same half-space induced by H\n∗ as qxy. Let us in particular consider the following choice for θ:\nθ = min c,d d(H∗, qcd) = min c,d λ∗ · cos(h∗,hcd) (7)\nwhere the minimum is taken over all descendants c of a and all descendants d of y. We will show that H∗θ is a hyperplane separating A\n− from A+. It is sufficient to show that for every c which is not a descendant of a and every descendant d of y, it holds that\nd(H∗, qcd) = λ ∗ · cos(h∗,hcd) < θ (8)\nWe have that either tc < t − a or tc > t − a , which by Assumption 6 means that for all descendants d and d′ of y\ncos(h∗,hcd) < min(cos(h ∗,ha−d′), cos(h ∗,ha+d′))\nThe minimum in (7) is attained for either c = a− or c = a+. It follows that (8) holds, and thus that H∗θ is a hyperplane separating A − and A+.\nAssociating variables with convex regions. For each region x and its sibling y in the tree, we can consider the Voronoi diagram induced by the corresponding points on the moment curve M(tx) and M(ty). Let us denote the corresponding cells as Xx and Xy. For each node a we define:\nYa = Xa ∩ ⋂ {Xx |x is an ancestor of a}\nIf a and b are leaf nodes such that Θ |= aEC b, it follows from Assumption 3 that a has an ancestor x (a 6= x) and b has an ancestor y (b 6= y) such that x and y are siblings in T . We then have that qab is well-defined.\nLemma 7. For all leaf nodes a and b such that Θ |= aEC b, it holds that qab ∈ Ya ∩ Yb.\nProof. Let a′ be the sibling of a in the tree. From Lemma 4, it follows that d(qab,M(ta)) ≤ d(qab,M(ta′)) which means qab ∈ Xa. Now let u be an arbitrary ancestor of a and let v be the sibling of x. By Lemma 5 we then know that d(qab,M(tu)) ≤ d(qab,M(tv)), which implies qab ∈ Xu. Since this holds for every ancestor of a, it follows that qab ∈ Ya. In entirely the same way, we find qab ∈ Yb.\nLet Sa be a small hypersphere centered around M(ta):\nSa = {p | d(p,M(ta)) ≤ ε}\nfor ε > 0 a sufficiently small constant. We realize each variable a corresponding to a leaf node in the tree as the convex region Za defined as:\nZa = CH(Sa ∪ {qab |Θ |= aEC b, b is a leaf node})\nEach region a which is not a a leaf node is realized as\nZa = CH({Zb | b is a leaf node and a descendant of a})\nFrom Lemma 7, it follows that Za ⊆ Ya, which implies ZaDRZb unless a is a descendant or ancestor of b. Moreover, from Assumption 2, we know that when Θ |= aEC b it will hold that ZaECZb. Moreover, by construction, it is clear that aP b when a is a descendant of b (a 6= b). From Assumption 1, it follows that then aPP b, and because of Assumption 4 we moreover have aTPP b.\nIt remains to be shown that ZaDCZb if Θ |= aDC b. Assume Θ |= aDC b. Let x be an ancestor of a (or x = a) and y be an ancestor of b (or y = b) such that x and y are siblings. First assume that neither of x and y is a leaf node. Now consider the sets Pa and Pb defined as follows:\nPa = {qcd | c is a descendant of a (or c = a), d is a descendant of y, c and d are leaf nodes,Θ |= cEC d}\nPb = {qcd | c is a descendant of x , d is a descendant of b (or d = b), c and d are leaf nodes,Θ |= cEC d}\nLetGxy be the hyperplane which separatesXx fromXy. Noting thatGxy then also separates Za from Zb, we have CH(Pa) = Za∩Gxy and CH(Pb) = Zb∩Gxy. To show that Za∩Zb = ∅, it thus suffices to show that CH(Pa)∩CH(Pb) = ∅. Note that if qcd ∈ Pb it must be the case that c is not a descendant of a, since qcd ∈ Pb implies cEC d and d{TPP,EQ}b and thus cEC b. Also note that qcd ∈ Pa or qcd ∈ Pb means that c 6= x and d 6= y since x and y are not leaf nodes, i.e. all elements of Pa and Pb are well-defined. It follows that CH(Pa) ⊆ A+ and CH(Pb) ⊆ A− in the sense of Lemma 6, from which we can derive that indeed CH(Pa) ∩ CH(Pb) = ∅. Now assume that x is a leaf node (and thus x = a). Then it is clear that y cannot have any descendant c such that Θ |= xEC c, as by Assumption 3, this would mean that x has an ancestor z such that Θ |= zEC c and thus Θ |= zEC y, which means that x and y would not be siblings. Hence we have that Za ∩ Gxy = Zb ∩ Gxy = ∅ from which we again find ZaDCZb. Finally, the case where y is a leaf node is entirely similar.\nThis completes the proof of Proposition 16. Additionally considering NTPP relations does not introduce any additional difficulties, i.e. we also have the following result.\nProposition 17. Every consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,DC, TPP,TPP−1,NTPP,NTPP−1} has a convex solution in R4.\nProof. The proof proceeds by induction on the number of NTPP or NTPP−1 relations in Θ, entirely analogously to the proof of Proposition 14."

For every n ≥ 1 there exists a consistent atomic RCC5 network Θ over {DR,PO,PP,PP−1} which has no convex solution in Rn.\nProof. Let n ≥ 1 be arbitrary and consider the following set of RCC5 constraints Θ. For 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n+ 2, add the following constraints to Θ:\naiDR aj (9)\nFor each subset I ⊆ {1, ..., n + 2} we introduce a variable bI and for each i ∈ I we add the following constraint to Θ:\naiPP bI (10)\nFor each j /∈ I, we moreover add the following constraint:\naj DR bI (11)\nFor any two (different) subsets I and J of {1, ..., n+ 2}:\n• If I ⊂ J , we add to Θ the constraint bI PP bJ .\n• Else, if I ⊃ J , we add to Θ the constraint bI PP−1 bJ .\n• Else, if I ∩ J 6= ∅, we add to Θ the constraint bI PO bJ .\n• Else, we add to Θ the constraint bI DR bJ .\nIt is clear that Θ is a consistent atomic network over {DR,PO,PP,PP−1}. Suppose Θ had a convex solution S in Rn. Fix an arbitrary point pi in the interior of each region S(ai). It is clear that the points p1, ..., pn+2 are distinct, because of (9). Because of Radon’s theorem, there exists a set I ⊆ {1, ..., n+ 2} such that CH( ⋃ i∈I pi) ∩ CH( ⋃ i/∈I pi) 6= ∅. As each pi is an interior point of S(ai), it follows that there exists an ε > 0 such that\nS(bI) ∩ S(bcoI) ⊇ {p | d(p, q) ≤ ε, q ∈ CH( ⋃ i∈I pi) ∩ CH( ⋃ i/∈I pi)}\nIn particular, this means that dim(S(bI) ∩ S(bcoI)) = n, where coI = {1, ..., n + 2} \\ I. This contradicts the constraint bI DR bcoI which is entailed by Θ.\nThe proof of Proposition 19 remains valid if we replace the role of PP by either TPP or NTPP and if we replace DR by either EC or DC.

For every n ≥ 1, there exist consistent atomic RCC8 networks over the following sets of base relations which have no convex solutions in Rn:\n• {DC,PO,TPP,TPP−1}\n• {EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1}\n• {DC,PO,NTPP,NTPP−1}\n• {EC,PO,NTPP,NTPP−1}"

      "text" : "Throughout this section, let Θ be an atomic and consistent RCC8 network which does not contain any occurrences of EQ. The aim of this section is to establish an upper bound on the number of dimensions which are needed to guarantee that Θ can be convexly realized. Our strategy is to start with a restricted network Θ↓V ′, with V ′ ⊆ V , for which the results from the previous section guarantee a convex solution in R, R2, R3 or R4. Then we incrementally build a convex solution for Θ from the convex solution of Θ↓V ′. The main technique we use to extend the initial solution for Θ↓V ′ is the following proposition, where a subnetwork Θ↓Z (Z ⊆ V ) is called an O-clique if Θ |= z1Oz2 for every z1, z2 ∈ Z. We say that an O-clique Θ↓Z has a common part in a solution S if ⋂ z∈Z S(z) is a non-empty regularly closed region.\nProposition 20. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. Suppose that Θ↓V ′ has a k-dimensional convex solution in which every O-clique has a common part, and moreover that Θ entails the following constraints:\na1 NTPP a2 a2 NTPP a3 ... al−1 NTPP ar\nb1 NTPP b2 b2 NTPP b3 ... bl−1 NTPP bs\narDC bs\nIt holds that Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {a1, ..., ar, b1, ..., bs}) has a (k + 1)-dimensional convex solution in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Let S be a convex solution of Θ↓V ′ in Rk; we construct a convex solution T of Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {a1, ..., ar, b1, ..., bs}) in Rk+1. Let Ar+1 = Bs+1 be an arbitrary non-empty convex region which strictly contains S(v) for every v ∈ V ′. Let Ai and Bj for i ∈ {1, ..., r} and j ∈ {1, ..., s} be defined as:\nAi = Eδi(Ai+1) ∩ ⋂ {S(v) |Θ |= aiTPP v, v ∈ V ′}\n∩ ⋂ {Eδi(S(v)) |Θ |= aiNTPP v, v ∈ V ′}\nBj = Eδ′j(Bj+1) ∩ ⋂ {S(v) |Θ |= bj TPP v, v ∈ V ′}\n∩ ⋂ {Eδ′j(S(v)) |Θ |= bj NTPP v, v ∈ V ′}\nwhere Eδ is the erosion operator defined by Eδ(X) = {p | ∀q . (d(p, q) ≤ δ)⇒ (q ∈ X)}. We will assume that δi is sufficiently small to ensure the following three conditions:\n• Ai is non-empty and dim(Ai) = k.\n• For every v, w ∈ V ′ if Θ |= vNTPPw it holds that S(v) ⊆ Eδi(S(w)).\n• For every v ∈ V ′ and i ∈ {1, ..., n} such that S(v) ⊆ i(Ai+1) it holds that S(v) ⊂ Eδi(Ai+1).\nand analogously for δ′j and Bj. Note that we can assume that Ai is nonempty because every O-clique has a common part. It is clear that we can make these assumptions without loss of generality. Note that since Ai ⊆ Eδi(Ai+1), it holds that AiNTPPAj for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ r and similarly we have BiNTPPBj for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ s.\nLet 0 < a−r < a − r−1 < ... < a − 1 < a + 1 < a + 2 < ... < a + r and b − s < b − s−1 <\n... < b−1 < b + 1 < b + 2 < ... < b + s < 0. We define T for ai and bj as:\nT (ai) = {(x1, ..., xk, y) | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ Ai, y ∈ [a−i , a+i ]} T (bj) = {(x1, ..., xk, y) | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ Bj, y ∈ [b−j , b+j ]}\nSince AiNTPPAj and [a − i , a + i ]NTPP [a − j , a + j ] for i < j we immediately find T (ai)NTPP T (aj) and similarly we find T (bi)NTPP T (bj). Moreover, since b+s < 0 < a − r we have T (ai)DC T (bj) for 1 ≤ i ≤ r and 1 ≤ j ≤ s. For v ∈ V ′ we define:\nT (v) = {(x1, ..., xk, y) | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ S(v), y ∈ [v−, v+]}\nwhere v− < v+ are defined as follows. Let the level ∆(v) of a region v be defined as in Section 4.2.2. We define:\nv+ =  a+r + ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= arNTPP v a+i if Θ |= aiTPP v a+i + ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= aiNTPP v, i < r and Θ 6|= ai+1 P v a−1 +a + 1 2 + ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= a1{PO,TPP−1,NTPP−1}v a−1 if Θ |= a1 EC v a−i +a − i−1 2 + ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= ai−1 DC v, i > 1 and Θ |= aiO v a−i if Θ |= ai−1 DC v, i > 1 and Θ |= aiEC v ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= arDC v and Θ 6|= vP bs b+j if Θ |= vTPP bj b+j +b + j−1 2 + ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= vNTPP bj, j > 1, Θ 6|= vP bj−1 b+1 +b − 1\n2 + ∆(v) · ε if Θ |= vNTPP b1\nv− =  b−s −∆(v) · ε if Θ |= bsNTPP v b−j if Θ |= bj TPP v b−j −∆(v)ε if Θ |= bj NTPP v, j < s and Θ 6|= bj+1 P v b−1 +b + 1 2 −∆(v) · ε if Θ |= b1{PO,TPP−1,NTPP−1}v b+1 if Θ |= b1 EC v b+j +b + j−1 2 −∆(v) · ε if Θ |= bj−1 DC v, j > 1 and Θ |= bj O v b+j if Θ |= bj−1 DC v, j > 1 and Θ |= bj EC v −∆(v) · ε if Θ |= bsDC v and Θ 6|= vP ar a−i if Θ |= vTPP ai a−i +a − i−1 2 −∆(v) · ε if Θ |= vNTPP ai, i > 1, Θ 6|= vP ai−1 a−1 +a + 1\n2 −∆(v) · ε if Θ |= vNTPP a1\nwhere ε > 0 is sufficiently small. First note that v− < v+. Indeed, if Θ 6|= vP ar and Θ 6|= vP bs, it holds that v− < 0 < v+. Now consider Θ |= vP ar and let i be the smallest i for which Θ |= vP ai, then we have a−i ≤ v− < a−i +a − i−1 2 < v+ < a−i−1 if i > 1 and a − 1 ≤ v− < a−1 +a + 1 2 < v+ < a+1 otherwise. The case where Θ |= vP bs is entirely similar. It is straightforward to verify that the RCC8 relations which hold between T (v), on the one hand, and T (a1), ..., T (ar), T (b1), ..., T (bs), on the other,\nare those which are imposed by Θ. Finally, we need to show that T is also a solution of Θ↓V ′, given that S is a solution of Θ↓V ′. Let u1, u2 ∈ V ′.\n• The cases where Θ |= u1 DCu2 or Θ |= u1 TPPu2 are trivial.\n• Assume that Θ |= u1 NTPPu2. By construction it is clear that T (u1)PP T (u2). The fact that T (u1)NTPP T (u2) follows easily from the observation that ∆(u1) < ∆(u2).\n• Assume that Θ |= u1 ECu2 and let (x1, ..., xk) ∈ S(u1) ∩ S(u2). It is clear that T (u1)DR T (u2); we show that T (u1) ∩ T (u2) 6= ∅:\n– If Θ 6|= u1 P ar, Θ 6|= u1 P bs, Θ 6|= u2 P ar and Θ 6|= u2 P bs, it holds that (x1, ..., xk, 0) ∈ T (u1) ∩ T (u2).\n– Suppose that Θ |= u1 TPP ai and Θ 6|= u1 P ai−1 (or i = 1). Note that then u−1 = a − i and u + 1 > a−i +a − i−1 2 if i > 1 and u+1 > a−1 +a + 1 2\notherwise. Since Θ |= u1 ECu2 it must hold that Θ 6|= u2 DC ai. If Θ |= u2 EC ai, it holds that u+2 = a−i and thus (x1, ..., xk, a−i ) ∈ T (u1) ∩ T (u2). Similarly, if Θ |= u2 O ai, it holds that (x1, ..., xk, a−i +a − i−1 2 ) ∈ T (u1) ∩ T (u2) if i > 1 and (x1, ..., xk, a − 1 +a + 1 2 ) ∈\nT (u1) ∩ T (u2) otherwise. – Suppose that Θ |= u1 NTPP ai and Θ 6|= u1 P ai−1 (or i = 1).\nThen Θ |= u1 ECu2 implies Θ |= u2 O ai and we again find (x1, ..., xk, a−i +a − i−1 2 ) ∈ T (u1) ∩ T (u2) if i > 1 and (x1, ..., xk, a − 1 +a + 1 2 ) ∈\nT (u1) ∩ T (u2) otherwise. – The case where Θ |= u2 P bs is entirely analogous.\n• Assume that Θ |= u1 POu2 and let (x1, ..., xk) ∈ i(S(u1)) ∩ i(S(u2)). We show that i(T (u1))∩ i(T (u2)) 6= ∅ from which it easily follows that T (u1)PO T (u2).\n– If Θ 6|= u1 P ar, Θ 6|= u1 P bs, Θ 6|= u2 P ar and Θ 6|= u2 P bs, it holds that (x1, ..., xk, 0) ∈ i(T (u1)) ∩ i(T (u2)).\n– Suppose that Θ |= u1 TPP ai and Θ 6|= u1 P ai−1 (or i = 1). Since Θ |= u1 POu2 it must hold that Θ |= u2 O ai. It follows that (x1, ..., xk, a−i +a − i−1 2 ) ∈ i(T (u1)) ∩ i(T (u2)) if i > 1 and (x1, ..., xk,\na−1 +a + 1\n2 ) ∈ i(T (u1)) ∩ i(T (u2)) otherwise.\n– The cases where Θ |= u1 NTPP ai or Θ |= u2 P bs are entirely analogous.\nExample 5. Consider the consistent atomic network Θ which contains the following constraints\nxNTPP y uNTPP y yNTPP z xECu\na1 NTPP a2 b1 NTPP b2 a2 DC b2\nuEC a1 uPO a2 uPO b1\na1 NTPP y yPO a2 yPO b1\na2 NTPP z zPO b1 xTPP a1\nas well as all constraints which are implied by the above constraints. Figure 11 shows a possible convex realization in R of the restricted network Θ↓{x, y, z, u}. The remaining regions, a1, a2, b1, b2, satisfy the condition of Proposition 20. By applying the construction from the proof of Proposition 20, a twodimensional convex solution of Θ is obtained, which is shown in Figure 12.\nNote that in the above proposition, it is possible that r = 0, or s = 0, or r = s = 1. We have the following corollary.\nCorollary 14. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If Θ↓V ′ has a convex solution in Rk in which every O-clique has a common part and Θ |= a{DC,NTPP}b, then Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {a, b}) has a convex solution Rk+1 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nMoreover, we can generate a convex solution for any network, using the following corollary.\nCorollary 15. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If Θ↓V ′ has a convex solution in Rk in which every O-clique has a common part, then Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {a}) has a convex solution Rk+1 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nTogether with Proposition 17, we obtain the following upper bound.\nCorollary 16. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and let V ′ ⊆ V be such that Θ↓V ′ does not contain any occurrences of PO. It holds that Θ has a convex solution in R|V \\V ′|+4.\nSimilar results can be obtained based on the fragments of RCC8, identified in Figure 2, which guarantee convex solutions in R, R2 and R3."

      "text" : "We now turn our attention to the problem of deriving an upper bound on the number of required dimensions which only depends on the number of variables. In particular, we will show that a consistent network with at most 2n + 1 regions can be convexly realized in Rn, provided that n ≥ 2. This result does not hold for n = 1: although most consistent networks of three variables are convexly realizable on the real line, there are two exceptions, as made explicit in the following lemma.\nLemma 8. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over the set of variables V . If |V | = 3 then Θ has a convex solution in R unless Θ is\nisomorphic to one of the following networks:\nN13 = {aEC b, bEC c, aEC c} N23 = {aPO b, bEC c, aEC c}\nProof. Let us write V = {a, b, c}. If Θ contains an instance of the relation DC or NTPP then the result follows immediately from Proposition 20 (e.g. if Θ |= aDC b, then we can extend a 0-dimensional realization of c to a 1-dimensional convex realization of Θ). Assume that Θ contains an instance of TPP, e.g. Θ |= aTPP b. We define the solution of Θ as follows, only considering the cases where Θ does not contain any instances of DC or NTPP:\n• If cTPP a and cTPP b: S(a) = [0, 2], S(b) = [0, 3] and S(c) = [0, 1].\n• If aTPP c and bTPP c: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [0, 3].\n• If aTPP c and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [−1, 1] and S(c) = [0, 2].\n• If cPO a and cTPP b: S(a) = [0, 2], S(b) = [−1, 2] and S(c) = [−1, 1].\n• If cPO a and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 2], S(b) = [0, 3] and S(c) = [−1, 1].\n• If cEC a and cTPP b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [1, 2].\n• If cEC a and cEC b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [−1, 0].\n• If cEC a and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 1], S(b) = [0, 2] and S(c) = [1, 3].\nIf Θ does not contain any instances of DC, NTPP or TPP, then either it is isomorphic to N13 or it contains an instance of PO. In the latter case, assuming that Θ |= aPO b, we define the solution of Θ as follows:\n• If cPO a and cPO b: S(a) = [0, 3], S(b) = [1, 4] and S(c) = [2, 5].\n• If cPO a and cEC b: S(a) = [1, 3], S(b) = [2, 4] and S(c) = [0, 2].\n• If cEC a and cPO b: S(a) = [2, 4], S(b) = [1, 3] and S(c) = [0, 2].\n• If cEC a and cEC b then Θ is isomorphic to N23 .\nTo show that consistent networks with 2n + 1 variables have a convex solution in Rn we first need a number of technical lemmas. Let Θ′ be the RCC8 network which is obtained from Θ by replacing every constraint of the form aTPP b by aPP b and every constraint of the form aEC b by aDR b. We say that S is a weak solution of Θ iff S is a solution of Θ′.\nLemma 9. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and assume that Θ↓V ′ has a convex weak solution in Rk in which every O-clique has a common part. Let u ∈ V \\ V ′ be such that Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {u}) is a network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP−1} and assume that one of the following conditions is satisfied:\nfor every v ∈ V ′ it holds that Θ 6|= vTPPu and Θ 6|= uTPP v (12) for every v ∈ V ′ it holds that Θ 6|= vECu and Θ 6|= uTPP v (13)\nIt holds that Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {u}) has a convex solution in Rk+1 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Let S be a k-dimensional convex weak solution of Θ↓V ′. We now define a (k + 1) dimensional solution T of Θ↓(V ′ ∪ {u}) as follows.\nLet us first consider the case where Θ 6|= vTPPu and Θ 6|= uTPP v for all v ∈ V ′. Let A be a non-empty k-dimensional convex region which strictly contains S(v) for every v ∈ V ′. We define:\nT (u) = {(λ · x1, ..., λ · xk, λ | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ A, λ ∈ [1, 2]}\nand for v ∈ V ′:\nT (v) = {(λ · x1, ..., λ · xk, λ | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ S(v), λ ∈ [0, λv]}\nwhere λv > 0 depends on the relation between v and u:\nλv = { 1 if Θ |= uEC v 1.5 if Θ |= uPO v\nGiven that (0, ..., 0) ∈ ⋂ v∈V ′ T (v), we then indeed have that T is a solution of Θ↓V ′. It is moreover clear that for each v ∈ V ′, the RCC8 relation between T (u) and T (v) is the one required by Θ.\nNow consider the case where Θ 6|= vECu and Θ 6|= uTPP v for any v in V ′. Let A be defined as before. We define for all v in V ′:\nT (u) = {(λ · x1, ..., λ · xk, λ | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ A, λ ∈ [0, 2]} T (v) = {(λ · x1, ..., λ · xk, λ | (x1, ..., xk) ∈ S(v), λ ∈ [0, λv]}\nλv = { 1 if Θ |= vTPPu 3 if Θ |= vPOu\nExample 6.

By applying the construction from the proof of Lemma 9, a two-dimensional convex solution of Θ is obtained, which is shown in Figure 14.\nRemark 2. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network and assume that Θ↓V ′ is a network over {EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1}. Then region u ∈ V ′ does not satisfy conditions (12) and (13) if and only if one of the following conditions is satisfied:\n• there exists v ∈ V ′ such that Θ |= uTPP v;\n• there exist v1, v2 ∈ V ′ such that Θ |= v1 TPPu and Θ |= v2 ECu.\nLemma 10. Let Θ be an RCC8 constraint network over {PO,TPP,TPP−1, EC} that involves four variables. Suppose Θ is consistent but has no convex weak solution in R. Then Θ is isomorphic to one of the following three networks, where an arrow, a solid line, and a dotted line represent, respectively,\na TPP, PO, and EC relation.\na\nb\nc d\na b\nc d\na b\nc d\n(N14 ) (N 2 4 ) (N 3 4 )\nProof. This can be checked by case-by-case analysis. We verified this using a computer program. The code of the program is available from the authors.\nWe note that each N i4 (i = 1, 2, 3) contains an EC relation. The following result is clear.\nCorollary 17. Let Θ be an RCC8 constraint network over {PO,TPP, TPP−1} that involves four variables. Suppose Θ is consistent. Then Θ has a convex weak solution in R.\nWe need a number of additional lemmas before we can present the main result.\nLemma 11. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP−1}. If |V | = 5 then Θ has a convex solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nLemma 12. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If |V | = 5 then Θ has a convex solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nLemma 13. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP−1} and V = {x, y, c1, c2, d1, d2}. If Θ |= {c1 EC d1, c2 EC d2} then Θ has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nLemma 14. Suppose Θ is a basic RCC8 network over {EC,PO,TPP, TPP−1} and V = {x, y, z, a, b, c, d}. In addition, assume that Θ satisfies\n• Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is N14 , N24 or N34 ;\n• there is no u in V which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9;\n• Θ |= {yTPPx, zECx, zEC y} and Θ 6|= xTPP v for v ∈ {a, b, c, d}.\nThen Θ has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. The proof is provided in Appendix B.\nProposition 21. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over the set of variables V . If |V | ≤ 2n + 1 with n ≥ 2 then Θ has a convex solution in Rn.\nProof. Suppose |V | = 2n + 1 (the case where |V | < 2n + 1 follows trivially) and n ≥ 2. Let W = {a1, ..., al, b1, ..., bl} be such that:\n• for each i ∈ {1, ..., l} it holds that Θ |= ai{DC,NTPP}bi;\n• Θ↓(V \\W ) is a network over {EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1}.\nNote that the number of elements in V \\ W is odd. If |V \\ W | = 1, then l = n, and we can start with a zero-dimensional solution of the unique element in V \\W and extend it to an n-dimensional convex solution of Θ by repeatedly applying Proposition 20. If |V \\W | = 3, we know from Lemma 12 that a 2-dimensional convex solution of Θ↓((V \\W ) ∪ {a1, b1}) exists. This solution can then be extended to a 2 + (l − 1) dimensional convex solution\nof Θ by repeatedly applying Proposition 20, where 2l = 2n+ 1− 3 and thus 2 + (l − 1) = n. Similarly, if |V \\W | = 5 it follows from Lemma 11 that a 2-dimensional convex solution of Θ↓(V \\W ) exists, which can be extended to an n-dimensional convex solution of Θ by repeated application of Proposition 20.\nNow assume that |V \\ W | ≥ 7. First assume that there is a region z ∈ V \\W which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9. Then there exists a U = {c1, ..., ck, d1, ..., dk} ⊆ V \\ (W ∪ {z}) such that\n• for each i ∈ {1, ..., k} it holds that Θ |= ciEC di;\n• Θ↓(V \\ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})) is a network over {PO,TPP,TPP−1}.\nNote that V \\(W∪U∪{z}) contains an even number of elements. If |V \\(W∪ U ∪{z})| ≥ 6 we start with a 2-dimensional convex solution of Θ↓(V \\ (W ∪ U∪{z})), whose existence is guaranteed by Corollary 3. This solution is then extended to a k+ 2 dimensional weak convex solution of Θ↓(V \\ (W ∪{z})), by repeatedly applying the method from Proposition 20, and then extended to a k+3 dimensional convex solution of Θ↓(V \\W ) by applying the method from Lemma 9. Finally, by repeatedly applying the method from Proposition 20, we obtain a k+l+3 dimensional convex solution of Θ. Note that 2n+1 = |W∪U∪{z}|+|V \\(W∪U∪{z})| = 2k+2l+1+|V \\(W∪U∪{z})| ≥ 2k+2l+7, from which we obtain k + l + 3 ≤ n.\nIf |V \\ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})| = 4, we know by Corollary 17 that Θ↓(V \\ (W ∪ U ∪ {z})) has a convex weak solution in R. By applying Proposition 20 and Lemma 9, as before, we can extend this weak solution to a convex solution of Θ in Rk+l+2, with k + l + 2 ≤ n.\nSuppose |V \\ (W ∪U ∪ {z})| = 2, and write V \\ (W ∪U ∪ {z}) = {x, y}. Note that U = {ci, di : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} for some k ≥ 2 and we have Θ |= ciEC di for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. By Lemma 13, we know Θ↓{x, y, c1, d1, c2, d2} has a convex weak solution in R2, which can be extended to a convex solution in Rk+l+1, using Proposition 20 and Lemma 9 as before.\nSuppose |V \\ (W ∪U ∪ {z})| = 0. Then U = {ci, di : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} for some k ≥ 3. By Lemma 13, we know Θ↓{c1, c2, c3, d1, d2, d3} has a convex weak solution in R2, which can be extended to a convex solution in Rk+l+1, using Proposition 20 and Lemma 9 as before.\nNow assume that there is no region z ∈ V \\W which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9. By Remark 2, this implies that for each u ∈ V \\W , we\nhave either Θ |= uTPP v for some v ∈ V \\W or there exist v1, v2 such that Θ |= {v1 TPPu, v2 ECu}. In particular, there are x, y, z ∈ V \\W such that Θ |= {yTPPx, xEC z, yEC z} and Θ 6|= xTPP v for any v ∈ V \\W .\nIf |V \\ (W ∪{x, y, z})| ≥ 6, we can proceed similarly as before. In particular, we construct a convex weak solution of V \\ (W ∪ {x, y, z}) in Rl, with |V \\ (W ∪{x, y, z})| = 2l+2. Then we extend it to a convex weak solution of V \\W in Rl+1 using the method from Proposition 20, and we modify it to a convex solution in Rl+2 of V \\W . Finally, we extend it to a convex solution in Rn of Θ.\nThe only remaining case is where |V \\(W ∪{x, y, z})| = 4. If V \\(W ∪{x, y, z}) is not isomorphic to one of the networks N14 , N24 , N34 , we can construct a convex weak solution in R and extend it to a convex solution in Rn of Θ as before. Let us write V \\ (W ∪ {x, y, z}) = {a, b, c, d} and assume that Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is isomorphic to one of N14 , N24 , N34 . By Lemma 14 we know that Θ↓(V \\W ) has a convex weak solution in R2, from which it follows that Θ↓(V \\W ) has a convex solution in R3."

Because u and v are disjoint, we know {P1, P3} = {Pj1 , Pj2} or {P2, P4} = {Pj3 , Pj4}. This is a contradiction."

This implies that S(a)∩S(b) ⊆ H1 and S(c) ∩ S(d) ⊆ H2. All we need to show is that H1 6= H2. This is clear, however, because if H1 = H2 then H1 would separate S(a) from S(c) or S(d), which means that S(a) could not partially overlap with both S(c) and S(d). Thus dim(H1∩H2) ≤ 1 which also means dim(S(a)∩S(b)∩S(c)∩S(d)) ≤ 1.\nn dimensions\nFor any n ≥ 4 we consider the network ΘnD obtained by adding the following constraints to Θ2D for i ∈ {0, ..., n− 3}\neiTPP a eiNTPP fi aTPP fi giEC fi\ngiEC a uTPP gi vTPP gi eiEC b\ngiTPP b\nand the following constraints for i ∈ {1, ..., n− 3}\neiEC gi−1 giTPP gi−1\nWe show that dim(S(a) ∩ S(gn−3)) ≤ 1 for any n-dimensional convex solution S, which again leads to a contradiction, and thus that ΘnD is not realizable by n-dimensional convex regions.\nLet Gi be a hyperplane separating S(gi) and S(fi) for i ∈ {0, ..., n− 3}, and let H1 be a hyperplane separating S(a) and S(b) as before. We show by induction that dim(H1∩G0∩ ....∩Gk) ≤ n−k−2 for every k ∈ {0, ..., n−3}, from which the stated immediately follows.\nFirst assume that k = 0. It suffices to show that H1 6= G0 to show that dim(H1 ∩ G0) ≤ n − 2. If H1 = G0, we would have that S(a) ∩ S(b) ⊆ G0, and in particular that G0 contains a boundary point of S(e0); call this point P . However, since S(e0)NTPPS(f0), P would also belong to S(f0), and since G0 only contains boundary points of S(f0), we would have that P is a boundary point of S(f0) as well. This is a contradiction, since e0 NTPP f0 means that S(e0) can only contain internal points of S(f0).\nFor k > 0, we show that H1 ∩ G0 ∩ ... ∩ Gk−1 6⊆ Gk in a similar way. Suppose H1∩G0∩ ...∩Gk−1 ⊆ Gk did hold. We have that H1, G0, ..., Gk−1 all separate S(a) from S(gk−1), hence S(a)∩S(gk−1) ⊆ H1∩G0∩...∩Gk−1 ⊆ Gk. Since S(ek) ⊆ S(a) and S(ek) ∩ S(gk−1) 6= ∅, there must exist a point P in S(ek) ∩ S(gk−1) which is thus also in Gk. Clearly the point P is a boundary point of S(ek), and since ekNTPP fk, we have that P is an internal point of S(fk). This is a contraction, since Gk was assumed to be a hyperplane separating S(fk) from S(gk).\nFor any number of dimensions n we can thus find an RCC network which is consistent but cannot be realized by convex n-dimensional regions. The counterexamples we have provided for two and three dimensions are optimal, in the sense that they involve 2n + 2 regions, i.e. any convex network with fewer regions would necessarily be realizable by convex regions in n dimensions. The counterexample for n ≥ 4 dimensions, on the other hand, uses 3n regions, and the question whether counterexamples with fewer regions exist remains open."

      "text" : "We have studied how the consistency problem for RCC8 networks is affected by the requirement that all regions need to be convex. Previous results about convexity in RCC8 have been largely negative: for any fixed number of dimensions k, deciding whether a consistent RCC8 network Θ can be realized using convex regions in Rk is computationally hard [23]. In contrast, we have identified a number of important sufficient conditions under which consistent RCC8 networks have convex solutions. First, we have identified all restrictions on the set of base relations that guarantee that consistent atomic networks can be convexly realized in R, R2, R3 and R4. Second, we have shown an upper bound which only depends on the number of regions, i.e. every consistent RCC8 network with at most 2n+ 1 regions can be convexly realized in Rn (n ≥ 2).\nOur main motivation in this paper was to justify the use of standard RCC8 reasoners to reason about convex regions in high-dimensional spaces, e.g. to support qualitative reasoning about conceptual spaces [9, 39]. While existing work on conceptual spaces is mostly based on geometric representations (e.g. corresponding to the Voronoi diagram induced by a set of prototypes [9]), in practice it can be difficult to obtain accurate region-based representations from data, especially for concepts which are relatively rare.\nIn contrast, existing lexical resources such as WordNet4 and ConcepNet5 encode several relations that can be interpreted as qualitative spatial relations between conceptual space representations. For example, the hypernym/hyponym relations encoded in WordNet can be seen as PP and from ConceptNet it is sometimes possible to derive EC relations. For example, ConceptNet encodes6 that “jogging is a kind of exercise similar to running” and “jogging is slower than running”, from which we may derive joggingEC running. Similarly, natural language processing methods, e.g. based on Hearst patterns [40], can be used to learn qualitative semantic relations from natural language sentences. To use such knowledge about the meaning of concepts in applications, we therefore need methods for qualitative reasoning about meaning. The results we have presented in this paper provide the first step towards such applications.\nFuture work will build on these results by investigating generalizations of RCC5 and RCC8 which are tailored towards reasoning about concepts. For example, [18] has focused on adding a betweenness relation to RCC5, which is important for formalizing particular forms of commonsense reasoning [41]. In [42], a logic for concepts is introduced in which comparative distance can be expressed (i.e. “a is closer to b than to c”), which is important for formalizing categorization, but without guarantees that concepts can be realized as convex regions. An interesting question would then be whether the results from this paper, viz. the observation that requiring convexity does not affect consistency if the number of dimensions is sufficiently large, carries over to such more expressive settings."

      "heading" : "Appendix A. Complexity of deciding convex realizability in Rk",
      "text" : "In [23] it was shown that deciding whether a set of RCC8 constraints has a convex solution in R2 is as hard as deciding the consistency of a set of algebraic equations (of similar size) over the real numbers. This latter problem belongs to the complexity class ∃R, which has been introduced in [43]. The class ∃R is known to be in PSPACE and to contain NP, but its exact relationship with the polynomial hierarchy is yet to be determined. Here we show that deciding whether a set of RCC8 constraints has a convex solution in Rk is ∃R-complete for any fixed k ≥ 2. The membership proof follows easily from the membership proof for the 2-dimensional case (cf. the remark after Corollary 2 in [23]).\nWe show by induction that deciding whether a (not necessarily atomic) consistent RCC8 network over {PP,EC} has a convex solution in Rk is ∃Rhard. The case k = 2 has been shown in [23]. Now suppose that we have already shown this result for k = n − 1. Let Θ be any consistent RCC8 network over {PP,EC} and let V be the set of variables occurring in Θ. We construct the RCC8 network Ψ by adding to Θ the following constraints:\n• aEC b (for a and b fresh variables);\n• v1 PP v, v2 PP v, v1 PP a and v2 PP b for every v ∈ V (where v1 and v2 are fresh variables);\n• u1 EC v1 and u2 EC v2 for every constraint of the form uEC v in Θ.\nWe show that Ψ has a convex solution in Rn iff Θ has a convex solution in Rn−1. First suppose that Θ has a convex solution S in Rn−1 and let X = CH{S(v) | v ∈ V }. Then we can define a convex solution T of Ψ in Rn as follows:\nT (a) = {(x1, ..., xn−1, y) | (x1, ..., xn−1) ∈ X, y ∈ [−1, 0]} T (b) = {(x1, ..., xn−1, y) | (x1, ..., xn−1) ∈ X, y ∈ [0, 1]}\nand for each u ∈ V\nT (u) = {(x1, ..., xn−1, y) | (x1, ..., xn−1) ∈ S(u), y ∈ [−1, 1]} T (u1) = {(x1, ..., xn−1, y) | (x1, ..., xn−1) ∈ S(u), y ∈ [−1, 0]} T (u2) = {(x1, ..., xn−1, y) | (x1, ..., xn−1) ∈ S(u), y ∈ [0, 1]}\nIt is straightforward to verify that T is indeed a convex solution of Ψ. Conversely, assume that Ψ has a convex solution T in Rn. From aEC b it follows that there is an n − 1 dimensional hyperplane H separating T (a) and T (b). For v ∈ V , we define:\nS(v) = H ∩ T (v)\nBecause T (v1) and T (v2) are at opposite sides of H, we find that H ∩ T (v) corresponds to a regular closed region in Rn−1. It is also clear from the convexity of T (v) that S(v) is convex. Finally, we need to show that S is a solution of Θ.\nFor a constraint of the form uEC v ∈ Θ, we know that Ψ contains the constraints u1 EC v1 and u2 EC v2, and we can thus choose points p ∈ T (u1)∩ T (v1) and q ∈ T (u2) ∩ T (v2). The line segment between p and q intersects the hyperplane H at a point r. Since p ∈ T (u)∩ T (v) and q ∈ T (u)∩ T (v), because of the convexity of T (u) and T (v), we find r ∈ T (u) ∩ T (v), and thus S(u) ∩ S(v) 6= ∅. Furthermore it is clear that S(u) and S(v) cannot overlap, hence we find that S satisfies the constraint uEC v.\nFor a constraint of the form uPP v ∈ Θ, it is clear from T (u) ⊂ T (v) that S(u) ⊆ S(v). Moreover, we can assume without loss of generality that whenever uPP v ∈ Θ there is a z ∈ V such that uEC z and zTPP v (i.e. we can always introduce such variables z without affecting the consistency of Θ). It then easily follows from S(u) ⊆ S(v) that S(u) ⊂ S(v)."

Now suppose that Θ has a subnetwork which is isomorphic to N54 but not a subnetwork which is isomorphic to N44 , and moreover that e is externally connected to or contained in at least one of a, b, c, d, and e either contains or is contained in one of a, b, c, d (otherwise e satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9 which we assumed not to be the case).

Using Lemma 9, we then obtain that Θ has a convex solution in R2.\n– Suppose Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is isomorphic to N14 . Note that since e satisfies one of the conditions from Lemma 9 that Θ 6|= eTPP c. If Θ |= {cTPP e, dPO e} then the conditions of Lemma 9 are satisfied for u = d and since Θ↓{a, b, c, e} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N 2 4 , N 3 4 it follows that Θ has a convex solution.

Finally, if Θ |= cPO e, then the conditions of Lemma 9 are also satisfied for V ′ = {a, b, d, e} and u = c. Moreover, if in addition Θ |= dTPP e, then Θ↓{a, b, c, e} is not isomorphic to one of the networks N14 , N24 , N 3 4 and Θ has a convex solution in R2; otherwise, if Θ |= d{PO,EC}e, then the conditions of Lemma 9 are also satisfied for V ′ = {a, b, c, e} and u = d. In this case, if Θ↓{a, b, d, e} or Θ↓{a, b, c, e} is not isomorphic to one of the networks N14 , N24 , N34 we again find that Θ has a convex solution in R2 from Lemmas 10 and 9. Otherwise, it follows that Θ is isomorphic to the following network:\ne\na b\n|| c\nd\n(N115 )\nA convex solution of this network is shown in Figure B.15.\n– Suppose Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is isomorphic to N24 .

Note that in this case all of a, b, c, d are in relation TPP or PO with e. Assume e.g. that Θ |= aTPP e. If Θ |= bPO e then the conditions of Lemma 9 are satisfied for u = b and Θ↓{a, b, e, c} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N 2 4 , N 3 4 from which we obtain that Θ has a convex solution in R2. Therefore assume that Θ |= bTPP e. If Θ |= {cTPP e, dPO e} then the conditions of Lemma 9 are satisfied for respectively u = d and Θ↓{a, b, c, e} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N 2 4 , N 3 4 which means that Θ has a convex solution in R2. The case where Θ |= {dTPP e, cPO e} is isomorphic. The only remaining possibility is that Θ is isomorphic to the following network:\ne\na\nEE\nb\nYY\nc d\n(N135 )\nA convex solution of this network is shown in Figure B.15.\nFinally assume that Θ does not contain any occurrence of TPP. Then any subset of four regions satisfies the conditions for V ′ from Lemma 9. If at least any sub-network of size four is not isomorphic to the networks N14 , N 2 4 and N 3 4 from Lemma 10, then it is clear that Θ has a convex solution in R2. If all of these sub-networks\nare isomorphic to N14 , N 2 4 or N 3 4 , it follows that Θ is isomorphic to the following network:\ne\na b\nc d\n(N145 )\nA convex solution of this network is shown in Figure B.15.\n– Suppose Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is isomorphic to N34 .

If Θ |= dPO e then the conditions of Lemma 9 are satisfied for u = d and since Θ↓{a, b, c, e} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N 2 4 , N 3 4 it follows that Θ has a convex solution in R2. If Θ |= dTPP e and e.g. Θ |= aPO e, the conditions of Lemma 9 are satisfied for u = a and Θ↓{b, c, d, e} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N 2 4 , N 3 4 . If Θ does not contain any occurrences of TPP and each subnetwork of size four is isomorphic to the networks N14 , N 2 4 and N 3 4 from Lemma 10, then Θ is isomorphic to the network N145 which we already considered.\nLemma 12. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network. If |V | = 5 then Θ has a convex solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part. Proof. Let V = {a, b, c, d, e}. If Θ does not contain any occurrences of NTPP or DC, the result follows directly from Lemma 11. Therefore assume that Θ |= d{DC,NTPP}e. • If Θ↓{a, b, c} is convexly realizable in R, it follows from Proposition 20\nthat Θ has a convex solution in R2.\n• Suppose Θ↓{a, b, c} is isomorphic to the network N13 from Lemma 8.\n– First assume that Θ 6|= xPP y for any x ∈ {d, e} and y ∈ {a, b, c}. Let Θ′ be obtained from Θ by weakening the constraints aEC b, bEC c and aEC c to aDR b, bDR c and aDR c. Let S ′ be an arbitrary convex solution in R of Θ′↓{a, b, c} and let T ′ be the resulting convex solution in R2 of Θ′ which is obtained by applying Proposition 20. Let a−, b−, c−, d−, e−, a+, b+, c+, d+, e+\nbe defined as in the proof of Proposition 20, then we have e.g. T ′(a) = {(x, y) |x ∈ S ′(a), y ∈ [a−, a+]} and similar for b, c, d and e. A property of the construction from the proof of Proposition 20 is that the values of a−, b−, c−, a+, b+, c+ do not depend on S ′; they only depend on the choice of d−, d+, e−, e+. Assume a− ≤ b− ≤ c− (the other cases are isomorphic). We now define a convex solution T of Θ as follows:\nT (a) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [−1, 0], y ∈ [a−, a+]} T (b) = {(x · (λ− b−), λ) |λ ∈ [b−, b+], x ∈ [1, 2]} T (c) = {(x · (λ− b−), λ) |λ ∈ [c−, c+], x ∈ [0, 1]} T (d) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [−2,max(2(b+ − b−), c+ − b−) + 1], y ∈ [d−, d+]} T (e) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [−3,max(2(b+ − b−), c+ − b−) + 2], y ∈ [e−, e+]}\nIt is easy to verify that T is indeed a solution of Θ. As an illustration of this procedure, consider the following network:\na\nb c\nd e\n(N165 )\nwhere the absence of an arrow denotes DC and a single arrow, solid line and dotted line denote TPP, PO and EC as before. The convex solution in R2 which is obtained by applying the above procedure is shown in Figure B.16.\n– Now assume that Θ |= ePP a. The main idea is to use a procedure similar to the method from Proposition 20 to extend a convex solution in R of Θ↓{b, c} to a convex solution in R2 of Θ. In fact, if dNTPP a and aNTPP e both hold, or dDC e and aNTPP d, we can simply apply the method from Proposition 20. However, we may also have dTPP a, eTPP a, aTPP e or aPO e, but these cases can be handled in a similar way. As an example, in Figure B.16 a convex solution is shown of the following network:\na\nb c\nd\n33\n+3 e\n(N175 )\nwhere a double arrow denotes NTPP.\n• Suppose Θ↓{a, b, c} is isomorphic to the network N23 from Lemma 8.\n– First assume that Θ 6|= xPP y for any x ∈ {d, e} and y ∈ {a, b, c}. Let Θ′ be defined as before and let again a−, b−, c−, d−, e−, a+, b+, c+, d+, e+ be the bounds obtained from the solution T ′ of Θ′. A property of the bounds a−, a+, c−, c+ is that [a−, a+]∩ [c−, c+] 6= ∅. Let l ∈ [a−, a+] ∩ [c−, c+]. We define a convex solution T ′ in R2 as follows:\nT (a) = CH({(x, y) |x ∈ [0, 2], y ∈ [a−, a+]} ∪ {(3, l)}) T (b) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [1, 3], y ∈ [b−, b+]} T (c) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [3, 4], y ∈ [c−, c+]} T (d) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [−1, 5], y ∈ [d−, d+]} T (e) = {(x, y) |x ∈ [−2, 6], y ∈ [e−, e+]}\n(a) N165 (b) N 17 5 (c) N 18 5\n(d) N195 (e) N 20 5\nLemma 13. Let Θ be a consistent atomic RCC8 network over {EC,PO, TPP,TPP−1} and V = {x, y, c1, c2, d1, d2}. If Θ |= {c1 EC d1, c2 EC d2}\nthen Θ has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Suppose Θ 6|= xEC y. If there is an i such that Θ↓{x, y, ci, di} is not isomorphic to the networks N14 and N 3 4 from Lemma 10 (noting that Θ↓{x, y, ci, di} cannot be isomorphic to N24 ), it holds that Θ↓{x, y, ci, di} has a convex weak solution in R, which can be extended to a convex weak solution in R2 using Proposition 20. Therefore we assume that for every choice of i, it holds that Θ↓{x, y, ci, di} is isomorphic to N14 or N34 . This implies in particular that Θ |= xPO y, as otherwise Θ↓{x, y, ci, di} will be not isomorphic to N14 , N24 and N34 . Furthermore, if Θ |= ciEC dj we can assume that Θ↓({x, y, c1, c2, d1, d2} \\ {ci, dj}) is not isomorphic to N14 , N24 and N34 because otherwise we could again obtain a convex weak solution in R2 by using Proposition 20. Under these assumptions, we can show that Θ is isomorphic to one of the following networks:\nc1 d1\nx \\\\ xx ff y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx \\\\ xx ff y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx \\\\ xx ff y\nc2 d2\n(N16 ) (N 2 6 ) (N 3 6 )\nc1 d1\nx xx\ny88BB\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx xx\ny\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\n(N46 ) (N 5 6 ) (N 6 6 )\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\n(N76 ) (N 8 6 ) (N 9 6 )\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\nc1 d1\nx y\nc2 d2\n(N106 ) (N 11 6 )\nThese networks have a convex solution in R2, as shown in Figure B.17. Suppose Θ |= xEC y. For convenience, we write c3 = x and d3 = y. If Θ↓{ci, cj, di, dj} (i 6= j) is not isomorphic to N24 (note that it cannot be isomorphic to N14 and N 3 4 ), then Θ has a convex weak solution in R2 as before. Suppose on the other hand that for each i and j, Θ↓{ci, cj, di, dj} is isomorphic to N24 . Then Θ is isomorphic to the following network:\nc1 d1\nc2 d2\nc3 d3\n(N126 )\nA convex solution of N86 is shown in Figure B.17.\nLemma 14. Suppose Θ is a basic RCC8 network over {EC,PO,TPP, TPP−1} and V = {x, y, z, a, b, c, d}. In addition, assume that Θ satisfies\n• Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is N14 , N24 or N34 ;\n• there is no u in V which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9;\n• Θ |= {yTPPx, zECx, zEC y} and Θ 6|= xTPP v for v ∈ {a, b, c, d}.\nThen Θ has a convex weak solution in R2 in which every O-clique has a common part.\nProof. Since there is no region u ∈ V which satisfies the conditions of Lemma 9, by Remark 2, there exist v1, v2 such that Θ |= {v1 TPPu, v2 ECu} for every maximal region u in Θ. In particular, we know x is such a maximal region in Θ.\nWe note that if one of the following two conditions is satisfied, then using the method from Proposition 20 we can get a convex weak solution of Θ in R2 by extending a convex weak solution of Θ↓(V \\ {u1, u2, u3, u4}) in R:\n(∃u1, u2, u3, u4 ∈ V ) Θ |= {u1 TPPu2, u2 TPPu3, u3 ECu4} (B.1) (∃u1, u2, u3, u4 ∈ V ) Θ |= {u1 TPPu2, u3 TPPu4, u2 ECu4}. (B.2)\nIn the following, we assume Θ satisfies neither (B.1) nor (B.2). As a consequence, we know that\nΘ 6|= vTPP y, Θ 6|= vTPP z, and Θ 6|= {yTPP v, vTPPx} for v ∈ {a, b, c, d}.\nSuppose v, w are two regions in {a, b, c, d} and Θ |= vECw. We assert that v, w cannot be both maximal in Θ. We prove this by contradiction. Since v, w are maximal in Θ, we know in particular Θ 6|= vTPPx, Θ 6|= wTPPx. Moreover, by Remark 2, we have Θ |= yTPP v or Θ |= zTPP v, and Θ |= yTPPw or Θ |= zTPPw. Note that if Θ |= {zTPP v, yTPPw} or Θ |= {zTPPw, yTPP v}, then (B.2) is satisfied and this contradicts our assumption. Also note that neither Θ |= {zTPP v, zTPPw} nor Θ |= {yTPP v, yTPPw} is possible as Θ |= vECw. Therefore, v, w cannot be both maximal.\nSuppose Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is N24 . Note that Θ |= {aEC b, cEC d}. If neither a nor b is maximal, then we have Θ |= {aTPPx, bTPPx}. Furthermore, by Θ |= zECx, we know Θ |= {zEC a, zEC b, zECx, zEC y}. Because Θ↓{x, y, a, b} is isomorphic to none of N14 , N24 and N34 , it has a convex weak solution in R. Since z is EC to all these four regions, we can extend it to a convex weak solution for Θ↓{x, y, z, a, b} in R. Now, using Proposition 20, we can further extend this to a convex weak solution of Θ in R2.\nWe next consider the subcase when exact one of a, b is maximal. Without loss of generality, we assume that a is maximal and b is not. It is clear that Θ↓{x, y, a, b} is not isomorphic to any of N14 , N24 and N34 and, hence, has a convex weak solution S in R. Write S(a) = [a−, a+] and similarly for b, x, y. We have either a− < x− < a+ < x+ or x− < a− < x+ < a+. It is easy to see that there is an interval which is contained in (or partially overlaps, or is disjoint from) [a−, a+], which is EC to the other three intervals. Therefore, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for Θ↓{x, y, z, a, b}, which can be extended to a convex weak solution in R2 for Θ by using Proposition 20.\nSuppose Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is N34 and Θ |= {aEC b, aEC c, bEC c}. At most one of a, b, c can be maximal in Θ. Without loss of generality, we assume c is not maximal. There are two subcases. Suppose d is not maximal either. Then we have Θ |= {cTPPx, dTPPx} and hence Θ |= {zEC c, zEC d, zECx, zEC y}. Just as before, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for Θ↓{x, y, z, c, d} and extend it to a convex weak solution of Θ in R2.\nWe next consider the subcase when c is not maximal and d is maximal. Because c is not maximal, we have Θ |= cTPPx. Furthermore, because d is maximal, we have either Θ |= zTPP d, yEC d} or Θ |= {yTPP d, zEC d}. In both cases, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for Θ↓{x, y, c, d} and then extend it to a convex weak solution of Θ↓{x, y, z, c, d} in R and to a convex weak solution of Θ in R2 as before.\nSuppose Θ↓{a, b, c, d} is N14 and Θ |= {aEC b, aTPP c, bTPP c}. Because Θ does not satisfy (B.1), we know Θ 6|= cTPPx and hence c is maximal in Θ. We have Θ |= cPOx and either Θ |= yEC c or Θ |= zEC c. Since z does not satisfy the conditions of Lemma 9 and Θ 6|= {zTPP a, zTPP b}, we know Θ |= zTPP c or Θ |= zTPP d. If d is not maximal, then Θ |= dTPPx, and hence\nΘ |= {dTPPx, zEC d, zTPP c, yEC c, y{EC,PO}d}.\nIf d is maximal, then we have either Θ |= {zTPP d, yEC d} or Θ |= {yTPP d, zEC d}. In the first case, we have either\nΘ |= {zTPP d, yEC d, xPO d, yEC c, z{EC,PO,TPP}c}\nor\nΘ |= {zTPP d, yEC d, xPO d, zEC c, y{EC,PO,TPP}c}.\nIn the second case, we have\nΘ |= {yTPP d, zEC d, xPO d, zTPP c, yEC c}.\nIn all these cases, we can construct a convex weak solution in R for Θ↓{x, y, c, d} and then extend it to Θ↓{x, y, z, c, d} in R and to Θ in R2 as before."

While RCC8 is essentially dimensionless, most current applications are confined to reasoning about two-dimensional or threedimensional physical space. In this paper, however, we are mainly interested in conceptual spaces, which typically are high-dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the meaning of natural language concepts can be represented using convex regions. The aim of this paper is to analyze how the restriction to convex regions constrains the realizability of networks of RCC8 relations. First, we identify all ways in which the set of RCC8 base relations can be restricted to guarantee that consistent networks can be convexly realized in respectively 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D. Most surprisingly, we find that if the relation ‘partially overlaps’ is disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 networks can be convexly realized in 4D. If instead refinements of the relation ‘part of’ are disallowed, all consistent atomic RCC8 relations can be convexly realized in 3D. We furthermore show, among others, that any consistent RCC8 network with 2n + 1 variables can be realized using convex regions in the n-dimensional Euclidean space.",
