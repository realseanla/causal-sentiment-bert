      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Interval analysis [14] is a tool which makes it possible to compute with sets even when nonlinear functions are involved [10] in the definition of the sets. Interval methods are generally used to solve equations or optimization problems [5] but can also been used to solve set-membership problems where the sets are represented by subpavings [7]. The efficiency of interval algorithms can be improved by the use of contractors [2] or (separators [6] which correspond to pairs of contractors).\nThis paper deals with localization of a robot with sonar rangefinders in a unstructured environment. This problem is considered as difficult due to the fact that the sonar returns a measurement under the form of an impact point inside an emission cone. This specific type of measurement makes the problem partially observable. Moreover, our environment is not represented by geometric features such as segments or disks, but by an image which cannot be translated into equations. Now, as shown by Sliwka [17], an unstructured map can be cast into a contractor form which allows us to use contractor/separator algebra.\nHere, we propose first to use a separator-based method to perform a reliable simulation necessary to generate realistic data (see, e.g., [18] for a survey on reliable simulation). Then, once these data have been generated, we consider the inverse problem, i.e., the robot localization with large-cone sonar measurements in an unstructured map. This problem has never been considered yet, to our knowledge at least in an unstructured environment (see e.g., [9, 11, 8, 12, 3] in the case where the map is made with geometrical features). We will also show the link with Minkowski operations and propose separator counterparts for these operations.\nSection 2 recalls the basic notions on contractors and separators needed to understand our approach. Section 3 presents the concept of set-to-set transform and shows how our localization problem can be solved with separators. Section 4 proposes to formulate the Minkowski operations as a specific set-to-set transform, corresponding to translations. Section 5 illustrates the application of the Minkowski operation to the problem of localization of a robot in an unstructured environment. Section 6 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "This section recalls the basic notions on intervals, contractors and separators that are needed to understand the contribution of this paper. An interval of R is a closed connected set of R. A box [x] of Rn is the Cartesian product of n intervals.\nA contractor C is an operator IRn 7→ IRn such that\nC ([x])⊂ [x] (contractance) [x]⊂ [y] ⇒ C ([x])⊂ C ([y]). (monotonicity) (1)\nWe define the inclusion between two contractors C1 and C2 as follows:\nC1 ⊂ C2⇔∀ [x] ∈ IRn, C1([x])⊂ C2([x]). (2)\nA set X is consistent (See Figure 1) with the contractor C (we will write X∼ C ) if for all [x], we have\nC ([x])∩X= [x]∩X. (3)\nTwo contractors C and C1 are equivalent (we will write C ∼ C1) if we have:\nX∼ C ⇔ X∼ C1. (4)\nA contractor C is minimal if for any other contractor C1, we have the following implication\nC ∼ C1⇒ C ⊂ C1. (5)\nExample 1. The minimal contractor CX consistent with the set\nX= { x ∈ R2,(x1−2)2 +(x2−2.5)2 ∈ [1,4] }\n(6)\ncan be built using a forward-backward constraint propagation [1] [4]. The contractor CX can be used by a paver to obtain an outer approximation for X. This is illustrated by Figure 2 (left) where CX removes parts of the space outside X (painted light-gray). But due to the consistency property (see Equation (3))\nCX has no effect on boxes included in X. A box partially included in X can not be eliminated and is bisected, except if its length is larger than an given value ε . The contractor CX only provides an outer approximation of X. If C1 and C2 are two contractors, we define the following operations [2].\n(C1∩C2)([x]) = C1([x])∩C2([x]) (7) (C1tC2)([x]) = C1([x])tC2([x]) (8) (C1 ◦C2)([x]) = C1 (C2([x])) (9)\nwhere t is the union hull defined by\n[x]t [y] = [[x]∪ [y]] . (10)\nIn order to characterize an inner and outer approximation of the solution set, we introduce the notion of separator. A separator S is a pair of contractors { S in,S out } such that, for all [x] ∈ IRn, we have\nS in([x])∪S out([x]) = [x] (complementarity). (11)\nA set X is consistent with the separator S (we will write X∼S ), if\nX∼S out and X∼S in, (12)\nwhere X= {x | x /∈ X}. This notion of separator is illustrated by Figure 3. We define the inclusion between two separators S1 and S2 as follows\nS1 ⊂S2⇔S in1 ⊂S in2 and S out1 ⊂S out2 . (13)\nA separator S is minimal if S1 ⊂S ⇒S1 = S . (14)\nIt is trivial to check that S is minimal implies that the two contractors S in and S out are both minimal. If we define the following operations\nS1∩S2 = { S in1 ∪S in2 ,S out1 ∩S out2 } (intersection)\nS1∪S2 = { S in1 ∩S in2 ,S out1 ∪S out2 } (union)\n(15)\nthen we have [6] { S1 ∼ X1 S2 ∼ X2 ⇒ { S1∩S2 ∼ X1∩X2 S1∪S2 ∼ X1∪X2 (16)\nOther operations on separators such as the complement or the projection can also be considered [6]. Example 2. Consider the set X of Example 1. From the contractor consistent with\nX= { x ∈ R2,(x1−2)2 +(x2−2.5)2 /∈ [1,4] } , (17)\nwe can build a separator SX for X. An inner and outer approximation of X obtained by a paver based on SX is depicted on Figure 2. The dark gray area is inside X and light gray is outside. The minimality property of the separators can be observed by the fact that all contracted boxes of the subpaving touch the boundary of X. Therefore, we are now able to quantify the pessimism introduced by the paver."

Set-to-set transform. Consider the set defined by :\nP= {p ∈ Rp | f(A,p)⊂ B}. (20)\nThe vector p corresponds to a parameter vector associated to a transformation. A transformation p is consistent, if after transformation of A, the set A is included inside B. We have\nf(A,p)⊂ B ⇔ ∀a ∈ A, f(a,p) ∈ B ⇔ ¬∃a ∈ A, f(a,p) ∈ B ⇔ ¬∃a ∈ A,(a,p) ∈ f−1 ( B )\n⇔ ¬∃a,(a,p) ∈ A×Rp ∧ (a,p) ∈ f−1 ( B ) .\n(21)\nAs a consequence P= pro jp{(A×Rp)∩ f−1 ( B ) }. (22)\nTherefore, if we have separators SA,SB for A,B then a separator SP for P can be obtained using the separator algebra [6]. It is given by\nSP = pro jp{(SA×SRp)∩ f−1 ( SB ) }. (23)\nCombining this separator with a paver, we are able to obtain an inner and outer approximation of P. Example 1: A robot at position (0,0) in inside an environment defined by the map\nM= {x ∈ R2 | x1 < 5 or x2 < 3}. (24)\nIt emits an ultrasonic sound in the cone with angles π4 ± π24 . For a simulation purpose, we want to compute the distance returned by the sonar. This distance corresponds to the shortest distance inside the emission cone to the complementary of the map:\nd = inf{d | f(S1,d)∩M 6= /0}\nor equivalently d = sup{d | f(S1,d)⊂M}, (25)\nwhere S1 is the unit cone defined by\nS1 = {(x,y) | x2 + y2 < 1 and atan2(y,x) ∈ [ 5π 24 , 7π 24 ]}. (26)\nand f(x,d) = d ·x is the scaling function. To solve our problem, we first characterize the set:\nD= {d | f(S1,d)⊂M} (27) which corresponds to a set-to-set transform problem and we get\n[0,6.2988]⊂ D⊂ [0,6.3085]. (28)\nThe situation is depicted on Figure 4. As a consequence, the true distance d returned by the sensor satisfies d ∈ [6.2988,6.3085]"

      "heading" : "5 Localization in an unstructured environment",
      "text" : "Consider a robot R at position p = (p1, p2) in an unstructured environment described by the set M. We assume that the heading θ of R is known with a good accuracy (for instance, by using a compass) and doesn’t need to be estimated. The robot is equipped several sonars which return the distance between the robot and the map with respect to the emission cone of the sonar. This section deals with the localization of the robots using the set-to-set transform. Several authors have already studied this problem using interval analysis [12, 13, 3] but in an environment made with segments.\nEach sensor emits an acoustic wave in its direction αi which propagates inside a cone of half angle γ corresponding to the aperture of the beam. By measuring the time lag between the emission and the reception of the wave, reflected by the map, an interval [di] = [d−i ,d + i ] contains the true distance di to the nearest obstacle which lies in the scope of the sensor can be obtained. The situation is depicted in Figure 7a. The area swept by the wave between 0 and di is free of obstacles whereas the map is hit by the wave at distance di. Define\nSi = {(x,y) | x2 + y2 < d−i and atan2(y,x) ∈ [αi− γ,αi + γ]} ∆Si = {(x,y) | x2 + y2 ∈ [di] and atan2(y,x) ∈ [αi− γ,αi + γ]}\nThe set Si is called the free sector and ∆Si is called the impact pie. These sets are depicted on Figure 7b.\nThe set of all feasible positions P consistent with [di] is\nP(i) = {p ∈ R2 | (p+Si)⊂M and (p+∆Si)∩M 6= /0} (35) = (M Si)∩ (M⊕−∆Si).\nWith several measurements [di] the set of all positions consistent with all data is\nP= ⋂\ni\n(M Si)∩ (M⊕−∆Si). (36)\nDenote by SM,SSi ,S∆Si separators for M,Si ,∆Si. Then a separator for P is\nSP = ⋂\ni\n(SM SSi)∩ (SM⊕−S∆Si). (37)\nAs an illustration, consider the situation described by Figure 8 (left), where a robot collects 6 sonar data. The width of the intervals corresponding to the range measurement is ±1m .The first measurement corresponding to i = 1 is painted green. Figure 8 (right) corresponds to an approximation of the set M S1, obtained using a paver with the separator SM SS1 .\nFigure 9 (left) corresponds to an approximation of the set M⊕−∆S1, obtained using a paver with the separator SM⊕−S∆S1 . It corresponds to the set of positions for the robot such that the impact pie ∆S1 intersects the outside of the map M. Figure 9 (right) corresponds to the set (M S1)∩ (M⊕−∆S1), i.e., it contains the position consistent with both ∆S1 and S1.\nFigure 10 (left) corresponds to an approximation of the set P, obtained using a paver on with the separator SP. It corresponds to the set of positions for the robot that all six impact pies ∆Si intersect the outside of the map M and all six free sectors are inside M. A zoom of the solution set is given in Figure 10 (right). The computing time is 127 sec. and 205 boxes have been generated. Note that obtaining an inner approximation of the solution set was not possible using existing approaches that are not based on separators."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "Separator-based techniques are particularly attractive when solving engineering applications, due to the fact that they can handle and propagate uncertainties in a context where the equations of the problem are non-linear and non-convex. Now, the performances of paving methods are extremely sensitive to the accuracy of the separators but also by the uncertainty generated by the dependency effect induced by the separator algebra. Indeed, when a separator, associated to the same set, occurs several times in the separator expression, a pessimism is introduced. It is thus important to factorize subexpression with separators into a single one which is computed separately by a specific algorithm. Another possibility is to rewrite the set expression in order to avoid multioccurences. This is what we have done for the Minkowski sum A⊕B and difference A B.\nThe efficiency of these new operators and their ability to get an inner and outer approximation of the solution set was illustrated on the problem of the localization of a robot."
