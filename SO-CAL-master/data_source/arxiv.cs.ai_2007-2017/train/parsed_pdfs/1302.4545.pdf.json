      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Unawareness refers to the lack of conception rather than the lack of information. There is a fundamental difference between not knowing about which events obtain and the inability to conceive of some events. Unawareness is an interdisciplinary topic that fascinates economists, computer scientists, logicians, and philosophers alike. Traditionally, computer scientists, logicians and philosophers are interested in epistemic models while most economists are mainly interested in the behavioral implications. In the literature, unawareness has been defined epistemically using syntactic and semantic approaches.1 While epistemic characterizations are conceptually insightful, the behavioral content of unawareness is less clear. Can unawareness be characterized behaviorally?\nA first attempt to answer this question is presented in Schipper (2012). There we apply the lattice state-space structure of Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008, 2013) to the Anscombe-Aumann approach to subjective utility theory and characterize awarenessdependent subjective expected utility. This framework allows us to distinguish unawareness of an event from the event being Savage null and thus we are able to show behavioral implications of unawareness. Yet, our approach in Schipper (2012) has many shortcomings. For instance, as in almost any decision theoretic framework, we consider states of nature rather than states of the world. That is, states describe just lists of physical events but are silent on the state of mind of the decision maker. While such an approach is sensible in a purely decision theoretic framework, where bets are placed on physical events rather than (higher order) beliefs of some players, it does not allow for characterizing behaviorally - at least in principle - the intricate epistemic properties of knowledge and awareness across the lattice structure introduced in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008). For instance, introspection of knowledge requires bets on events in which the decision maker knows an event.\nMorris (1996, 1997) showed for standard state-spaces with states of the world that properties of knowledge and belief can be - at least in principle - characterized behaviorally. In this paper, we extend his approach to unawareness structures and show how to characterize behaviorally properties of the possibility correspondence introduced in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006). Moreover, we show how to characterize preferencebased operators of knowledge, awareness, and unawareness.\nThis work is directly related to a growing literature on unawareness. Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008, 2013) introduced a syntax-free semantics of unawareness using state-spaces familiar to economists, decision theorists, and game theorists. Apart from having a syntax-free semantics, Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008) generalize Modica and Rustichini (1999) to the multi-agent case. The precise connection between Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006) on one hand and Modica and Rustichini (1999) and earlier work in computer science by Fagin and Halpern (1988) on the other hand is understood from Halpern (2001), Halpern and Rêgo (2008, 2012), and Heifetz, Meier, and\n1For a bibliography see http://www.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/schipper/unaw.htm\nSchipper (2008). Galanis (2012) relaxes some properties of the possibility correspondence in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006). The connection between Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006, 2008) and Galanis (2012) is explored in Galanis (2011). Li (2009) presents an alternative to modeling unawareness in the single-agent case. Heinsalu (2012) explores the connection between Li (2009) and the rest of the literature. Finally, Feinberg (2012) presents an approach of modeling unawareness in the context of games. The precise connection between Feinberg (2012) and the rest of the literature is yet to be explored. The literature addressed also awareness of unawareness, see Board and Chung (2011), Halpern and Rêgo (2009, 2012a), Sillari (2008), Ågotnes and Alechina (2007), and Walker (2013). The relationship between Board and Chung (2011) and Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006) is studied in Board, Chung, and Schipper (2011). The relationship between Halpern and Rego (2009, 2012a) and Heifetz, Meier and Schipper (2006) is explored in Halpern and Rego (2012a). See Section 4 for further discussions of the related literature.\nIn the next section we provide a brief exposition of unawareness structures and review properties of knowledge and awareness. In Section 3 we introduce the decision theoretic framework and provide the results. We conclude with a discussion in Section 4. Proofs are collected in the appendix."

This is interpreted as follows: Let’s say an individual considers investing in a firm (e.g., the act f). A firm can be viewed as a bundle of uncertain opportunities and liabilities. The decision maker may perceive only a subset of opportunities and liabilities depending on her awareness level that may be influenced by her prior experience or her reading of the “fine prints” of the “share sales and purchase agreement”. In our setting, the opportunities and liabilities are represented by money prizes contingent\non states, i.e., acts. Some of the opportunities and liabilities (i.e., events) may not be expressible in some of the spaces in S. That is, they are not perceived when having certain awareness levels. So an act denotes simultaneously more or less rich descriptions of those opportunities and liabilities. It is essentially a label of the action “buy the firm”. Which opportunities and liabilities are perceived by the decision maker, i.e., the awareness level of the decision maker, will be captured by the preferences over acts introduced below.\nFor any event E and acts f and g, define a composite act fEg by\nfEg(ω) =\n{\nf(ω) if ω ∈ E g(ω) otherwise.\nNote that different from composite acts in the Savage approach, g is not only prescribed on the negation of E but also on all states that are neither in E nor in ¬E.

While such a measurability assumption may be justified in some applications, it may not be applicable in general. The speculative trade example in Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper (2006) is one instance.4 A practical framework of decision making under unawareness should not rule out such examples.\nIn the following we will consider also composite acts of the form\nf{ω}g(ω ′) =\n{\nf(ω′) if ω = ω′ g(ω′) otherwise.\nAlthough {ω} may not be an event in the unawareness structure, we still have f{ω}g ∈ A.

First, for each state ω it confines the value of the correspondence to a single space. Second, it requires that this space is weakly lower than the space Sω. The proof of Lemma 1 in the appendix reveals that these two features are mimicked by Properties 1 and 2, respectively.\n5Note that f % (ω) g does not necessarily imply that the decision maker would prefer f over g if he believes that the state is ω.\nProperty 1 will play a role also in characterizing other properties of the possibility correspondence.

The proof contained in the appendix verifies that Property 4 is a “translation” of Transitivity and that Property 5 is a “translation” of Euclideanness.\nThe next two properties relate preferences across spaces.

We now define knowledge, awareness, and unawareness directly in terms of preferences.\nDefinition 3 The preference-based knowledge operator on Σ is defined by\nK̃(E) :=\n{\nω ∈ Ω : (i) f¬Eg ∼ (ω) h¬Eg for all f, g, h ∈ A, and (ii) fEg ≻ (ω) hEg for some f, g, h ∈ A\n}\nif there is a state ω ∈ Ω such that (i) and (ii) hold, and by K̃(E) := ∅S(E) otherwise.\nProperty (i) is familiar from the definition of Savage null event (Savage, 1954). An event E is known if its negation is null. Morris (1996, 1997) defines “standard” knowledge by this property alone.6 Yet, in unawareness structures it is possible that both the event and its negation are null, in which case - as we will see below - the decision maker is unaware of the event. That’s why we need to add the second requirement, property (ii), to the definition.\nGiven the possibility correspondence Π̃ and Definition 1, the knowledge operator on Σ is\nK(E) = {ω ∈ Ω : Π̃(ω) ⊆ E}\nif there is a state ω ∈ Ω such that Π̃(ω) ⊆ E, and K(E) = ∅S(E) otherwise.\nProposition 5 For any event E ∈ Σ, K̃(E) = K(E).\nThe proof is contained in the appendix.7\n6To be precise, Morris (1996, 1997) defines “Savage belief” by property (i) alone. Since in our context we impose Property 3 which implies the Truth, we think it is justified to call it knowledge.\n7The proof makes use of the assumption that Ω is finite. We were not be able to prove it for more general Ω without imposing further assumptions. We suspect that this is one of the reasons why Morris (1996, 1997) assumed Ω to be finite.\nDefinition 4 The preference-based awareness operator on Σ is defined by\nÃ(E) :=\n{\nω ∈ Ω : (ii) fEg ≻ (ω) hEg for some f, g, h ∈ A, or (iii) f¬Eg ≻ (ω) h¬Eg for some f, g, h ∈ A\n}\nif there is a state ω ∈ Ω such that (ii) or (iii) hold, and by Ã(E) := ∅S(E) otherwise.\nGiven the possibility correspondence Π̃ and Definition 2, the decision maker’s awareness operator in Σ is\nA(E) = { ω ∈ Ω : Π̃(ω) ⊆ S(E)↑ }\nif there is a state ω such that Π̃(ω) ⊆ S(E)↑, and A(E) = ∅S(E) otherwise.\nProposition 6 For any event E ∈ Σ, Ã(E) = A(E).\nThe proof follows from Proposition 5 and Weak Necessitation.\nDefinition 5 The preference-based unawareness operator on Σ is defined by\nŨ(E) :=\n{\nω ∈ Ω : (0) fEg ∼ (ω) hEg for all f, g, h ∈ A, and (i) f¬Eg ∼ (ω) h¬Eg for all f, g, h ∈ A\n}\nif there is a state ω ∈ Ω such that (0) and (i) hold, and by Ũ(E) := ∅S(E) otherwise.\nThis behavioral definition of unawareness means that a decision maker is unaware of an event if this event is null and the negation of the event is null.8 Indeed, this behavioral definition of unawareness is equivalent to the epistemic notion of unawareness.\nCorollary 1 For any event E ∈ Σ, Ũ(E) = U(E).\nNote that we are able to characterize all epistemic operators by conjunction and disjunction of choices experiments corresponding to properties (0) to (iii) in Definitions 3 to 5."

      "text" : "In what sense do our results really provide a behavioral characterization of properties of the possibility correspondence, knowledge, awareness, and unawareness? First note that in order to “reveal” whether a decision maker’s possibility correspondence satisfies properties 0. to 5., many counterfactual choice experiments have to be performed. For\n8This condition characterizes behaviorally unawareness in Schipper (2012) using a states-of-nature lattice structure and the Anscombe-Aumann approach.\ninstance, we first may have to conduct choice experiments at a state ω at which the decision maker may be unaware of both events E and F . Then we may have to consider choice experiments at a state ω′, at which the decision maker may be aware of E but unaware of F , and then at yet another state ω′′ at which he is unaware of E but aware of F etc. But how should this be practically done? If these choice experiments are conducted sequentially, then it requires that after becoming aware of the E the decision maker must become unaware of E before we can conduct the last set of choice experiments.9 More natural is the interpretation of the model as the belief of another player (or the modeler) about the decision maker’s choices at various states. While this interpretation may appear unusual at a first glance, we would argue that it corresponds rather closely to the actual treatment of decision theoretic models by decision theorists. Despite the emphasis on preferences revealed by choices, most decision theorists chose not to conduct choice experiments and many choice theoretic “axioms” are just of technical nature (e.g., continuity axioms) or impractical to implement in actual choice experiments (e.g., axioms on conditional preferences). Such “axioms” are testable just in “principle”. That is, they represent the belief of the modeler about how a decision maker would perform in certain choice experiments when he is ascribed a certain utility representation.10\nOur analysis is subject to another caveat raised previously in Schipper (2012). Property 1 implies that the events of which the decision maker is unaware of do not affect her ranking of acts. This holds even for composite acts conditioned on events that the decision maker is unaware of. More generally, it rules out that a decision maker becomes aware of an event merely from facing an act. This is also the implicit assumption in standard decision theory (i.e., different acts do not change the subset of “small worlds” that a decision maker pays attention to). Yet, there it is less problematic since there is just one set of “small worlds”. But it may be unrealistic in some situations with unawareness. Sometimes, when facing an act, a decision maker may become in very subtle ways a bit more careful with the “fine prints” of acts, and this care may lead her to become aware of events. E.g., a buyer facing a decision about whether or not to enter into a certain purchase contract may become aware of events that she was previously unaware of when reading all the fine prints of the contract. If ex ante an outside observer does not know how acts affect the awareness of a decision maker, then it may be impossible to design choice experiments required to elicit properties of the static possibility correspondence.\nOur analysis differs from the one presented in Schipper (2012) in several aspects. First, we mentioned already that Schipper (2012) considers states of nature while we consider states of the world. Latter approach allows us to talk about knowledge of knowledge etc.\n9Another difficulty that this model shares with Morris (1996, 1997) is how to phrase practically bets on events corresponding to (even higher order) beliefs of some events.\n10Our interpretation of the decision theoretic model is also reminiscent of the interpretation of the notion of strategy in extensive-form games. As Rubinstein (1991) pointed out, an action prescribed by a strategy at an information set which is excluded by an earlier move of that very strategy is implicitly interpreted in game theory as the beliefs that the other players entertain regarding the player’s move if that information set were reached.\nSecond, while Schipper (2012) considers Anscombe-Aumann acts, i.e., mappings from states to mixtures over outcomes, we consider here real-valued Savage acts, i.e., mappings from states to real numbers. Third, Schipper (2012) aims at subjective expected utility representation theorems with probabilistic beliefs while we focus on characterizing the qualitative notions of knowledge, awareness, and unawareness. Our analysis is related to Li (2008) who seeks to study the difference between unawareness and zero probability as well.\nMorris (1996) also related dynamic preferences to properties of belief change. Dynamic unawareness has been analyzed in epistemic frameworks (van Dittmarsch and French 2009, 2011a, b, Hill, 2010), in game theoretic settings (Feinberg, 2012, Grant and Quiggin, 2013, Halpern and Rêgo, 2012b, Rêgo and Halpern, 2012, Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper, 2011a, b, Li, 2006, Meier and Schipper, 2011), and more recently also in a decision theoretic framework by Karni and Vierø (2013). The latter approach is confined to states of nature, i.e., the beliefs of the decision maker are not part of the description of the state. We leave a decision theoretic analysis of dynamic unawareness with states of the world analogous to Morris (1996) to future research."

But Property 2 implies Sω′ Sω. Note that S ′ = Sω′ , a contradiction.\nSuppose now that there exists S ∈ S and ω ∈ S such that Π̃(ω) * S ′, for all S ′ ∈ S. Then there exist ω′, ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω) such that Sω′ 6= Sω′′ . If ω\n′ ∈ Π̃(ω) then by Property 1 we have f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A and for any ω ′′ 6= ω′ with Sω′′ 6= Sω′ , f ′{ω′′}g ′ ∼ (ω) h′{ω′′}g ′ for all f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A. Hence ω′′ /∈ Π̃(ω), a contradiction.\n“⇐”: Suppose there exist ω′, ω′′ ∈ Ω such that Property 1 is violated, i.e., f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A, Sω′′ 6= Sω′ , and f ′ {ω′′}g ′ ≁ (ω) h′{ω′′}g ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A. Then ω′, ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω), a contradiction to Π̃(ω) ⊆ S ′ for some S ′ ∈ S.\nSuppose there exist ω, ω′, ω′′ ∈ Ω such that Property 2 is violated, i.e., f{ω′}g ≻ (ω)h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A and Sω′ Sω. Then by previous arguments Π̃(ω) ⊆ S ′ with S ′ = Sω′ Sω = S, a contradiction of Confinement.\nA.2 Proof of Lemma 2\n“⇐”: Suppose by contradiction that f{ωS}g ∼ (ω) h{ωS} for all S Sω and all f, g, h ∈ A. Thus, rSωS (ω) /∈ Π̃(ω) for all S Sω, a contradiction.\n“⇒”: Suppose f{ωS}g ≻ (ω) h{ωS}g for some S Sω and some f, g, h ∈ A. Thus, ωS ∈ Π̃(ω). Property 1 implies Π̃(ω) ⊆ S. Thus, Π ↑(ω) is well-defined and we conclude that ω ∈ Π̃↑(ω).\nA.3 Proof of Lemma 3\nWe first prove that Transitivity is equivalent to Property 4: f{ω′′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A if and only if ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω). f ′{ω′}g ′ ≻ (ω) h′{ω′}g ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A if and only if ω′ ∈ Π̃(ω). f ′′{ω′′}g ′′ ≻ (ω′) h′′{ω′′}g ′′ for some f ′′, g′′, h′′ ∈ A if and only if ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω′). Thus, Property 4 is equivalent to if ω′ ∈ Π̃(ω) and ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω′), then ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω). This is equivalent to Transitivity.\nSecond, we prove that Euclideanness is equivalent to Property 5: f{ω′′}g ≻ (ω ′) h{ω′′}g\nfor some f, g, h ∈ A if and only if ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω′). f ′{ω′}g ′ ≻ (ω) h′{ω′}g ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A if and only if ω′ ∈ Π̃(ω). f ′′{ω′′}g ′′ ≻ (ω) h′′{ω′′}g ′′ for some f ′′, g′′, h′′ ∈ A if and only if ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω). Thus, Property 5 is equivalent to if ω′ ∈ Π̃(ω) and ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω), then ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ω′). This is equivalent to Euclideanness.\nA.4 Proof of Lemma 4\n“⇒”: If f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A, then ω ′ ∈ Π̃(ω). If f ′{ω′′}g ′ ≻ (ωS) h ′ {ω′′}g ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A, then ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ωS). Moreover, according to Property 6, ω ′ ∈ {ω′′}↑. From Property 1 follows that Π̃↑(ω) and Π̃↑(ωS) are well-defined. Thus ω ′ ∈ Π̃↑(ωS) and it follows that Π̃↑(ω) ⊆ Π̃↑(ωS).\n“⇐”: ω′ ∈ Π̃(ω) if and only if f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A. Since ω′ ∈ Π̃↑(ωS), by Projections Preserve Ignorance there exists ω ′′ ∈ Π̃(ωS) such that ω′ ∈ {ω′′}↑. Moreover, f ′{ω′′}g ′ ≻ (ωS) h ′ {ω′′}g ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A\nA.5 Proof of Lemma 5\nLet S Sω′ Sω. By Property 1, f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A if and only if Π̃(ω) ⊆ Sω′ . Thus, the hypotheses of both Projections Preserve Knowledge and Property 7 are equivalent under Property 1.\nf ′{ω′′}g ′ ≻ (ωS) h ′ {ω′′}g ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A if and only if ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ωS).\nf ′′{ω′′′}g ′′ ≻ (ω) h′′{ω′′′}g ′′ for some f ′′, g′′, h′′ ∈ A if and only if ω′′′ ∈ Π̃(ω).\nThus, the conclusion of Property 7 is equivalent to: ω′′ ∈ Π̃(ωS) if and only there exists a state ω′′′ ∈ Sω′ such that ω ′′ = ω′′′S and ω ′′′ ∈ Π̃(ω). This is equivalent to Π̃(ωS) = (Π̃(ω))S, the conclusion of Projections Preserve Knowledge.\nA.6 Proof of Proposition 5\n“⊇”: ω ∈ K(E) if and only if Π̃(ω) ⊆ E. It follows that f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A implies ω′ ∈ E. Define\nf ′(ω) =\n{\nf(ω) if ω = ω′ g(ω) if ω 6= ω′\nh′(ω) =\n{\nh(ω) if ω = ω′ g(ω) if ω 6= ω′\nand g′ = g. Note that f ′, h′, g′ ∈ A. Then from f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A implies ω′ ∈ E follows that f ′Eg ′ ≻ (ω) h′Eg ′ for some f ′, g′, h′ ∈ A, yielding property (ii).\nNote that property (i) in the definition of K̃ holds trivially if E = S(E)↑. Assume E $ S(E)↑. From Π̃(ω) ⊆ E follows that ω′ ∈ ¬E implies ω′ /∈ Π̃(ω). Thus f{ω′}g ∼ (ω) h{ω′}g for all f, g, h ∈ A. Since Ω is finite, we can enumerate all states in ¬E from lets say 1 to n. Then for any f, g, h we have f{ω1}g ∼ (ω) f{ω1,ω2}g ∼ (ω) ... ∼ (ω) f{ω1,ω2,...,ωn}g = f¬Eg as well as h{ω1}g ∼ (ω) h{ω1,ω2}g ∼ (ω) ... ∼ (ω) h{ω1,ω2,...,ωn}g = h¬Eg and thus by transitivity of (ω) also f¬Eg ∼ (ω) h¬Eg, yielding property (i) of the definition of K̃. Hence ω ∈ K̃(E).\n“⊆”: ω ∈ K̃(E) if and only if (i) f¬Eg ∼ (ω) h¬Eg for all f, g, h ∈ A, and (ii) fEg ≻ (ω) hEg for some f, g, h ∈ A. Consider first (i). For any ω\n′ ∈ ¬E, arguments made above imply f{ω′}g ∼ (ω) h{ω′}g for all f, g, h ∈ A if we let ω ′ = ω1. It follows that Π̃(ω) ∩ ¬E = ∅.\nConsider now property (ii) of the definition of K̃. We claim that for some ω′ ∈ E, f{ω′}g ≻ (ω) h{ω′}g for some f, g, h ∈ A. Suppose to the contrary that f{ω′}g ∼ (ω) h{ω′}g for all f, g, h ∈ A and all ω′ ∈ E. Since Ω is finite, we can enumerate states in E from lets say 1 to m. Previous arguments imply fEg ∼ (ω) hEg for all f, g, h ∈ A, a contradiction to property (ii). Thus Π̃(ω) ⊆ E which is equivalent to ω ∈ K(E)."

    "abstractText" : "Morris (1996, 1997) introduced preference-based definitions of knowledge and belief in standard state-space structures. This paper extends this preference-based approach to unawareness structures (Heifetz, Meier, and Schipper, 2006, 2008). By defining unawareness and knowledge in terms of preferences over acts in unawareness structures and showing their equivalence to the epistemic notions of unawareness and knowledge, we try to build a bridge between decision theory and epistemic logic. Unawareness of an event is characterized behaviorally as the event being null and its negation being null.",
