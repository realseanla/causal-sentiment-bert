Levin ∗\nThe paper describes multistage design of composite (modular) systems (i.e., design of a system trajectory). This design process consists of the following: (i) definition of a set of time/logical points; (ii) modular design of the system for each time/logical point (e.g., on the basis of combinatorial synthesis as hierarchical morphological design or multiple choice problem) to obtain several system solutions; (iii) selection of the system solution for each time/logical point while taking into account their quality and the quality of compatibility between neighbor selected system solutions (here, combinatorial synthesis is used as well). Mainly, the examined time/logical points are based on a time chain. In addition, two complicated cases are considered: (a) the examined logical points are based on a tree-like structure, (b) the examined logical points are based on a digraph. Numerical examples illustrate the approach.\nKeywords: modular systems, systems design, engineering frameworks, combinatorial synthesis, heuristics\n1. Introduction\nIn recent decades, the significance of modular (multi-component) systems has been increased (e.g., [1,3, 5,9,11,12,13,15,19,21,22]). This paper addresses procedures for multistage design of hierarchical modular systems. As a result, a system trajectory can be obtained. It is assumed the following: the considered hierarchical modular system can be represented as a morphological structure: tree-like system structure, design alternatives (DAs) for leaf nodes of the structure, estimates of DAs and their compatibility (e.g., [12,13,15,18]). In addition, it is necessary to consider a top-level structure/network (i.e., a set of elements as time/logical points/states and a structure over the elements), including the following four basic types of the structure: (a) chain, (b) tree, (c) acyclic directed graph (digraph), and (d) general digraph. Thus, a two-level model is examined (Fig. 1): (1) top-level network/graph G = (H,V ), where H corresponds to a set of node (time/logical points or states), V corresponds to a set of arcs; (2) morphological structure for each node µ ∈ H : Λµ.\n✛ ✚ ✘ ✙Top-level network of over nodes G = (H,V ),each node corresponds to a time/logical point/state\nTable 1 contains a brief description of the basic considered frameworks/problems. Generally, this kind of the design process consists of the following: (i) definition of a set of time/logical points; (ii) definition of the structure over the points above (i.e., chain, tree, digraph); (iii) modular design of the system for each point (e.g., on the basis of combinatorial synthesis as multiple choice problem or hierarchical morphological design) to obtain several system solutions; (iv) selection of the system solution for each point while taking into account their quality and the quality of compatibility between neighbor selected system solutions (here, combinatorial synthesis is used as well).\n∗Mark Sh. Levin: http://www.mslevin.iitp.ru; email: mslevin@acm.org\n2 Mainly, a chain of time points is considered in the above-mentioned design scheme. In addition, two complicated cases are considered: (a) the examined logical/time points are based on a tree-like structure, (b) the examined logical/time points are based on a digraph. Numerical examples illustrate the approach. An illustration for using the approach to multiple domain problems is presented.\nGenerally, combinatorial synthesis of modular systems can be based on multiple choice problem or hierarchical multicriteria morphological design (HMMD) approach (e.g., [12,13,15,16]. Here, HMMD is used. In HMMD approach, the resultant solution is composed from design alternatives (DAs) for system parts/components while taking into account quality if their interconnection (IC). In the basic version of HMMD, the following ordinal scales are used: (1) ordinal scale for quality of system components (or priority) (ι = 1, l; 1 corresponds to the best one); (2) scale for system quality while taking into account system components ordinal estimates and ordinal compatibility estimates between the system components (w = 0, ν; ν corresponds to the best level).\nFor the system consisting of m parts/components, a discrete space (poset, lattice) of the system quality (excellence) on the basis of the following vector is used: N(S) = (w(S);n(S)), where w(S) is the minimum of pairwise compatibility between DAs which correspond to different system components, n(S) = (η1, ..., ηr, ..., ηk), where ηr is the number of DAs of the rth quality in S ( ∑k r=1 nr = m). The optimization problem is: max N(S), max w(S), w(S) ≥ 0.\n3 3. General Schemes\nThe solving two-level framework for multistage design or design of system trajectory is the following (Fig. 2) (e.g., [12,13]):\nPhase 0. Generation of general structure of the design problem: 0.1. generation of time/logical points, 0.2. generation the top-level network over the time/logical points (e.g., chain, tree, digraph), 0.3. formulation of combinatorial synthesis subproblem for each time/logical point (i.e.,system morphological model: tree-like model, design alternatives (DAs) for leaf nodes, criteria for assessment of the DAs, estimates for DAs and their compatibility). Phase 1. Hierarchical system design for each time/logical point (combinatorial synthesis on the basis of HMMD or multiple choice problem) to get a set of Pareto-efficient solutions. Phase 2. Design of a system trajectory as a combination of results (i.e., solutions for the time/logical points) obtained at the previous phase. Here combinatorial synthesis (i.e., HMMD or multiple choice problem) is used as well. The resultant system trajectory can be as follows: (a) chain of solutions for time points (i.e., series or parallel-series trajectory), (b) tree of solutions (i.e., a system solution for each tree node), and (c) digraph of the system solutions (i.e., a system solution for each digraph node).\nResultant system trajectory from k solutions (as chain)✞✝ ☎✆ ✲ ... ✘✘✘✿✞✝ ☎✆ ✲ ... ✲✞✝ ☎✆\nIn Fig. 2, the following local system solutions are depicted: (a) stage 1: S11 , S 1 2 , S 1 3 ; (b) stage i: S 2 1 , S 2 2 ;\n(c) stage k: Sk 1 , Sk 2 , Sk 3 , Sk 4 . Thus, system trajectory (chain) is: α =< S1 2 ⋆ ... ⋆ Si 1 ⋆ ... ⋆ Sk 2 >. An illustrative example for three-stage trajectory design is presented in Fig. 3, an example of the system trajectory (chain) is: β =< Sτ1\n2 ⋆ Sτ2 3 ⋆ Sτ3 1 >.\nFig. 3.

Tree-like Trajectory for Medical Treatment\nHere, multi-stage design for medical treatment is examined. The example is based on the following: (i) basic tree-like structure for medical treatment for children asthma from [20] (a simplified version); (ii) top-level network as a decision tree (Fig. 6); (iii) modified tree-like structure of medical treatment for each node of the decision tree. The considered tree-like trajectory for medical treatment with ’analysis/decision’ nodes is depicted in\nFig. 15. Each node of the trajectory is based on a simplified hierarchical structure of medical treatment for children asthma that has been suggested in [20].\nThus, the examined structure of the basic composite medical plan is the following (priorities of DAs are shown in parentheses) (Fig. 16):\n8\nFig. 15.

On Multiple Domain Problems\nThe multistage strategies can be considered for various domains: system design, system testing, medical treatment, medical diagnosis. Fig. 24 illustrates a multistage trajectory for multistage diagnosis or system testing: (i) points {θ0, θ1, ..., θk} correspond to diagnosis/testing, (ii) points {a0, a1, ..., ak} correspond to analysis/decision, and (iii) morphological structures for test points are: {Λθ0 ,Λθ1, ...,Λθk}. On the other hand, it may be reasonable to examine multistage trajectories for two domains (Fig. 25): (a) system testing, (b) system design. Here, the following notations are used: (i) points {θ1, θ2, ..., θk} correspond to system testing/diagnosis, (ii) points {a0, a1, ..., ak} correspond to analysis/decision, (iii) points {ξ1, ξ2, ..., ξq} correspond to system design/redesign, (iv) morphological structures for test points are: {Λθ0,Λθ1 , ...,Λθk}, and (v) morphological structures for design/redesign points are: {Λξ0 ,Λξ1 , ...,Λξq}.\nThus, the combined multistage strategy involves two parts: (a) multistage strategy for system testing and (b) multistage strategy for system improvement/redesign. Note, two-domain problem can correspond to the following domains: system utilization and system maintenance. Evidently, parts for different domains can have more complicated forms (i.e., over digraph).\n5. Conclusion\nThe paper describes multistage design for a composite (modular) system (i.e., design of system trajectories). In the complicated situations, the multistage design is extended for graph-based design structures. Composition of the graph-based design structures lead to prospective multi-domain problems, for example: (a) system testing/diagnosis and system improvement/redesign, (b) medical diagnosis and medical treatment, (c) system utilization and system maintenance. It is necessary to note, the described approach is close to finite-state machines or state transition diagrams (e.g., [4,6,7,8,10,23]). On the other hand, it is interesting to consider a similarity of the described approach and dynamic decision making methods (e.g., [2]).\nIn the future, it may be reasonable to consider the following research directions: (1) examination of various real-world applications (e.g., medical diagnosis and medical treatment, communication networks); (2) study and usage of multistage system trajectories for multiple domains problems (e.g., system testing, system maintenance, system utilization, system improvement/redesign) including inter-domains interconnection;\n(3) special study of formal models for ’analysis/decision’ points (states); (4) taking into account uncertainty and extension of the described approach; (5) examination of a dynamic described approach while taking into account changes of external requirements; (6) design of a special computer environment; and (7) usage of the described system approaches in education (computer science, engineering, applied mathematics, management).\nREFERENCES\n1.

    "abstractText" : "The paper describes multistage design of composite (modular) systems (i.e., design of a system trajectory). This design process consists of the following: (i) definition of a set of time/logical points; (ii) modular design of the system for each time/logical point (e.g., on the basis of combinatorial synthesis as hierarchical morphological design or multiple choice problem) to obtain several system solutions; (iii) selection of the system solution for each time/logical point while taking into account their quality and the quality of compatibility between neighbor selected system solutions (here, combinatorial synthesis is used as well). Mainly, the examined time/logical points are based on a time chain. In addition, two complicated cases are considered: (a) the examined logical points are based on a tree-like structure, (b) the examined logical points are based on a digraph. Numerical examples illustrate the approach.",
