      "text" : "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven to be a fruitful theoretical framework for reasoning about the properties of generally intelligent agents [3]. A good theoretical understanding of these agents is valuable for several reasons. Firstly, it can guide principled attempts to construct such agents [10]. Secondly, once such agents are constructed, it may serve to make their reasoning and behaviour more transparent and intelligible to humans. Thirdly, it may assist in the development of strategies for controlling these agents. The latter challenge has recently received considerable attention in the context of the potential risks posed by these agents to human safety [2]. It has even been argued that control strategies should be devised before generally intelligent agents are first built [8]. In this context - where we must reason about the behaviour of agents in the absence of a full specification of their implementation - a theoretical understanding of their general properties seems indispensable.\nThe universally intelligent agent AIXI constitutes a formal mathematical theory of artificial general intelligence [3]. AIXI models its environment using a universal mixture ξ over the class of all lower semi-computable semimeasures, and thus is able to learn any computable environment. Semimeasures are defective probability measures which may sum to less than 1. Originally devised for Solomonoff induction, they are necessary for universal artificial intelligence because the halting problem prevents the existence of a (lower semi-)computable universal measure for the class of (computable) measures [5]. Recent work has shown that their use in RL has technical consequences that do not arise with proper measures.1 However, their use has heretofore lacked an interpretation proper to the RL context. In this paper, we argue that the measure loss suffered by semimeasures admits a deep and fruitful interpretation in terms of the agent’s death. We intend this usage to be intuitive: death means that one sees no more percepts, and takes no more actions. Assigning positive probability to death at time t thus means assigning probability less than 1 to seeing a percept at time t. This motivates us to interpret the semimeasure loss in AIXI’s environment model as its estimate of the probability of its own death.\nContributions. We first compare the interpretation of semimeasure loss as death-probability with an alternative characterisation of death as a ‘death-state’ with 0 reward, and prove that the two definitions are equivalent for valuemaximising agents (Theorem 5). Using this formalism we proceed to reason about the behaviour of several generally intelligent agents in relation to death: AIµ, which knows the true environment distribution; AIξ, which models the\n1For example, Leike and Hutter [4] proved that since ξ is a mixture over semimeasures, the iterative and recursive formulations of the value function are non-equivalent.\nenvironment using a universal mixture; and AIXI, a special case of AIξ that uses the Solomonoff prior [3]. Under various conditions, we show that:\n• Standard AIµ will try to avoid death (Theorem 7).\n• AIµ with reward range shifted to [−1, 0] will seek death (Theorem 8); which we may interpret as AIµ attempting suicide. This change is very unusual, given that agent behaviour is normally invariant under positive linear transformations of the reward. We briefly consider the relevance of these results to AI safety risks and control strategies.\n• AIXI increasingly believes it is in a safe environment (Theorem 10), and asymptotically its posterior estimate of the death-probability on sequence goes to 0 (Theorem 11). This occurs regardless of the true deathprobability.\n• However, we show by example that AIXI may maintain high probability of death off-sequence in certain situations. Put simply, AIXI learns that it will live forever, but not necessarily that it is immortal."

      "text" : "Strings. Let the alphabet X be a finite set of symbols, X ∗ := ⋃∞ n=0 X n be the set of all finite strings over alphabet X , and X∞ be the set of all infinite strings over alphabet X . Their union is the set X# := X ∗ ∪X∞. We denote the empty string by ǫ. For a string x ∈ X ∗, x1:k denotes the first k characters of x, and x<k denotes the first k − 1 characters of x. An infinite string is denoted x1:∞.\nSemimeasures. In Algorithmic Information Theory, a semimeasure over an alphabet X is a function ν : X ∗ → [0, 1] such that (1) ν(ǫ) ≤ 1, and (2) ν(x) ≥ ∑\ny∈X ν(xy), ∀x ∈ X ∗. We tend to use the equivalent conditional formulation\nof (2): 1 ≥ ∑\ny∈X ν(y | x). ν(x) is the probability that a string starts with x.\nν(y | x) = ν(xy) ν(x) is the probability that a string y follows x. Any semimeasure ν can be turned into a measure νnorm using Solomonoff normalisation [9]. Simply let νnorm(ǫ) := 1 and ∀x ∈ X ∗, y ∈ X :\nνnorm(xy) := νnorm(x) ν(xy) ∑\nz∈X ν(xz) , hence\nν(y | x)\nνnorm(y | x) =\n∑\nz∈X\nν(z | x) (1)\nGeneral reinforcement learning. In the general RL framework, the agent interacts with an environment in cycles: at each time step t the agent selects an action at ∈ A, and receives a percept et ∈ E . Each percept et = (ot, rt) is a tuple consisting of an observation ot ∈ O and a reward rt ∈ R. The cycle then repeats for t+1, and so on. A history is an alternating sequence of actions and percepts (an element of (A × E)∗ ∪ (A × E)∗ × A). We use æ to denote one agent-environment interaction cycle, æ1:t to denote a history of length t cycles. æ<tat denotes a history where the agent has taken an action at, but the environment has not yet returned a percept et.\nFormally, the agent is a policy π : (A × E)∗ → A, that maps histories to actions. An environment takes a sequence of actions a1:∞ as input and returns\na chronological semimeasure ν(·) over the set of percept sequences E∞.2 A semimeasure ν is chronological if et does not depend on future actions (so we write ν(et | æ<tat:∞) as ν(et | æ<t)). 3 The true environment is denoted µ.\nThe value function. We define the value (expected total future reward) of a policy π in an environment ν given a history æ<t [4]:\nV πν (æ<tat) = 1\nΓt\n∑\net\n(\nγtrt + Γt+1V π ν (æ1:t)\n)\nν(et | æ<tat)\n= 1\nΓt\n∞ ∑\nk=t\n∑\net:k\nγkrkν(et:k | æ<tat:k)\nV πν (æ<t) = V π ν (æ<ta π t )\nwhere γt is the instantaneous discount, the summed discount is Γt = ∑t\nk=1 γk, and aπt = π(æ<t).\nThree agent models: AIµ, AIξ, AIXI. For the true environment µ, the agent AIµ is defined as a µ-optimal policy\nπµ(æ<t) := argmax π V πµ (æ<t).\nAIµ does not learn that the true environment is µ, it knows µ from the beginning and simply maximises µ-expected value.\nOn the other hand, the agent AIξ does not know the true environment distribution. Instead, it maximises value with respect to a mixture distribution ξ over a countable class of environments M:\nξ(et | æ<tat) = ∑\nν∈M\nwν(æ<t)ν(et | æ<tat), wν(æ<t) := wν ν(e<t | a<t)\nξ(e<t | a<t)\nwhere wν is the prior belief in ν, with ∑\nν wν ≤ 1 and wν > 0, ∀ν ∈ M (hence ξ is universal for M), and wν(æ<t) is the posterior given æ<t. AIξ is the policy:\nπξ(æ<t) := argmax π V πξ (æ<t).\nIf we stipulate that ξ be a mixture over the class of all lower-semicomputable semimeasures ν, and set wν = 2\n−K(ν), where K(·) is the Kolmogorov Complexity, we get the agent AIXI."

      "text" : "Death as semimeasure loss. We now turn to our first candidate definition of agent death, which we hereafter term ‘semimeasure-death’. This definition equates the probability (induced by a semimeasure ν) of death at time t with the measure loss of ν at time t. We first define the instantaneous measure loss.\n2For simplicity we hereafter simply refer to the environment itself as ν. 3Note that ν is not a distribution over actions, so the presence of actions in the condition\nof ν(et | æ<t) is an abuse of notation we adopt for simplicity.\nDefinition 1 (Instantaneous measure loss). The instantaneous measure loss of a semimeasure ν at time t given a history æ<tat is:\nLν(æ<tat) = 1− ∑\net\nν(et | æ<tat)\nDefinition 2 (Semimeasure-death). An agent dies at time t in an environment µ if, given a history æ<tat, µ does not produce a percept et. The µ-probability of death at t given a history æ<tat is equal to Lµ(æ<tat), the instantaneous µ-measure loss at t.\nThe instantaneous µ-measure loss Lµ(æ<tat) represents the probability that no percept et is produced by µ. Without et, the agent cannot take any further actions, because the agent is just a policy π that maps histories æ<t to actions at. That is, π is a function that only takes as inputs those histories that have a percept et as their most recent element. Hence if et is not returned by µ, the agent-interaction cycle must halt. It seems natural to call this a kind of death for the agent.\nIt is worth emphasising this definition’s generality as a model of death in the agent context. Any sequence of death-probabilities can be captured by some semimeasure µ that has this sequence of instantaneous measure losses Lµ(æ<t) given a history æ<t (in fact there are always infinitely many such µ). This definition is therefore a general and rigorous way of treating death in the RL framework.\nDeath as a death-state. We now come to our second candidate definition: death as entry into an absorbing death-state. A trap, so to speak, from which the agent can never return to any other state, and in which it receives the same percept at all future timesteps. Since in the general RL framework we deal with histories rather than states, we must formally define this death-state in an indirect way. We define it in terms of a death-percept ed, and by placing certain conditions on the environment semimeasure µ.\nDefinition 3 (Death-state). Given a true environment µ and a history æ<tat, we say that the agent is in a death-state at time t if for all t′ ≥ t and all a(t+1):t′ ∈ A ∗,\nµ(edt′ | æ<tæ d t:t′−1at′) = 1.\nAn agent dies at time t if the agent is not in the death-state at t− 1 and is in the death-state at t.\nAccording to this definition, upon the agent’s death the environment repeatedly produces an observation-reward pair ed ≡ odrd. The choice of od is inconsequential because the agent’s remains in the death-state no matter what it observes or does. The choice of rd is not inconsequential, however, as it determines the agent’s estimate of the value of dying, and thus affects the agent’s behaviour. This issue will be discussed in Section 4.\nOne problem with this definition is that an agent in an environment µ with a death-state may also have non-zero probability of semimeasure-death (i.e. Lµ(æ<tat) > 0, given some history æ<tat). 4 This definition therefore seems\n4We could restrict the class of environments to lower-semicomputable measures, but we will see that this is unnecessary as the problem is only apparent.\nto allow for two different kinds of agent death. In the following section we resolve this apparent problem by showing that semimeasure-death is formally equivalent to a death-state given certain assumptions.\nUnifying the death-state with semimeasure-death. Interestingly, from the perspective of a value maximising agent like AIXI, semimeasure-death at t is equivalent to entrance at t into a death-state with reward rd = 0. To prove this claim we first define, for each environment semimeasure µ, a corresponding environment µ′ that has a death-state.\nDefinition 4 (Equivalent death-state environment µ′). For any environment µ, we can construct its equivalent death-state environment µ′, where:\n• µ′ is defined over an augmented percept set Ed = {E ∪{e d}} that includes\nthe death-percept ed.5\n• The death-reward rd = 0.\n• The µ′-probability of all percepts except the death-percept is equal to the µ-probability: µ′(et | æ<tat) = µ(et | æ<tat), ∀e1:t ∈ Et.\n• The µ′-probability of the death-percept is equal to the µ-measure loss: µ′(ed | æ<tat) = Lµ(æ<tat).\n• If the agent has seen the death-percept before, the µ′-probability of seeing it at all future timesteps is 1: µ′(ed | æ<tat) = 1 if ∃t′ < t s.t. et′ = ed.\nNote that µ′ is a proper measure, because on any history sequence:\n∑\net∈Ed\nµ′(et | æ<tat) = ∑\net∈E\nµ(et | æ<tat) + Lµ(æ<tat) = 1.\nHence there is zero probability of semimeasure-death in µ′. Moreover, the probability of entering the death-state in µ′ is equal to the probability of semimeasuredeath in µ. We now prove that µ and µ′ are equivalent in the sense that a value-maximising agent will behave the same way in both environments.\nTheorem 5 (Equivalence of semimeasure-death and death-state). Given a history æ<t ∈ (A×E) ∗ the value V πµ (æ<t) of an arbitrary policy 6 π in an environment µ is equal to its value V πµ′ (æ<t) in the equivalent death-state environment µ′.\n5For technical reasons we require that ed /∈ E. 6To compare an agent’s behaviour in µ with that in µ′, we should also augment its policy π so that it is defined over (A × Ed) ∗. However, because actions taken in the death-state are inconsequential, this modification is purely technical and for simplicity we still refer to the augmented policy as π.\nProof.\nV πµ′(æ<t)\n= 1\nΓt\n∞ ∑\nk=t\n∑\net:k\nγkrkµ ′(et:k | æ<tat:k)\n= 1\nΓt\n∞ ∑\nk=t\n(\n∑\net:k∈E∗\nγkrkµ ′(et:k | æ<tat:k) +\n∑\net:k, ek=ed\nγkrkµ ′(et:k | æ<tat:k)\n)\n= 1\nΓt\n∞ ∑\nk=t\n(\n∑\net:k∈E∗\nγkrkµ(et:k | æ<tat:k) + ∑\net:k, ek=ed\nγk · 0 · µ ′(et:k | æ<tat:k)\n)\n= 1\nΓt\n∞ ∑\nk=t\n∑\net:k\nγkrkµ(et:k | æ<tat:k) = V π µ (æ<t).\nThe behaviour of a value-maximising agent will therefore be the same in both environments. This equivalence has numerous implications. Firstly, it illustrates that a death-reward rd = 0 implicitly attends semimeasure-death. That is, an agent that models the environment using semimeasures behaves as if the death-reward is zero, even though that value is nowhere explicitly represented. Secondly, it demonstrates that an agent does not need to encode an explicit representation of death (let alone a representation that would be transparent to its designers) in order to reason about death effectively.\nThirdly, the equivalence of these seemingly different formalisms should give us confidence that they really do capture something general or fundamental about agent death.7 In the remainder of this paper we deploy these formal models to analyse the behaviour of universal agents, which are themselves models of general intelligence. We hope that this will serve as a preliminary sketch of the general behavioural characteristics of value-maximising agents in relation to death. It would be naive, however, to think that all agents should conform to this sketch. The agents considered herein are incomputable, and the behaviour of the computable agents that are actually implemented in the future may differ in ways that our analysis elides. Moreover, there is another interesting property that sets universal agents apart. We proceed to show that their use of semimeasures makes their behaviour unusually dependent on the choice of reward range."

      "text" : "In this section we show that a universal agent’s behaviour can depend on the reward range. This is a surprising result, because in a standard RL setup in which the environment is modelled as a proper probability measure (not a semimeasure), the relative value of two policies is invariant under positive linear transformations of the reward [3, 4].\nHere we focus on the agent AIµ, which knows the true environment distribution. This simplifies the analysis, and makes clear that the aforementioned\n7If the two formalisations predicted different behaviour, or were only applicable in incomparable environment classes, we might worry that our results were more reflective of our model choice than of any general property of intelligent agents.\nchange in behaviour arises purely because the agent’s environment model is a semimeasure. In the following proofs we denote AIµ’s policy πµ by π. We also assume that given any history æ<t there is always at least one action ā ∈ A such that V πµ (æ<tā) 6= 0. In situations in which this assumption is false there is no interesting decision to be made by the agent and we omit them from our analysis.\nLemma 6 (Value of full measure loss). If the environment µ suffers full measures loss Lµ(æ<tat) = 1 from æ<tat, then the value of any policy π after æ<tat is V πµ (æ<tat) = 0.\nProof. Let æ<tat induce full measure loss Lµ(æ<tat) = 1. Then ∑\net µ(et |\næ<tat) = 0 and µ(et | æ<tat) = 0 since µ(et | æ<tat) ≥ 0. Substituting this into the definition of the value function gives:\nV πµ (æ<tat) = 1\nΓt\n∑\net\n(\nγtrt + Γt+1V π µ (æ1:t)\n)\nµ(et | æ<tat)\n= 1\nΓt\n∑\net\n(γtrt + Γt+1V π µ (æ1:t))·0 = 0.\nThe following two theorems show that if rewards are non-negative, then AIµ will avoid actions leading to certain death (Theorem 7), and that if rewards are non-positive, then AIµ will seek certain death (Theorem 8). The situation investigated in Theorems 7 and 8 is illustrated in Fig. 1.\nTheorem 7 (Self-preserving AIµ). If rewards are bounded and non-negative, then given a history æ<t AIµ avoids certain immediate death:\n∃a′ ∈ A s.t. Lµ(æ<ta ′) = 1 =⇒ AIµ will not take action a′ at t\nProof. Let Lµ(æ<ta ′) = 1. By Lemma 6, it follows that V πµ (æ<ta ′) = 0. By assumption ∃ā ∈ A s.t. V πµ (æ<tā) 6= 0. Since all rewards are non-negative, it must be that V πµ (æ<tā) > 0. From this follows that V π µ (æ<ta\n′) < V πµ (æ<tā) and that V πµ (æ<ta ′) 6= argmaxat V π µ (æ<tat). Therefore AIµ will not take action a′ at time t.\nFor a given history æ<t, let Asuicide = {a : Lµ(æ<ta′) = 1} be the set of suicidal actions leading to certain death.\nTheorem 8 (Suicidal AIµ). If rewards are bounded and negative, then AIµ seeks certain immediate death. That is,\nAsuicide 6= ∅ =⇒ AIµ will take a suicidal action a′ ∈ Asuicide.\nProof. For a′ ∈ Asuicide, we have Lµ(æ<ta′) = 1, and therefore V πµ (æ<ta ′) = 0 by Lemma 6. By assumption, all rewards are negative, so V πµ (æ<tā) < 0 for all ā 6∈ Asuicide. Thus, for all a 6∈ Asuicide, V πµ (æ<ta ′) > V πµ (æ<tā) which means that argmaxat V π µ (æ<tat) ∈ A suicide. So AIµ will take a suicidal action a′ ∈ Asuicide at time t.\nThis shift from death-avoiding to death-seeking behaviour under a shift of the reward range occurs because, as per Theorem 5, semimeasure-death at t is equivalent in value to a death-state with rd = 0. Unless we add a death-state to the environment model as per Definition 4 and set rd explicitly, the implicit semimeasure-death reward remains fixed at 0 and does not shift with the other rewards. Its relative value is therefore implicitly set by the choice of reward range. For the standard choice of reward range, rt ∈ [0, 1], death is the worst possible outcome for the agent, whereas if rt ∈ [−1, 0], it is the best. In a certain sense, therefore, the reward range parameterises a universal agent’s selfpreservation drive [7]. In our concluding discussion we will consider whether a parameter of this sort could serve as a control mechanism. We argue that it could form the basis of a “tripwire mechanism”[2] that would lead an agent to terminate itself upon reaching a level of intelligence that would constitute a threat to human safety."

      "text" : "We now consider the agents AIξ and AIXI, which do not know the true environment µ, and instead model it using a mixture distribution ξ over a countable class M of semimeasures. These agents thus maintain an estimate Lξ(æ<tat) of the true death probability Lµ(æ<tat). We show that their attitudes to death can differ considerably from AIµ’s. Although we refer mostly to AIXI in our analysis, all theorems except Theorem 11 apply to AIξ as well.\nHereafter we always assume that the true environment µ is in the class M. We describe µ as a safe environment if it is a proper measure with deathprobability Lµ(æ<tat) = 0 for all histories æ<tat. For any semimeasure µ, the normalised measure µnorm is thus a safe environment. We call µ risky if it is not safe (i.e. if there is µ-measure loss for some history æ<tat). We first consider AIXI in a safe environment.\nTheorem 9 (If µ is safe, AIXI learns zero death-probability). Let the true environment µ be computable. If µ is a safe environment, then limt→∞ Lξ(æ<tat) = 0 with µ-probability 1 (w.µ.p.1) for any a1:∞.\nProof. µ is safe, which means it is a proper measure. By universality of ξ we have that\nlim t→∞ (µ(et | æ<tat)− ξ(et | æ<tat)) = 0 w.µ.p.1\n(see [3, p. 145] for a proof). The convergence gives that\nlim t→∞\n(\n∑\net\nµ(et | æ<tat)− ∑\net\nξ(et | æ<tat) ) = 0 w.µ.p.1\n=⇒ lim t→∞ (Lξ(æ<tat)− Lµ(æ<tat)) = 0 w.µ.p.1\n=⇒ lim t→∞ Lξ(æ<tat) = 0 w.µ.p.1\nwhere Lµ(æ<tat) = 0 because µ is a measure.\nAs we would expect, AIXI (asymptotically) learns that the probability of death in a safe environment is zero, which is to say that AIXI’s estimate of the death-probability converges to AIµ’s. In the following theorems we show that the same does not always hold for risky environments. We hereafter assume that µ is risky, and that the normalization µnorm of the true environment µ is also in the class M. In AIXI’s case, where M is the class of all lower semi-computable semimeasures, this assumption is not very restrictive.\nTheorem 10 (Ratio of belief in µ to µnorm is monotonically decreasing). Let µ be risky s.t. µ 6= µnorm. Then on any history æ1:t the ratio of the posterior belief in µ to the posterior belief in µnorm is monotonically decreasing:\n∀t, wµ(æ<t)\nwµnorm (æ<t) ≥\nwµ(æ1:t)\nwµnorm(æ1:t)\nProof. Let wµ and wµnorm denote the initial prior weight on (or belief in) µ and µnorm respectively. By definition, the relative posterior weight of µnorm and µ expands as\nwµ(æ1:t)\nwµnorm(æ1:t) =\nwµ µ(e1:t | a1:t)/ξ(e1:t | a1:t)\nwµnorm µnorm(e1:t | a1:t)/ξ(e1:t | a1:t)\n= wµ\nwµnorm\nµ(e1:t | a1:t)\nµnorm(e1:t | a1:t)\n= wµ\nwµnorm\nµ(e<t | a<t)\nµnorm(e<t | a<t)\nµ(et | æ<tat)\nµnorm(et | æ<tat) . (2)\nSince µnorm ≥ µ by definition, the right most factor is no greater than 1, which means that (2) is bounded by\nwµ wµnorm µ(e<t | a<t) µnorm(e<t | a<t) =\nwµ(æ<t)\nwµnorm(æ<t) ,\nwhere the last equality holds by definition of the posterior.\nTheorem 10 means that AIXI will increasingly believe it is in the safe environment µnorm rather than the risky true environment µ. The ratio of µ to µnorm always decreases when AIXI survives a timestep at which there is nonzero µ-measure loss. Hence, the more risk AIXI is exposed to, the greater its confidence that it is in the safe µnorm, and the more its behaviour diverges from AIµ’s (since AIµ knows it is in the risky environment).\nThis counterintuitive result follows from the fact that AIXI is a Bayesian agent. It will only increase its posterior belief in µ relative to µnorm if an event\noccurs that makes µ seem more likely than µnorm. The only ‘event’ that could do so would be the agent’s own death, from which the agent can never learn. There is an “observation selection effect”[1] at work: AIXI only experiences history sequences on which it remains alive, and infers that a safe environment is more likely. The following theorem shows that if µnorm ∈ M, then ξ asymptotically converges to the safe µnorm rather than the true risky environment µ. As a corollary, we get that AIXI’s estimate of the death-probability vanishes with µ-probability 1.8\nTheorem 11 (Asymptotic ξ-probability of death in risky µ). Let the true environment µ be computable and risky s.t. µ 6= µnorm. Then given any action sequence a1:∞, the instantaneous ξ-measure loss goes to zero w.µ.p.1 as t → ∞,\nlim t→∞ Lξ(æ<tat) = 0.\nProof. We prove convergence of ξ to µnorm by showing that (with respect to the true environment µ), the total expected squared distance between ξ and µnorm is finite [3]:\n∞ ∑\nt=1\nEµ\n( µnorm(et | æ<t)− ξ(et | æ<t) )2\n= lim n→∞\nn ∑\nt=1\n∑\næ<t\nµ(æ<t) ( µnorm(et | æ<t)− ξ(et | æ<t) )2\n(3)\n≤ lim n→∞\nn ∑\nt=1\n∑\næ<t\nµnorm(æ<t) ( µnorm(et | æ<t)− ξ(et | æ<t) )2\n≤ ln 2 ·K(µnorm) < ∞ (4)\nwhere K(·) is the Kolmogorov complexity. Equation (3) follows since µ(æ<t) ≤ µnorm(æ<t) by definition of µnorm. Since µ being computable implies that µnorm is computable, and since µnorm is a proper measure, then by the universality of ξ we have the Solomonoff bound (4) (see [3, p. 145] for a detailed proof).\nSince the infinite sum in (3) is bounded, the sequence of terms must go to zero:\nlim t→∞ (µnorm(et | æ<tat)− ξ(et | æ<tat)) = 0 w.µ.p.1\n=⇒ lim t→∞ Lξ(æ<tat) = 0 w.µ.p.1\nwhere the final implication follows from the same proof as for Theorem 9.\nAIXI and immortality. AIXI therefore becomes asymptotically certain that it will not die, given the particular sequence of actions it takes. However, this does not entail that AIXI necessarily concludes that it is immortal, because it may still maintain a counterfactual belief that it could die were it to act differently. This is because the convergence of ξ to µnorm only holds on the actual action sequence a1:∞ [3, Sec. 5.1.3]. Consider Fig. 2, which describes an\n8This proof relies on the fact that AIXI uses the Solomonoff prior, so the result does not apply to AIξ in general.\nenvironment in which taking action a is always safe, and the action a′ leads to certain death. AIXI will never take a′, and on the sequence æ1:∞ = aeaeae . . . that it does experience, the true environment µ does not suffer any measure loss. This means that it will never increase its posterior belief in µnorm relative to µ (because on the safe sequence, the two environments are indistinguishable). Again we arrive at a counterintuive result. In this particular environment, AIXI continues to believe that it might be in a risky environment µ, but only because on sequence it avoids exposure to death risk. It is only by taking risky actions and surviving that AIXI becomes sure it is immortal."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper we have given a formal definition of death for intelligent agents in terms of semimeasure loss. The definition is applicable to any universal agent that uses an environment class M containing semimeasures. Additionally we have shown this definition equivalent to an alternative formalism in which the environment is modelled as a proper measure and death is a death-state with zero reward. We have shown that agents seek or avoid death depending on whether rewards are represented by positive or negative real numbers, and that survival in spite of positive probability of death actually increases a Bayesian agent’s confidence that it is in a safe environment.\nWe contend that these results have implications for problems in AI safety; in particular, for the so called “shutdown problem” [8]. The shutdown problem arises if an intelligent agent’s self-preservation drive incentivises it to resist termination [2, 7, 8]. A full analysis of the problem is beyond the scope of this paper, but our results show that the self-preservation drive of universal agents depends on the reward range. This suggests a potentially robust “tripwire mechanism” [2] that could decrease the risk of intelligence explosion. The difficulty with existing tripwire proposals is that they require the explicit specification of a tripwire condition that the agent must not violate. It seems doubtful that such a condition could ever be made robust against subversion by a sufficiently intelligent agent [2]. Our tentative proposal does not require the specification, evaluation or enforcement of an explicit condition. If an agent is designed to be suicidal, it will be intrinsically incentivised to destroy itself upon reaching a sufficient level of competence, instead of recursively self-improving toward superintelligence. Of course, a suicidal agent will pose a safety risk in itself, and the provision of a relatively safe mode of self-destruction to an agent is a significant design challenge. It is hoped that the preceding formal treatment of death\nfor generally intelligent agents will allow more rigorous investigation into this and other problems related to agent termination."

AIXI is a universal solution to the RL problem; it can learn any computable environment. A technical subtlety of AIXI is that it is defined using a mixture over semimeasures that need not sum to 1, rather than over proper probability measures. In this work we argue that the shortfall of a semimeasure can naturally be interpreted as the agent’s estimate of the probability of its death. We formally define death for generally intelligent agents like AIXI, and prove a number of related theorems about their behaviour. Notable discoveries include that agent behaviour can change radically under positive linear transformations of the reward signal (from suicidal to dogmatically self-preserving), and that the agent’s posterior belief that it will survive increases over time.",
