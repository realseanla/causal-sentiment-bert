      "text" : "In the last two decades, a collection of highly related dynamical models including observable operator models (OOMs) [1–3], predictive state representations [4–6] and spectral learning based hidden Markov models [7, 8], have become powerful and increasingly popular tools for analysis of dynamical data. These models are largely similar and can be unified in a general learning framework of multiplicity automata, or equivalently sequential systems [9, 10]. We focus in this paper only on stochastic systems without control inputs. Because all of above mentioned models can be expressed in the form of OOMs for such systems, we will refer to them as OOMs below.\nIn contrast with the other commonly used models such as Markov models [11], Langevin models [12], traditional hidden Markov models (HMMs) [13] and recurrent neural networks [14], OOMs can exactly characterize the dynamics of a stochastic system without any a priori knowledge except the assumption of finite dynamical rank (i.e., the rank of Hankel matrix) [10], and the parameter estimation can be efficiently performed by the method of moments for discrete-valued systems without solving any intractable inverse or optimization problem.\nA major challenge for OOM based dynamical modeling approaches arises from nonequilibrium data. In most literature, the observation data are assumed to be equilibrium so that the expected values of observables associated with OOM learning can be reliably computed by simple averaging. However, the equilibrium assumption can be approximately satisfied only if most of observation data are generated after the system has mixed. In many practical situations, especially where metastable physical or chemical processes are involved, this assumption can be severely violated due to the\n∗Original title: Learning Observable Operator Models from Nonequilibrium Data\n29th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n00 93\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nS ep\nlimit of experimental technique or computational capacity. A notable example is the distributed computing project Folding@home [15], which explores protein folding processes that occur on the timescales of microseconds to milliseconds based on molecular dynamics simulations on the order of nanoseconds in length. In such a case, it is still unknown how to obtain promising estimates of OOMs from nonequilibrium data consisting of short trajectories. In [16], a hybrid estimation algorithm was proposed to improve OOM learning of large-time-scale processes by using both dynamic and static data, but it still requires assumption of equilibrium data. One solution to reduce the statistical bias caused by nonequilibrium data is to discard the observation data generated before the system reaches steady state, which is a common trick in applied statistics [17]. Obviously, this way suffers from substantial information loss and is infeasible when observation trajectories are shorter than mixing times. Another possible way would be to learn OOMs by likelihood-based estimation instead of moment-based estimation, but there is no effective maximum likelihood or Bayesian estimator of OOMs until now. The maximum pseudo-likelihood estimator of OOMs proposed in [18] demands high computational cost and its consistency is yet unverified.\nAnother difficulty for OOM based modeling approaches is learning with continuous data, where density estimation problems are involved. The density estimation can be performed by parametric methods such as the fuzzy interpolation [19] and the kernel density estimation [8]. But these methods would reduce the flexibility of OOMs for dynamical modeling because of their limited expressive capacity. Recently, a kernel embedding based OOM learning algorithm was proposed to cope with continuous data [20], which avoids explicit density estimation and learns OOMs in a nonparametric manner. However, the kernel embedding usually yields a very large computational complexity, which greatly limits practical applications of this algorithm to real-world systems.\nThe purpose of this paper is to address the challenge of nonequilibrium learning of OOMs due to the requirements of analysis of both discrete- and continuous-valued systems. We provide a modified moment-based method for discrete-valued stochastic systems which allows us to consistently estimate the equilibrium dynamics from nonequilibrium data, and then extend this method to OOM learning with continuous observations in a binless manner. In comparison with the existing learning methods for continuous OOMs, the proposed binless method does not rely on any density estimator, and can achieve consistent estimation with linear computational complexity in data size even if the equilibrium assumption of observations does not hold. Moreover, some numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the capability of the proposed nonequilibrium learning methods."

A large number of largely similar methods have been developed to learn OOMs from discrete data, and the generic learning procedure of these methods is summarized in Algorithm 1 by omitting details of algorithm implementation and parameter choice. For convenience of description and analysis, we specify in this paper the formula for calculating ˆ̄φ1, ˆ̄φ2, Ĉ1,2 and Ĉ1,3 (x) in Line 2 of Algorithm 1 as follows:\nˆ̄φ1 , 1\nN N∑ n=1 φ1(~s 1 n), ˆ̄φ2 , 1 N N∑ n=1 φ1(~s 2 n) (3)\nĈ1,2 , 1\nN N∑ n=1 φ1(~s 1 n)φ2(~s 2 n) > (4)\nĈ1,3 (x) , 1\nN N∑ n=1 1s2n=xφ1(~s 1 n)φ2(~s 3 n) >, ∀x ∈ O (5)\nHere {(~s 1n , s2n, ~s 3n)}Ns=1 is the collection of all subsequences of length (2L+ 1) appearing in observation data (N = T − 2L for a single observation trajectory of length T ). For instance, if an observation subsequence xt−L:t+L is denoted by (~s 1n , s 2 n, ~s 3 n) with some n, then ~s 1 n = xt−L:t−1 and ~s 3n = xt+1:t+L represents the prefix and suffix of xt−L:t+L of length L, s 2 n = xt is the intermediate observation value, and ~s 2n = xt:t+L−1 is an “intermediate part” of the subsequence of length L starting from time t (see Fig. 1 for a graphical illustration).\nAlgorithm 1 is much more efficient than the commonly used likelihood-based learning algorithms and does not suffer from local optima issues. In addition, and more importantly, this algorithm can be shown to be consistent if the observation data are equilibrium so that empirical estimates of φ̄1, φ̄2, C1,2 and C1,3 (x) converge to their true values with increasing data size (see, e.g., [3, 8, 10] for\nrelated works). However, the consistent estimation of OOMs with nonequilibrium data is still an unsolved problem."

      "text" : "We now analyze statistical properties of the OOM learning algorithm without the assumption of equilibrium observations. Before stating our main result, some assumptions on observation data are listed as follows: Assumption 1. The observation data consists of I independent trajectories of length T produced by a stochastic process {xt}, and the data size tends to infinity with (i) I →∞ and T = T0 or (ii) T →∞ and I = I0. Assumption 2. {xt} is driven by an m-dimensional OOMM = (ω, {Ξ(x)}x∈O,σ), and satisfies\n1\nT ′ T ′∑ t=1 ft p→ E∞ [ft] = E∞ [ft|x1:k] (12)\nas T ′ →∞ for all k, l, x1:k and ft = f (xt:t+l−1). Assumption 3. The limit of F>1 Ĉ1,2F2 ∈ Rm×m is invertible.\nNotice that we do not assume stationarity of processes as previously done in the literature, and Assumption 2 only states the asymptotic stationarity of {xt}. Therefore, estimates of φ̄1, φ̄2, C1,2 and C1,3 (x) obtained from empirical means may not be consistent if lengths of observation trajectories are kept at finite values (i.e., Case (i) in Assumption 1). Assumption 3 ensures that the limit of M̂ given by Algorithm 1 is well defined. Based on the above assumptions, we have the following theorem concerning the consistency of the OOM learning algorithm (see Appendix A.1 for proof):\nTheorem 1. Under Assumptions 1-3, the estimated OOM M̂ = (ω̂, {Ξ̂(x)}x∈O, σ̂) given by Algorithm 1 satisfies\nσ̂ p→ σeq, Ξ̂ (x) p→ Ξeq(x), ∀x ∈ O (13) whereMeq = (ωeq, {Ξeq(x)}x∈O,σeq) is an m-dimensional OOM equivalent toM.\nThis theorem is central in this paper, and implies that the moment based learning algorithm can achieve consistent estimation of all parameters of OOMs except initial state vectors even for nonequilibrium data. (ω̂\np→ ωeq does not hold in most cases except when {xt} is stationary. See Appendix A.1 for details). It can be further generalized according to requirements in more complicated situations where, for example, the data set consists of both several long trajectories and many short trajectories or trajectories are not independent from each other. The following two generalizations are particularly worth mentioning due to their importance for practical applications:\n1. The i-th observation trajectories is generated by OOM M = (ωi, {Ξ(x)}x∈O,σ) for i = 1, . . . , I (i.e., observations are generated with multiple different initial conditions), and the mean value of {ωi}Ii=1 tends to a constant in probability for I →∞.\n2. Matrices F1 and F2 are not constant but given by the singular value decomposition of Ĉ1,2 as in the spectral learning algorithm [21, 7, 22].\nWe show in Appendix A that the above two generalizations do not affect the consistency of Ξ̂ (x) and σ̂. In fact, it can be proved by similar proofs that all theoretical conclusions in this paper hold for the two generalizations."

Considering that the purpose of dynamical modeling is to predict properties of the system in equilibrium in many situations, here we only approximate equilibrium values of internal states of OOMs (see below) rather than actual initial state vectors, because the latter depend on initial conditions of data generation and the former are more physically interesting for analysis of equilibrium dynamics.\nGiven parameters ofMeq in Theorem 1, the equilibrium value of the internal state is defined as\nω̄eq = lim t→∞\nωeqΞeq(O)t (14)\nif the limit exists, where Ξeq(O) = ∑ x∈O Ξeq(x).

Some OOM learning algorithms for equilibrium data [23] also calculate ω̂ based on (16), where feature functions φ1,φ2 and matrices F1,F2 are specifically constructed so that ω̂Ξ̂(O) = ω̂, ω̂σ̂ = 1 can be exactly satisfied even if the statistical noise is considered.

In the case of a real observation space O ⊂ Rd,M defines probability densities of paths of {xt} as in (1), and C1,3 (x) becomes a matrixvalued density function C1,3 (x) = 1dxE∞ [ 1xt∈dx · φ1(xt−L:t−1)φ2(xt+1:t+L)> ] with general feature functions φ1,φ2 on Rd, which is difficult to approximate for each x ∈ O. The existing continuous learning algorithms overcome this problem by using parametric methods [19, 8] or kernel embeddings [20], but none of them can achieve consistent estimation with a low computational complexity like discrete learning algorithms even for equilibrium data.\nHere we present a binless strategy to perform dynamical modeling with continuous and nonequilibrium data, which simply views each available observation as a discrete probability atom in the observation space and approximates C1,3 (x) by\nĈ1,3 (x) = 1\nN N∑ n=1 δs2n (x)φ1(~s 1 n)φ2(~s 3 n) > (19)\ninstead of (5).

Note the binless strategy can be applied to more general cases where observations are strings, graphs or other structured variables, and is very similar to that used in Monte Carlo integration or nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation [24]. Although we cannot use the binless OOM to evaluate path probability densities of {xt} as in (18), the equilibrium expectation of any observable gt = g (xt+1:t+r) of {xt} can be approximated as\nE∞ [gt] ≈ E [ gt|M̂ ] =\n∑ x1:r∈X r g (x1:r) ω̂Ŵz1 . . .Ŵzr σ̂ (20)\nBy adding a technical assumption, our previous result on consistency of nonequilibrium learning of OOMs can extended to the binless case as follows (see Appendix A.4 for proof): Assumption 4. The observation space O is a closed set in Rd and feature functions φ1,φ2 are bounded on OL. Theorem 3. Under Assumptions 1-4, the binless OOM provided by Algorithm 2 satisfies\nE [ g (x1:r) |M̂ ] p→ E∞ [g (xt+1:t+r)] (22)\n(i) for all continuous functions g : Or 7→ R.\n(ii) for all bounded and Borel measurable functions g : Or 7→ R, if there exist constants ξ̄ and ξ so that ‖Ξ (x)‖ ≤ ξ̄ and limt→∞ P (xt+1:t+r = z1:r) ≥ ξ for all x ∈ O and z1:r ∈ Or.\nNote that we do not assume the observed dynamics coincides with a parametric model defined by feature functions in Theorem 3. This theorem shows that binless OOMs allow us to consistently and efficiently extract equilibrium histograms, principle components, time-cross correlations, etc., of a dynamical systems from nonequilibrium data, which is important especially for thermodynamic and kinetic analysis in computational physics and chemistry. Remark 2. The computational complexity of (20) is O (Nr), which is unaffordable for large data sets if r > 1. In this paper, we focus on estimation of specific observables in the forms of E∞ [a (xt)] and E∞ [a (xt) b (xt+k)] by binless OOMs, which only require O (N) time. The efficient estimation of E∞ [g (xt+1:t+r)] for general g with is outside the scope of this paper and will be dealt with separately in another paper."

      "text" : "In this section, we evaluate our algorithms on two stochastic systems driven by Brownian dynamics and the molecular dynamics of alanine dipeptide, and compare them to several alternatives. The detailed settings of simulations and algorithms are provided in Appendix B.\nBrownian dynamics Fig. 2(a) shows the potential function of a one-dimensional diffusion process {xt} on [0, 2] driven by Brownian dynamics, where the state space is discretized into two clusters I, II. It is obvious that the equilibrium probability of finding xt in I is smaller than that of xt ∈ II, because the potential well contained in II is deeper than the other one. In this example, all simulations are performed by starting from a uniform distribution on [0, 0.2], which imples that simulations are highly nonequilibrium and it is difficult to accurately estimate the equilibrium probabilities ProbI = E∞ [1xt∈I] and ProbII = E∞ [1xt∈II] of I and II from the simulation data. We first utilize the traditional OOM learning, expectation–maximization based HMM learning and the proposed nonequilibrium learning algorithm of OOMs to estimate ProbI and ProbII by assuming that we only know which cluster the xt is in for each time t, i.e., the observation space O = {I, II}. Fig. 2(b) summarizes the estimation results with different simulation lengths. It can be seen that estimates given by the traditional OOM and the HMM are far away from true values even for the largest simulation length T = 1000. In addition, it is worth pointing out that estimates given by the traditional OOM are very similar to empirical means of 1xt∈I and 1xt∈II because the OOM learning algorithm is essentially a moment matching algorithm and the estimated moments cannot be corrected in the traditional learning algorithm. (See Fig. 2(c). Note that the empirical estimates of ProbI and ProbII are the same for discrete and continuous observations.) In contrast to previous methods, the nonequilibrium learning based OOM effectively reduce the statistical bias in the nonequilibrium data, and achieves statistically correct estimation at T = 300.\nFigs. 2(c) and 2(d) plot estimates of the equilibrium state distribution given by the empirical estimator, HMM and binless OOM using nonequilibrium learning under the condition that the value of xt is exactly known and O = [0, 2], where the empirical estimator calculates statistics through averaging over all observations. The observation model of the HMM is constructed based on 100 uniform bins on the state space, where samples within the same bin are assumed to be independent. With such a fine discretization, the performance of the HMM is improved, but estimation errors of the HMM for short trajectory lengths are still large. Here, the proposed binless OOM significantly outperform the other methods, and its estimates are very close to true values even for extremely small short trajectories.\nFig. 3 provides an example of applying binless OOMs to kinetic analysis. The goal of this experiment is to perform the time-structure based independent component (TIC) analysis [25] of a two-dimensional Brownian dynamics based on nonequilibrium observation data. Fig. 3(b) displays the estimation errors of the coefficient vector of the first TIC obtained from different learning models, which also demonstrates the superiority of the proposed binless OOM method.\nAlanine dipeptide Alanine dipeptide is a small molecule which consists of two alanine amino acid units, and its configuration can be described by two backbone dihedral angles. Fig. 4(a) shows the potential profile of the alanine dipeptide with respect to the two angles, which contains five metastable states. We perform multiple short molecular dynamics simulations starting from the metastable state IV, where each simulation length is 10ns, and utilizes different methods to approximate the stationary distribution of the five metastable states. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the proposed binless OOM yields lower estimation error compared to each of the alternatives."

According to Appendix A.1, the limit of Ĉ1,2 can be expressed as\nĈ1,2 p→ GωG>σ\nwhere Gω and Gσ have the same definitions as in Appendix A.1. So the limit of Ĉ1,2 has rank m. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky Theorem, Ĉtrun1,2 = UΣV\n> is the best rank m approximation to Ĉ1,2 and therefore\nĈtrun1,2 p→ GωG>σ\nLet\nGωG > σ = ŨΣ̃Ṽ >\nbe the SVD of GωG>σ ,\nF̃1 = Ũ, F̃2 = ṼΣ̃ −1\nandMeq = (ωeq, {Ξeq(x)}x∈O,σeq) be an OOM which is equivalent toM with\nωeq = ωG > σ F̃2 Ξeq(x) = ( G>σ F̃2 )−1 Ξ(x) ( G>σ F̃2 ) σeq = ( G>σ F̃2 )−1 σ\nWe can obtain from the Wedin Theorem and the continuity of singular values of matrice that\nmin R ∥∥∥UR− Ũ∥∥∥ = ∥∥∥UU>Ũ− Ũ∥∥∥ p→ 0 min R\n∥∥∥VR− Ṽ∥∥∥ = ∥∥∥VV>Ṽ − Ṽ∥∥∥ p→ 0 Σ p→ Σ̃\nTherefore, we can construct an OOMM′ = (ω′, {Ξ′(x)}x∈O,σ′) with ω′ = ω̂ ( ΣV>ṼΣ̃ −1) = ˆ̄φ>2 VV >ṼΣ̃ −1\nΞ′(x) = ( ΣV>ṼΣ̃ −1)−1 Ξ̂ (x) ( ΣV>ṼΣ̃ −1) = ( Ũ>UU>Ĉ1,2ṼΣ̃ −1)−1 Ũ>UU>Ĉ1,3 (x) VV >ṼΣ̃ −1\nσ′ = ( ΣV>ṼΣ̃ −1)−1 σ̂\n= ( Ũ>UU>Ĉ1,2VV >ṼΣ̃ −1)−1 Ũ>UU> ˆ̄φ1\nwhich is equivalent to M̂ and satisfies\nΞ′(x) p→ ( Ũ>GωG > σ ṼΣ̃ −1)−1 Ũ>GωΞ(x)G > σ ṼΣ̃ −1\n= Ξeq(x)\nσ′ p→ ( Ũ>GωG > σ ṼΣ̃ −1)−1 Ũ>Gωσ\n= σeq\nIt is worth pointing out that we can also show conclusions of Theorems 2 and 3 with (A.5) by using similar proofs. The details proofs are omitted because they are trivial.\nA.4 Proof of Theorem 2\nPart (1) We first show that there is an OOM M̄eq = (ω̄eq, {Ξeq(x)}x∈O,σeq) which can describe the equilibrium dynamics of {xt}, where Ξeq(x) and σeq are defined in (A.3). In the case of T = T0 and I →∞, we can obtain from Assumptions 2 and 3 that\nlim k→∞ GωΞ(O)kG>σ = lim k→∞\n1\nT0 − 2L T0−2L−1∑ t=0 E [ φ1 (xt+1:t+L)φ2 (xt+L+k+1:t+2L+k) > ]\n=\n( 1\nT0 − 2L T0−2L−1∑ t=0 E [φ1 (xt+1:t+L)]\n)( E∞ [ φ2 (xt+1:t+L) > ])\n= Gωσ ( E∞ [ φ2 (xt+1:t+L) > ])\n⇒ lim k→∞ Ξ(O)k = σω̄ (A.8)\nwith ω̄ = ( E∞ [ φ2 (xt+1:t+L) > ]) G+>σ (A.9)\nwhere Gω and Gσ are defined by (A.2) and (A.1), and G+σ denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of Gσ . Then\nlim t→∞ P (xt+1:t+l = z1:l) = lim t→∞ ωΞ(O)tΞ(z1:l)σ\n= ωΞ(O)σω̄Ξ(z1:l)σ = ω̄Ξ(z1:l)σ\n= ω̄eqΞeq(z1:l)σeq\nwith ω̄eq = ω̄G > σF2 (A.10)\nIn the case of T = T0 and I → ∞, because rank (Gω) = m for Gω defined by (A.4), there is a sufficiently large but finite T ′ so that rank (G′ω) = m with\nG′ω = ∑ z1:L φ1(z1:L)ωΞ (O) T ′ Ξ(z1:L)\nConsidering\nlim k→∞ G′ωΞ(O)kG>σ = lim k→∞\nE [ φ1 (xT ′+1:T ′+L)φ2 (xT ′+L+k+1:T ′+2L+k) > ]\n= G′ωσ ( E∞ [ φ2 (xt+1:t+L) > ])\n⇒ lim k→∞ Ξ(O)k = σω̄ (A.11)\nwith ω̄ defined by (A.9), we can also conclude that\nlim t→∞\nP (xt+1:t+l = z1:l) = ω̄eqΞeq(z1:l)σeq\nwith ω̄eq defined by (A.10).\nNote in both cases, ω̄eq satisfies ωeq limk→∞Ξ(O)k = ω̄eq and\nω̄eqΞeq(O) = lim t→∞ ωeqΞeq(O)t+1\n= ω̄eq ω̄eqσeq = ω̄eqΞeq(O)σeq\n= lim t→∞ ∑ x∈O P (xt = x) = 1\nPart (2) In this part, we show that\nwΞeq(O) = w, wσeq = 1\nhas a unique solution w = ω̄eq.\nAccording to Appendix A.1 and (A.8), (A.11), if wΞeq(O) = w and wσeq = 1, we have\nw = lim k→∞\nwΞeq(O)k\n= lim k→∞\nw ( G>σF2 )−1 Ξ(O)k ( G>σF2 ) = w ( G>σF2 )−1 σω̄ ( G>σF2\n) = wσeqω̄eq = ω̄eq\nPart (3) We now show Theorem 2.\nThe optimization problem (17) can be equivalently transformed into an unconstrained problem\nω̂ = min w ∥∥∥wprojΞ̂(O)−wproj∥∥∥2 + ∥∥wproj −w∥∥2 where\nwproj = w ( I− σ̂σ̂+ ) + σ̂+ (A.12)\ndenotes the projection of w on the space {w|wσ̂ = 1}, I denotes the identity matrix of appropriate dimension, and ω̄eq is the unique solution if Ξ̂(O) = Ξeq(O) and σ̂ = σeq according to the conclusion in Part (2). Then we can obtain that ω̂\np→ ω̄eq according to Theorem 2.7 in [1], which yields the conclusion of Theorem 2.\nPart (4) We derive in this part the closed-form solution to (17).\nSince the projection of w on the space {w|wσ̂ = 1} is wproj defined by(A.12), (17) can be equivalent transformed into\nmin w ∥∥∥w (I− σ̂σ̂+) (Ξ̂(O)− I)+ σ̂+ (Ξ̂(O)− I)∥∥∥2 The solution to this problem is\nw∗ = −σ̂+ ( Ξ̂(O)− I )(( I− σ̂σ̂+ ) ( Ξ̂(O)− I ))+ which provides the optimal value of ω̂ as\nω̂ = w∗ ( I− σ̂σ̂+ ) + σ̂+\n= σ̂+ − σ̂+ ( Ξ̂(O)− I )(( I− σ̂σ̂+ ) ( Ξ̂(O)− I ))+ ( I− σ̂σ̂+ ) (A.13)\nA.5 Proof of Theorem 3\nHere we only consider the consistency of the binless OOM as I → ∞. The proof can be easily to extended to the case of T → ∞. In addition, we denote E∞[g(xt+1:t+r)] and E[g(x1:r)|M̂] by E∞[g] and EM̂[g] for convenience of notation.\nPart (1) We first show that Theorem 3 holds for g (xt+1:t+r) = 1xt+1:t+r∈Bi1×Bi2×...×Bir , where B1, . . . ,BK is a partition of O, i1:r ∈ {1, . . . ,K}r, and 1e denotes the indicator function of event e. In this case, we can construct a discrete OOM with observation space {B1, . . . ,BK} by the nonequilibrium learning algorithm, which can provide the same estimate of E∞ [g (xt+1:t+r)] as M̂. Therefore, we can show EM̂[g] p→ E∞[g] by using the similar proof of Theorem 2.\nPart (2) We now consider the case that g is a continuous function. According to the Heine-Cantor theorem, g is also uniformly continuous. Then, for an abitrary > 0, we can construct a simple function\nĝ(xt+1:t+r) = ∑\ni1,...,ir\nci1i2...ir1xt+1:t+r∈Bi1×...×Bir\nso that |g(z1:r)− ĝ(z1:r)| ≤ , ∀z1:r ∈ Or\nwhere {B1, . . . ,BK} is a partition of O. Then, we have\n|E∞[g]− E∞[ĝ]| ≤ E∞[|g − ĝ|] ≤\nand ∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣ p→ 0 as I →∞ according to the conclusion of Part (1), where E∞[g] = E∞[g(xt+1:t+r)] and EM̂[g] = E[g(x1:r)|M̂]. It can be known from Assumption 4, there exists a constant ξ such that\n1maxx∈X‖Ξ̂(x)‖<ξ/|X | p→ 1 (A.14)\nUnder the condition that maxx∈X ∥∥∥Ξ̂(x)∥∥∥ < ξ/ |X |, we have\n∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ = ω̂0 ( ∑ z1:r∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) Ξ̂(z1:r) ) σ̂\n≤ ‖ω̂0‖ ‖σ̂‖ ( ∑ z1:r∈X r ξr |X |r ) = ‖ω̂0‖ ‖σ̂‖ ξr\nIn addition, considering that we can show as in Appendix A.1 that ω̂ p→ ω̄eq and σ̂ p→ σeq, we can obtain\n1‖ω̂‖‖σ̂‖≤ξ0 p→ 1 (A.15)\nand 1|EM̂[ĝ]−EM̂[g]|≤ξ0ξr p→ 1\nwhere ξ0 is a constant larger than ‖ω̄eq‖ · ‖σeq‖. Based on the above analysis and the fact that∣∣E∞[g]− EM̂[g]∣∣ = ∣∣E∞[g]− E∞[ĝ] + E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ] + EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣\n≤ |E∞[g]− E∞[ĝ]|+ ∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣+ ∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣\nwe can get Pr (∣∣E∞[g]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≤ (ξ0ξr + 2) ) ≥ Pr (|E∞[g]− E∞[ĝ]| ≤ , ∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣ ≤ ,∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≤ ξ0ξr )\n→ 1\nBecause this equation holds for all > 0, we can conclude that EM̂[g] p→ E∞[g].\nPart (3) In this part, we prove the conclusion of the theorem in the case where g is a Borel measurable function and bounded with |g(z1:r)| < ξg for all z1:r ∈ Or, and there exist constants ξ̄ and ξ so that ‖Ξ (x)‖ ≤ ξ̄ and limt→∞ P (xt+1:t+r = z1:r) ≥ ξ for all x ∈ O and z1:r ∈ Or.\nAccording to Theorem 2.2 in [2], for an arbitrary > 0, there is a continuous function ĝ′ satisfies E∞[1xt+1:t+r∈K (ĝ′)] < , where K (ĝ′) = {z1:r|z1:r ∈ Or, |ĝ′(z1:r)− g(z1:r)| > }. Define\nĝ(z1:r) = { ĝ′(z1:r), |ĝ′(z1:r)| ≤ ξg −ξg, ĝ′(z1:r) < −ξg ξg, ĝ ′(z1:r) > ξg\nIt can be seen that ĝ is a continuous function which is also satisfies E∞[1xt+1:t+r∈K (ĝ)] < and bounded with |ĝ(z1:r)| < ξg . So the difference between E∞[g] and E∞[ĝ] satisfies\n|E∞[g]− E∞[ĝ]| ≤ E∞ [|g(xt+1:t+r)− ĝ(xt+1:t+r)|] = E∞[1xt+1:t+r∈K (ĝ)]E∞ [|g(xt+1:t+r)− ĝ(xt+1:t+r)| |xt+1:t+r ∈ K (ĝ)]\n+E∞[1xt+1:t+r /∈K (ĝ)]E∞ [|g(xt+1:t+r)− ĝ(xt+1:t+r)| |xt+1:t+r /∈ K (ĝ)] ≤ · 2ξg + = (2ξg + 1)\nFor the difference between E∞[ĝ] and EM̂[ĝ], we can obtain from the above that ∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣ p→ 0 as I →∞ by considering that ĝ is continuous, which implies that there is an I0 such that\nPr (∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣ > ) < , ∀I > I0\nNext, let us consider the value of ∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣. Note that∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≤ ‖ω̂0‖ ‖σ̂‖ ∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ z1:n∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) Ξ̂(z1:r)\n∥∥∥∥∥ < ξ0ξ r\n|X |r ∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ z1:r∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) ∣∣∣∣∣ under the condition that\n∥∥∥Ξ̂(x)∥∥∥ < ξ/ |X | and ‖ω̂‖ ‖σ̂‖ ≤ ξ0. Therefore, there exists an I1 such that Pr\n(∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≥ ξ0ξr|X |r ∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ z1:r∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) ∣∣∣∣∣ ) < , ∀I > I1 (A.16)\ndue to (A.14) and (A.15). Let x′1:r denotes a random sample taken uniformly from X r. We can obtain that\nP (x′1:r) = P (x′1) . . .P (x′r) ≤ ( ‖ω‖ ‖σ‖ ξO ξ̄ )r where ξO ≥\n∥∥∥Ξ (O)k∥∥∥ for any k ≥ 0. Note ξO <∞ because we can show the existing of the limit of { ∥∥∥Ξ (O)0∥∥∥ ,∥∥∥Ξ (O)1∥∥∥ , . . .} by similar steps in Appendix A.4. Thus\nE\n[ 1\n|X |r ∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ z1:r∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) ∣∣∣∣∣ ] ≤ E [E [|ĝ(x′1:r)− g(x′1:r)| |X ]]\n= E [|ĝ(x′1:r)− g(x′1:r)|] = E [ 1x′1:r∈K (ĝ) ] E [|ĝ(x′1:r)− g(x′1:r)| |x′1:r ∈ K (ĝ)]\n+E [ 1x′1:r /∈K (ĝ) ] E [|ĝ(x′1:r)− g(x′1:r)| |x′1:r /∈ K (ĝ)]\n≤ ξµ · 2ξg + = (2ξgξµ + 1) where ξµ = ( ‖ω‖ ‖σ‖ ξO ξ̄ )r /ξ. By the Markov’s inequality, we have\nPr\n[ 1\n|X |r ∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ z1:r∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≥ √ ] ≤ (2ξgξµ + 1) √ (A.17)\nCombining (A.16) and (A.17) leads to\nPr (∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≥ ξ0ξr√ ) ≤ Pr (∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≥ ξ0ξr|X |r ∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ z1:r∈Xr (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) ∣∣∣∣∣ )\n+ Pr\n( 1\n|X |r ∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ z1:r∈X r (ĝ(z1:r)− g(z1:r)) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≥ √ )\n≤ + (2ξgξµ + 1) √\nfor all I > I1. From all the above, we have Pr (∣∣E∞[g]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≤ 2(ξg + 1) + ξ0ξr√ ) ≥ Pr\n(∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣ ≤ , ∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ ≤ ξ0ξr√ ) ≥ 1− Pr\n(∣∣E∞[ĝ]− EM̂[ĝ]∣∣ > )− Pr (∣∣EM̂[ĝ]− EM̂[g]∣∣ > ξ0ξr√ ) ≥ 1− 2 − (2ξgξµ + 1) √\nfor all I > max{I0, I1}, which yields EM̂[g] p→ E∞[g] due to the arbitrariness of ."
