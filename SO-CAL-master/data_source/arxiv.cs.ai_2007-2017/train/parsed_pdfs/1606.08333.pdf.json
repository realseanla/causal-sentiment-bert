      "text" : "Pang Juan was an ancient Chinese military general of the Wei state during the Warring States period. Both he and Sun Bin studied under the tutelage of the hermit Guiguzi, but later led the opposing armies of two countries (resp.) Wei and Qi at war. Ambushed by Qi, the Wei army suffered a crushing defeat and Pang Juan committed suicide. In traditional folklore, Sun Bin carved the words “Pang Juan dies under this tree” on a tree at the ambush area. When Pang and his men arrived, he saw that there were carvings on the tree so he lit a torch for a closer look. At that moment, the Qi troops lying in ambush attacked and Pang Juan committed suicide under that very tree.

Corresponding author. 1True Lies is a 1994 James Cameron movie featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis. It\nis among the very first imported Hollywood movies in China.\nThe Pang Juan example demonstrates that the announcement of something false may make it true. (A detailed analysis will be given later.) This is reminiscent of the logic of truthful public announcements, wherein the announcement of something true may make it false. The archetypical example is the announcement of p ∧ ¬✷p, for example when you are being told: “You do not know that Pang Juan died in 342 BC.” To get p ∧ ¬✷p we have to read this sentence as its implicature “Pang Juan died in 342 BC and you do not know that.” This phenomenon may even be called the reason that this logic exists, that it is considered interesting, and various puzzles build upon the phenomenon. But in truthful public announcement logic we cannot announce something false thus making it true. The announced formulas are supposed to be true. In an alternative semantics for public announcement logic, that of conscious update (Gerbrandy and Groeneveld, 1997), and that is also known as believed (public) announcement logic, the announcement of a formula is independent of its truth. In that logic, we can call an announcement a lie if the announced formula is false. A true lie is then the announcement of something false that makes it true.\nThis analysis of a lie is not entirely according to the traditional view of agents lying to each other: you are lying to me if you believe ¬ϕ but you say to me that ϕ with the intention to make me believe that ϕ.2 If we model the realization of this intention (namely that indeed I believe you), and incorporate all belief aspects, we get ✷a¬ϕ→ [✷aϕ]✷b✷aϕ (where agent a lies to agent b). Abstracting from all belief aspects gives us ¬ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ. Although the former is more precise, it is not uncommon, if not customary, to abstract from the source and the justification of the lie so that we get ¬ϕ → [ϕ]✷bϕ, from where it is not a big step to ¬ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ, the main focus of our investigation. (In order to make this identification, we can think of agent b as the special agent who is able to distinguish all states, for whom it holds that ✷bϕ ↔ ϕ.) This simplied schema ¬ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ is clearly in opposition to the schema ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ for the so-called successful formulas. (In truthful public announcement logic the successful formulas are those for which [ϕ]ϕ is valid. In that logic [ϕ]ϕ is equivalent to ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ. But in believed public announcement logic, where announcements are independent of the truth of the announced formula, [ϕ]ϕ is not equivalent to ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ.) In this work we mainly investigate true lies, successful formulas, and yet other notions in believed announcement logic, and also the iteration of such announcements.\nWe also present results in this work that are not for believed announcement logic, but that are still related to iterated announcements, or to lying.\nIn the logic of believed public announcements, interpreted on KD45 models encoding belief, the announced formula can be false and true before the announcement and can also be false and true after the announcement; and even beyond that, when iterating that same announcement, this value can change in arbitrary ways after each next announcement. In\n2This analysis of lying goes back to Augustine (1988). Lying has been a thriving topic in the philosophical community since then (Siegler, 1966; Bok, 1978; Mahon, 2006, 2008). More recent modal logical analyses that can be seen as a continuation of this philosophical tradition include Baltag (2002); Steiner (2006); Kooi and Renne (2011); van Ditmarsch et al. (2012); Sakama (2011); Liu and Wang (2013); van Ditmarsch (2014). In modal logics with only belief operators the intentional aspect of lying is not modelled.\nthe logic of truthful public announcements, interpreted on S5 models encoding knowledge, lying is not possible. But it can still be that formulas other than the announcement keep changing their value when iterating a given announcement, in ways otherwise very similar to the results for belief.\nIn the Pang Juan example (as we will explain later) it can be argued that the action involved is not so much an announcement but an assignment. Assignments model that propositional variables change their value (it is also known as ontic change): the proposition “Pang Juan dies under this tree” was false, and afterwards it is true: factual change. We present a scenario involving lying wherein private (i.e., non-public) announcements and private assignments both play a role: two friends hesitating to go to a party are both being lied to that the other one is going to the party, subsequent to which they both change their minds (factual change) and go to the party.\nWe now give an overview of our results and of the contents of our paper. Section 2 recalls the logic of believed announcements, and the subsequent Section 3 introduces all novel terminology to put our results in perspective, and also gives an overview of our results. These results are then developped in detail in the remaining sections. In Section 4 we present results on successful formulas, true lies, self-refuting formulas, and (so-called) impossible lies (that remain false even after announcement). In Section 5 we elaborate on the result that there are models and announcements such that by iterating that announcement in the model we can change its value arbitrarily often and in arbitrarily chosen ways. In Section 6 we syntactically characterize the single-agent true lies, i.e., formulas that satisfy ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ. In Section 7 we discuss iteration of truthful public announcements on models encoding knowledge, and in Section 8 the interaction of private announcements and private assignments, by way of the above-mentioned example of two friends going to party. Section 9 presents an integration of our different results in view of future research."

      "text" : "We recall the modelling of lying and truthtelling (after (van Ditmarsch et al., 2012)) in believed (public) announcement logic, also known as ‘arrow elimination’ (not necessarily truthful) public announcement logic (Gerbrandy and Groeneveld, 1997), which is a lesser known alternative for the better known ‘state elimination’ (truthful) public announcement logic (Plaza, 1989; Baltag et al., 1998). Its language, structures, and semantics are as follows. Given are a finite set of agents A and a countable set of propositional variables P (let a ∈ A and p ∈ P ).\nDefinition 1 (Language)\nL ∋ ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | (ϕ ∧ ϕ) | ✷aϕ | [ϕ]ϕ ⊣\nOther propositional connectives are defined by abbreviation. For ✷aϕ, read ‘agent a believes formula ϕ’. If there is a single agent only, we may omit the index and write ✷ϕ instead. Agent variables are a, b, c, . . . . For [ϕ]ψ, read ‘after public announcement of ϕ,\nψ’. If ✷a¬ϕ, we say that ϕ is unbelievable (for a) and, consequently, if ¬✷a¬ϕ, for which we write ✸aϕ, we say that ϕ is believable (for a). This is also read as ‘agent a considers it possible that ϕ’. Shared belief ✷Aϕ (everybody believes that ϕ) is defined as ∧\na∈A ✷aϕ. We say that ϕ is believable iff all agents consider ϕ believable, i.e., ∧\na∈A ✸aϕ, for which we write ✸Aϕ (however, this is not the dual of ✷Aϕ: we may have that ¬✷A¬ϕ but not ✸Aϕ). Believability plays an important role in our setting.\nDefinition 2 (Structures) An epistemic model M = (S,R, V ) consists of a domain S of states (or ‘worlds’), an accessibility function R : A → P(S × S), where each R(a), for which we write Ra, is an accessibility relation, and a valuation V : P → P(S), where each V (p) represents the set of states where p is true. For s ∈ S, (M, s) is an epistemic state.⊣\nAn epistemic state is also known as a pointed Kripke model. We often omit the parentheses in (M, s). Without any restrictions we call the model class K. The class of models where all accessibility relations are transitive and euclidean is called K45, and if they are also serial it is called KD45 (this class is the main focus of our investigations, because it encodes agents with consistent beliefs). The class of models where all accessibility relations are equivalence relations is S5. Class KD45 is said to have the properties of belief, and S5 to have the properties of knowledge.\nDefinition 3 (Semantics) Assume an epistemic model M = (S,R, V ).\nM, s |= p iff s ∈ Vp M, s |= ¬ϕ iff M, s 6|= ϕ M, s |= ϕ ∧ ψ iff M, s |= ϕ and M, s |= ψ M, s |= ✷aϕ iff for all t ∈ S : Ra(s, t) implies M, t |= ϕ M, s |= [ϕ]ψ iff M |ϕ, s |= ψ\nwhere epistemic model M |ϕ = (S,Rϕ, V ) is as M except that for all a ∈ A, Rϕa := Ra ∩ (S × [[ϕ]]M ) (and where [[ϕ]]M := {s ∈ S |M, s |= ϕ}). ⊣\nIn our semantics, [ϕ]✷aψ means that, regardless of the truth of ϕ, agent a believes ψ after public announcement of ϕ. In particular, [p]✷ap is valid: after the announcement of a propositional variable, the agent believes that it is true; regardless of the value of that variable. This is why it is called believed (public) announcement of ϕ, in contrast to the truthful (public) announcement of ϕ (Plaza, 1989), wherein we restrict the model to the subdomain of all states where ϕ is true (see Appendix A). As said, believed announcement logic originates with Gerbrandy and Groeneveld (1997), where it is called the logic of conscious updates. In believed announcement logic new information is accepted by the agents independent from the truth of that information. In truthful announcement logic new information is only incorporated if it is true.\nIt should be noted that in believed announcement logic announcements can be truthful (namely when true) and lying (namely when false), whereas in truthful announcement logic announcements can only be truthful. In van Ditmarsch et al. (2012) the believed public\nannouncement of ϕ is modelled as non-deterministic choice between such truthful and lying public announcement of ϕ, so that ‘after truthful announcement of ϕ, ψ’ corresponds to ϕ→ [ϕ]ψ, and ‘after lying announcement of ϕ, ψ’ (after the lie that ϕ, ψ) corresponds to ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ψ.\nThe announcing agent is not modelled in announcement logics, but only the effect of its announcements on the audience, the set of all agents. The interaction between announcement and belief can be formalized as [ϕ]✷aψ ↔ ✷a(ϕ→ [ϕ]ψ) (Gerbrandy and Groeneveld, 1997).\nBelieved and truthful announcement are therefore closely related. And even in a technical sense: whenever a believed announcement is true, the semantics delivers results that are indistinguishable in the logics. This is because on any epistemic model, the model restriction semantics and the arrow restriction semantics result in bisimilar models, on the part of the model wherein the announcement is true. Investigations of these correspondences are made in Kooi (2007) and van Ditmarsch et al. (2012)."

      "text" : "Let p be the proposition ‘Pang Juan dies under this tree’ (Chinese does not have a future tense). As a consequence of Pang Juan observing ‘Pang Juan dies under this tree’, he dies under this tree. The logic of public announcements is a logic of public observations, and observing written text is the typical action that has a straightforward formalization in logic: it corresponds to the announcement of the proposition representing that text. We could imagine Pang Juan being uncertain if he would die under this tree (¬✷p ∧ ¬✷¬p), such that observing p removes this uncertainty.\nStill, this analysis is unsatisfactory: If the written text had been ‘Pang Juan does not die under this tree’, i.e., ¬p, he would still have died. If the written text had been ‘The moon is made of green cheese’, i.e., the announcement of some unrelated proposition q, he would still have died. Even if there had nothing been written on that tree (it wasn’t carvings, but merely a gnarled old tree trunk), i.e., the announcement of the trivial proposition ⊤, he would still have died. It was giving away his position by lighting the torch that caused his death, irrespective of what was written on the tree. Therefore the scenario cannot be modelled as initial uncertainty that is reduced by an informative action: it does not fit the schema ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ.\nAlternatively, with some justification it can be said that p is false before the observation of p but after the observation of p, p is true. Changing the value of a variable is factual/ontic change. It could then be a lying public announcement of p (observing p while p is false) linked to a public assignment changing the value of p into true. However, this analysis has the same shortcomings as the previous one: what is observed does not matter. Also, Pang Juan can hardly be seen as enacting his own death. The actors are the soldiers of his enemy Sun Bin. Of course we can see the visual observation (informative) and the\nsubsequent death (ontic) as two distinct, but related, actions. Indeed van Emde Boas and van Emde Boas Lubsen (2016) argue that this action is neither epistemic (informative) nor performative (factual).\nIn the True Lies movie Jamie Lee Curtis (unsuccessfully) plays the role of a timid slovenly housewife, who starts enacting the lie that she is a spy in order to make her husband jealous and thus seduce him. As Arnold Schwarzenegger really is a spy, because of her enactment she also really becomes a spy (and incidentally also a sparkling, extrovert, and well-dressed woman, a role that fits her rather well). This story of gradual and (exclusively) factual change also does not fit a logic of exclusively informational change. However, this factual changes interacts with belief (informative) change.\nIn Section 8 we will see that the combination of (private) informational and (private) factual change after all makes for a pretty good but different kind of true lie. With that background we will, in Section 9, review once more the Pang Juan and the Arnold Schwarzenegger examples. In the current section (and the subsequent three sections, altogether the core of our contribution) we focus exclusively on true lies as informational change, i.e., ϕ is a true lie iff ¬ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ is valid in the logic of believed announcements. Also relevant is the satisfiability of ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ. These different perspectives are, of course, related, and we will now proceed to explain how. (In Section 3.2 they are properly defined as special cases of a more general setup.)\nConsider the formula ϕ = p ∧ ✷p and the model M consisting of two states s and t wherein a proposition p is false and true, respectively, and that are indistinguishable for the agent. We then have that M, t |= ¬(p ∧ ✷p) whereas M |(p ∧ ✷p), t |= p ∧ ✷p so that\nM, t |= ¬(p ∧ ✷p) → [p ∧✷p](p ∧✷p).\nTherefore, the formula p ∧ ✷p is a true lie in state t of the model. On the other hand, although M, s |= ¬(p ∧ ✷p), we have that M |(p ∧ ✷p), s 6|= p ∧ ✷p for the simple reason that p is false in s. So\nM, s 6|= ¬(p ∧✷p) → [p ∧✷p](p ∧ ✷p).\nWe illustrate both transitions below:\n¬p p\ns t p∧✷p⇒\n¬p p\ns t\nFor another example, note that\nM |(p ∧ ✷p), t |= ¬(p ∧ ✷p) → [p ∧ ✷p](p ∧ ✷p)\nfor the simple reason that M |(p ∧ ✷p), t 6|= ¬(p ∧ ✷p). This seems somewhat undesirable: you do not want the implication to be true because the antecedent is false. In a given\nmodel (N, u) you only want to call ϕ a true lie if N, u |= ¬ϕ but N, u |= [ϕ]ϕ, in other words, if N, u |= ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ.\nThe formula p ∧ ✷p is sometimes a true lie and sometimes not. Of additional interest are the formulas that are always true lies, i.e., formulas ϕ such that ¬ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ is valid. Consider model class K45. We show that ✷p and p∨✷p are true lies. However, the latter is more interesting than the former.\nLet us first show that ✷p is a true lie. Consider an epistemic state (M, s), where M = (S,R, V ), and such that M, s |= ¬✷p. Then there is a state t with (s, t) ∈ R and such that M, t |= ¬p. Now consider the believed announcement update ✷p. Let u be any state with (s, u) ∈ R. In a K45 model M |✷p with accessibility relation R✷p we have that (s, u) 6∈ R✷p, because from (s, t) ∈ R and (s, u) ∈ R follows (euclidicity) (u, t) ∈ R and thus M,u |= ¬✷p, so (s, u) 6∈ R✷p. In M |✷p no state is accessible from s. Thus, M |✷p, s |= ✷p and therefore M, s |= ¬✷p→ [✷p]✷p.\nIf the ✷ modality represents belief, this is not a very interesting form of lying, as in the resulting model the agent’s beliefs are inconsistent: M |✷p, s |= ✷p but also M |✷p, s |= ✷¬p. Differently said, as the agent did not believe ✷p, she does not consider it possible that the lie ✷p is the truth. More interesting are what we will call the believable true lies that we associate with the validity of (¬ϕ ∧✸ϕ) → [ϕ]ϕ and with the satisfiability of (¬ϕ∧✸ϕ)∧[ϕ]ϕ (and with the model class KD45 — believable true lies preserve consistent beliefs). Formula ✷p is not believable in the last sense, as ¬✷p ∧✸✷p implies (in KD45) that ¬✷p and ✷p are both true, which is inconsistent.\nWe now show that p ∨ ✷p is a true lie. Consider a K45 epistemic state (M, s), where M = (S,R, V ), and such that M, s |= ¬p ∧ ¬✷p. Again, because M, s |= ¬p ∧ ¬✷p and because M is a K45 model, none of the accessible states satisfy ✷p. But of course, some may satisfy p. Therefore, M |(p ∨ ✷p), s |= ✷p and thus M |(p ∨ ✷p), s |= p ∨ ✷p. Formula p∨✷p is therefore also a believable true lie, and even in the non-trivial sense that ¬(p ∨ ✷p) ∧✸(p ∨ ✷p) ∧ [p ∨ ✷p](p ∨ ✷p) is satisfiable (namely when there are accessible p worlds as well from s in M). If p ∨✷p is believable, this lie will preserve seriality in the updated model (as there must be an accessible p state), and therefore preserves KD45.\nWe illustrate the difference between these two true lies on the same model as above. (We recall that p ∧ ✷p is not a true lie in both states of the model, but only in state t.)\n¬p p\ns t ✷p⇒\n¬p p\ns t\n¬p p p∨✷p ⇒\n¬p p\nIn this work we wish to investigate in depth which formulas may be true lies on a given model, and which formulas may be true lies on any model, and for which classes of\nmodels. In addition to true lies that become true after lying announcements, there are the successful formulas that remain true after truthful announcements, and we can consider two other options: self-refuting formulas that become false after truthful announcements, and what one might call ‘impossible lies’ that remain false after lying announcements. We will therefore take a more general perspective: what formulas may change their value or keep their value after their announcement, how does this depend on whether they were true or false before the announcement, and what happens when we iterate these announcements? We now first introduce terminology to address these matters."

Believable σ-satisfiable and believable σ-valid for infinite strings are also analogously defined as above.

If ϕ is σ-valid then it is also believable σ-valid, as the former implies the latter (the condition in the implication is stronger). However, if ϕ is non-trivially σ-valid then it may not be non-trivially believable σ-valid, and vice versa.\nFor strings σ of length 2 we use corresponding English terminology that reflects common usage in the literature.\nσ name σ-valid σ-satisfiable 10 self-refuting |= ϕ→ [ϕ]¬ϕ ∃(M, s) : (M, s) |= ϕ ∧ [ϕ]¬ϕ 01 true lie |= ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ ∃(M, s) : (M, s) |= ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ 11 successful |= ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ ∃(M, s) : (M, s) |= ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ 00 impossible lie |= ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]¬ϕ ∃(M, s) : (M, s) |= ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]¬ϕ\nIt is also common to refer to a formula that is 11-satisfiable in a given model (M, s) as a successful update, and to a formula that is not, as an unsuccessful update, etc. The successful formulas are the most well-known from the literature, and have been investigated on the class of S5 models (van Ditmarsch and Kooi, 2006; Holliday and Icard, 2010). The archetypical unsuccessful update and even self-refuting formula in that setting is p ∧ ¬✷p (Moore, 1942; Hintikka, 1962; Holliday and Icard, 2010).\nIt is easy to come up with σ-satisfiable formulas for any finite string σ. But it is even easier to see finite strings as prefixes of infinite strings, and to show that infinite σ are always satisfiable. For infinite σ, in view of iterated relativization (Miller and Moss, 2005; Sadzik, 2006), formulas that can be announced arbitrarily often in a given model without stabilizing to the value of the announcement formula or its negation have our special attention.

In the continuation we will see that there are σ-satisfiable formulas for any σ ∈ {0, 1}ω (this includes the unstable σs), whereas for σ-validity we only need to consider finite strings (this does not imply stability in a particular model, but recurrence of a finite pattern)."

      "text" : "In this section we present results and conjectures for σ-satisfiable and σ-valid formulas, with respect to the classes K and KD45. We wish to encourage the reader to obtain\nfurther results. We start with two rather obvious observations. Let σ be a finite or infinite {0, 1} string:\n• If ϕ is σ-satisfiable and τ is a prefix of σ, then ϕ is τ -satisfiable; and if ϕ is σ-valid and τ is a prefix of σ, then ϕ is τ -valid.\n• If ϕ is believable σ-satisfiable on class KD45 in (M, s), then for all m < |σ|, M |ϕm ∈ KD45.\nWe now start with results for σ-satisfiability and continue with results for σ-validity. Various results are accompanied by lengthy proofs and drawn-out examples which are found in separate sections.\nProposition 7 Let σ ∈ {0, 1}ω. Then there are σ-satisfiable formulas on class K. ⊣\nProof See Section 5.1. We provide a single formula, namely ¬✷⊥ ∧ ((✸✷⊥∧✸¬✷⊥) → ✸(p∧✷⊥)), and a single frame F (a frame is a model without the valuation, i.e., a pair pair (S,R)) with designated state s ∈ S such that for any σ ∈ {0, 1}ω, by properly choosing the valuation V on F , we can establish that ¬✷⊥ ∧ ((✸✷⊥ ∧ ✸¬✷⊥) → ✸(p ∧ ✷⊥)) is σ-satisfiable in ((F, V ), s). The root s is infinitely branching.\nProposition 8 Let σ ∈ {0, 1}ω. Then there are believable σ-satisfiable formulas on class KD45. ⊣\nProof See Section 5.3. The result is obtained by adapting the formula and model used in Proposition 7. This is according to fairly standard method to transform a model with a directed single-agent accessibility relation into a model with two undirected accessibility relations for different agents. (The method has been used for multi-S5 models but not for multi-KD45 models, to our knowledge.)\nWe continue with results on σ-validity. Our special interest have non-trivial σ-valid formulas and non-trivial believable σ-valid formulas. (We recall that ‘non-trivial’ means that they are also σ-satisfiable.)\nFirst, a negative and a positive result for single updates.\nProposition 9 There are no non-trivial 01-valid formulas on class K. ⊣\nProof If ϕ is a trivial 01-valid formula then ϕ is equivalent to ⊤. Let us therefore assume that ¬ϕ is satisfiable.\nSuppose towards contradiction that such a non-trivial true lie exists. Call it ϕ. Then ¬ϕ is satisfiable on a model. Without loss of generality suppose it is a tree, with the root of the tree as the designated state.\nNow consider a singleton model with an empty accessibility relation, i.e., a dead end. Call it (M, s). If (M, s) satisfies ¬ϕ then ϕ cannot be a true lie, since the announcement of ϕ does not change the model (the accessibility relation is already empty). Therefore (M, s) satisfies ϕ.\nNow consider any model (N, t) such that t only has successors that are dead ends. Using the above result for singletons we know that those successors also satisfy ϕ. Now if (N, t) were to satisfy ¬ϕ, then ϕ is not a true lie since the announcement of ϕ would not change the model either: all successors are ϕ states. Therefore (N, t) has to satisfy ϕ.\nContinuing this reasoning, it will be clear that ϕ must be satisfied in all finite-depth trees. Therefore, if a non-trivial true lie exists, it can only be satisfiable on an infinite-depth tree.\nLet (M, s) be an infinite-depth tree such that (M, s) satisfies ¬ϕ and [ϕ]ϕ. The formula ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ is equivalent to an announcement-free formula ψ (the logic of believed announcement is equally expressive as the base modal logic, via a rewriting system). Let d be the modal depth of ψ.\nFor d′ > d, let (N, t) be a finite-depth tree that is d′-bisimilar to (M, s) (we refer to Blackburn et al. (2001) for this notion). Then for all formulas η of modal depth at most d′, (M, s) |= η iff (N, t) |= η. Therefore, as (M, s) |= ψ and the modal depth of ψ is d < d′, also (N, t) |= ψ, i.e., (N, t) |= ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ. This contradicts that finite-depth trees cannot satisfy true lies as already obtained above.\nAs neither finite-depth nor infinite-depth trees may satisfy ¬ϕ, no tree satisfies ¬ϕ and thus no pointed model. Therefore non-trivial true lies do not exist on class K.\nProposition 10 Let σ ∈ {0, 1}2. Then there are non-trivial σ-valid formulas and nontrivial believable σ-valid formulas on class KD45. ⊣\nProof See Section 4. The section also gives references for the origin of the corresponding English terminology, in the context of validity and satisfiability.\nWe recall that a believable true lie is a believable 01-valid formula. The following result is a syntactical characterization of this semantic notion, on the KD45 models. The term ‘disjunctive lying form’ is defined syntactically in Section 6.\nProposition 11 (Characterization of believable true lies) A formula is a believable true lie iff it is not equivalent to a disjunctive lying form. ⊣\nProof See Section 6. The proof closely follows the proof of the syntactic characterization of successful formulas in Holliday and Icard (2010).\nThere are successful formulas that are not true lies, such as booleans. Clearly |= p→ [p]p, whereas 6|= ¬p → [p]p. There are also successful formulas that are true lies, such as ¬✷p and (in the universal fragment:) p ∨ ✷p. At some stage we conjectured that all true lies are successful formulas. But this is not the case.\nProposition 12 (Some true lies are not successful formulas) On class K45 (KD45), some 01-valid formulas are not 11-valid. ⊣\nProof Let ϕ = ✷⊥∨ (p∧✸p∧✸¬p)∨ (¬p∧✸p∧✷p). We show that on K45 ϕ is 01-valid but not 11-valid.\nDue to transitivity and euclidicity, a pointed K45 model consists of a designated point possibly pointing at a cluster of indistinguishable points. The formula ϕ actually specifies its K45 models modulo bisimilarity. We list all eight K45 pointed models (modulo bisimilarity) for one variable p, where we distinguish those where ϕ is true from those where ϕ is false, and we also give the result of the ϕ update. The underlined state is the designated state.\n— ϕ is true at these four models:\na : ¬p p b : ¬p p c : ¬p p d : ¬p p\n— annoucing ϕ in those models delivers:\na′ : ¬p p b′ : ¬p p c′ : ¬p p d′ : ¬p p\n— ϕ is false at these four models:\ne : ¬p p f : ¬p p g : ¬p p h : ¬p p\n— announcing ϕ in those models delivers:\ne′ : ¬p p f ′ : ¬p p g′ : ¬p p h′ : ¬p p\nModels e′, f ′, g′, h′ are bisimilar to a, b, d, a respectively, thus ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ holds on e, f, g, h, i.e., ϕ is 01-valid. However, c′ is bisimilar to e thus ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ is false at model c, i.e., ϕ is not 11-valid.\nWe not only have that ϕ is 01-valid but not 11-valid on K45 but also that ϕ is 01-valid (obvious) but not 11-valid (not obvious: the transition between c and c′ is between KD45 models) on KD45. The reader may further observe that ϕ is also non-trivially believable 01-valid (the transition from g to g′ is between KD45 models).\nA natural question to ask is whether for all σ ∈ {0, 1}∗ ∪ {0, 1}ω there are (non-trivial) σ-valid formulas. The answer is (un)fortunately negative. For example, there are no (non-trivial) 001-valid formulas. We recall that 001-valid means ¬ϕ → [ϕ](¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ). Let (M, s) be such that M, s 2 ϕ. Then M,w [ϕ](¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ), i.e., M |ϕ, s ¬ϕ and M |ϕ, s |= [ϕ]ϕ. From the latter we get M |ϕ|ϕ, s |= ϕ. However, as ¬ϕ→ [ϕ](¬ϕ∧ [ϕ]ϕ) is valid it also holds on (M |ϕ, s), so that M |ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ → [ϕ](¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ), and in particular M |ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]¬ϕ, so that, as M |ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ, we have M |ϕ|ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ . Contradiction.\nWe already observed above that if σ is a prefix of τ and a formula is τ -valid then it is also σ-valid. In the other direction this is very obviously false, for example there are impossible lies (such as ¬✷p, i.e., 00-valid formulas). But we saw in the previous paragraph that there are no 001-valid formulas. However, sometimes, if σ is a prefix of τ and a formula is σ-valid, then it is also τ -valid.\nGiven σ ∈ {0, 1}ω and prefix τ of σ, then σ and τ (and τ and σ) are completion equivalent iff for all intermediate strings τ ′ (for all prefixes τ ′ of σ such that τ is a prefix of τ ′), a formula is σ-valid iff it is τ ′-valid. This relation is clearly an equivalence relation. The shortest sequence of a completion equivalence class is the representative and the longest (possibly infinite) sequence of this class is the completion.\nConjecture 13 The following completion equivalence classes of σ-valid formulas are all non-empty and all different, and there are no other classes.\n01k (k > 0) 10k (k > 0) 01k0 (k ≥ 0) 10k1 (k ≥ 0) ⊣\nIf σ = 01k0 (for k ≥ 0), then τ = 0(1k0)ω is its completion; and similarly if σ = 10k1 (for k ≥ 0), then τ = 1(0k1)ω is its completion. For example, the 11-valid formulas are also 111-valid, or 1111-valid, or 111 . . . -valid: they are all completion equivalent; 111 . . . is the completion of this class and 11 is its representative. On the other hand, σs of shape 01k and 10k (for k > 0) may have no infinite completions and be already maximal.\nThere are 011-validities on K45. A true lie p∨✷p is an example. We recall that a true lie is by definition a 01-validity. But formula p∨✷p is also 011-valid, because if announced when false, it results in a K45 model satisfying ✷p and such that further updates have no informative effect. Therefore, it is also 0111-valid, and . . . and 01ω-valid. Similarly, a believable true lie p ∨ ✷p is an example of a 011-validity on KD45. As it is believable, this guarantees the existence of an accessible p state. That state will be preserved after the p ∨ ✷p update, and thus the resulting model is serial. More interesting would be a 011-validity that is not a 0111-validity. For another example, from Proposition 9 follows that there are no 01k-validities on class K. But we have not investigated systematically which of the conjectured σ-valid types are non-empty and for which classes of models."

      "text" : "In this section we restrict ourselves to validities on class KD45 (or S5, included in KD45).\nSuccessful formulas\n|= ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ\nA successful update in some given model is a 11-satisfiable formula (in that model). We then call a formula ‘successful’ if it is always a successful update, i.e., if it is not merely 11-satisfiable but 11-valid. The typical example of a successful update is ‘no child\nsteps forward’ in the muddy children problem (Moses et al., 1986; van Ditmarsch and Kooi, 2015). Given k muddy children out of n children, this is a succesful update for the first k−2 times that father makes his request to step forward if you know whether you are muddy, and only an unsuccessful update the (k − 1)th time, as the kth time that the request is made, the muddy children step forward. The formula in question, for the example of three muddy children, is ¬(✷ama ∨✷a¬ma)∧¬(✷bmb ∨✷b¬mb)∧¬(✷cmc ∨✷c¬mc) (where mi stands for “child i is muddy”). However, the archetypical unsuccessful update is p ∧ ¬✷p (Moore, 1942; Hintikka, 1962). The original 1940s setting is the incoherence of a person saying “I went to the pictures [movies] last Tuesday, but I don’t believe that I did” (Moore, 1942, p. 543). In fact, p ∧ ¬✷p is a self-refuting formula: after announcing it truthfully, it always becomes false.\nThe successful formulas are the most well-known from the literature, and have been investigated on the class of S5 models (van Ditmarsch and Kooi, 2006; Holliday and Icard, 2010). On the class S5, and using the (state eliminating) semantics of truthful public announcement logic, the successful formulas are those for which |= [ϕ]ϕ (and the selfrefuting formulas are then those for which |= [ϕ]¬ϕ). On S5 (but of course not in KD45), ϕ → [ϕ]ψ is equivalent to [ϕ]ψ. A formula is successful in believed announcement logic if and only if it is successful in truthful announcement logic. This we can easily see:\nIn truthful announcement logic, M, s |= [ϕ]ϕ iff (M, s |= ϕ implies M |ϕ, s |= ϕ), where M |ϕ denotes the submodel consisting of the states satisfying ϕ (see Appendix A); whereas in believed announcement logic, M, s |= ϕ → [ϕ]ϕ iff (M, s |= ϕ implies M |ϕ, s |= ϕ). Using that, whenever the announcement formula ϕ is true in a model (M, s), the model (M |ϕ, s) resulting from state elimination is bisimilar to the model (M |ϕ, s) resulting from arrow elimination.\nA characterization of single-agent successful formulas in S5 is known (Holliday and Icard, 2010) (we will use it below to obtain results for true lies), but only incidental results and no characterization is known for multi-agent successful formulas. Results are that: the positive fragment is successful (van Ditmarsch and Kooi, 2006) (the positive or universal fragment of the language of public announcement logic is inductively defined by ϕ ::= p | ¬p | ϕ ∨ ϕ | ϕ ∧ ϕ | ✷aϕ | [¬ϕ]ϕ), publicly known formulas are successful (formulas ✷∗Aϕ, where ✷ ∗\nA stands for common knowledge for the set of all agents — however note that ✷∗Bϕ may be unsuccessful if B ⊂ A), ¬✷ap is successful (and non-trivially believable) (Qian, 2002) — an older result than Holliday and Icard (2010), but subsumed by the later characterization of Holliday and Icard (2010).\nA strong intuitive and technical motivation for the successful formulas in truthful announcement logic is that they describe the so-called substitution free fragment of the logic. In general we do not have for dynamic epistemic logics that |= ϕ iff |= ϕ[p/ψ], for example [p]p is valid but [p ∧ ¬✷p](p ∧ ¬✷p) is invalid. But this uniform substitution holds for the fragment of the language consisting of the successful formulas (Holliday et al., 2013).\nSelf-refuting formulas\n|= ϕ→ [ϕ]¬ϕ\nSimilarly to the successful formulas, a formula is self-refuting in believed announcement logic if and only if it is self-refuting in truthful announcement logic. As said, a well-known self-refuting formula (and that is also non-trivially believable) is p ∧ ¬✷p. A syntactic characterization of single-agent self-refuting formulas in S5 is also presented in Holliday and Icard (2010), but a more general multi-agent characterization is also not known to us (researchers have been looking for this in vain for some considerable time).\nImpossible lies\n|= ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]¬ϕ\nClearly ⊤ is an impossible lie, as this makes the antecedent ¬ϕ of the implication false, but this is the trivial case. Slightly more interesting impossible lies are the booleans. (And all these are non-trivially believable.) For example, p is an impossible lie because |= ¬p→ [p]¬p. This is obvious, as announcements do not change the value of propositional variables.\nAnother impossible lie is ¬✷p. It is trivial: |= ✷p → [¬✷p]✷p holds because in any model satisfying ✷p the accessibility relation of the agent is empty after the ¬✷p update.\nThe formula ¬✷p is also a successful formula. No characterization results are known for impossible lies.\nTrue lies\n|= ¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ\nAbove we have already seen examples of true lies. The formula ⊤ (or any other valid formula) is a trivial true lie. Examples of single-agent true lies are: ✷p, p ∨ ✷p (which is non-trivially believable).\nUnsatisfiable formulas are not true lies, as [⊥]⊥ is equivalent to ⊥ (in believed announcement logic, not in truthful announcement logic), so that ¬⊥ → ⊥ is equivalent to ⊥.\nSection 6 proves a syntactical characterization of single-agent believable true lies in class KD45 (Proposition 11)."

      "text" : "A common way to transform a model for a directed single-agent (unimodal) setting exhibiting a certain desirable property into a model for a symmetric multi-agent setting with the same property, is to replace an arrow by a pair of (undirected) links for different agents, i.e., a pair (x, y) ∈ R by two pairs (x, z) ∈ Ra and (z, y) ∈ Rb. In a multi-agent S5 setting, this means chaining equivalence classes of size two for different agents a and b. Instead of arbitrarily long finite chains, we then build arbitrarily long alternating and interlocking a/b chains. The technique has been used to great effect for undecidability arguments for S5 logics (French and van Ditmarsch, 2008) and also to great effect for expressivity arguments for such logics (van Ditmarsch et al., 2007; Kooi, 2007). This chaining procedure can be extended in a natural way to KD45 models (for consistent belief), namely when (at least) the root of the model is an unreachable state wherein incorrect belief is possible, but where (almost) all remaining states constitute equivalence classes (wherein belief is correct). We\napply this procedure to get a symmetric multi-agent model from an asymmetric singleagent model, to the model M of Subsection 5.1, in order to get an example of an unstable formula in a multi-agent KD45 setting.\nStarting with the model M of that section, we thus get the following model N . The accessibility relation is solid for agent a and it is dashed for agent b. Intuitively, to get N from M , all nodes are replaced by two nodes with the same valuation and that are indistinguishable for an agent b, whereas one might say the previous directed arrows are replaced by indistinguishability for an agent a. Except for the root, wherein we do something special: all pairs in the accessibility relation for a starting in the root are directed, and we add another node to the model that is accessible from the root for agent b only (in the figure: the node below the root), and from where all nodes accessible from the root for agent a are also a-accessible (in the figure we have only drawn one of those arrows, for visual clarity). This is a KD45 model. We assume the usual visual conventions for such models: all directed arrows point to clusters of indistinguishable nodes for that agent (see Appendix B). However, merely in order to emphasize the similarity with the model M , from the root of the model we have many outgoing arrows (whereas according to the visual convention one would have been enough).\n◦••\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n•\n•\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n•\nInstead of ϕ = ¬✷⊥ ∧ ((✸✷⊥ ∧✸¬✷⊥) → ✸(p ∧ ✷⊥))\nwe then get a more or less corresponding multi-agent formula\nψ = ¬✸b(✷ap ∨ ✷a¬p) ∧ ((p ∧✷b¬p) → ✸a✸b✷ap)\nTo get the latter from the former, first replace each ✸ by ✸a✸b. We recall that in the model, we replaced each directed unlabeled arrow by an a step plus a b step. Then, replace ✷⊥ by ✸b(✷ap∨✷a¬p). We recall that ✷⊥ defined a leaf node inM . As KD45 models are serial, we now observe that the leaves of model N are the unique nodes wherein a knows whether p: ✷ap ∨ ✷a¬p, such that ✸b(✷ap ∨ ✷a¬p) is only true in the final two nodes of each branch.\nThe extra node is needed to allow for a formula that distinguishes the root node from other nodes: the root of N is the unique node wherein agent b has incorrect belief: p∧✷b¬p. In all other nodes, agent b (correctly) knows the value of p. (We did not know how to distinguish the root node from other nodes without introducing such an additional node.)\nThe nodes a-accessible from the root form an infinite a-equivalence class. The a arrows leading from the extra node below the root to that class are there so that this node is not a leaf.\nWith the ‘translation’ so far, the final part ✸(p ∧ ✷⊥) of the formula ϕ becomes ✸a✸b(p∧✸b(✷ap∨✷a¬p)), which is KD45 equivalent to ✸a✸b✷ap, as found in the formula ψ.\nIn plain English, ψ describes that: (i) b does not consider it possible that a knows whether p, and that (ii) in the node where b’s belief is incorrect (the root note), a considers it possible that b considers it possible for a to know that (not whether!) p. Condition (i) is always false in the leaves and in the nodes just below the leaves, whereas condition (ii) is only true in the root if there is a path of length 2 to a leaf node satisfying p.

      "heading" : "6 Characterization of single-agent believable true lies",
      "text" : "Exactly which formulas are true lies? Can they been characterized syntactically, and if so, how? The corresponding problem for successful and self-refuting formulas has been studied and solved for the single-agent case (Holliday and Icard, 2010). These characterizations are given for S5 (see Section 4) but are said to hold also for KD45 “with minor changes” (Holliday and Icard, 2010). The problem is still open for the multi-agent case, for both classes of formulas. Two main reasons that the single-agent case is easier, are that in that case, first, it is well known that any formula is (S5 or KD45) equivalent to a formula in disjunctive normal form without any nestings of modalities, and, second, that satisfiability of a formula in disjunctive normal form can be checked syntactically (Holliday and Icard, 2010) (see below for details). Based on these two properties, the characterizations in Holliday and Icard (2010) check that certain disjuncts (conditionally) exist in the (disjunctive normal form) formula, which is shown to ensure that the formula is of the required type.\nIn this section we give a similar characterization of believable true lies. It is heavily inspired by Holliday and Icard (2010). Indeed, we take the technique directly from them, as well as notation and concepts. Just as Holliday and Icard (2010) syntactically characterize the set of successful formulas, we syntactically characterize the complement of the set of believable true lies. The differences are in the details of the characterization and the corresponding proof.\nIn the rest of this section, a “formula” always refers (single-agent) formula in the standard modal language. (Note that any formula in L is equivalent to such an announcementfree formula.) We now formally define the two properties mentioned above, disjunctive normal forms and syntactic satisfiability checking, and then give the characterization in Definition 16.\nDefinition 14 (Disjunctive normal form) A formula ϕ is in disjunctive normal form iff it is a disjunction of conjunctions of the form\nδ = α ∧ ✷β1 ∧ . . . ∧ ✷βn ∧✸γ1 ∧ . . . ∧✸γm\nwhere α and each γi are conjunctions of literals and each βi is a disjunction of literals. ⊣\nWe write ∼l to denote the negation of a literal l where double negations are removed. Similarly, when β is a disjunction of literals, ∼β denotes the conjunction of negated literals with single negation removed. For a given conjuction δ of the form above, in the following we will write δα for α and δ✷✸ for ✷β1 ∧ . . . ∧ ✷βn ∧ ✸γ1 ∧ . . . ∧ ✸γm. Every formula is KD45-equivalent to one in disjunctive normal form.\nDefinition 15 (Clarity (Holliday and Icard, 2010)) Given a conjunction or disjunction χ of literals, L(χ) denotes the set of literals occurring in it. Set L(χ) is open iff no literal in L(χ) is the negation of any other. A conjunction δ = α∧✷β1∧ . . .∧✷βn∧✸γ1∧ . . .∧✸γm in disjunctive normal form is clear iff (i) L(α) is open; (ii) there is an open set of\nliterals {l1, . . . , ln} with li ∈ L(βi); and (iii) for every γk there is a set of literals {l1, . . . , ln} with li ∈ L(βi) such that {l1, . . . , ln} ∪ L(γk) is open. A disjunction in disjunctive normal form is clear iff at least one of the disjuncts is clear. ⊣\nThe key point about clarity is that a formula isKD45-satisfiable iff it is clear (Holliday and Icard, 2010, Lemma 3.6).\nWe define a formula that we call a disjunctive lying form. We will then show that, modulo logical equivalence, the class of these formulas corresponds exactly to the class of formulas that are not believable true lies. The characterization will be explained after the definition.\nDefinition 16 (Disjunctive lying form) A formula ϕ in disjunctive normal form is a disjunctive lying form iff there exist (possibly empty) sets S and T of disjuncts of ϕ and a conjunct ✷βθ of each θ ∈ T , such that any disjunctive normal form of\nχ = ¬ϕ ∧✸ϕ ∧ χ1 ∧ χ2 ∧ χ3\nis clear3 , where\nχ1 = ∧\nθ∈T\nt(θ) ∧ ∧\nθ∈T\n¬t(θ) t(θ) = θα ∧ ∧\n✸γ in θ\n∨\nσ∈S\n✸(σα ∧ γ)\nχ2 = ∧\nσ∈S\nσ✷✸ ∧ ∧\nσ∈S\n¬σ✷✸\nχ3 = ∧\nθ∈T\n∨\nσ∈S\n✸(σα ∧ ∼βθ)\nand X denotes the set of disjuncts of ϕ that are not in X. ⊣\nWe now recall (page 11):\nProposition 11 A formula is a believable true lie iff it is not equivalent to a disjunctive lying form.\nBefore we prove Proposition 11, let us explain the intuition behind the definition. This will also serve as a guide to the proof of Proposition 11. If χ is true in some pointed model (is clear), then ¬ϕ ∧ ✸ϕ is true. The role of χ1 − χ3 is to ensure that ¬ϕ remains false in the updated model — which holds iff ϕ is not a believable true lie — by ensuring that certain disjuncts (conditionally) exist in ϕ.\nThe role of S is to syntactically encode which states are still accessible from the current state after the update. These are exactly the states where σα is true for some σ ∈ S. Since\n3The definition allows both S and T to be empty. However, if S is empty then (any disjunctive form of) χ is not clear (χ3 is a contradiction), so it follows that a disjunctive lying form actually must have a non-empty S as a witness. If T is empty then χ3 is a tautology. There exist disjunctive lying forms with an empty T as a witness (one example is p ∧✷p).\nϕ is false in the initial pointed model, there is only one way it can become true in the updated pointed model: if, for some disjunct θ of ϕ where θα is already true and all ✸γ are already true and stay true in the updated model, all ✷β that were false in the initial pointed model become true in the updated model. We must avoid that. Those disjuncts that can potentially become true are exactly those in T . Thus, we must make sure that for every disjunct θ ∈ T , there is at least one ✷β such that β is false in at least one state that is still accessible after the update. That is ensured by χ3.\nAs an example, to see that the believable true lie p∨✷p (already in disjunctive normal form) is not a disjunctive lying form, we need to check for all possible subsets of disjuncts S and T over the set of all disjuncts {p,✷p}, whether χ is clear. There are only two possibilities for T : T = ∅ or T = {✷p}. In the former case we get that χ1 = ¬p ∧ ⊥ (not clear). In the latter case, there are four possibilities for S: if S = ∅ then χ3 = ⊥; if S = {p} then χ3 = ✸(p ∧ ¬p); if S = {✷p} then χ2 = ✷p and χ3 = ✸¬p; and if S = {p,✷p} then χ2 = ✷p and χ3 = ✸¬p ∧✸(p ∧ ¬p). In all cases χ is not clear.\nAs another example, consider p∧✷p which is not a believable true lie. To see that it is a disjunctive lying form, take S = {p∧✷p} and T = ∅. We get that χ1 = ¬p, and χ2 = ✷p and χ3 = ⊤. It is easy to see that χ is clear (it is equivalent to ¬p ∧ ✷p ∧✸(p ∧ ✷p)).\nProof (of Prop. 11) Without loss of generality, let ϕ be a disjunctive normal form. Consider first the implication towards the left: assume that ϕ is a disjunctive lying form and let S, T , χ and βθ for each θ ∈ T be as in Def. 16. We must show that there exists M, s such that M, s |= ¬ϕ ∧ ✸ϕ and M |ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ. Since any disjunctive normal form of χ is clear iff it is satisfiable, so let M, s be such that M, s |= χ. Then M, s |= ¬ϕ ∧ ✸ϕ. Assume, towards a contradiction, that M |ϕ, s |= ϕ. Then there exists a disjunct θ in ϕ such that M |ϕ, s |= θ. As explained above, we are going to show that χ3 ensures that this is impossible. To do that, we must first show that it must be the case that θ ∈ T (intuitively defined as the set of disjuncts that can potentially become true in the updated model), and then that χ3 ensures that the conjunct ✷βθ is false in M |ϕ, s, leading to a contradiction.\nThus, we first show that it must be the case that θ ∈ T . From M |ϕ, s |= θα it follows thatM, s |= θα (θα is propositional). We now show that alsoM, s |= ∧\n✸γ in θ ∨ σ∈S ✸(σ α∧\nγ), and it follows from M, s |= χ1 that θ ∈ T . Let ✸γ be a conjunct in θ. We have that M |ϕ, s |= ✸γ, i.e., that there exists a state t such that Rst and M |ϕ, t |= γ and, since t is a state in M |ϕ, M, t |= ϕ. From the latter it follows that M, t |= σ for some disjunct σ of ϕ. From M, t |= σ✷✸ and Rst it follows that M, s |= σ✷✸ by standard KD45 reasoning, and thus that σ ∈ S by χ2. Since γ is propositional, M |ϕ, t |= γ implies that M, t |= γ. Thus, M, s |= ✸(σα ∧ γ) for some σ ∈ S. Since ✸γ was arbitrary, we get that M, s |= ∧\n✸γ in θ ∨ σ∈S ✸(σ α ∧ γ) and thus that θ ∈ T .\nHaving shown that θ ∈ T , we now get a contradiction from the fact that M, s |= χ3. It follows that there exists a σ ∈ S such that M, s |= ✸(σα ∧ ∼βθ). That means that there exists a state t such that Rst and M, t |= σα ∧ ∼βθ. From the fact that σ ∈ S we know that M, s |= σ✷✸ and thus, by standard KD45 reasoning, that M, t |= σ✷✸. That means that M, t |= σ and thus M, t |= ϕ. The latter means that t is accessible from s in M |ϕ,\nand thus that M |ϕ, s |= ¬✷βθ. But this contradicts M |ϕ, s |= ✷βθ which follows from the assumption that M |ϕ, s |= θ. This concludes the implication towards the left.\nFor the direction towards the right, assume that ϕ is not a true lie, i.e., that there exist M, s such that M, s |= ¬ϕ ∧✸ϕ and M |ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ. We now define T , S, and βθ for each θ ∈ T , as follows. We will then show that the resulting χ is satisfiable. For any disjunct δ in ϕ, let\nδ ∈ T ⇔M, s |= t(δ) δ ∈ S ⇔M, s |= δ✷✸\nLet θ ∈ T . In order to define βθ, we first show that for every conjunct ✸γ in θ, we have that M |ϕ, s |= ✸γ. Let ✸γ be a conjunct in θ. From the fact that M, s |= t(θ) we get that there is a σ ∈ S such thatM, s |= ✸(σα∧γ). In other words, there exists a state t such that Rst andM, t |= σα∧γ. From χ2 and the fact that σ ∈ S and standard KD45 reasoning we have that M, t |= σ✷✸. Thus, M, t |= σ. That means that M, t |= ϕ and that t is accessible from s in M |ϕ, so M |ϕ, s |= ✸γ, for all ✸γ in θ. Since θα is propositional, M |ϕ, s |= θα follows fromM, s |= t(θ), and thusM |ϕ, s |= ¬θ (which follows fromM |ϕ, s |= ¬ϕ) implies that there must be a conjunct ✷β in θ such that M |ϕ, s |= ¬✷β. Let βθ be one such β.\nFinally, we show that χ is satisfiable. It follows that any disjunctive normal form of χ is clear, and thus that ϕ is a disjunctive lying form. We show that M, s |= χ (where M, s is the pointed model above). We have that M, s |= ¬ϕ ∧ ✸ϕ by assumption, and M, s |= χ1 ∧ χ2 by definition. It remains to be shown that M, s |= χ3. Let θ ∈ T . By definition of βθ, M |ϕ, s |= ✸∼βθ. That means that there exists a state t such that t is accessible from s in the updated model and M |ϕ, t |= ∼βθ. Since t is accessible from s in M |ϕ, M, t |= ϕ. Let σ be a disjunct of ϕ such that M, t |= σ. Thus M, t |= σ✷✸, and from that and standard KD45 reasoning, M, s |= σ✷✸, and thus σ ∈ S. FromM, t |= σ we know that M, t |= σα, and since ∼βθ is propositional, M, t |= ∼βθ ∧ σ\nα for some σ ∈ S and thus M, s |= ✸(∼βθ ∧ σ α). Since θ ∈ T was arbitrary, M, s |= χ3."

      "heading" : "7 Knowledge and iterated announcement whether",
      "text" : "The focus of our story is on lying and therefore on the believed announcement logic, not on the truthful announcement logic wherein lying is impossible. However some of our questions are also meaningful in a logic of knowledge change, interpreted on models with equivalence relations. As an example, let us address the matter of arbitrarily often iterated updates and unstable formulas. For KD45 models we could affirmatively answer the following question (Section 5.3):\nAre there a model (M, s) and a formula ϕ, such that if we continue to announce in this model that ϕ, the value of ϕ never stabilizes? (i)\nThis cannot be in S5, as ϕ cannot be truthfully announced when ϕ is false in the actual state. An obvious question in the setting of S5 models and truthful public announcements is:\nAre there a model (M, s) and a formula ϕ, such that if we continue to announce in this model whether ϕ, the value of ϕ never stabilizes? (ii)\nThe (truthful public) announcement whether ϕ announces the value of ϕ. If ϕ is true, it is a truthful announcement of ϕ, whereas if ϕ is false, it is a truthful announcement of ¬ϕ. To question (ii) we do not know the answer. We conjecture that the answer is: no. However, a related question is:\nAre there a model (M, s) and formulas ϕ and ψ, such that if we continue to announce whether ϕ, the value of ψ never stabilizes? (iii)\nThis question we can answer positively, and we think that it may be found in various epistemic scenarios of interest. In the scenario we present here, we do slightly better than (iii):\nAre there a model (M, s) and formulas ϕ and ψ, such that if we continue to announce that ϕ, the value of ψ never stabilizes? (iv)\nAn answer to (iv) is also an answer to (iii). Lack of stability in the sense of (iv) is more formally defined as follows. Let σ ∈ {0, 1}ω be unstable; we recall that this means that for all n ∈ N there are m, k ≥ n such that σm = 1 and σk = 0. Then we wish to find (M, s), ϕ, and ψ such that for all n ∈ N, M |ϕn , s |= σn+1(ψ), and whereM is an S5 model. (Where we further recall that σn(ψ) = ψ if σn = 1 and else σn(ψ) = ¬ψ; and that M |ϕ is the (S5 preserving) state elimination semantics for truthful public announcement—see Section 2 and Appendix A.)\nNow consider σ = (01)ω (σ = 010101...), the alternating string. Our solution is a simple adjustment of the model N from Section 5.3 to realize an unstable formula for believed announcement logic. The model below is the equivalence closure (reflexive, symmetric, and transitive closure) of that model N . To achieve that visually, we only have to replace the directed arrows involving the root and the node below the root by undirected links, and assume transitivity. The alternating values of σi have been made explicit in three branches, for an example. As in Section 5.3, we decorate the states of N with the variable p according to σ; • means that p is false (σ1 = σ3 = 0), and ◦ that p is true (σ2 = 1).\n◦••\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n•\n•\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\n◦\n◦\n•\n•\nσ1σ1\nσ2\nσ2\nσ1\nσ1\nσ3\nσ3\nσ2\nσ2\nσ1\nσ1\n•\nIn order to get N |ϕn , s |= σn+1(ψ) we decorate as before the model with values σn for the propositional variable p (where the model above demonstrates strict alternation in the first three values) and we take ϕ := ¬✸b(✷ap ∨ ✷a¬p) and ψ := ¬(✷bp ∨ ✷b¬p) → ✸a✸b✷ap. In other words, we split the unstable formula ¬✸b(✷ap∨✷a¬p)∧ ((p∧✷b¬p) → ✸a✸b✷ap) that we employed in Section 5.3 into a part doing the job of always removing the leaf and the node before the leaf of every branch, and another part checking whether there is a branch of length two from the root to a p node, where the distinguishing formula for the root has become b’s ignorance of p (there are now two nodes that can be the root).\nFor a different example of M |ϕn , s |= σn+1(ψ), consider an infinite number of (possibly) muddy children, of which an infinite subset are in fact muddy, let ϕ be the usual proposition ‘nobody steps forward’ (nobody knows whether he or she is muddy; see Section 4), and let ψ be the proposition ‘it is common knowledge that at least n children are muddy but it is not common knowledge that at least n+ 1 children are muddy, where n is even’, and let σ = (01)ω, again. After father’s initial announcement that at least one child is muddy (which serves as the initial model N in this case), ψ is false (because n = 1 which is odd). Whereas after nobody steps forward following the first request by father to do so if you know whether you are muddy, ψ is true (because now it is common knowledge that at least two children must be muddy: n = 2 which is even). And so on, ad infinitum.\nIf we consider non-public events, there are yet other interesting forms of unstable iteration on S5 models. Running ahead of the next Section 8 (and see Appendix A): there are action models such that their iterated execution does not stabilize on a given model. The following is a vintage example in a two-agent setting.\nConsider a two-state epistemic model for two agents Anne (solid access) and Bob (dashed access) such that Anne is uncertain whether p but Bob knows whether p. Actually, p is true (the ◦ state, boxed). Iterated execution of the action model with two actions with preconditions ¬✷ap and p ∧ ✷b¬✷ap transforms this two-state epistemic model into a three-state model, and vice versa, ad infinitum. We could think of the formula ✷b¬✷ap being alternatingly true and false in the p-world (the ◦-world) about which agent a is uncertain. The execution can be visualized as follows.\n◦ •\n◦\n×\n◦\ns t\n◦\n¬✷ap p ∧ ✷b¬✷ap\n=\n◦\n◦ •\n◦\n◦ •\n◦\n×\n◦\ns t\n◦\n¬✷ap p ∧ ✷b¬✷ap\n=\n◦\n◦ •\n◦\nIn the regrettably unpublished (Sadzik, 2006) the matter of stabilization after action model execution is discussed at great length."

      "heading" : "8 Private lies",
      "text" : "True Lies and Butterflies Mei wants to invite two friends Zhu Yingtai and Liang Shanbo to a party. She knows that they are dying to get close to each other. Thus one will come if and only if (s)he believes that the other will come. Obviously they do not yet wish to admit this to each other, because as far as they know they are both still very uncertain about each other’s feelings. Given this uncertainty, both in fact don’t intend to come to the party. Mei now lies to Yingtai that Shanbo will come to the party and she lies to Shanbo that Yingtai will come to the party. As a result, they will both come to the party. (This story is a free adaptation of the Butterfly Lovers, a famous Chinese folktale, see https: // en. wikipedia. org/ wiki/ Butterfly_ Lovers .)\nWe can consider this an example of a true lie, because when Mei is telling to to Yingtai that Shanbo plans to come, in fact Shanbo is not planning to come, and when she is telling to Shanbo that Yingtai plans to come, in fact Yingtai is not (yet) planning to come. (For modelling convenience we assume that Yingtai is slow in making up her mind after Mei informs her about Shanbo.) After that, they both change their minds, and both lies have become true.\nIn order to model this story we will depart in two respects from the previous setting of believed announcement logic. In the first place these announcements are not public but private. In the second place the agents that we model change their minds. As we consider the factual propositions ‘Yingtai plans to go to the party’ and ‘Shanbo plans to go to the party’, changing your mind involves factual change. A logic allowing both formalizations is called action model logic (with factual change) (Baltag et al., 1998; van Ditmarsch et al., 2007; van Benthem et al., 2006). This logic can be seen as a straightforward generalization of believed announcement logic. (Alternatively, we can model the dynamics in more protocol oriented dynamic epistemic logics, such as Wang (2010); van Ditmarsch et al. (2014).) We only present some examples of action models and assume familiarity with the framework. For technical details, see Appendix A on page 34 or the above references.\nFor an initial model, we assume that Yingtai and Shanbo know of themselves whether they intend to go to the party but do not know it of the other one (and that this is known, that this is the background knowledge). This comes with the following model, wherein solid access represents the uncertainty of Yingtai and dashed access represents the uncertainty of Shanbo, and where worlds are named with the facts py (‘Yingtai comes to the party’) and ps (‘Shanbo comes to the party’) that are true there, where 01 stands for ‘py is false and ps is true’, etc. The designated point of the model is boxed: initially both do not intend to go to the party.\n00 10\n01 11\nMei now lies to Yingtai, in private, that Shanbo goes to the party. For the convenience of the reader informed about action model logic, we can model this as a three-pointed action model as follows, on the left—where for convenience we have put the similar private lie to Shanbo about Yingtai next to it, on the right.\n¬ps ps\n⊤\n¬py py\n⊤\nThe result of the first of these lying actions is as follows.\n00 10\n01 11\n00 10\n01 11\nNow Mei lies privately to Shanbo that Yingtai goes to the party. The result of that action is as follows. For the convenience of the reader we also depict (on the right) the restriction of this model to the submodel generated by the point 00:\n00 10\n01 11\n00 10\n01 11\n00 10\n01 11\n00 10\n01 11\n00 10\n01\n00 10\n01 11\nThe above model formalizes that: Yingtai is not going to the party, believes that Shanbo goes to the party, and believes that Shanbo is uncertain whether she goes to the party;\nand that: Shanbo is not going to the party, believes that Yingtai goes to the party, and believes that Yingtai is uncertain whether he goes to the party.\nWe now first let Yingtai change her mind and then Shanbo change his mind. Yingtai changing her mind can again be formalized as an action model, namely as a private assignment to Yingtai; and similarly, Shanbo changing his mind as a private assignment to Shanbo. It is important here that a public assignment is an improper way to formalize this action: a public assignment of Yingtai going to the party if she believes that Shanbo goes to the party would be informative to Shanbo in case he were to believe that she believed that he was going to the party. Because in case he was uncertain if she would go to the party, he would then learn from this public assignment that she would come to the party for his sake. Boring. Because exactly the absence of this sort of knowledge of the other’s intentions makes first lovers’ meetings so thrilling. That kind of uncertainty should not be resolved. Therefore, we formalize it as a private assignment. Interestingly, in the current model the result of a public and of a private assignment (the result of Yingtai privately changing her mind or publicly changing her mind) is the same. But that is because both Yingtai and Shanbo believe that the other is uncertain whether they go to the party.\nBelow on the left is the action model for Yingtai changing her mind, and on the right, the one for Shanbo changing his mind. (So, for example, according to our conventions, in the left action model the solid relation, that of Yingtai, has identity access, and the dashed relation, for Shanbo, has only a reflexive arrow in the point that the dashed arrow is pointing to.)\npy := ✷yps ⊤ ps := ✷spy ⊤\nWe now depict, from left to right, once more the model before they change their minds, the model resulting from executing the action of Yingtai changing her mind, and the model resulting from Shanbo changing his mind, where once again we restrict the actually resulting models to the point-generated subframes.\n00 10\n01\n00 10\n01 11\nYingtai ⇒\n10 10\n11\n00 10\n01 11\nShanbo ⇒\n11 11\n11\n00 10\n01 11\nNow that Yingtai and Shanbo have changed their minds, the lies have become the truth! They both go the party, and they will both expect the other to be surprised to find them at the party.4 They declare their love to each other and they live happily ever after.\n4This is in accordance with the resulting model, above on the right; for example, in the root 11 of that"

      "heading" : "9 What lies in the future?",
      "text" : "We have modelled the true lie ϕ in believed announcement logic as the validity\n¬ϕ→ [ϕ]ϕ\nor as the satisfiability of ¬ϕ ∧ [ϕ]ϕ,\nwhere the believed announcement models informative change and not factual change. Finding satisfiable true lies, of which there are many, seems a first step towards finding valid true lies, of which there are few. The latter seem to give more insight. They have the shape of correctness statements ϕ → [α]ψ in Hoare logic; and indeed we have seen that valid true lies come with strong syntactic restrictions. In the private lie example we also modelled actions involving factual change. With this tool (and action model logic in its full generality) in hand we can also formalize the Pang Juan and the Arnold Schwarzenegger true lies, and make them fit a similar pattern. However, in this case we stop at satisfiability and the mere description of the examples. We defer a more general treatment and generic patterns involving validity to future research.\nThe Pang Juan true lie can be formalized as a two-pointed action model where one action has precondition p, the other action has precondition ¬p, where the postcondition is p := ⊤ in both actions (‘no matter what was the case, you will now die’), and where the agent only considers the action with precondition p possible. The designated point is the action where p is false (Pang Juan does not die). Let us call this action α(p).\n¬p; p := ⊤ p; p := ⊤\nAlternatively, we can separate the observation part from the ontic change part, and consider the composition of those two actions. The former is then the lie that p, i.e., the believed announcement that p when p is false. The action model equivalent of a believed announcement is a two-point action model (see Appendix A). The latter a singleton action called public assignment (namely of ⊤ to p). So we get:\n¬p p composed with p := ⊤\nAs the observing agent is Pang Juan and the killing agent one of his opponents, one may prefer the sequence of two epistemic actions over the single epistemic action. On the other hand, as Pang Juan’s observation and his subsequent death seem inextricably linked, one might prefer the single epistemic action. However, there is no notion of agency in dynamic epistemic logics: the composition of two actions is indistinguishable from the single action that combines the informative and ontic part: in the logic we have that [α(p)]ϕ\nmodel Yingtai believes —move to the top 11— that Shanbo believes —move to 01 and 11— that Yingtai is uncertain whether Shanbo comes to the party, both when she comes to the party —the equivalence class consisting of 00 and 01— as when she does not come to the party —the cluster consisting of 10 and 11.\nis equivalent to [p][p := ⊤]ϕ, for all ϕ. So it does not matter. (We also recall that Pang Juan would die no matter which observation he made. We can satisfy this requirement by replacing the announcement that p by the announcement that q in the modelling with two epistemic actions. But that does not give any insight.) We end up with the satisfiability of\n¬p ∧ [α(p)]p\nbut without being able to generalize this to a validity of shape ¬p → [α(p)]p. This would require stronger or different logics, involving agency, or other notions of action or interaction (van Emde Boas and van Emde Boas Lubsen, 2016), or of self-fulfilling prophesy.\nIn the Arnold Schwarzenegger example there is a lot of belief change and factual change going on. The epistemic goals of both agents, and their respective protocols in order to reach those goals, seem to play an important part.\nLet pj represent ‘Jamie Lee Curtis is a spy’ and pa represent ‘Arnold Schwarzenegger is a spy’. At first Arnold is a spy (pa), Arnold believes that he is a spy (Bapa —of course, the reader might say; but hang on!), Jamie believes he is not a spy (Bj¬pa), and Arnold’s goal is to keep it that way (Bj¬pa). Jamie is not a spy (¬pj), she believes that she is not a spy (Bj¬pj), and Arnold also believes this (Ba¬pj). Jamie’s goal also is to keep it that way. So they both believe that the other is not a spy, and this is a stable situation, because both want the other to believe that. We now get a number of transitions where beliefs, facts, and goals all change. The initial situation is (i).\ngoal a goal j (i) pa ¬pj Bapa Bj¬pa Ba¬pj Bj¬pj Bj¬pa Ba¬pj (ii) pa ¬pj Bapa Bj¬pa Ba¬pj Bjpj Bj¬pa Bapj (iii) pa ¬pj Bapa Bjpa Ba¬pj Bjpj Bj¬pa Bapj (iv) pa pj Bapa Bjpa Bapj Bjpj Bjpa Bapj\nThe epistemic goals of the agents are only realized in (i) and (iv); only there they are stable. Indeed, the last stage is the happy ending. (For details, please see the movie.) In (ii), Jamie has started to enact a spy in order to make Arnold believe that she is a spy; she even believes that she has become a spy, without realizing that she has been set up: she is not really a spy. In (iii), she finds out that Arnold is a spy (because unlike Arnold, third parties believe that she is a spy and that she is collaborating with Arnold). In (iv) —abstracting from intervening details involving helicopter fights and Miami skyscrapers— they end up collaborating as spies and believing in each other, now truthfully so. Again, a stable situation.\nLet us call the composition of all these actions α(pa, pj). Again we have satisfiability of\n(pa ∧ ¬pj) ∧ [α(pa, pj)](pa ∧ pj)\nbut no general pattern involving validity of (pa ∧ ¬pj) → [α(pa, pj)](pa ∧ pj) or any other additional insight. Lacking in our formal analysis in dynamic epistemic logic are much stronger notions of epistemic protocol (how does one realize an epistemic goal given a\nbelief state?), protocol logics, and, again, notions of agency (Bolander and Andersen, 2011; Wang, 2010). Second-order false belief scenarios are modelled in Braüner et al. (2016); Arslan et al. (2015)."

Of particular interest were iterations of announcements where the beliefs of the agents never stabilize: the models keep changing with every next announcement. The investigation can be seen as the obvious next step given existing in-depth investigations of successful and self-refuting updates changing agents’ knowledge, i.e., on models where epistemic stances are interpreted with equivalence relations. We have carried this forward not merely to the KD45 models for believing agents, but also to models without structural properties. Two new types of update then come to the fore: true lies (that become true after a lying announcement) and impossible lies (that stay false even after a lying announcement), and also iterations of such announcements. An open question on these iterations is which σ-valid formulas are realizable."

In the language we only have to replace the public announcement modalities [ϕ]ψ with action model modalities [M, s]ψ, for ‘after execution of epistemic action (M, s), ψ’ (is true). An action model is like an epistemic model, only instead of a valuation it has preconditions and postconditions. The syntactic primitive [M, s]ψ may seem a peculiar mix of syntax and semantics, but there is a way to see this as a properly inductive construct in a two-typed language with both formulas and epistemic actions, because the preconditions and postconditions of these actions are again formulas. We now proceed with the technical details.\nAn action model M = (S,R, pre, post) for language L (assumed to be simultaneously defined with primitive construct [M, s]ϕ, see above) consists of a domain S of actions, an accessibility function R : A → P(S × S), where each R(a), for which we write Ra, is an accessibility relation, a precondition function pre : S → L, that assigns to each action its executability precondition, and postcondition function post : S → P 6→ L, where it is required that each post(s) only maps a finite (possibly empty) subset of all atoms to a formula. For s ∈ S, (M, s) is an epistemic action.\nThe semantics of action model execution is as follows.\nM, s |= [M, s]ψ iff M, s |= pre(s) implies M ⊗M, (s, s) |= ψ\nwhere M ⊗M = (S ′, R′, V ′) (known as update of M with M, or as the result of executing M in M) is such that S ′ = {(s, s) |M, s |= s}; ((s, s), (t, t)) ∈ Ra iff (s, t) ∈ Ra and (s, t) ∈ Ra;\nand (s, s) ∈ V ′(p) iff M, s |= post(s)(p) for all p in the domain of post, and otherwise (s, s) ∈ V ′(p) iff s ∈ V (p).\nA truthful public announcement of ϕ corresponds to a singleton action model M = (S,R, pre, post) with S = {s}; Ra = {(s, s)} for all a ∈ A; pre(s) = ϕ (and empty domain for postconditions). A believed public announcement of ϕ corresponds to a a two-point action model M = (S,R, pre, post) with S = {s, t}; Ra = {(t, s), (s, s)} for all a ∈ A; pre(s) = ϕ and pre(t) = ¬ϕ (and again the empty domain for postconditions). If the designated point is t it is a public lie and if the designated point is s it is a truthful (believed) announcement."

      "text" : "To depict epistemic models, a pair of states in the accessibility relation is represented by an arrow between those states. There are visual conventions to simplify the display of multiagent S5 models and multi-agent KD45 models. The conventions guarantee that, given a number of agents, any of the following three uniquely determines the two others: (i) the epistemic frame, (ii) the fully displayed visualization, and (iii) the simplified visualization.\nIn S5 models all accessibility relations are equivalence relations, so that we can partition the domain in equivalence classes: sets of indistinguishable states. In the visualization we can therefore assume transitive, symmetric, and reflexive closure. Visually, indistinguishable states are connected by a path (transitive closure) of undirected edges (symmetric closure). Reflexive arrows not drawn (reflexive closure). Singleton equivalence classes do not show in the visualation. But they are inferable as long as we know how many agents there are.\nExamples are as follows. The simplified visualization is on the right and the visualization with all arrows of the accessibility relation is on the left.\n• • • •\n• • •\n• • •\n• • • • • •\nIn KD45 models all accessibility relations are transitive, euclidean and serial. Therefore we can divide the domain in clusters. A cluster is a set of indistinguishable states (just as an equivalence class in S5), but those states may also appear to be indistinguishable from the perspective of states outside the cluster (unlike in S5), the so-called unreachable states. In unreachable states beliefs are incorrect. In the KD45 visualization we can therefore assume transitive and euclidean closure, and (this is crucial) we can assume reflexive closure of\nstates in a cluster. This is because a state in a cluster is a state that is reachable from another state. Reflexivity then follows from seriality and euclidicity: from (x, y) ∈ R and once more) (x, y) ∈ R follows with euclidicity that (y, y) ∈ R). It is therefore not so different from the S5 visualization. The only difference is that we also draw arrows from states outside a cluster to a (exactly one) cluster. From the source state of such an arrow is not only accessible the state in the cluster that is the endpoint of that arrow, but also all other states in that cluster.\nExamples are as follows.\n• • • •\n• • • • • •\n• • • • • •\nA good way to understand the visualization rules is to reproduce the full visualization on the left from the simplified visualization on the right. The role of singleton clusters takes some getting used to. For example, in the first KD45 example, on the right: As there is an outgoing arrow from the left state, it is not a state in a cluster but an unreachable state. Therefore it has no loop in the completion, on the left. As there is an incoming arrow in the right state it is part of a cluster. This is therefore a singleton cluster. This state must have a loop in the completion, on the left. In the last KD45 example, as there is an outgoing arrow for the solid relation from the left state, it is, just as in the first example, not a state in a cluster but an unreachable state. However, as there there is no outgoing arrow for the dashed relation from the left state, we can infer that it is a singleton cluster and thus infer a loop for the dashed relation. And indeed, on the left, it is there. Etc.\nThe S5 visualization is well-known. The KD45 visualization is not well-known."

In that logic, we can call an announcement a lie if the announced formula is false. A true lie is then the announcement of something false that makes it true. This analysis of a lie is not entirely according to the traditional view of agents lying to each other: you are lying to me if you believe ¬φ but you say to me that φ with the intention to make me believe that φ. If we model the realization of this intention (namely that indeed I believe you), and incorporate all belief aspects, we get ✷a¬φ→ [✷aφ]✷b✷aφ (where agent a lies to agent b). Abstracting from all belief aspects gives us ¬φ → [φ]φ. Although the former is more precise, it is not uncommon, if not customary, to abstract from the source and the justification of the lie so that we get ¬φ → [φ]✷bφ, from where it is not a big step to ¬φ → [φ]φ, the main focus of our investigation. (In order to make this identification, we can think of agent b as the special agent who is able to distinguish all states, for whom it holds that ✷bφ ↔ φ.) This simplied schema ¬φ → [φ]φ is clearly in opposition to the schema φ → [φ]φ for the so-called successful formulas. (In truthful public announcement logic the successful formulas are those for which [φ]φ is valid. In that logic [φ]φ is equivalent to φ → [φ]φ. But in believed public announcement logic, where announcements are independent of the truth of the announced formula, [φ]φ is not equivalent to φ → [φ]φ.) In this work we mainly investigate true lies, successful formulas, and yet other notions in believed announcement logic, and also the iteration of such announcements. We also present results in this work that are not for believed announcement logic, but that are still related to iterated announcements, or to lying. In the logic of believed public announcements, interpreted on KD45 models encoding belief, the announced formula can be false and true before the announcement and can also be false and true after the announcement; and even beyond that, when iterating that same announcement, this value can change in arbitrary ways after each next announcement.
