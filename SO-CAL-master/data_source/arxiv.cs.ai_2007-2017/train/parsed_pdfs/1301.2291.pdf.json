HUGIN and LP are two new ar­ chitectures introduced in this paper. The compu­ tational complexity using the three architectures are compared on the same structure, the Limited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID), where on­ ly the requisite information for the computation of optimal policies is depicted. Because the req­ uisite information is explicitly represented in the diagram, the evaluation procedure can take ad­ vantage of it. Previously, it has been shown that significant savings in computational time can be obtained by performing the calculation on the LIMID rather than on the traditional influence diagram. In this paper we show how the ob­ tained savings is considerably increased when the computations are performed according to the LP scheme.",
