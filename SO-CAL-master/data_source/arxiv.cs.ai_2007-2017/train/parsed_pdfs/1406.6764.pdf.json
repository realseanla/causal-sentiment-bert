      "text" : "Acyclic directed mixed graphs, also known as semiMarkov models contain directed (→) and bi-directed (↔) edges subject to the restriction that there are no directed cycles. The use of such graphs to represent a statistical model may be traced to path diagrams introduced by [14], where bi-directed edges are used to represent correlated errors. Such graphs are useful for representing the independence structure arising from a DAG model with hidden variables. More recently they have proved useful in characterizing the set of intervention distributions that are identifiable [4, 13]. Ancestral graphs [12] are a subclass of ADMGs.\nThe global Markov property for such models is given by the natural extension of d-separation to graphs with bi-directed edges. [11] provided a local Markov property for acyclic directed mixed graphs that was equivalent to the global property for all distributions. [5] introduced a weaker version of the local Markov property which is equivalent to the global property under additional assumptions.\nIn order to be able to score these models we require a parametrization of the set of distributions obeying the conditional independence relations given by an ADMG. Until now such parametrizations have only been available in the multivariate Gaussian case [2, 12].\nIn this paper we give a factorization result which leads directly to a parametrization in the multivariate binary case. It is not hard to extend the parameterization to the general discrete case, though we do not do it here for reasons of space.\nWe illustrate the main ideas with the graph shown in Figure 1. This graph implies the conditional independence relations X1⊥X2, X4 and X2⊥X1, X3, which cannot be represented by a DAG model (without latents). The theorem given in this paper associates this graph with the following factorizations:\np(x1, x2) = p(x1)p(x2),\np(x1, x3) = p(x1)p(x3 | x1),\np(x2, x4) = p(x2)p(x4 | x2),\np(x1, x2, x3) = p(x3 | x1)p(x1)p(x2),\np(x1, x2, x4) = p(x4 | x2)p(x1)p(x2),\np(x1, x2, x3, x4) = p(x3, x4 | x1, x2)p(x1)p(x2).\nNote that the only terms here are: p(x1), p(x2), p(x3|x1), p(x4|x2) and p(x3, x4|x1, x2). These factorizations lead to a (variation dependent) parametrization in the binary case: if the variables are binary then p(X1 = 0), p(X2 = 0), p(X3 = 0|x1), p(X4 = 0|x2) and p(X3 = X4 = 0|x1, x2), with x1, x2 ∈ {0, 1}, are sufficient to specify any multivariate binary distribution obeying the global Markov property for G1; see [1]. Note that there are 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10 quantities here, which corresponds to the known dimension of this Markov model in the binary case.\nIt is possible to use the local directed Markov property for ADMGs in [11] (see §4.2), together with a given or-\ndering (consistent with the directed edges), to obtain factorizations in terms of univariate densities, as proposed in [9]. However, this strategy suffers from the following problem: if only one order is considered then the factorization corresponds to a DAG, and hence, in general, will not be sufficient capture all of the independencies given by the ADMG, e.g. ordering the vertices as they are numbered in G1 would give:\np(x1, x2, x3, x4) = p(x1)p(x2)p(x3|x1)p(x4|x1, x2, x3),\nwhich does not imply X1⊥X4. On the other hand if all consistent orderings are considered then the set of densities does not form a parametrization as the dimension is too large, e.g. for G1 we would specify: p(x1), p(x2), p(x3 | x1), p(x4 | x2), p(x3 | x1, x2) and p(x4 | x1, x2), which gives 14 parameters in the binary case. Consequently these are not all free: some are constrained to be deterministic functions of others. The factorization in this paper is more complicated as it involves multivariate joint densities, but it has the advantage that it does give a parametrization.\nIn an ADMG, a set A is said to be ancestrally closed if x → · · · → a in G with a ∈ A implies that x ∈ A. Our main result is then as follows: a distribution P obeys the global Markov property with respect to an ADMG G if and only if for every ancestrally closed set A:\np(XA) = ∏\nHi∈[A]G\np(XHi | XTi)\nwhere [A]G denotes a partition of A into sets {H1, . . . , Hk}, with corresponding conditioning sets T1, . . . , Tk; for details of the partition and conditioning sets see Theorem 4 below.\nThis generalizes and unifies three existing results for subclasses of ADMGs: First, the well-known factorization of an ancestrally closed set in a DAG D [10]:\np(XA) = ∏\nv∈A\np(Xv | XpaD(v)).\nSecond, the factorization associated with any set A in a bi-directed graph B [3]:\np(XA) = ∏\nC :C⊆A; C is connected in B,\nand C is inclusion maximal in A\np(XC);\nwhere a set C is connected if every pair of vertices in C are joined by a path in C, and a connected set C is inclusion maximal in A if there is no set of C∗, with C ⊂ C∗ ⊆ A, that is connected. (Note that in a bi-directed graph every set is ancestrally closed trivially since there are no directed edges.) Third the factorization associated with a bi-directed chain graph such as G1; see [1].\nThe paper is organized as follows: §2 contains basic definitions; §3 contains the factorization result; §4 outlines the proof."

      "text" : "A directed cycle is a sequence of edges x → · · · → x. If a directed mixed graph G contains no directed cycles then G is acyclic. There may be two edges between a pair of vertices in an acyclic directed mixed graph (ADMG), but in this case at least one edge must be bi-directed (x ↔ y): otherwise there would be a directed cycle (multiple edges of the same type are not permitted). The induced subgraph of G given by set A, denoted GA consists of the subgraph of G with vertex set A, and those edges in G with endpoints in A. The connected components of a graph G are\nFor a vertex x in a mixed graph G, paG(x) ≡ {v | v → x in G} is the set of parents of x; if y ∈ paG(x) then x ∈ chG(y), the set of children of y; spG(x) ≡ {v | v ↔ x in G} is the set of spouses1 of x; anG(x) ≡ {v | v → · · · → x in G or v = x} is the set of ancestors of x; similarly deG(x) ≡ {v | v ← · · · ← x in G or v = x} is the set of descendants of x. These definitions are applied disjunctively to sets of vertices, so that, for example,\npaG(A) ≡ ⋃\nx∈A\npaG(x), spG(A) ≡ ⋃\nx∈A\nspG(x).\n(Note that spG(A)∩A may be non-empty, and likewise for the other definitions.) A path between x and y in G is a sequence of edges 〈ǫ1, . . . , ǫn〉, such that there exists a sequence of distinct vertices 〈x ≡ w1, . . . , wn+1 ≡ y〉, (n≥0), where edge ǫi has endpoints wi, wi+1 (paths consisting of a single vertex are permitted for the purpose of simplifying proofs). We denote a subpath of a path π, by π(wj , wk+1) ≡ 〈ǫj , . . . , ǫk〉. It is necessary to specify a path as a sequence of edges rather than vertices because the latter does not specify a unique path when there may be two edges between a given pair of vertices. A path of the form x → · · · → y is a directed path from x to y.\nFor a mixed graph G with vertex set V we consider collections of random variables (Xv)v∈V taking values in probability spaces (Xv)v∈V , where the probability spaces are either real finite-dimensional vector spaces or finite discrete sets. For A ⊆ V we let XA ≡ ×v∈A(Xv), X ≡ XV and XA ≡ (Xv)v∈A. We use the usual shorthand notation: v denotes a vertex and a random variable Xv, likewise A denotes a vertex set and XA.\n1Note that our usage, though established, differs from that of some authors who use the term ‘spouse’ to denote the other parents of the children of a vertex in a DAG."

(Note that if this property holds for one vertex v ∈ D, then it holds for all vertices in D.) By extension, a set W will be said to have ancestrally closed districts if every district in W is ancestrally closed.\nProposition 3. If W ∈ A(G) then W has ancestrally closed districts.\nNote however that the converse is false: a set may have ancestrally closed districts but not be ancestral.

In chain graphs this is generalized so that the parents of an ‘undirected component’ precede the component itself. In the case of an ADMG graph, ‘blocks’ are heads (defined below) which are subsets of connected components of G↔. However, it is easy to find ADMG graphs in which there is no ordering under which every vertex that is a parent of at least one vertex in a given head, occurs prior to any vertex in that head. For example,\nin Figure 2, {1, 4} and {2, 3} form heads. It is easy to see that if 1 is ordered before 2 and 3, then we cannot also have 2 ordered before 1 and 4.\nThe upshot of this is that the inclusion of a term in the factorization in which vertex i is on the left of the conditioning bar, and j is on the right, does not preclude the inclusion of a term, in the same factorization, in which the reverse holds. For example, we associate with the graph in Figure 2, the factorization:\np(x1, x2, x3, x4) = p(x1, x4 | x2)p(x2, x3 | x1). (2)\nIt is easy to see that this factorization implies that X3⊥X4 | X1, X2. However, after marginalizing x3 and x4 it can be seen that (2) implies\np(x1, x2) = p(x1 | x2)p(x2 | x1),\nso X1⊥X2, which also follows from the global Markov property associated with this graph.

Thus by Lemma 15, disan(H)(H) = disan(ψ(k)(A))(H). Further, since ψ(k)(A) has ancestrally closed districts, and H ⊆ ψ(k)(A), disan(ψ(k)(A))(H) = disψ(k)(A)(H).

      "text" : "An inductive argument establishing Theorem 4 faces several challenges: If A is an ancestral set, there may be no head H ∈ [A]G such that A \\ H is an ancestral set: see for example the set {x1, x2, x3, x4} in Figure 2, in which {x1, x4} and {x2, x3} are the heads. Since Theorem 4 only makes assertions about factorizations over margins p(XA) where A is an ancestral set, this means that we cannot apply an inductive argument where we add one term at a time. Further, as the examples in section 3.4 make clear, the heads occurring in the decomposition of an ancestral set A do not necessarily occur in the decomposition of an ancestral superset A ∪ {x}. Thus any inductive argument which hypothesizes that the factorization holds for p(XA) and then extends this to p(XA∪{x}) must also transform the terms in the factorization of p(XA).\nWe first sketch our proof strategy by considering the example in Figure 4. Suppose, as an inductive hypothesis that, as required by Theorem 4,\np(a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d)\n= p(b1, c1|a1, c2, d)p(a1|c2)p(b2, c2|a2, c1, d)\n×p(a2|c1)p(d). (4)\nWe wish to show that the global Markov property implies that\np(a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d, e)\n= p(e, b1, b2|a1, a2, c1, c2, d)\n×p(d)p(a1, c1|c2)p(a2, c2|c1). (5)\nTo this end we use the chain rule to further factorize the terms in equation (4), as follows:\np(b1, c1|a1, c2, d) = p(b1|a1, c1, c2, d)p(c1|a1, c2, d),\np(b2, c2|a2, c1, d) = p(b2|a2, c1, c2, d)p(c2|a2, c1, d).\nSince c1 is m-separated from d given a1 and c2, p(c1|a1, c2, d) = p(c1|a1, c2). Likewise p(c2|a2, c1, d) = p(c2|a2, c1). Also since b1 is m-separated from a2 given {a1, c1, c2, d} we have p(b1|a1, c1, c2, d) = p(b1|a1, a2, c1, c2, d). Finally, we note that b2 is mseparated from {a1, b1} given {a2, c1, c2, d}, hence p(b2|a2, c1, c2, d) = p(b2|a1, a2, b1, c1, c2, d). We now obtain:\np(e|a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d)p(a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d)\n= (\np(e|a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2, d)\n× p(b1|a1, a2, c1, c2, d)p(b2|a1, a2, b1, c1, c2, d) )\n×p(d) ( p(c1|a1, c2)p(a1|c2) )\n× ( p(c2|a2, c1)p(a2|c1) )\nwhich establishes the required factorization (5). A key step in this argument was the ordering used to decompose p(b1, c1|a1, c2, d) into univariate marginals. Had this been decomposed into p(c1|a1, b1, c2, d)p(b1|a1, c2, d), the argument would not have gone through, as the global Markov property could not have been applied, and the terms could not have been re-arranged in the required manner.\nWe first consider the relation between the depth of a vertex in A, and in A ∪ {x}, (in the case where both sets are ancestral). We show that there exists a (not necessarily unique) total order on the vertices in A ∪ {x}, which is compatible with both orderings on the heads, in the sense that a precedes b if the head containing a precedes the head containing b in [A]G , or in [A∪{x}]G . We use this total order to factor the head terms in the factorization of p(xA), given by the inductive hypothesis, into univariate terms. We will then apply the global Markov property to add or remove terms to the conditioning sets as required. Finally, regrouping terms will yield the required factorization of p(xA∪{x}).\nLemma 19. If A,A ∪ {x} ∈ A(G), (x /∈ A) then for w ∈ A, depA(w) ≤ depA∪{x}(w).\nProof: By induction on k = depA∪{x}(w). 2\nLemma 20. If A,A ∪ {x} ∈ A(G), (x /∈ A) then for w ∈ A, depA∪{x}(w) ≤ depA(w) + 1.\nA total ordering < on the vertices in a set A ∈ A(G) will be said to be consistent with the depth ordering induced by A, if whenever depA(b) < depA(c), then b < c.\nCorollary 21. If A,A ∪ {x} ∈ A(G), (x /∈ A) then there exists a total ordering on the vertices in A that is consistent with the depth ordering induced by A and the depth ordering induced by A ∪ {x}.\nWe note in passing that this Corollary cannot, in general, be extended to ancestral sets differing by more than one vertex. Consider the sets A = {c, d, e}, and A∗ = {a, b, c, d, e} in Figure 3. depA(e) = 1 > depA(d) = 0, but depA∗(d) = 2 > depA∗(e) = 1.\nIf < is a total ordering, define suc<(x) = {v | v ≥ x}."
