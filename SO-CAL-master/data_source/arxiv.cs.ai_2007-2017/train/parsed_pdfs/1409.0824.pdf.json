      "text" : "One difficulty in constructing an adequate deontic logic is the instability of intuition about simple principles. Let O applied to a formula represent the obligation to render the formula true, and consider the following principle (discussed by Ross, 1941, cited in McNamara, 2010).\n(1) Op→ O(p ∨ q)\nIs (1) valid? It is tempting to think so if you read the disjunction as “at least one.” Then the formula can be glossed as:\nIf you are obliged to see to it that p is true then you are obliged to see to it that at least one of p, q is true.\nOn the other hand, (1) seems unpersuasive if p stands for a nice state of affairs (you contribute to the Red Cross) and q for something bad (you pinch the cat). In this case, p ∨ q does not appear to represent a distinct obligation; at least, satisfying the\n∗Contact: osherson@princeton.edu, weinstein@cis.upenn.edu\ndisjunction with q seems not to meet any moral requirement. [The logic advanced below will declare (1) to be invalid.]\nSeveral other challenges to the development of deontic logic are discussed in McNamara (2010, §4). They encourage a tolerant attitude about alternative systems in the expectation that distinct approaches will prove necessary in different contexts (for example, legal versus technological; see Meyer et al., 1994). It is in this spirit that we here offer a deontic system built upon the preference logic advanced in Osherson and Weinstein (2012). The plan is to define deontic modalities like obligation in terms of the preference relation, then examine the consequences that follow from the underlying preference logic. The idea of deriving obligation from preference is based on Hansson (2002), and explored more thoroughly in Hansson (2013, §6.2). Our system differs from earlier work because of its distinctive logic of preference.\nA survey of deontic logics is available in Hilpinen and McNamara (2013), including discussion of the familiar Kripke-style semantics for obligation. A very different approach, based on default logic, is advanced in Horty (2012, Ch. 3). The logic of preference is reviewed in Hansson (2001), and more recently in Liu (2008); Dietrich and List (2009). Our system builds upon the concept of “selecting” a possible world to represent a formula; this technique was introduced by Stalnaker (1968) for the analysis of counterfactuals. The idea of attaching values to possible worlds in order to analyze preference among statements (pivotal in our system) appears in Rescher (1967) and elsewhere. An alternative perspective on preference is advanced in de Jongh and Liu (2009).\nWe proceed to a summary of our approach to preference logic, then return to deontic modality. The appendix sketches the proofs of the propositions that follow."

Then ϕ ≻ ψ is true if and only if\nA envisions a situation in which ϕ is true and that otherwise differs little from her actual situation (if ϕ is already true then A’s actual situation may well be the one she envisions). Likewise, A envisions a second situation that is like her actual situation except that ψ is true. Finally, the utility of the first imagined situation exceeds that of the second.\nIn our formal semantics, the appeal to utility is underwritten by a function that maps possible worlds into real numbers. Several generalizations involving just an ordering of worlds are explored in Osherson and Weinstein (2012). Also, the latter paper represents utility as fractionated into separate scales thought of as reasons for preference. For example, if A is contemplating a political career, different considerations might compete in her mind, leading to a final evaluation of the options proceed or desist. To keep the present system as simple as possible, we here dispense with the issue of utility aggregation (explored in Osherson and Weinstein, 2012, 2013), letting embody relative value “all things considered.”\nThe appeal to alternative situations is based on a selection function of the kind envisioned by Stalnaker (1968), namely, as mapping a world-plus-proposition into another\nworld that satisfies the proposition. Intuitively, the chosen world is “similar” to the original world; it might even be the original world if the proposition is true in it. To enforce similarity, we will ultimately impose a powerful condition on selection functions.\nNote that L allows embedded occurrences of ≻ as in: p ≻ (q ≻ r). If p is loneliness, q is amassing great wealth, and r is finding true love then the formula would be true of A if she would rather be lonely than prefer riches to love (a real romantic)."

Let us denote this judgment by C(p, q), where C is the dyadic modality of conditional obligation. It might be thought that monadic obligation (denoted by O) is more fundamental than C, allowing the latter to be defined in one of the ways shown here:\n(10) (a) C(p, q) def = O(p→ q)\n(b) C(p, q) def = p→ Oq\nBut neither definition is satisfactory. Since p → q is equivalent to ¬q → ¬p, the first suggests that C(p, q) if and only if C(¬q,¬p). Letting p, q be given by (9), we see that, to the contrary, C(p, q) can be true and C(¬q,¬p) false. For in a situation where Social Security revenues are not enhanced we are not obliged to lower life expectancy. The second definition in (10) entails that C(p, q) ∨C(¬p, q) is a logical truth, which is odd. (Neither attending baseball games nor failing to requires that I root for the Red Sox.)\nMore discussion of the obstacles to representing conditional obligation by a composite of O and the material conditional is available in McNamara (2010, §4.5).

We will not attempt to survey all the alternatives to (11) that come to mind but are unsuitable. One illustration suffices. The definition\nC(ϕ,ψ) def = ¬ϕ ≻ (ϕ ∧ ¬ψ)\nseems promising at first. (ϕ carries committment to ψ if it’s better that ϕ be false than be true without ψ.) But consider:\np : You save someone from drowning.\nq : You exhibit modesty when subsequently interviewed.\nFor these sentences, C(p, q) is plausible but ¬p ≻ (p∧¬q) is not since it’s better to save someone and brag about it than to let the victim drown.\nDefinition (11), as well as its competitors, is open to concerns about relevance. If p is tying your shoelaces, and q is saving a rainforest then p ∧ q is better than p ∧ ¬q. Yet it seems strange to believe that p carries the obligation q. It is not the mission of our logic, however, to keep track of all the circumstances giving rise to obligations; there may well be a back story that connects your shoelaces to the fate of a rain forest. Definition (11) should rather be assessed in terms of the plausibility of its consequences on the assumption that p carries the obligation q. Moreover, in a given application of deontic logic, all the concepts in play might be relevant to each other.\nFollowing Hilpinen (2001, p. 171), the two monadic modalities (obligation and permission) may be derived from C.\n(12) Definition: For all ψ ∈ L,\nOψ def = C(⊤, ψ) Pψ def = ¬O¬ψ\nThus, ψ is obligatory if it is required by the logically true proposition. ψ is permissible if its negation is not obligatory. Unravelling the definitions yields:\n(13) Proposition: For all ψ ∈ L,\n(a) |= (Oψ) ↔ (ψ ≻ ¬ψ)\n(b) |= (Pψ) ↔ (ψ ¬ψ)\nThat is, ψ is obligatory if its truth makes for a better world than does its falsity; ψ is permitted provided its truth doesn’t make things worse. The semantics of presented in Section 2.3, along with Definitions (11) and (12), will be called the basic system. Easy consequences of the basic system include:\n(14) Proposition: For all θ, ψ ∈ L,\n(a) ♦(θ) ∧ ♦(¬θ) |= P(θ) ∨ P(¬θ)\n(b) Oθ |= Pθ\n(c) |= ¬((Oθ) ∧O(¬θ))\n(d) |= ¬O⊤ |= ¬O⊥ |= ¬P⊥ |= ¬P⊤\n(e) C(θ, ψ) |= ♦(θ ∧ ψ) ∧ ♦(θ ∧ ¬ψ).\nGlosses for (14) are straightforward; for example, (14)e asserts that conditional obligations involve contingent propositions. The same is true for monadic obligation, as seen in (14)d — which already distinguishes the basic system from deontic logic based on Kripke models. The principles in (14) can be questioned but they are not outlandish. Nonetheless, the harvest of deontic principles in (14) is rather meager. Richer results will emerge in Section 4.1 when we relativize validity to a narrower class of models."

If Harry has already been thrown overboard (despite your obligation), then you’re not required to make Tom join him.\nItem (24)d is undermined by setting p = I’m invited to a party honoring a close friend, q = I go to the party, and r = the police advise me not to go. For (24)e, consider p = I go to church, and q = I shout hallelujah. Although it may be true that going to my particular church obliges me to shout hallelujah, and that I am obliged to go to church, it doesn’t follow that I’m obliged to shout hallelujah, for I might not have fulfilled my obligation to go to church (and shouting hallelujah outside of church annoys people). The contrasting case with p rather than Op is listed among the ∆-validities as (19)c, above. Item (24)f is open to the same kind of counter example as (24)e; we rehearse it in the Discussion section in light of the centrality of the principle to standard deontic logic.\nA similar consideration undermines (24)g, a putative transitivity principle for conditional obligation. Suppose that an invasion by the enemy obliges us to stand and fight, and that the latter obliges us to blow up the bridges. It doesn’t follow that an invasion obliges us to blow up the bridges. It depends on whether we stand and fight\nor capitulate, that is, whether we live up to our first conditional obligation. If not, we shouldn’t blow up the bridges, violating transitivity.\nItem (24)h raises the issue of contradictory obligations. Perhaps a person could have the obligation to spend Saturday morning at the office (due to unfinished work that people are waiting for), and also the obligation to spend Saturday morning with her children. We might nonetheless resist the idea that the impossible conjunction of the two duties is obligatory. Such is the view of the logic developed here, which restricts obligation to contingent propositions. [Cf. (14)d]. Similar remarks apply to the related principle (24)i. For deeper discussion of moral conflict, see Horty (2012, Ch. 4).\nThe modal collapse envisioned in (24)j does not seem deontically viable. Let p = No one consumes more than 500 calories per day. It would be good if that were good since we would save on groceries. But it would not be good that p, since that would leave everyone malnourished. Regarding (24)k, let p be that you promise marriage to Joan, r be that you promise marriage to Jane, and q that you go to City Hall to swear monogamy. Each promise separately requires the oath of monogamy but their conjunction seems not to. Next, the formula O(Op → p) appearing in (24)l is initially attractive; it says that it is good that if p is good then p is true. But let p be that global temperature is stable, and consider the equivalent formulation: O(¬p→ P¬p) — which says (dubiously) it is good that if temperatures are unstable then this is permissible. Moreover, there might be conflicting good things as in p = The nation is united behind candidate Jones, q = The nation is united behind candidate Smith. Each of p, q might be good (to avoid political deadlock) but it can’t be good for their individual goodness to make each true since their joint truth is impossible.\nThis brings us to (24)m. The item may seem to be misclassified as invalid if read as the inference from “p is obligatory” to “at least one of p, q is obligatory.” But the appeal of the latter inference might rely on the illicit interpretation of “at least one of p, q is obligatory” as “either p is obligatory or q is obligatory (or both), a different assertion [see (25)b below]. Observe that if O(p) entails O(p ∨ q) then surely O(¬p) entails O(¬p ∨ ¬q) hence P(p ∧ q) entails P(q). But the latter assertion is open to the same objection raised against (24)b. That is, it might be permissible for a medical team to anaesthetize and make an incision without it being permitted tout court to make an incision; for, the incision is forbidden in case the anaesthetic was forgotten. Note also that the substitution of ¬p for q in the conclusion of (24)m yields O(⊤) which might be considered objectionable [as mentioned above in connection with (14)d].\nFurther invalid inferences are provided by the next proposition. Their deontic implausibility can be easily seen from examples like those deployed above. Some of the items in (25) have rather scant plausibility. They are included as evidence that our\nlogic does not “over-generate.”\n(25) Proposition: For every weighting function p:\n(a) Pp ∧ Pq 6|= {p} P(p ∧ q)\n(b) O(p ∨ q) 6|= {p} Op ∨Oq (c) p→ q 6|= {p} Op→ Oq\n(d) Op 6|= {p} O(p ∧ q)\n(e) Pp 6|= {p} P(p ∧ q)\n(f) ∅ 6|= {p} C(p, q) ∨ C(q, p)\n(g) O(p ∨ q) 6|= {p} Op\n(h) Op 6|= {p} p\n(i) Pp 6|= {p} POp\n(j) (¬q ≻ ¬p) ∧Op 6|= {p} Oq"

      "text" : "Via the foregoing developments, we have attempted to construct deontic modality from binary preference. Three systems were examined. The most basic embraces arbitrary models of the underlying preference logic and hence yields the fewest deontic validities [e.g., those exhibited in Proposition (14)]. The ∆ system narrows the class of models by identifying worlds with subsets of propositional variables, and requiring selection to minimize the symmetric difference between chosen and candidate worlds. New theorems emerge [see Proposition (19)]. The third system imposes an additional constraint on selection by declaring some variables to be more stable than others when choosing a possible world. This yields further validities [Proposition (23)].\nAt the same time, many implausible deontic principles are invalid even in the most constrained, third system [see Propositions (24), (25)]. Indeed, we hope to have shown that preference-based deontic logic makes tenable distinctions between validity and invalidity, especially when the impact of an obligation is distinguished from the impact of actually fulfilling the obligation [as already noted in Hintikka (1971)]. To illustrate the latter point one more time, consider again (24)f:\nO(p→ q) therefore O(p) → O(q)\nThis inference is central to standard deontic logic (McNamara, 2010, §2.1) but is invalid in our framework. Its intuitive invalidity is revealed by the instances:\np = I promise to call this evening.\nq = I call this evening.\nFor these statements, O(p→ q) may well be true (promise keeping). But Op is nonetheless insufficient to secure Oq; for, O(p → q) ∧Op is consistent with my failing to fulfill Op (even though it’s my obligation). In this case, the obligation Oq is not in force (or at least, not for promise reasons). Other points of divergence between standard deontic logic and the system advanced here include the inference from Op to O(p∨q), discussed in the Introduction and in connection with Proposition (24)m.\nThe goal, of course, is not to construct the uniquely accurate deontic logic; there is too much variability in judgment for such a project. Rather, we hope to populate the space of credible systems by starting from a novel semantics, namely, the preference semantics elaborated in Osherson and Weinstein (2012). A wide range of deontic logics may prove helpful in analyzing obligation and related concepts, as well as facilitating applications to Decision Science, jurisprudence, etc.\nThe underlying preference semantics can be enriched in several ways, each generating a distinct deontic system. As mentioned earlier, we have here exploited only a single utility scale whereas a plurality might be envisioned, measuring different aspects of morality (fairness, well being of the least favored, etc.). The question then arises how the scales should be combined; see the discussion in Osherson and Weinstein (2012, §5.3), Osherson and Weinstein (2013, §8-9). Likewise, new constraints on models may be introduced, and the language can be enriched with quantifiers (op. cit.). In each case, a wealth of axiomatic and decidability issues arise."

      "text" : "Proposition (13) is evident, and implies Proposition (14)a,b. The last four items of Proposition (14) follow from clause (d) of Definition (6). For the harder propositions, we provide some partial proofs.\nProof of Proposition (19)\nWe illustrate the proof of Proposition (19) by doing clause (a):\nOp ∧ (¬p ≻ ¬q) |=∆ Oq\nTo prove this assertion it must be shown that Op∧ (¬p ≻ ¬q)[M ] ⊆ Oq[M ], for all ∆ models M. Let ϕ be (p ≻ ¬p)∧(¬p ≻ ¬q), and let ψ be q ≻ ¬q. By Proposition (13)a it suffices to show that ϕ[M ] ⊆ ψ[M ] for all ∆ models M. Let ∆ model M = (W, s, u, t) be given. We partition W into four cosets:\n(26) (a) worlds that include both p and q.\n(b) worlds that include p but not q.\n(c) worlds that include q but not p. and\n(d) worlds that include neither p nor q.\nArbitrary worlds of these four types will be denoted by [pq], [pq̄], [p̄q], and [p̄q̄]. We consider in turn the four kinds of worlds distinguished in (26). In each case it must be shown that if the world belongs to ϕ[M ] then it belongs to ψ[M ].\nTo begin, choose a world [pq] of type (26)a. Because s is ∆-based, we have:\n(27) (a) s([pq], p[M ]) = [pq]\n(b) s([pq], q[M ]) = [pq]\n(c) s([pq],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(d) s([pq],¬q[M ]) = [pq̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [pq], [pq̄], [p̄q] iff v belongs to all three of them. Suppose that [pq] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Then:\n(28) (a) u(s([pq],¬p[M ])) > u(s([pq],¬q[M ]))\n(b) u(s([pq], p[M ])) > u(s([pq],¬p[M ]))\nSo by (27) and (28):\n(29) (a) u([p̄q]) > u([pq̄])\n(b) u([pq]) > u([p̄q])\nDirectly from (29):\nu([pq]) > u([pq̄]),\nhence by (27):\n(30) u(s([pq], q[M ])) > u(s([pq],¬q[M ]))\nAnd (30) implies that [pq] ∈ ψ[M ].\nNext, choose a world [pq̄] of type (26)b. Because s is ∆-based, we have:\n(31) (a) s([pq̄], p[M ]) = [pq̄]\n(b) s([pq̄], q[M ]) = [pq]\n(c) s([pq̄],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\n(d) s([pq̄],¬q[M ]) = [pq̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [pq], [pq̄], [p̄q̄] iff v belongs to all three of them. Suppose that [pq̄] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Then:\n(32) (a) u(s([pq̄],¬p[M ])) > u(s([pq̄],¬q[M ]))\n(b) u(s([pq̄], p[M ])) > u(s([pq̄],¬p[M ]))\nSo by (31) and (32):\n(33) (a) u([p̄q̄]) > u([pq̄])\n(b) u([pq̄]) > u([p̄q̄])\nBut (33) is impossible, contradicting [pq̄] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Thus, [pq̄] is not a counter example to ϕ[M ] ⊆ ψ[M ].\nNext, choose a world [p̄q] of type (26)c. Because s is ∆-based, we have:\n(34) (a) s([p̄q], p[M ]) = [pq]\n(b) s([p̄q], q[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(c) s([p̄q],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(d) s([p̄q],¬q[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [pq], [p̄q], [p̄q̄] iff v belongs to all three of them. Suppose that [p̄q] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Then:\n(35) (a) u(s([p̄q],¬p[M ])) > u(s([p̄q],¬q[M ]))\n(b) u(s([p̄q], p[M ])) > u(s([p̄q],¬p[M ]))\nSo by (34) and (35):\n(36) (a) u([p̄q]) > u([p̄q̄])\n(b) u([pq]) > u([p̄q])\nDirectly from (36)a and (34)b,d:\n(37) u(s([p̄q], q[M ])) > u(s([p̄q],¬q[M ]))\nAnd (37) implies that [p̄q] ∈ ψ[M ].\nFinally, choose a world [p̄q̄] of type (26)d. Because s is ∆-based, we have:\n(38) (a) s([p̄q̄], p[M ]) = [pq̄]\n(b) s([p̄q̄], q[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(c) s([p̄q̄],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\n(d) s([p̄q̄],¬q[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [pq̄], [p̄q], [p̄q̄] iff v belongs to all three of them. Suppose that [p̄q̄] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Then:\n(39) (a) u(s([p̄q̄],¬p[M ])) > u(s([p̄q̄],¬q[M ]))\n(b) u(s([p̄q̄], p[M ])) > u(s([p̄q̄],¬p[M ]))\nSo by (38)c,d and (39)a:\nu([p̄q̄]) > u([p̄q̄]).\nBut this is impossible, contradicting [p̄q̄] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Thus, [p̄q̄] is not a counter example to ϕ[M ] ⊆ ψ[M ]. 2\nProof of Proposition (23)\nWe illustrate the proof of Proposition (23) by doing clause (h):\nO(p ∨ q) ∧ ¬q |= P Op\nwhere P is the class of weighting function that assign greater value to q than to either p or r. To prove the assertion it must be shown that O(p ∨ q) ∧ ¬q[M ] ⊆ Op[M ], for all ∆ models with p-based selection function drawn from P. Let ϕ be (((p ∨ q) ≻ (¬p ∧ ¬q)) ∧ ¬q), and let ψ be p ≻ ¬p. By Proposition (13)a it suffices to show that ϕ[M ] ⊆ ψ[M ] for all ∆ models with p-based selection function drawn from P. Let M be such a model. We partition W into the four cosets indicated in (26), and denote their members using the same notation as before. Observe that for all worlds w of types [pq] or [p̄q], w 6∈ ϕ[M ]. It thus suffices to show that if [pq̄] ∈ ϕ[M ] then [pq̄] ∈ ψ[M ], and that if [p̄q̄] ∈ ϕ[M ] then [p̄q̄] ∈ ψ[M ]. First consider [pq̄]. Because s is P-based (and hence ∆), we have:\n(40) (a) s([pq̄],¬p ∧ ¬q[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\n(b) s([pq̄], p[M ]) = [pq̄]\n(c) s([pq̄],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\n(d) s([pq̄], p ∨ q[M ]) = [pq̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [p̄q̄], [pq̄] iff v belongs to both of them. Suppose that [pq̄] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Then:\n(41) u(s([pq̄], p ∨ q[M ])) > u(s([pq̄],¬p ∧ ¬q[M ]))\nSo by (40) and (41):\n(42) u([pq̄]) > u([p̄q̄])\nhence by (40):\n(43) u(s([pq̄], p[M ])) > u(s([pq̄],¬p[M ]))\nAnd (43) implies that [pq̄] ∈ ψ[M ].\nNow consider [p̄q̄]. Because s is P-based, we have:\n(44) (a) s([p̄q̄],¬p ∧ ¬q[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\n(b) s([p̄q̄], p[M ]) = [pq̄]\n(c) s([p̄q̄],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\n(d) s([p̄q̄], p ∨ q[M ]) = [pq̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [p̄q̄], [pq̄] iff v belongs to both of them. Note that (44)d relies on our choice of weighting function. Since the function gives greater weight to q than to p, the polarity of q is preserved rather than that of p when a choice between the two must be made.\nSuppose that [p̄q̄] ∈ ϕ[M ]. Then:\n(45) u(s([p̄q̄], p ∨ q[M ])) > u(s([p̄q̄],¬p ∧ ¬q[M ]))\nSo by (44) and (45):\n(46) u([pq̄]) > u([p̄q̄])\nhence by (44):\n(47) u(s([p̄q̄], p[M ])) > u(s([p̄q̄],¬p[M ]))\nAnd (47) implies that [p̄q̄] ∈ ψ[M ]. 2\nProof of Propositions (24) and (25)\nWe do (24)f:\nFor every weighting function p: O(p→ q) 6|= {p} O(p) → O(q)\nLet ϕ = (p → q) ≻ (p ∧ ¬q) and ψ = (p ≻ ¬p) → (q ≻ ¬q). By Proposition (13)a it suffices to show that for every weighting function p, there is ∆ model M = (W, s, u, t) with p-based selection function such that for some w ∈ W: w ∈ ϕ[M ] but w 6∈ ψ[M ]. We partition W into the four cosets indicated in (26), and denote their members using the same notation as before. Pick a world of form [p̄q], Let M = (W, s, u, t) be such that:\n(48) (a) s([p̄q], p → q[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(b) s([p̄q], p ∧ ¬q[M ]) = [pq̄]\n(c) s([p̄q], p[M ]) = [pq]\n(d) s([p̄q],¬p[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(e) s([p̄q], q[M ]) = [p̄q]\n(f) s([p̄q],¬q[M ]) = [p̄q̄]\nwhere for all variables v not equal to p or q, v belongs to one of [p̄q], [pq̄], [pq], [p̄q̄] iff v belongs to all four of them. It is clear from (48) that s may be chosen to be p-based for any weighting function p inasmuch as all of the selections are dictated exclusively by minimizing symmetric difference of variables in the sense of subset. (See Section 4.1 above.)\nLet utility function u be such that:\n(49) (a) u(s([p̄q], p→ q[M ])) = u([p̄q]) = 2\n(b) u(s([p̄q], p ∧ ¬q[M ])) = u([pq̄]) = 1\n(c) u(s([p̄q], p[M ])) = u([pq]) = 3\n(d) u(s([p̄q],¬p[M) ]) = u([p̄q]) = 2\n(e) u(s([p̄q], q[M ])) = u([p̄q]) = 2\n(f) u(s([p̄q],¬q[M) ]) = u([p̄q̄]) = 4\nThen u(s([p̄q], p → q[M ])) = 2 > 1 = u(s([p̄q], p ∧ ¬q[M ])) so [p̄q] ∈ ϕ[M ]. On the other hand, u(s([p̄q], p[M ])) = 3 > 2 = u(s([p̄q],¬p[M) ]) but u(s([p̄q], q[M ])) = 2 < 4 = u(s([p̄q],¬q[M) ]). Hence, [p̄q] 6∈ ψ[M ]. 2"
