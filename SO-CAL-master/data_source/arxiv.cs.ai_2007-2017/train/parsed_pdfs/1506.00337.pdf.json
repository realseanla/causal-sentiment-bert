      "text" : "A dominant part of qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning (QSTR) research focus on the study of individual or multiple qualitative calculi. Roughly speaking, a qualitative calculus M is simply a finite class of relations over a universe U of spatial or temporal entities which form a Boolean algebra. Usually, we assume that the identity relation is contained in one atomic relation in M and relations in M are closed under converse [19]. Well-known qualitative calculi include Point Algebra (PA) [28,26] and Interval Algebra (IA) [1] for representing temporal relations and Region Connection Calculus RCC5 and RCC8 [22], Cardinal Relation Algebra [12,18], and Rectangle Algebra [14,3] for representing spatial relations.\nFor convenience, we write RCC5/8 for either RCC5 or RCC8. Since the composition of two RCC5/8 relations R,S is not necessarily a relation in RCC5/8 [11,16], we\n? Work supported by the Australian Research Council under DP120104159 and FT0990811. ??

Unlike RCC5/8, the calculi PA, IA, CRA and RA are closed under composition and are all relation algebras. With weak composition, RCC5/8 is also a relation algebra.\nUsing a qualitative calculus M, we represent spatial or temporal information in terms of relations inM, and formulate a spatial or temporal problem as a set of qualitative constraints (called a qualitative constraint network or QCN). A qualitative constraint has the form (xRy), which specifies that two variables x, y are related by the relation R inM. A QCN N is consistent if there exists an assignment of values in U to variables in N such that all constraints in N are satisfied simultaneously. If this is the case, we call this assignment a solution of N . We say M is minimal if, for each constraint (xRy) in N , R is the minimal (or strongest) relation between x and y that is entailed by N . We say N is globally consistent if every partial solution (i.e. a partial assignment that satisfies all constraints in a restriction of N ) can be extended to a solution of N .\nThe consistency problem and the minimal labelling problem (MLP) are two major reasoning tasks of QSTR research. The consistency problem decides whether a QCN has a solution and the MLP decides if it is minimal. These problems have been investigated in depth in the past three decades for many qualitative calculi in the literature, see e.g. [1,2,3,5,15,18,21,23,26].\nBoth problems are in general NP-hard for IA, CRA, RCC5/8, and RA. Local consistency algorithms like path consistency algorithm (PCA) are designed for solving these problems approximately [1]. A QCN N = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is path consistent (PC) if each Rij is non-empty and contained in the (weak) composition of Rik and Rkj for any k. Applying PCA will either find an inconsistency in N in case N is not path consistent, or return a path consistent network that is equivalent to N , which is also known as the algebraic closure or a-closure of N [19]. A QCN N = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is called basic or atomic if every relation Rij is an atomic relation inM.\nInterestingly, for every qualitative calculusMmentioned in this paper and any basic QCNN overM, path consistency ensures consistency, i.e. any path consistent network has a solution. This holds also for any tractable subclass S of M that contains all basic relations and is closed under (weak) composition, intersection, and converse. For example, it was found in [21] that there exists a unique maximal tractable subclass of IA, written as H and called ORD-Horn. It was proved, also in [21], that any path consistent network overH is consistent.\nIn this paper, we study distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi. We assume M is a qualitative calculus which satisfies the condition that every path consistent basic QCN has a solution. A subalgebra of M is a subclass of M that contains all atomic relations and is closed under (weak) composition, intersection, and converse. A subalgebra S is distributive if (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersection, i.e. R (S ∩ T ) = (R S) ∩ (R T ) and (S ∩ T ) R = (S R) ∩ (T R) for any R,S, T ∈ S with S ∩ T 6= ∅.\nAlthough distributive subalgebra is a new concept proposed recently in [9,15], several examples of distributive subalgebras have been studied before. The first such a\nsubalgebra, the subclass of convex IA relations CIA, was found in [17], where Ligozat also proved that path consistent networks over CIA is globally consistent. As every globally consistent network is minimal, this shows that path consistent networks over CIA is also minimal. Later, Chandra and Pujari [5] defined a class of convex RCC8 relations (written D841 in [15] and this paper) and proved that every path consistent network over D841 is minimal. More recently, Amaneddine and Condotta [2] found another subclass of IA, written as SIA, and proved that CIA and SIA are the only maximal subalgebras of IA such that path consistent networks over which are globally consistent. It turns out that these subalgebras are all maximal distributive subalgebras of IA or RCC8 [15].\nThe important concept of distributive subalgebra was also found very useful in identifying a subnetwork that is equivalent to a given one but has no redundant relations. Such a subnetwork is called a prime subnetwork in [9,15]. It was proved there that every constraint network over a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8 has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be found in cubic time; and, in contrast, it is in general NP-hard to decide if a constraint is non-redundant in an arbitrary RCC5/8 constraint network. The cubic time algorithm for finding the prime subnetwork is very useful in applications such as computing, storing, and compressing the relationships between spatial objects and hence saving space for storage and communication. We refer the reader to [15] for a real-world application example and detailed discussions.\nAs the focus of [9] and [15] is redundancy in RCC5/8 constraint networks, there are several interesting topics left untouched, which are the subject of this paper. We first give a characterisation of distributive subalgebras in terms of intersections of relations and then compute and find all maximal distributive subalgebras for every qualitative calculus mentioned before. Lastly, we establish two nice properties regarding partial path consistency [4] and variable elimination [30] of constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra. These properties will play an important role in efficient reasoning with sparse constraint networks involving a large number of variables.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we first give a short introduction of the qualitative calculi mentioned above and recall basic notions including weak composition, path and global consistency. Section 3 then presents a characterisation of distributive subalgebras and Section 4 shows how we compute and find all maximal distributive subalgebras of these calculi. We then prove in Section 5 two important properties of distributive subalgebras that will be used in efficient reasoning with large sparse constraint networks. In Section 6 we discuss the connection between distributive subalgebras and conceptual neighbourhood graphs, and relation with classical CSPs. The last section then concludes the paper."

Let U be the set of closed intervals on the real line. Thirteen binary relations between two intervals x = [x−, x+] and y = [y−, y+] are defined by the order of the four endpoints of x and y, see Table 1. The Interval Algebra is generated by these JEPD relations.\nWe write\nBIA = {b,m,o, s,d, f,eq, fi,di, si,oi,mi,bi} (1)\nfor the set of basic IA relations. Ligozat [17] defines the dimension of a basic interval relation as 2 minus the number of equalities appearing in the definition of the relation (see Table 1). That is, for basic relations we have\ndim(eq) = 0,dim(m) = dim(s) = dim(f) = 1,dim(b) = dim(o) = dim(d) = 2.\nFor a non-basic relation R we define\ndim(R) = max{dim(θ) : θ is a basic relation in R}. (2)\nUsing the conceptual neighbourhood graph (CNG) of IA [13], Ligozat [17] gives a geometrical characterisation for ORD-Horn relations. Consider the CNG of IA (shown in Table 1 (ii)) as a partially ordered set (Bint, ) (by interpreting any relation to be smaller than its right or upper neighbours). For θ1, θ2 ∈ Bint with θ1 θ2, we write [θ1, θ2] as the set of basic interval relations θ such that θ1 θ θ2, and call such a relation a convex interval relation. An IA relation R is called pre-convex if it can be obtained from a convex relation by removing one or more basic relations with dimension lower than R. For example, [o,eq] = {o, s, fi,eq} is a convex relation and {o,eq} is a pre-convex relation. Ligozat has shown that ORD-Horn relations are precisely preconvex relations. Every path consistent network over H is consistent [21]. In addition, every path consistent network over CIA is globally consistent and minimal [17]."

We assume an orthogonal basis in the Euclidean plane. For a bounded region a, its minimum bounding rectangle (MBR), denoted by M(a), is the smallest rectangle which contains a and whose sides are parallel to the axes of the basis. We write Ix(a) and Iy(a) as, respectively, the x- and y-projections ofM(a). The basic rectangle relation between two bounded regions a, b is α ⊗ β iff (Ix(a), Ix(b)) ∈ α and (Iy(a), Iy(b)) ∈ β, where α, β are two basic IA relations (see Figure 4 for illustration). We write BRA for the set of basic rectangle relations, i.e.,\nBRA = {α⊗ β : α, β ∈ BIA}. (3)\nThere are 169 different basic rectangle relations in BRA. The Rectangle Algebra (RA) is the algebra generated by relations in BRA [3].\nHenceforth, for two IA relations R,S, we will write R ⊗ S for the (non-basic) relation {α ⊗ β : α ∈ R, β ∈ S, α, β ∈ B}; analogously, for two subclasses of IA relations R and S, we will write R ⊗ S for the set of RA relations {R ⊗ S : R ∈ R, S ∈ S}. The following lemma is straightforward.\nLemma 1. Let ∆ = {vi(Rij ⊗ Sij)vj}ni,j=1 be an RA network, where Rij and Sij are arbitrary IA relations.

Suppose α, β, γ are three basic RCC5/8 relations. Then we have\nγ ∈ α β ⇔ γ ∩ (α ◦ β) 6= ∅. (4)\nThe weak composition of two (non-basic) relations R and S is computed as follows:\nR S = ⋃ {α β : α ∈ R, β ∈ S}.\nBecause PA, IA, CRA and RA are closed under composition, we have\nProposition 1. For M being PA, IA, CRA or RA, weak composition is the same as composition, i.e. for any R,S ∈M, we have R ◦ S = R S.\nProposition 2 (See [10]). With the weak composition operation , the converse operation −1, and the identity relation, PA, IA, RCC5/8, CRA, and RA are relation algebras. In particular, the weak composition operation is associative. Moreover, for PA, IA, RCC5/8, CRA, and RA relations R,S, T , we have the following cycle law\n(R S) ∩ T 6= ∅⇔ (R−1 T ) ∩ S 6= ∅⇔ (T S−1) ∩R 6= ∅.

We say a network N = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is path consistent if for every\n1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n, we have\n∅ 6=Rij ⊆ Rik Rkj .\nIn general, path consistency can be enforced by calling the following rule until an empty constraint occurs (then N is inconsistent) or the network becomes stable\nRij ← (Rik Rkj) ∩Rij ,\nwhere 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n are arbitrary. A cubic time algorithm, henceforth called the path consistency algorithm or PCA, has been devised to enforce path consistency. For any qualitative constraint network N , the PCA either detects inconsistency of N or returns a path consistent network, written Np, which is equivalent to N and also known as the algebraic closure or a-closure of N [19]. It is easy to see that in this case Np refines N , i.e., we have Sij ⊆ Rij for each constraint (viSijvj) in Np.\nDefinition 5. LetM be a qualitative calculus with universe U . SupposeN = {viTijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a QCN over M and V = {v1, ..., vn}. For a pair of variables vi, vj ∈ V (i 6= j) and a basic relation α in Tij , we say α is feasible if there exists a solution (a1, a2, . . . , an) in U of N such that (ai, aj) is an instance of α. We say N is minimal if α is feasible for every pair of variables vi, vj (i 6= j) and every basic relation α in Tij .\nA scenario of N is a basic network with form Θ = {viθijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}, where each θij is a basic relation in Tij . A scenario is consistent if it has a solution.

This implies that there exist R0, S0, T0 ∈ ̂{Rx} ∪ Di which do not satisfy Helly’s condition (8). Note that R0 ⊗ ?, S0⊗?, and T0⊗? are all in ̂{R} ∪ Di ⊗Dj . However, the three relationsR0⊗?, S0⊗?, and T0 ⊗ ? do not satisfy (8), which means that ̂{R} ∪ Di ⊗Dj is not distributive.\nThe above proves the maximality of Di ⊗ Dj . To show the uniqueness, suppose S is a distributive subalgebra. We show S is a subset of Di ⊗Dj for some i, j.\nFirst, we show for every R ∈ S we have R = Rx ⊗ Ry . Suppose not. Then there exist α ∈ Rx and β ∈ Ry s.t. α ⊗ β 6∈ R. Similar to the proof of the maximality, we know both {α} ⊗ ? and ? ⊗ {β} are in B̂ and, hence, in S . The three relations R, {α} ⊗ ?, ?⊗ {β}, however, do not satisfy Helly’s condition (8).\nNext, we show that S is a subset of Di ⊗ Dj for some i, j. Write Sx = {Rx : R ∈ S} and Sy = {Ry : R ∈ S}. We assert that Sx and Sy are both distributive subalgebras of IA. We first note that if R = Rx ⊗ Ry ∈ S, then both Rx ⊗ ? and ? ⊗ Ry are in S. This is because, for instance, {eq} ⊗ ? is a relation in B̂RA ⊆ S and (Rx⊗Ry) ({eq}⊗?) = Rx⊗?. It is easy to check that {Rx⊗? : Rx⊗Ry ∈ S} is a distributive subalgebra which is contained in S. Now, it is clear that Sx is a distributive subalgebra of IA and, hence, contained in eitherD1 orD2. The same conclusion applies to Sy . Therefore, S is a subset of Di ⊗Dj for some i, j. ut\nThe above proof also applies to CRA."

      "text" : "In [30], Zhang and Marisetti proposed a novel variable elimination method for solving (classical and finite) connected row convex (CRC) constraints [8]. The idea is to eliminate the variables one by one until a trivial problem is reached. Although very simple, the algorithm is able to make use of the sparsity of the problem instances and performs very well. One key property of CRC constraints is that any strong path consistent CRC constraint network is globally consistent. Recall that a similar property has been identified in our Theorem 2 for constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra. The following theorem shows that the same variable elimination method also applies to constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra,\nTheorem 4. LetM be a qualitative calculus that satisfies (6) and (7). Suppose N = {viRijvj | 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a network over a distributive subalgebra S of M and V = {v1, ..., vn}. If Rij ⊆ Rin Rnj for every 1 ≤ i, j < n, then N−n is consistent only if N is consistent, where N−n is the restriction of N to {v1, ..., vn−1}.\nProof. Suppose {δij : 1 ≤ i, j < n} is a consistent scenario ofN−n. First, write Ti for Rn,i and let T̂i = ⋂n−1 j=1 Tj δji. We only need to show T̂j ⊆ T̂i δij . Note\nT̂i δij = ( n−1⋂ j=1 Tj′ δj′i) δij = n−1⋂ j′=1 (Tj′ δj′i δji) ⊇ n−1⋂ j′=1 Tj′ δj′j = T̂j .\nSecond, we show T̂i is not empty. To this end, by Helly’s condition (8), we only need to show Tj δji ∩ Tj′ δj′i 6= ∅ for any j 6= j′. Using the cycle law twice, we have\nTj δji ∩ Tj′ δj′i 6= ∅ iff Tj′ δj′i δij ∩ Tj 6= ∅ iff Tj′−1 Tj ∩ δj′i δij 6= ∅ iff Rj′n Rnj ∩ δj′i δij 6= ∅.\nBecause δj′j ⊆ Rj′n Rnj and δj′j ⊆ δj′i δij , we have Rj′n Rnj ∩ δj′i δij 6= ∅, hence Tj δji ∩ Tj′ δj′i 6= ∅. ut\nBy the previous theorem, we can directly devise an efficient variable elimination algorithm for constraint networks over a distributive subalgebra. At each step, we choose the node for deleting which has the smallest degree. In particular, we can simply remove all nodes with degree 1 from the constraint network without affecting its consistency. This is especially useful for efficient reasoning with large sparse constraint networks."

      "heading" : "5.2 Partial Path Consistency",
      "text" : "Another efficient method for solving sparse constraint networks is the partial path consistency (PPC) algorithm proposed by Bliek and Sam-Haroud [4]. The idea is to enforce path consistency (PC) on sparse graphs by triangulating instead of completing them. The authors demonstrated that, as far as CRC constraints are concerned, the pruning capacity of PC on triangulated graphs and their completion are identical on the common edges. Recently, PPC has also been extended to qualitative spatial and temporal constraint solving [6,23], where the authors proved that any PPC constraint network over a maximal tractable subclass of IA or RCC8 is always consistent. However, for constraint networks over these subclasses, the pruning capacity of PC on triangulated graphs and their completion may be not identical on the common edges. In this section, we show that the answer is affirmative for constraint networks over distributive subalgebras.\nWe first recall several basic notions related to PPC introduced in [4]. An undirected graph G = (V,E) is triangulated or chordal if every cycle of length greater than 3 has a chord, i.e. an edge connecting two non-consecutive vertices of the cycle. For each v ∈ V , the adjacency set Adj(v), is defined as {w ∈ V : {v, w} ∈ E}. A vertex v is simplicial ifAdj(v) is complete. Every chordal graph has a simplicial vertex. Moreover, after removing a simplicial vertex and its incident edges from the graph, a chordal graph remains chordal. The order in which simplicial vertices are successively removed is called a perfect elimination order.\nLemma 3 ([4]). If G = (V,E) is an incomplete chordal graph, then one can add a missing edge (u,w) with u,w ∈ V such that\n– the graph G′ = (V,E ∪ {{u,w}}) is chordal graph; and – the graph induced by X = {x|{u, x}, {x,w} ∈ E} is complete.\nFor a constraint network N = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} over V = {v1, ..., vn}, the constraint graph of N is the undirected graph G(N ) = (V,E(N )), for which we have {vi, vj} ∈ E(N ) iff Rij 6= ?. Given a constraint network N and a graph G = (V,E), we say N is partial path consistent w.r.t. G iff for any 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n with {vi, vj}, {vj , vk}, {vi, vk} ∈ E we have Rik ⊆ Rij Rjk [6].\nThe following result was first proved for RCC8 in [24]. The proof given there is also applicable to other calculi. We here give a slightly different proof which does not use the weakly global consistency result.\nTheorem 5. LetM be a qualitative calculus that satisfies (6) and (7). Suppose N = {viRijvj | 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a network over a distributive subalgebra S of M and V = {v1, ..., vn}. Assume in addition that G = (V,E) is a chordal graph such that E(N ) ⊆ E. Then enforcing partial path consistency on G is equivalent to enforcing path consistency on the completion of G, in the sense that the relations computed for the constraints in G are identical.\nProof. The proof is similar to the one given for CRC constraints [4, Theorem 3]. Suppose we have a chordal graph G = (V,E) such that G(N ) ⊆ G andN is PPC w.r.t. G. We will add to G the missing edges one by one until the graph is complete. To prove\nthe theorem, we show that the relations of the constraints can be computed from the existing ones so that each intermediate graph, including the complete graph, is path consistent.\nIn the following we assume the order v1, . . . , vn is a perfect elimination order of chordal graph G. Denote Si = {vn−i+1, . . . , vn}, Gi = G(Si) (the induced subgraph of G by Si), and Fi = {vk ∈ N(vn−i) : k > n − i}, where N(vn−i) = {vj : {vj , vn−i} ∈ E}.\nWe add the missing edges one by one to G in the following manner:\n1. choose the largest i such that Gi is complete; 2. choose vertices vn−i, vj in G; 3. label the edge {vn−i, vj} (and resp. its reverse) with\nRn−i,j = ⋂\nvk∈Fi\nRn−i,k Rk,j .\nAfter adding one edge, we prove G′, the resulting graph, is still path consistent. First, we show the added label is non-empty. To show this, by Theorem 1, we need only showRn−i,k Rk,j ∩Rn−i,k′ Rk′,j 6= ∅ for any vk 6= vk′ ∈ Fi. Such a pairwise intersection is not empty because, by the cycle law of relation algebra, we have\nRn−i,k Rk,j ∩Rn−i,k′ Rk′,j 6= ∅ iff Rk,n−i Rn−i,k′ ∩Rk,j Rj,k′ 6= ∅.\nSince G(Fi ∪ {vn−i}) and Gi are complete and path consistent, we have Rk,k′ ⊆ Rk,n−i Rn−i,k′ andRk,k′ ⊆ Rk,j Rj,k′ . This showsRk,n−i Rn−i,k′∩Rk,j Rj,k′ 6= ∅ and, hence, Rn−i,k Rk,j ∩Rn−i,k′ Rk′,j 6= ∅.\nWe then need to show the constraint network is path consistent for the three paths 〈n− i, j, k′〉, 〈n− i, k′, j〉, and 〈k′, n− i, j〉.\nFor 〈n − i, j, k′〉, note that, for any k ∈ Fi, we have Rn−i,k′ ⊆ Rn−i,k Rk,k′ ⊆ Rn−i,k Rk,j Rj,k′ . Therefore, we have Rn−i,k′ ⊆ ⋂ k∈Fi Rn−i,k Rk,j Rj,k′ . By\ndistributivity, we know Rn−i,k′ ⊆ ( ⋂\nk∈Fi Rn−i,k Rk,j) Rj,k′ = Rn−i,j Rk,j . For 〈n− i, k′, j〉, by the construction of Rn−i,j , we have Rn−i,j ⊆ Rn−i,k′ Rk′,j . For 〈k′, n − i, j〉, we need to show Rk′,j ⊆ Rk′,n−i Rn−i,j . Note Rn−i,j =⋂\nvk∈Fi Rn−i,k Rk,j . By distributivity, it is sufficient to show, for each k ∈ Fi, Rk′,j ⊆ Rk′,n−i Rn−i,k Rk,j . Because G(Fi ∪ {vn−i}) is complete and PC, Rk′,k ⊆ Rk′,n−i Rn−i,k. Moreover, because G(Fi ∪ {vj}) is complete and PC by construction and induction, Rk′,j ⊆ Rk′,k Rk,j ⊆ Rk′,n−i Rn−i,k Rk,j .\nThus, after adding a missing edge, the resulting graph remains path-consistent. At last we will get the complete graph, which is equivalent to the completion of G. Note that the label of every edge in G is not changed. This finishes the proof. ut"

For IA, Ligozat [17] characterises the convex relations by using the CNG of IA [13] (shown in Table 1 (ii)). An IA relation is convex if it is an “interval” [α, β] containing all the relations between its two endpoint relations α, β in the CNG. The subclass of convex IA relations is exactly the maximal distributive subalgebra CIA.\nSimilar idea applies to PA and RCC5 directly. For PA, the CNG is shown in the left of Figure 6. From the CNG of PA, we observe the “convex” relations correspond to relations in CPA = {<,=, >,≤,≥}, one of the maximal distributive subalgebras of PA. For RCC5, the CNG is shown in the middle of Figure 6. The subclass of convex RCC5 relations is precisely the maximal distributive subalgebra D514 specified in [15].\nThe CNG of CRA is constructed by using the CNG of PA. For example, note that < and = are conceptual neighbours in the CNG of PA, and NW is defined as x < x′ and y > y′ and N is defined as x = x′ and y > y′. Then N and NW should be conceptual neighbours in CRA. The complete CNG of CRA is given in [18] and the subclass of convex CRA relations corresponds to the maximal distributive subalgebra that is the Cartesian product of CPA and itself. Like CRA, the CNG of RA is constructed by using the CNG of IA. The subclass of convex RA relations [3] is the maximal distributive subalgebra that is the Cartesian product of CIA and itself.\nFor RCC8, the situation is a little different. We need to revise the CNG by introducing three imaginary relations TPP′,TPP−1 ′ and PO′ (see Figure 6, right). After this modification, Chandra and Pujari [5] identified the class of convex RCC8 relations, which is precisely the maximal distributive subalgebra D841 specified in [15].\nA natural question arises as, “Can we obtain each maximal distributive subalgebra by designing an appropriate CNG?” The answer seems negative as the maximal distributive subalgebra SPA contains 6= but does not contain either ≤ or ≥."

The second concept is very similar to our notion of distributivity, except that it only requires the relations to form a closure w.r.t. the network.

      "text" : "In this paper, we gave a detailed discussion of the important concept of distributive subalgebra proposed in a recent work [15]. We proved that distributive subalgebras are exactly subalgebras which are Helly in our sense and found all maximal distributive subalgebras for PA, IA, RCC5/8, CRA, and RA. We also proposed two nice properties of distributive subalgebras which will be used for efficient reasoning of large sparse constraint networks. Future work will implement and empirically evaluate and compare these two methods by using real datasets.\nAppendix\nHere we give a detailed proof of Theorem 2.\nTheorem 2. Let M be a qualitative calculus that satisfies (6) and (7). Suppose S is a distributive subalgebra ofM. Then every path consistent network over S is weakly globally consistent and minimal.\nProof. We first note that, sinceM satisfies (6), any three relations inM have the cycle law property (5) (see e.g. [10]), and by Theorem 1 any distributive subalgebra S ofM is Helly and hence satisfies (9).\nSuppose Γ = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a path consistent network over S. Write Vk = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} and W k+1t = Vt ∪ {vk+1} for 1 ≤ k < n and 1 ≤ t ≤ k. Let ∆Vk = {viδijvj : vi, vj ∈ Vk} be a consistent scenario of Γ↓Vk = {viRijvj : vi, vj ∈ Vk} (see Figure 7).\nWe show ∆Vk can be extended to a consistent scenario ∆Vk+1 of Γ↓Vk+1 . Note that any path consistent basic network overM is consistent by (7).\nLet R̂k+1,i = ⋂k\nj=1(Rk+1,j δj,i) for i = 1, . . . , k. It is easy to see R̂k+1,i ⊆ Rk+1,i. Our idea is as follows:\nStep 1. Choose an arbitrary basic relation δk+1,1 in R̂k+1,1. Step 2. Extend a consistent scenario ∆Wk+1t to a consistent scenario ∆Wk+1t+1 by choos-\ning a certain basic relation δk+1,t+1 in R̂k+1,t+1, together with the constraints {viδi,t+1vt+1|1 ≤ i ≤ t} in ∆Vk . See Figure 8 for illustration of ∆Wk+1t and ∆Wk+1t+1\n. Step 3. Repeat Step 2 for 1 ≤ t ≤ k−1 until a consistent scenario∆Vk+1 of Γ↓Vk+1 =\nΓ↓Wk+1k is obtained.\nTo show Step 1 can be achieved, we prove that R̂k+1,i = ⋂k\nj=1(Rk+1,j δj,i) 6= ∅ for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. By applying the cycle law (see (5)), for 1 ≤ j, j′ ≤ k we have\n(Rk+1,j δji) ∩ (Rk+1,j′ δj′i) 6= ∅ iff ((Rk+1,j′ δj′i) δij) ∩Rk+1,j 6= ∅ iff (Rj′,k+1 Rk+1,j) ∩ (δj′i δij) 6= ∅.\nSince Γ is path consistent and the partial scenario ∆Vk is also path consistent, we have δj′j ⊆ Rj′,j ⊆ Rj′,k+1 Rk+1,j and δj′j ⊆ δj′i δij . Therefore (Rj′,k+1 Rk+1,j) ∩ (δj′i δij) 6= ∅ and hence (Rk+1,j δji)∩ (Rk+1,j′ δj′i) 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ j, j′ ≤ k. Note S is Helly by Proposition 1, we know R̂k+1,i = ⋂k j=1(Rk+1,j δj,i) 6= ∅ for all 1 ≤ i ≤ k. To show Step 2 can be achieved, we only need to find a basic relation δk+1,t+1 in R̂k+1,t+1 such that∆Wk+1t ∪{vk+1δk+1,t+1vt+1} is path consistent, for t = 1, . . . , k− 1.\nWith the following statements, we can show the existence of such δk+1,t+1.\nStatement 1. δk+1,i δi,t+1 ∩ R̂k+1,t+1 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i ≤ t. Statement 2. δk+1,i δi,t+1 ∩ δk+1,j δj,t+1 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t.\nIn fact, from the above statements and that S is Helly, we know ( ⋂t\ni=1(δk+1,i δi,t+1))∩ R̂k+1,t+1 6= ∅. Thus, there exists a δk+1,t+1 in R̂k+1,t+1 such that\n( t⋂ i=1 (δk+1,i δi,t+1)) ∩ δk+1,t+1 6= ∅. (13)\nTo show this δk+1,t+1 actually extends ∆Wk+1t , we also need to prove that ∆Wk+1t ∪ {viδi,t+1vt+1 : 1 ≤ i ≤ t} ∪ {vk+1δk+1,t+1vt+1} is path consistent. Note we only need to show δk+1,t+1 ⊆ δk+1,i δi,t+1 for any 1 ≤ i ≤ t, because ∆Wk+1t and ∆Vt+1(⊆ ∆Vk) are both path consistent. This will be true if (13) is true. Therefore, in the following, we show the two statements above are actually true.\nFor Statement 1, note\n( k⋂ j=1 (Rk+1,j δj,t+1)) δt+1,i = k⋂ j=1 (Rk+1,j δj,t+1 δt+1,i)\n⊇ k⋂\nj=1\n(Rk+1,j δji).\nThen R̂k+1,t+1 δt+1,i ⊇ R̂k+1,i ⊇ δk+1,i 6= ∅, that is δk+1,i ∩ (R̂k+1,t+1 δt+1,i) 6= ∅. By cycle law, we have (δk+1,i δi,t+1) ∩ R̂k+1,t+1 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i ≤ t.\nFor Statement 2, for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t we have\n(δk+1,i δi,t+1) ∩ (δk+1,j δj,t+1) 6= ∅ iff (δi,k+1 δk+1,j δi,t+1) ∩ δj,t+1 6= ∅ iff (δi,k+1 δk+1,j) ∩ (δi,t+1 δt+1,j) 6= ∅.\nBecause ∆Wk+1t is a (path) consistent scenario, we have δij ⊆ δi,k+1 δk+1,j for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t. Note ∆Vt+1(⊆ ∆Vk) is also a (path) consistent scenario, we have δij ⊆ δi,t+1 δt+1,j . Then (δi,k+1 δk+1,j) ∩ (δi,t+1 δt+1,j) ⊇ δij 6= ∅ for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ t, and hence (δk+1,i δi,t+1) ∩ (δk+1,j δj,t+1) 6= ∅. ut"

This paper studies distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersections. It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong n-consistency) in a qualitative sense. The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras. This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of n ≥ 3 relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty. We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra. Lastly, we establish two nice properties which will play an important role in efficient reasoning with constraint networks involving a large number of variables.",
