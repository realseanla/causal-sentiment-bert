    "abstractText" : "We describe scoring metrics for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of user knowledge and statistical data. We identify two important properties of metrics, which we call event equivalence and parame­ ter modularity. These properties have been mostly ignored, but when combined, greatly simplify the encoding of a user's prior knowl­ edge. In particular, a user can express his knowledge-for the most part-as a single prior Bayesian network for the domain.",
