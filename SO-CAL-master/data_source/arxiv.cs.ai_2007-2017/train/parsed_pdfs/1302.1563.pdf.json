In subjective probability testing, the subject is given a problem that can be solved us­ ing applications of Bayes' rule, and then asked to judge the probability in each component of the problem along with the solution. A solution (called the normative so­ lution) is then obtained by applying Bayes' rule to the subject's subjective probabilities. F inally, that solution is compared to the subject's solution. When they re­ placed deterministic relationships by probabilistic ones, Morris and Larrick [1995] found that subjects discounted about normatively.",

It is then argued that this model is closely related to how humans reason with and learn causal structure. It is shown that studies in psychology on discounting (reasoning concern­ ing how the presence of one cause of an effect makes an­ other cause less probable) support the hypothesis that humans reach the same judgments as algorithms for do­ ing inference in Bayesian networks. Next, it is shown how studies by Piaget indicate that humans learn causal structure by observing the same independencies and de­ pendencies as those used by certain algorithms for learn­ ing the structure of a Bayesian network. Based on this indication, a subjective definition of causality is for­ warded. Finally, methods for further testing the accu­ racy of these claims are discussed.",
