      "text" : "R ELATIONAL learning is becoming increasingly impor-tant because of the high value hidden in relational data and also of its many applications in various domains such as social networks, the semantic web, bioinformatics, and the linked data cloud [1]. A class of relational learning methods focus mostly on the problem of modeling a single relation type, such as relational learning from latent attributes [2], [3], which models relations between objects as resulting from intrinsic latent attributes of these objects. But in reality, relational data typically involve multiple types of relations between objects or attributes, which can themselves be similar. For example, in social networks [4], relationships between individuals may be personal, familial, or professional. This type of relational data learning is often referred to as multi-relational learning (MRL), which needs to model large-scale sparse relational databases efficiently [5].\nPeople usually make use of the semantic web’s RDF formalism to represent relational data, where relations are modeled as triples of the form (subject, relation, object), and a relation either denotes the relationship between two entries or between an entity and an attribute value. Considering the multiple types of relationships, it is a more natural way stacking the matrices of observed relationships into one big sparse three-order tensor. Fig. 1 shows an illustration of this modeling method. In recent years, tensors have become ubiquitous such as multi-channel images and videos, and become popular due to the ability to discover complex and interesting latent structures and correlations of data [6], [7], [8], [9]. Recently there is a growing interest\n• F. Shang (Corresponding author) and J. Cheng are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.

For example, Bader et al. [16] proposed a three-way component decomposition model for analyzing intrinsically asymmetric relationships. In addition, Nickel et al. [1] incorporated collective learning into the tensor factorization, which is designed to account for the inherent structure of relational data. Two of the most popular tensor factorizations are the Tucker decomposition [10] and the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition [11]. To address incomplete tensor estimation, two weighted alternating leastsquares methods [8], [17] were proposed. However, these methods require the ability to reliably estimate the rank of the involved tensor [18], [19].\nRecently, the low rank tensor recovery problem has been intensively studied. Liu et al. [20] first extended the trace norm (also known as the nuclear norm [21] or the Schatten 1-norm [19]) regularization for partially observed lowmultilinear rank tensor recovery. Then the tensor recovery problem is transformed into a convex combination of trace norm minimization of the matrix unfolding along each mode. More recently, in Liu et al.’s subsequent paper [22], they proposed three efficient algorithms to solve the lowmulti-linear rank tensor completion problem. Some similar algorithms\ncan also be found in [18], [23], [24], [25]. In addition, there are some theoretical developments that guarantee the reconstruction of a low rank tensor from partial measurements by solving trace norm minimization under some reasonable conditions [25], [26], [27], [28]. However, the tensor trace norm minimization problems have to be solved iteratively and involve multiple singular value decompositions (SVDs) in each iteration. Therefore, existing algorithms suffer from high computational cost, making them impractical for realworld applications [19], [29].\nTo address both of the issues mentioned above, i.e., the robustness of given ranks and the computational efficiency, we propose a scalable core tensor trace norm Regularized Orthogonal Iteration Decomposition (ROID) method for full or incomplete tensor analytics. We first induce the equivalence relation of the Schatten p-norm (0< p <∞) of a low multi-linear rank tensor and its core tensor. We use the trace norm of the core tensor to replace that of the whole tensor, and then achieve a much smaller scale matrix trace norm minimization problem. In particular, our ROID method is generalized as a graph Laplacian regularized version by using auxiliary information from the relationships or a sparse higher-order orthogonal iteration (SHOOI) version. Finally, we develop two efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier (ALM) algorithms for our problems. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the convergence property of our algorithms. Our experimental results on real-world datasets verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We review preliminaries and related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose two novel core tensor trace norm regularized tensor decomposition models, and develop two efficient ALM algorithms and extend one algorithm to solve the SHOOI problem in Section 4. We provide the theoretical analysis of our algorithms in Section 5. We report the experimental results in Section 6. In Section 7, we conclude this paper and point out some potential extensions for future work."

However, there is no straightforward way to determine the rank of a tensor. In fact, the problem is NP-hard [6], [30]. Fortunately, the multi-linear rank (also called the Tucker rank in [27], [31]) of a tensor X is easy to compute, and consists of the ranks of all mode-n unfoldings.\nDefinition 1. The multi-linear rank of a third-order tensor X is the tuple of the ranks of the mode-n unfoldings,\nmulti-linear rank= [ rank(X(1)), rank(X(2)), rank(X(3)) ] .\nIn order to keep problems simple, the (weighted) sum of the ranks of all unfoldings along each mode is used to take the place of the multi-linear rank of the tensor, and is relaxed into the following definition.\nDefinition 2. The Schatten p-norm (0<p<∞) of a third-order tensor X is the average of the Schatten p-norms of all unfoldings X(n), i.e.,\n‖X‖Sp = 1\n3\n3∑\nn=1\n‖X(n)‖Sp\nwhere ‖X(n)‖Sp =( ∑ iσ p i ) 1/p denotes the Schatten p-norm of the unfolding X(n), and σi is the i-th singular value of X(n).

Since the decomposition rank Rn (n= 1, 2, 3) is in general much smaller than In, in this sense, the storage of the Tucker decomposition form can be significantly smaller than that of the original tensor. Moreover, unlike the rank of the tensor R, the multi-linear rank (R1, R2, R3) is clearly computable. If the factor matrices of the Tucker decomposition are constrained orthogonal, the classical decomposition methods are referred to as the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) [32] or higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) [33], where the latter leads to the estimation of best rank-(R1, R2, R3) approximations while the truncation of HOSVD may achieve a good rank-(R1, R2, R3) approximation but in general not the best possible one [33]. Hence, we are particularly interested in extending the HOOI method for sparse MRL problems.\nIn addition, several extensions of both tensor decomposition models are developed for tensor estimation problems, such as [34], [35], [36]. However, for all those methods, a suitable rank value needs to be given, and it has been shown that both WTucker andWCP models are usually sensitive to the given ranks due to their least-squares formulations [18], [19], and they have poor performance when the data have a high rank [22]."

Liu et al. [22] proposed three efficient algorithms (e.g., the HaLRTC algorithm) to solve (3). In addition, there are some similar convex tensor completion algorithms in [18], [23], [24].

However, if the order of the involved tensor is no more than three, the models (3) and (4) often perform better than the more balanced (square) matrix model in [27]. Indeed each unfolding X(n) shares the same entries, and thus cannot be optimized independently. Therefore, we must apply variable splitting and introduce multiple additional equal-sized variables to all unfoldings of X . Moreover, existing algorithms involve multiple SVDs in each iteration and suffer from high computational cost O(I4), where the assumed size of the tensor is I × I × I ."

The entries of the core tensor G ∈Rr1×r2×r3 show the level of interaction between the different components.

Then we can give some relatively large integers (d1, d2, d3) satisfying dn ≥ r ′ n and dn ≥ rn, n = 1, 2, 3.\nTheorem 1.

Since the trace norm (i.e., the Schatten 1-norm) is the tightest convex surrogate to the rank function [21], [39], we mainly consider the trace norm case in this paper. According to the equivalence relation of the trace norm of a low multi-linear rank tensor and its core tensor, the tensor completion model (3) is formulated into the following form:\nmin G,U,V,W,X\n1 λ ‖G‖∗ + 1 2 ‖X − G×1U×2V ×3W‖ 2 F ,\ns.t.,XΩ=TΩ, U TU=Id1 , V TV =Id2 ,W TW =Id3 .\n(6)\nWhen all entries of T are observed, the model (6) degenerates to the following core tensor trace norm regularized tensor decomposition problem [29]:\nmin G,U,V,W\n1 λ ‖G‖∗ + 1 2 ‖T − G×1U×2V ×3W‖ 2 F ,\ns.t., UTU=Id1 , V TV =Id2 ,W TW =Id3 .\n(7)\nIt is clear that the core tensor G of size (d1, d2, d3) has much smaller size than the whole tensor T , i.e., dn ≪ In for all n ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Therefore, our core tensor trace norm regularized orthogonal tensor decomposition models (6) and (7) can alleviate the SVD computational burden of much larger unfoldings in both models (3) and (4). Besides, the core tensor trace norm term promotes low multi-linear rank tensor decompositions, and enhances the robustness of the multi-linear rank selection, while those traditional tensor decomposition methods are usually sensitive to the given multi-linear rank [22], [29]."

As a variant of the standard ALM, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has received much attention recently due to the tremendous demand from large-scale machine learning applications [43], [44]. Similar to (3), the proposed problem (6) is difficult to solve due to the interdependent tensor trace norm term ‖G‖∗. Therefore, we first introduce three much smaller auxiliary variables Gn ∈R\ndn×Πj 6=ndj into (6), and then reformulate it into the following equivalent form:\nmin G,U,V,W,{Gn},X\n3∑\nn=1\n‖Gn‖∗ 3λ + 1 2 ‖X − G×1U×2V×3W ‖ 2 F ,\ns.t.,XΩ=TΩ,G(n)=Gn, U T U=Id1 , V T V=Id2 ,W T W=Id3 .\n(10)\nThe partial augmented Lagrangian function of (10) is\nLρ({Gn}, G, U, V, W, X , {Yn}) = 3∑\nn=1\n( ‖Gn‖∗ 3λ + 〈Yn, G(n) −Gn〉+ ρ 2 ‖G(n) −Gn‖ 2 F )\n+ 1\n2 ‖X − G×1U×2V ×3W‖\n2 F\n(11)\nwhere Yn ∈ R dn×Πj 6=ndj (n = 1, 2, 3) are the matrices of Lagrange multipliers (or dual variables), and ρ> 0 is called the penalty parameter. Our ADMM iterative scheme for solving (10) is derived by successively minimizing Lρ over ({Gn},G, U, V,W,X ), and then updating (Y1, Y2, Y3).\n4.1 Updating {Gk+11 , G k+1 2 , G k+1 3 } By keeping all the other variables fixed, Gk+1n is updated by solving the following problem,\nmin Gn ‖Gn‖∗ 3λ + ρk 2 ‖Gk(n) −Gn + Y k n /ρ k‖2F . (12)\nFor solving (12), we give the shrinkage operator [45] below.\nDefinition 3. For any matrix M ∈ Rm×n, the singular vector thresholding (SVT) operator is defined as:\nSVTµ(M) := Udiag(max{σ − µ, 0})V T\nwhere max{·, ·} should be understood element-wise, U ∈Rm×r , V ∈ Rn×r and σ = (σ1, σ2, . . . , σr) T ∈ Rr×1 are obtained by SVD of M , i.e., M = Udiag(σ)V T .\nTherefore, a closed-form solution to (12) is given by:\nGk+1n = SVT1/(3λρk)(G k (n) + Y k n /ρ k). (13)\nIt it clear that only some smaller size matrices Mn = Gk(n)+ Y k n /ρ\nk ∈ Rdn×Πj 6=ndj (dn ≪ In, n = 1, 2, 3) in (13) need to perform SVD. Therefore, our shrinkage operator has a significantly lower computational complexity O( ∑ nd 2 nΠj 6=ndj) while the computational complexity of\nthose algorithms for solving (3) and (4) is O( ∑\nnI 2 nΠj 6=nIj)\nfor each iteration. Hence, our algorithm has a much lower complexity than those as in [18], [22], [23], [24], [25].\n4.2 Updating {Uk+1, V k+1,W k+1,Gk+1}\nThe optimization problem (10) with respect to U , V , W and G is formulated as follows:\nmin G,U,V,W\n3∑\nn=1\nρk\n2 ‖G(n) −G\nk+1 n + Y k n /ρ k‖2F\n+ 1\n2 ‖X k − G×1U×2V ×3W‖ 2 F ,\ns.t., UTU = Id1 , V TV = Id2 , W TW = Id3 .\n(14)\nUnlike the HOOI algorithm in [33], we propose a new orthogonal iteration scheme to update thematricesU , V and W for the optimization of (14). Moreover, the conventional HOOI can be seen as a special case of (14) when ρk=0. For any estimate of these matrices, the optimal solution with respect to G is given by the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. For given matrices U , V and W , the optimal core tensor G of the optimization problem (14) is given by\nG = 1\n1 + 3ρk\n( A+ ρkB ) (15)\nwhere A=X k×1U T×2V T×3W T, B= ∑3 n=1refold(G k+1 n −Y k n/ρ\nk) and refold(·) denotes the refolding of the matrix into a tensor.\nPlease see APPENDIX B for the proof of Theorem 2. Moreover, we propose an orthogonal iteration scheme for solving U , V and W , which is an alternating orthogonal procrustes scheme to solve the rank-(d1, d2, d3) problem. Analogous with Theorem 4.2 in [33], we first state that the minimization problem (14) can be formulated as follows:\nTheorem 3. Assume a real third-order tensor X k, then the minimization problem (14) is equivalent to the maximization (over these matrices U , V and W having orthonormal columns) of the following function\ng(U, V, W ) = ‖A+ ρkB‖2F . (16)\nThe detailed proof of Theorem 3 is given in APPENDIX C. According to the theorem, an orthogonal iteration scheme is proposed to successively solve U , V and W by fixing the other variables. Imagine that the matrices V and W are fixed and that the optimization problem (16) is merely a quadratic function of the unknown matrix U . Consisting of orthonormal columns, we have\nmax U, UTU=Id1\n‖Mk1×1U T+ρkB‖2F =‖(M k 1) T (1)U+ρ kBT(1)‖ 2 F (17)\nwhereMk1=X k×2(V k)T×3(W k)T . This is actually the wellknown orthogonal procrustes problem [46]. Hence, we have\nUk+1 = ORT ( (Mk1)(1)B T (1) ) (18)\nwhere ORT(A) := Û V̂ T , and Û and V̂ are the left singular vector and right singular vector matrices obtained by the tight SVD of the matrix A. Repeating the above procedure for V and W , we have\nV k+1 = ORT ( (Mk2)(2)B T (2) ) ,\nW k+1 = ORT ( (Mk3)(3)B T (3) ) (19)\nwhere Mk2 = X k×1 (U k+1)T ×3 (W k)T and Mk3 = X k×1 (Uk+1)T ×2(V\nk+1)T .

(21)\nBy introducing a Lagrangian multiplier Y ∈ RI1×I2×I3 for XΩ=TΩ, the Lagrangian function of (21) is given by\nH(X ,Y) =‖X − Gk+1×1U k+1×2V k+1×3W k+1‖2F\n+ 〈Y, PΩ(X )− PΩ(T )〉.\nLetting ∇(X ,Y)H=0, we then obtain the following KarushKuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions:\n2(X − Gk+1×1U k+1×2V k+1×3W k+1) + PΩ(Y) = 0,\nXΩ − TΩ = 0.\nBy deriving simply the KKT conditions, we have the optimal solution as follows:\nX k+1=PΩ(T ) +P ⊥ Ω (G k+1×1U k+1×2V k+1×3W k+1) (22)\nwhere P⊥Ω is the complementary operator of PΩ. Based on the above analysis, we develop an efficient ADMM algorithm for solving (10), as outlined in Algorithm 1. Moreover, Algorithm 1 can be extended to solve (7) and the SHOOI problem (8) (the details can be found in the Supplementary Materials).

      "text" : "To evaluate the robustness of our ROIDmethod with respect to multi-linear rank parameter changes, we first conduct some experiments on synthetic tensors of size 100×100×100 or 200× 200× 200, and illustrate the RSE results of all these tensor decomposition methods with 10% sampling ratio, where the rank parameter of ROID, SHOOI, WTucker and WCP is chosen from {10, 15, . . . , 40}. The average RSE results of 10 independent runs are shown in Fig. 2, from which we can see that when the number of the given rank increases, the RSE of all these tensor decomposition methods (except WCP) gradually increase, especially for SHOOI. More specifically, SHOOI gives extremely accurate solutions for exact multi-linear rank tensor completion problems. However, as the number of the given rank increases, the RSE of SHOOI increases dramatically. In contrast, ROID under all these settings consistently outperforms WTucker and WCP in terms of RSE, and performs more robust than SHOOI. This confirms that our ROIDmodel with core tensor trace norm regularization is reasonable, and can provide a good estimation of the observed tensor even though from only a few observations. Note that the RSE of both convex algorithms, HaLRTC and Latent, on tensors of size 100×100×100 are 0.5796 and 0.3375, respectively.\n3. http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/∼ji-liu/ 4. http://ttic.uchicago.edu/∼ryotat/softwares/tensor/\nWe also report the recovery results of WTucker, WCP, HaLRTC, Latent and our ROID method with different fractions of observed entries and tensor multi-linear ranks on synthetic tensors of size 200× 200× 200 in Fig. 3, where the sampling ratio varies from 5% to 20% with increment 2.5%, and the multi-linear ranks rn, n = 1, 2, 3 are chosen from 10 to 40 with increment 5. We can observe that in all these settings, our ROID method consistently outperforms the other methods in terms of RSE. HaLRTC is able to yield very accurate solutions using adequate large sampling ratio (e.g. 0.2); however, when the fraction of observed entries is low (e.g. 0.05), or the underlying tensor multilinear ranks are high (e.g. 40), the performance of HaLRTC (and also the other convex tensor trace norm minimization method, Latent) is poor. The main reason is that WTucker and our ROID method are all multiple structured methods similar to the matrix case [50], and need only O(dN+ dNI) observations to exactly recover an Nth-order low multilinear rank tensor X with high probability, while O(rIN−1) observations are required for recovering the true tensor by both convex tensor trace norm minimization methods, HaLRTC and Latent, as stated in [27], [28], [51].\nMoreover, we conduct some experiments to evaluate the robustness of our ROID method with respect to the regularization parameter λ, and report the results of Latent and our ROID method on synthetic tensors of size 100×100×100 or 200×200×200 in Fig. 4(a), where λ is tuned from the grid {101, 102, . . . , 106} and the sampling ratio is set to 10%. Note that the solid and dashed lines denote the results of ROID with d1 = d2 = d3 = r and d1 = d2 = d3 = ⌊1.5r⌋, respectively. It is clear that as λ increases, both Latent and our ROID method with exact multi-linear rank give much better performance for tensor completion problems. As suggested in [25], setting λ → ∞ gives more accurate solutions for the noiseless problem. In practical applications, this parameter of ROID is set to λ = 100 for the following noisy problems. Moreover, our ROID method under all settings significantly outperforms Latent in terms of RSE.\nFinally, we present the running time of our ROID method and the other methods with varying sizes of thirdorder tensors, as shown in Fig. 4(b), from which we can see that the running time of WTcuker, WCP, Latent and HaLRTC dramatically grows with the increase of tensor size whereas the running time of our SHOOI and ROID methods only increase slightly. In addition, WTcuker, WCP, Latent and HaLRTC could not yield experimental results on the two largest synthetic tensor completion problems with sizes of\n800 and 1000, because they ran out of memory. Our ROID method is more than 10 times faster than WTcuker and WCP, more than 25 times faster than HaLRTC, and more than 150 times faster than Latent when the size of input tensors is 600×600×600. This shows that our ROIDmethod has good scalability and can address large-scale problems. Notice that because Latent converges too slowly, we do not consider it in the following experiments. Moreover, Table 1 summarizes the time complexities of major computations in the two related weighted tensor decomposition algorithms and the two convex trace norm minimization algorithms, where the assumed sizes of the tensor and the core tensor are I × I × I and d × d × d, respectively. From Table 4, we can see that although WTucker and WCP have the computational complexity similar to our ROIDmethod, they are much slower in practice than ROID due to their PolakRibiere nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithms with a timeconsuming line search scheme [52]."

We can observe that the three trace norm minimization algorithms, i.e., our ROID and GROIDmethods andHaLRTC, significantly outperform GWTucker and GWCP in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, ROID and GROID run remarkably faster than the other methods, and are more robust than GWTucker and GWCP with respect to given multi-linear ranks. The running time of ROID and GROID increase slightly when the number of users increases. In contrast, the running time of the other methods increases dramatically, and they could not complete the computation within 48 hours on the two largest problem sizes of 8,000 or 15,088 users. This shows that ROID and GROID have very good scalability and can address large-scale problems. GROID performs significantly better than all the other methods in terms of prediction accuracy due to the use of auxiliary information."

      "text" : "Finally, we examine how well our ROID method performs on the three popular multi-relational datasets, which have previously been used by Kemp et al. [55] for link prediction, including the Kinship, Nations and UMLS data sets. The Kinship data set consists of kinship relationships (such as “father” or “wife” relations) among the members of the ALyawarra tribe in Central Australia [56]. The data set contains 104 tribe members and 26 types of kinship (binary) relations, formfitting a three-order tensor of size 104×104×26. The Nations data set consists of international relations among different countries in the world [57]. The data set contains 14 countries and 56 types of (binary) relations (such as “Treaties” or “Military Alliance”), and is a three-order tensor of size 14×14×56. The UMLS data set is collected from the Unified Medical Language System by McCray et al. [58]. This data set includes a semantic network with 135 concepts and 49 binary predicates (such as “affects” or “causes”), and is a three-order tensor of size 135×135×49.\nWe compare our ROID method with several state-of-theart approaches including WCP, the nonparametric Bayesian\nmehtod, IRM6 [55], the hidden variable discovery method, MRC [2] and RESCAL7 [1] and HaLRTC [22] on these three data sets. Since WCP, WTucker and SHOOI yield very similar results on all three data sets, we only report the results of WCP. Then, we use the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC) as the evaluation metric to test the relation prediction performance as in [1], [4]. In order to obtain comparable results to IRM, MRC and RESCAL, we follow their experimental requirements and preform 10-fold cross validation. For our ROID method, we set the multi-linear rank d1=d2=d3=35 for both the Kinship and UMLS data sets, and d1 = d2 =14 and d3 =10 for the Nations data set, and the regularization parameter λ = 100.\nWe illustrate the experimental results of all these six methods on these three data sets, as shown in Fig. 8, from\n6. http://www.psy.cmu.edu/∼ckemp/code/irm.html 7. http://www.mit.edu/∼mnick/\nwhich we can see that our ROID method and HaLRTC consistently outperform the other four methods. The reason is that HaLRTC and our ROID method can more efficiently explore the impact of different relations to improve the accuracy of relation prediction. AsWCP, RESCAL, HaLRTC, and our ROID method have similar AUC results, we also report the RSE results of these four methods in Table 2. It is clear that our ROID method consistently performs better than the other three methods in terms of recovery accuracy. Moreover, we demonstrate the relation-based clustering capabilities of our ROID method on the Nations data set. We apply the K-means clustering method with K = 3 to the matrix Xm, and illustrate the results on four types of relationships in Fig. 9, from which we can see that similar results as in [1], [55] are obtained."

      "text" : "Moreover, we present the comparison of the running time of related methods on three multi-relational data sets. In [1], it has been shown that WCP and RESCAL are much faster than MRC as well as IRM. Therefore, we only report the running time of WCP, RESCAL, HaLRTC and our ROID method on these three data sets with different ranks, as listed in Table 3. It is clear that our ROID method is much faster thanWCP and RESCAL, and is more suitable for largescale multi-relational data. RESCAL and WCP usually scale worse with regard to the ranks than our ROID method. In other words, with the increase of the given tensor ranks, the running time of RESCAL and WCP dramatically grows whereas that of our ROID method only changes slightly.\nWe also evaluate the robustness of our ROID method against its parameters: the given tensor ranks and the regularization parameter λ on these three real-world data sets, as shown in Fig. 10, from which we can see that our ROID method is robust against its parameter variations, especially on the Kinship and UMLS date sets. Note that three rank parameters d1, d2 and d3 are set to the lesser of the given multi-linear rank and the corresponding size of\nthe tensor. The regularization parameter λ is tuned from the grid {100, 101, . . . , 106}."

      "text" : "In this paper we proposed a scalable ROID method and its graph regularized version for full or incomplete tensor analytics, such as multi-relational learning. First, we induced the equivalence relation of the Schatten p-norm (0<p<∞) of a low multi-linear rank tensor and its core tensor. Then we presented a novel orthogonal tensor decomposition model with core tensor trace norm regularization. We also introduced a regularization version using graph Laplacians induced from the relationships and a sparse higher-order orthogonal iteration version. Finally, we developed two efficient ADMM algorithms to solve our problems. Moreover, we analyzed theoretically the local convergence of our algorithms. The convincing experimental results for real-world problems verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods, especially from only a few observations.\nMoreover, our ROID method can be extended to various higher-order tensor recovery and completion problems, such as higher-order robust principal component analysis (RPCA) [31] and robust tensor completion. For future work, we are interested in exploring ways to regularize our model with other auxiliary information, such as semantic information contained in social network [59]. Due to the unitary invariant property of norms as stated in Theorem 1 and the superiority of the Schatten-p quasi-norm (0< p < 1) to the trace norm, it would be an interesting research direction in future to investigate the more general core tensor Schatten quasi-norm regularization."

Most existing methods either suffer from superlinear per-iteration cost, or are sensitive to the given ranks. To address both issues, we propose a scalable core tensor trace norm Regularized Orthogonal Iteration Decomposition (ROID) method for full or incomplete tensor analytics, which can be generalized as a graph Laplacian regularized version by using auxiliary information or a sparse higher-order orthogonal iteration (SHOOI) version. We first induce the equivalence relation of the Schatten p-norm (0<p<∞) of a low multi-linear rank tensor and its core tensor. Then we achieve a much smaller matrix trace norm minimization problem. Finally, we develop two efficient augmented Lagrange multiplier algorithms to solve our problems with convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments using both real and synthetic datasets, even though with only a few observations, verified both the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.",
