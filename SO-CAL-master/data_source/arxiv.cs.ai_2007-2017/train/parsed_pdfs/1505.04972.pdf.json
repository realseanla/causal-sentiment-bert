      "text" : "An RDF data shape is a description of the expected contents of an RDF document (aka graph) or dataset. A major part of this description is the set of constraints that the document or dataset is required to satisfy. In this respect, data shapes do for RDF what XML Schema[6] does for XML. The term shape is used instead of schema to avoid confusion with RDF Schema[3] which, like OWL[9], describes inference rules, not constraints.\nW3C recently (2014) chartered the RDF Data Shapes Working Group to define SHACL, a standard RDF data shape language[8]. Both of the member submissions to this working group, Resource Shape 2.0[13] and Shape Expressions (ShEx) [15] allow shapes to refer to each other. For example, in Resource Shape 2.0 the property oslc:valueShape lets one resource shape refer to another. ShEx has a similar feature. In these languages, a shape may refer directly or indirectly to itself.\nWe refer to the ability to name and reference shape language elements as recursion in analogy with that ubiquitous feature of programming languages which allows a function to call other functions, including itself. Of course, when writing a recursive function care must be taken to ensure that recursion terminates. Similarly, when defining a shape language care must be taken to\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n04 97\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.D B\n] 1\nN ov\nspell out the precise meaning of recursion. Neither of the member submissions included a precise definition of recursion.\nThis article provides a precise definition of the meaning of recursion as used in Resource Shape 2.0. Precision is achieved through the use of Z Notation [16], a formal specification language based on typed set theory. The LATEX source for this article has been type-checked using the fuzz type-checker [17] and is available in the GitHub repository agryman:shape-recursion [14].\nThe definition of recursion presented in this article is largely independent of language-specific details. We speculate that it also applies to ShEx and to all three of the current proposals for SHACL. In particular, recursion is not permitted in the SHACL-SPARQL proposal [10], but we conjecture that recursion could be added by using the definition proposed here as a top-level control structure."

      "text" : "This section introduces two examples of recursive shapes. The first recursive shape describes the data in a Personal Information Management application. This application is highly simplified and easy to understand. It is used as a running example to illustrate the formal definitions. Although this shape is written using recursion, it can be re-written as an equivalent, non-recursive shape.\nThe second recursive shape describes what it means to be a Polentoni [11]. This shape is also highly simplified but cannot be re-written as non-recursive using the Resource Shape 2.0 specification."

      "heading" : "2.1 Example: Personal Information Management",
      "text" : "We use a highly simplified running example to illustrate the concepts defined in the following sections. Each formal definition is instantiated with data drawn from the running example in order to help the reader understand the formalism and relate it to RDF. Although the inclusion of examples lengthens the presentation, we hope that it will make the formalism more tangible and accessible to readers who are unfamiliar with Z Notation.\nConsider a Linked Data [2] application for Personal Information Management (PIM). The application manages documents that contain information about a contact person and their associates. As a Linked Data application, the PIM application provides a REST API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting contact information over HTTP using RDF representations of the data. Shapes are useful in this context for two main reasons. First, the PIM application may publish shapes that describe the contact information so that application developers who want to use the REST API understand the API contract. Second, the PIM application may internally use a shape engine that automatically validates the data, especially incoming creation and update requests.\nThe prefixes rdf: and foaf: as used for terms in the RDF[5] and FOAF[4] vocabularies. The application maintains the following integrity constraints.\n• Each document contains information about exactly one contact person and zero or more of their associates. A contact person is never an associate of themself.\n• Each contact has type foaf:Person and has exactly one name given by the property foaf:name.\n• The contact’s associates are given by the property foaf:knows which may have zero or more values.\n• Each associate has type foaf:Person and has exactly one name given by foaf:name.\n• Each associate is known by exactly one contact given by following the property foaf:knows in the backward direction, i.e. the associate is the object of the property and the contact is the subject.\nNote that these constraints are circular since the definition of contact refers to the definition of associate, and conversely. We have an obligation to give this circularity a precise meaning.\nThese constraints are illustrated by a valid document for Alice (Listing 1) and an invalid document for Bob (Listing 2). All RDF source code examples are written in Turtle format [1].\nThe following document about Alice satisfies all the constraints of the application.\n1 # http :// example.org/contacts/alice 2 @prefix foaf: <http :// xmlns.com/foaf /0.1/> . 3 @base <http :// example.org/contacts/> . 4 5 <alice#me> a foaf:Person ; 6 foaf:name \"Alice\" ; 7 foaf:knows 8 <bob#me > , 9 <charlie#me > .\n10 11 <bob#me> a foaf:Person ; 12 foaf:name \"Bob\" . 13 14 <charlie#me> a foaf:Person ; 15 foaf:name \"Charlie\" .\nListing 1: Contact document for Alice\nThe following document about Bob violates some of the constraints of the application.\n1 # http :// example.org/contacts/bob 2 @prefix foaf: <http :// xmlns.com/foaf /0.1/> . 3 @base <http :// example.org/contacts/> . 4 5 <bob#me> a foaf:Person ; 6 foaf:name \"Bob\" ; 7 foaf:knows 8 <alice#me > , 9 <charlie#me > .\n10 11 <alice#me> foaf:name \"Alice\" . 12 13 <charlie#me> a foaf:Person .\nListing 2: Contact document for Bob\nIt is clear that the document about Bob is invalid, since Alice has no type and Charlie has no name.\nIt is also intuitively clear that the document about Alice is valid. However, if we naively translate the PIM constraints into logical conditions on the document about Alice, then we run into a problem. All the constraints about types, names, and who knows who are satisfied and unproblematic, but the constraints about what it means to be a contact or an associate are circular. A naive translation of these constraints on the Alice document is as follows.\n• If Bob is an associate and Charlie is an associate then Alice is a contact.\n• If Alice is a contact then Bob is an associate.\n• If Alice is a contact then Charlie is an associate.\nTable 1 introduces propositional variables to stand for statements about being a contact or associate in the Alice document.\nThe PIM constraints on the Alice document translate to the following consistency condition.\n(B ∧ C ⇒ A) ∧ (A⇒ B) ∧ (A⇒ C )\nUnfortunately, this consistency condition does not uniquely determine the values of the propositional variables. In fact, this consistency condition has several solutions as shown in Table 2. Only the solution in which all the propositional variable are true agrees with our intuition.\nThis analysis shows that the naive translation of the constraints about contacts and associates produces a necessary, but not sufficient, consistency condition on the meaning of these constraints. A precise definition for this type of constraint is given in Section 6. A brief overview of this definition follows.\nThe correct interpretation of the constraints is based on the observation that they specify two essentially different kinds of information. One kind defines rules for labelling nodes with names. The other kind defines a set of conditions associated with each name and asserts that these conditions must hold at each node labelled with that name.\nIn the PIM application, the names are contact and associate. The rules for labelling the nodes in a document are as follows.\n1. Initially, no node has any labels.\n2. Start with the node that corresponds to the person that the document is about, and label it as a contact.\n3. For each node labelled as a contact, find all the nodes they know, and add an associate label to each of them.\n4. For each node labelled as an associate, find all the nodes that they are known by and add a contact label each of them.\n5. Repeat the previous two steps until no new labels are added.\n6. Note that this procedure always terminates because the number of nodes is finite and the number of names is finite (2 in this case).\nIn the Alice document, the labelling procedure results in the nodes being labelled as follows.\n• Alice is labelled as a contact because the document is about Alice and Alice is known by Bob and Charlie.\n• Bob is labelled as an associate because Alice knows Bob.\n• Charlie is labelled as an associate because Alice knows Charlie.\nWhenever a node gets labelled with a name, the conditions associated with the name must hold. No recursion is involved in this step.\nThe conditions that must hold for nodes labelled with contact are as follows.\n• A contact must be a person.\n• A contact must have exactly one name.\n• A contact must not know itself.\nThe conditions that must hold for nodes labelled with associate are as follows.\n• An associate must be a person.\n• An associate must have exactly one name.\n• An associate must be known by exactly one node.\nAlthough the statement of the PIM constraints uses recursion, the properties of the data in this case allow us to write an equivalent non-recursive statement [12]. Specifically, since a node is an associate only if it is known by a contact, and an associate must be known by exactly one contact, nothing more is gained by requiring that all nodes that know an associate must be contacts. Dropping this condition removes the recursion. However, in general we cannot convert a recursive constraint into an equivalent non-recursive constraint. The next example illustrates an essentially recursive constraint."

      "heading" : "2.2 Example: Polentoni",
      "text" : "Consider the following definition of what it means to be a Polentoni [11].\n• A Polentoni lives in exactly one place and that place is Northern Italy.\n• A Polentoni only knows other Polentoni.\nThe definition of Polentoni refers to itself and is therefore recursive. However, we can give it a precise meaning using the labelling procedure described above.\nIn this example, the only label name is Polentoni. The labelling procedure is as follows.\n1. Initially, no node has any labels.\n2. Start with the node to be checked for being a Polentoni, and label it as a Polentoni.\n3. For each node labelled as a Polentoni, find all the nodes they know, and add a Polentoni label to each of them.\n4. Repeat the previous step until no new labels are added.\n5. Note that this procedure always terminates because the number of nodes is finite and the number of names is finite (1 in this case).\nThe condition that must hold for nodes labelled with Polentoni is as follows.\n• A Polentoni must live in Northern Italy.\nListing 3 contains some sample data.\n1 @prefix ex: <http :// example.org/polentoni#> . 2 3 ex:Enrico ex:livesIn ex:NorthernItaly . 4 ex:Diego ex:livesIn ex:NorthernItaly . 5 ex:Alessandro ex:livesIn ex:NorthernItaly . 6 ex:Sergio ex:livesIn ex:NorthernItaly . 7 ex:John ex:livesIn ex:NorthernItaly . 8 ex:Maurizio ex:livesIn ex:SouthernItaly . 9\n10 ex:Enrico ex:knows ex:John . 11 ex:John ex:knows ex:Maurizio . 12 ex:Diego ex:knows ex:Alessandro . 13 ex:Alessandro ex:knows ex:Diego . 14 ex:Alessandro ex:knows ex:Sergio .\nListing 3: Polentoni sample data\nFigure 1 depicts the Polentoni sample data where, for example, the arrow from Enrico to John indicates that Enrico knows John.\nChecking Enrico results in Enrico, John, and Maurizio being labelled as Polentoni. However, Maurizio lives in Southern Italy so Enrico is not a Polentoni.\nChecking Diego results in Diego, Alessandro, and Sergio begin labelled as Polentoni. They all live in Northern Italy so Diego is a Polentoni.\nNote that if Resource Shape 2.0 were more expressive then we could rewrite the definition of Polentoni to avoid recursion as follows.\n• A Polentoni lives in Northern Italy (and nowhere else).\n• Everyone that a Polentoni knows, directly or indirectly, lives in Northern Italy (and nowhere else).\nThe price paid for eliminating recursion is that now we have introduced the transitive closure of the knows relation, which is beyond the expressive power of the Resource Shape 2.0 specification.\nTransitive closure is, however, expressible using SPARQL property paths. In fact, all the Polentoni constraints can be expressed by a single SPARQL query. Listing 4 contains a SPARQL query that finds all non-Polentoni people in a graph, where we assume that a person is any resource that lives somewhere, or knows someone, or is known by someone. Note the use of the property path ex:knows* which is referred to as a ZeroOrMorePath expression.\n1 # polentoni.rq 2 3 prefix ex: <http :// example.org/polentoni#> 4 5 # finds all non -Polentoni person nodes ?this in the graph 6 select distinct ?this 7 where { 8 # binds each person node to ?this 9 {\n10 select distinct ?this 11 where { 12 {?this ex:livesIn ?region} 13 union 14 {?this ex:knows ?person} 15 union 16 {? person ex:knows ?this} 17 } 18 } 19 20 # binds each person that ?this knows , 21 # directly or indirectly , to ?person 22 ?this ex:knows* ?person . 23 24 # A non -Polentoni ?person must not live 25 # in and only in Northern Italy 26 { 27 # ?person lives nowhere 28 filter not exists {? person ex:livesIn ?region} 29 } 30 union 31 { 32 # ?person lives somewhere not Northern Italy 33 ?person ex:livesIn ?region. 34 filter (? region != ex:NorthernItaly) 35 } 36 }\nListing 4: SPARQL query for non-Polentoni people\nTable 3 gives the results of running the non-Polenoni query on the data contained in Listing 3.\n• Maurizio is non-Polentoni because he lives in Southern Italy.\n• John is non-Polentoni because he knows Maurizio.\n• Enrico is non-Polentoni because he knows John.\nOne might therefore contemplate avoiding the issue of recursion by adding powerful path expressions to the shape language. However, it is unclear that path expressions alone are sufficiently powerful to cover all the cases currently\nexpressible in Resource Shape 2.0. Furthermore, even if that were true, translating recursive references into property path expressions would impose a severe burden on the shape author. The use of recursion allows concise and intuitively clear descriptions so, as long as recursion can be given a precise definition, there is good reason to include in future shape languages."

The meaning of this relation is that if (x , a) requires (y , b) then whenever x must satisfy the constraints named by a then y must satisfy the constraints named by b.\nrequires : Graph ×NeighbourGraph\" (NamedNode#NamedNode)\n∀ g : Graph; ng : NeighbourGraph • requires(g ,ng) =\n{ x , y : nodes(g); a, b : NAME ; q : Neighbour | (a, q , b) ∈ ng .arcs ∧ (x , y) ∈ q(g) •\n(x , a) 7→ (y , b) }\n• The named node (x , a) requires (y , b) when the neighbour graph includes an arc (a, q , b) and the node y can be reached from x by matching the neighbour function q in g .\nFor example, the requires relation for the Alice graph in the PIM application is as follows.\n` requires(alice graph, pim ng) = {(alice, contact) 7→ (bob, associate), (alice, contact) 7→ (charlie, associate), (bob, associate) 7→ (alice, contact), (charlie, associate) 7→ (alice, contact)}\nA labelled graph is a data graph whose nodes are each labelled by a, possibly empty, set of names.\nLabelledGraph graph : Graph names : NAME label : TERM NAME\nlabel ∈ nodes(graph)\" names\n• Each node in the graph is labelled by a set of names.\nFor example, the following is a labelled graph based on the Alice graph.\nalice lg : LabelledGraph\nalice lg .graph = alice graph\nalice lg .names = {contact , associate}\nalice lg .label = {alice 7→ {contact}, bob 7→ {associate}, charlie 7→ {associate}, Alice 7→ , Bob 7→ , Charlie 7→ , foaf Person 7→ }\nA pointed graph and a pointed neighbour graph determine a unique labelled graph. Intuitively, the labelling process starts by labelling the base node with the base name. Next, the neighbour graph is checked for arcs that begin at baseName, e.g. (baseName, q , b). For each such arc compute the set values(g , q , baseNode) and for each node y in this set, label y with b. Now repeat these steps taking y as the new base node and b as the new base name, but only do this once for each named node (y , b). Since there are a finite number of nodes and a finite number of names, this process always terminates.\nLabelGraph PointedGraph PointedNeighbourGraph LabelledGraph\nlet ng == θNeighbourGraph • let R == (requires(graph,ng))∗ •\nlabel = (λ y : nodes(graph) • { b : names | (baseNode, baseName) R (y , b) })\n• The label of a node y is the set of names b such that the named node (y , b) is related to the base named node (baseNode, baseName) by R the reflexive-transitive closure of the requires relation requires(graph, shape).\n• Note that this labelling process makes use of R, the reflexive-transitive closure of the requires relation. The use of R avoids difficulties associated with explicitly recursive definitions. We have, in effect, eliminated explicit recursion by computing a transitive closure of a finite binary relation.\n• Note that the components of LabelledGraph are uniquely determined by the components of PointedGraph and PointedNeighbourGraph.\nFor example, the pointed graph alice pg and the pointed neighbour graph pim png uniquely determine the labelled graph alice lg .\n∀LabelGraph | θPointedGraph = alice pg ∧ θPointedNeighbourGraph = pim png •\nθLabelledGraph = alice lg"

This apparent circularity would cause difficulty if contact and associate were each described as a constraint. However, using the preceding formalism, the composite shape consisting of both the contact and associate resource shapes is given a well-defined meaning.\nIn Resource Shape 2.0, neighbour functions are limited to forward and backward path expressions. In fact, backward path expressions were missing from the original OSLC Resource Shape language and are a proposed extension in Resource Shape 2.0. The proposed syntax for backward path expressions uses the optional property oslc:isInverseProperty but this design could be improved to provide better compatibility with downlevel clients, i.e. a downlevel client might silently ignore this new property and produce incorrect results.\nThe following SPARQL query extracts the neighbour graph arcs from a set of resource shapes. Each binding of (?a ?direction ?p ?b) corresponds to an arc (a, q , b) where q = forward(p) or q = backward(p).\n1 prefix oslc: <http ://open -services.net/ns/core#> 2 3 select distinct ?a ?direction ?p ?b 4 where { 5 ?a a oslc:ResourceShape ; 6 oslc:property ?prop . 7 ?prop a oslc:Property ; 8 oslc:propertyDefinition ?p ; 9 oslc:valueShape ?b .\n10 optional {?prop oslc:isInverseProperty ?inverse} 11 bind (if(bound (? inverse) && ?inverse , 12 ’backward ’, ’forward ’) as ?direction) 13 }\nListing 7: Query for neighbour graph arcs\nThe result of running this query on the PIM resource shapes is given in Table 4.\nThe query correctly extracts the neighbour graph pim ng of the PIM shape."

The intersection of Resource Shape 2.0 and ShEx certainly includes the recursive aspects of Resource Shape 2.0 as expressed by oslc:valueShape. Therefore the preceding formalism applies to ShEx provided that ValueReference is used in a way that maps directly to Resource Shape 2.0.\nHowever, ShEx allows a more permissive use ValueReference. For example, a ValueReference may appear inside GroupRule with cardinalities. It is not clear that this usage can be expressed using suitably defined neighbour functions."

The absence of recursion in SHACL-SPARQL therefore detracts from its usefulness. However, since the formalism presented here gives a clear and unobjectionable meaning to a limited form of recursion, this capability could be added to SHACL-SPARQL."
