      "text" : "Rough set theory, proposed by Pawlak in 1982, is an important mathematical tool for dealing with imprecise and uncertain information in data analysis. In theoretical aspects, by extending the equivalence relation, Pawlak’s model has been generalized to covering-based rough sets, fuzzy covering-based rough sets, dominance rough sets, fuzzy rough sets, rough fuzzy sets, decision-theoretic rough sets, doublequantitative rough sets, multi-granulation rough sets, and so on. In application aspects, rough set theory has been successfully applied to various fields such as machine learning, data mining, image processing,\n∗Corresponding author.

So far, many types of fuzzy covering-based lower and upper approximation operators have been proposed with respect to different backgrounds. Especially, the fuzzy γ−covering based lower and upper approximation operators introduced by Ma [23, 24] builded the link between the fuzzy covering rough set theory and Pawlak’s model, which provides an effective approach to studying the fuzzy covering approximation spaces from the view of Pawlak’s rough sets. In practical situations, there are a lot of fuzzy covering approximation spaces. Especially, there exists a great number of fuzzy covering information systems. To perform knowledge discovery of fuzzy covering information systems, we should construct the effective lower and upper approximation operators for the fuzzy covering approximation spaces. There are many effective rough set models such as probabilistic rough sets, grade rough sets, double quantitative rough sets, and multi-granulation rough sets, and we should study how to construct the lower and upper approximation operators for fuzzy covering approximation spaces with the advantages of different rough set models.\nThe purpose of this work is shown as follows. First, we propose the fuzzy γ-covering based probabilistic lower and upper approximation operators, as extensions of probabilistic lower and upper approximation operators, in fuzzy γ-covering approximation spaces. We present the fuzzy γ-covering based grade lower and upper approximation operators as extensions of grade lower and upper approximation operators. We also discuss the relationship between the fuzzy γ-covering based probabilistic operators and the fuzzy γ-covering based grade operators. Second, we provide the fuzzy γ-covering based disjunctive double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators in fuzzy γ-covering approximation spaces. We propose the fuzzy γ-covering based conjunctive double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. We also discuss the relationship between the fuzzy γ-covering based disjunctive and conjunctive double-quantitative approximation operators and the fuzzy γ-covering based probabilistic and grade approximation operators. Third, we present the fuzzy γ∗-coverings based multi-granulation probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators in fuzzy γ∗-coverings information systems. We also discuss the relationship between the γ∗-coverings based multi-granulation probabilistic and grade approximation operators and the fuzzy γ∗-coverings based probabilistic and grade approximation operators. Fourth, we provide the fuzzy γ∗-coverings based disjunctive and conjunctive multi-granulation double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. We also discuss the relationship between the fuzzy γ∗-coverings based double-quantitative multi-granulation approximation operators and the fuzzy γ∗-coverings based multi-granulation probabilistic and grade approximation operators.\nThe reminder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related works. In Section 3, we recall some basic concepts of covering rough set theory, probabilistic rough set theory, grade\nrough set theory, and fuzzy covering rough set theory. Section 4 proposes the fuzzy γ−covering based probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators. In Section 5, we present the fuzzy γ−covering double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. Section 6 introduces the fuzzy γ∗−coverings multi-granulation lower and upper approximation operators. In Section 7, we construct the fuzzy γ∗−coverings multi-granulation double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. The paper ends with conclusions in Section 8."

      "text" : "In this section, we review some works related to double-quantitative rough set theory, multi-granulation\nrough set theory, and fuzzy covering-based rough set theory.\n(1) Double-quantitative rough set theory:\nDouble-quantitative rough set theory [5,6,14,36,51,53–55], as the combination of probabilistic rough sets [15,19,20,24,30,33,42–44,47,48] and grade rough sets [9,22,45], considers the relative and absolute quantitative information when constructing the lower and upper approximation operators. For example, Fan et al. [5] proposed a couple of double-quantitative decision-theoretic rough fuzzy set models based on logical conjunction and logical disjunction operation and discuss rules and the inner relationship between two models. Fang et al. [6] presented the probabilistic graded rough set as an extension of Pawlak’s rough set and grade rough sets and double relative quantitative decision-theoretic rough set models. Li et al. [14] provided double-quantitative decision-theoretic rough sets and studied its properties. Xu et al. [36] proposed the lower and upper approximations of generalized multi-granulation double-quantitative rough sets by introducing the lower and upper support characteristic functions. They also constructed the approximation accuracy to show the advantage of the proposed model. Zhang et al. [52,53] provided information architecture, granular computing and rough set model in the double-quantitative approximation space of precision and grade. They also proposed two basic double-quantitative rough set models of precision and grade and their investigation using granular computing.\n(2) Multi-granulation rough set theory:\nMany efforts have focused on multi-granulation rough set theory [7, 12, 13, 16–18, 21, 26–28, 32, 35– 38, 41, 51]. For example, Feng et al. [7] proposed variable precision multi-granulation decision-theoretic fuzzy rough sets. Li et al. [12] presented a comparative study of multi-granulation rough sets and concept lattices via rule acquisition. Li et al. [13] provided multi-granulation decision-theoretic rough sets in ordered information systems. Liang et al. [16] established an efficient feature selection algorithm with a multi-granulation view. Lin [17] introduced an approach to feature selection via neighborhood multigranulation fusion. Lin et al. [18] presented a fuzzy multi-granulation decision-theoretic approach to multi-source fuzzy information systems. Liu et al. [21] provided the multi-granulation rough sets in covering context. Qian et al. [26,27] introduced multi-granulation rough set theory by extending Pawlak’s\nmodel. Raghavan et al. [28] explored the topological properties of multi-granulation rough sets. She et al. [32] deeply studied topological structures and properties of multi-granulation rough sets. Wu et al. [35] proposed a formal approach to granular computing with multi-scale data decision information systems. Xu et al. [36–38] considered variable, fuzzy and ordered multi-granulation rough set models. Yang et al. [41] updated multi-granulation rough approximations with increasing of granular structures. Zhang et al. [51] provided constructive methods of rough approximation operators and multi-granulation rough sets.\n(3) Fuzzy covering-based rough set theory:\nFuzzy covering-based rough set theory [1–3, 8–11, 23, 29, 31, 34, 39, 40, 46, 56] has attracted more and more attention. For example, based on fuzzy covering and binary fuzzy logical operators, Deng [2] proposed an approach to fuzzy rough sets in the framework of lattice theory, and presented a link between the generalized fuzzy rough approximation operators and fundamental morphological operators. Feng et al. [8] defined a novel pair of belief and plausibility functions by employing a method of non-classical probability model and the approximation operators of a fuzzy covering. Huang et al. [9] presented an intuitionistic fuzzy graded covering rough set and studied its properties. Li et al. [11] showed a general framework for the study of covering-based fuzzy approximation operators in which a fuzzy set can be approximated by some elements in a crisp or a fuzzy covering of the universe. Ma [23] presented the concepts of fuzzy γ-covering and fuzzy γ-neighborhood and two new types of fuzzy covering rough set models which links covering rough set theory and fuzzy rough set theory. Š ešel ja [31] investigated lattice-valued covering, or fuzzy neighboring relation arising from a given lattice-valued order and showed that every L-fuzzy covering is obtained by synthesis of crisp coverings arising from the corresponding cut orderings. Wang et al. [34] proposed the concepts of consistent and compatible mappings with respect to fuzzy sets and constructed a pair of lower and upper rough fuzzy approximation operators by means of the concept of fuzzy mappings. Yang et al. [40] presented the definition of fuzzy γ-minimal description and a novel type of fuzzy covering-based rough set model and investigate its properties. Yao et al. [46] introduced the concepts of fuzzy positive region reduct, lower approximation reduct and generalized fuzzy belief reduct, and investigated the relationships among these reducts. Zhang et al. [56] proposed the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets based on intuitionistic fuzzy coverings and studied its properties."

      "text" : "In this section, we recall the concepts of coverings, the lower and upper approximation operators.\nDefinition 3.1 [50] Let U be a non-empty set (the universe of discourse). A non-empty sub-family C ⊆ P(U) is called a covering of U if\n(1) every element in C is non-empty; (2) ⋃ {C | C ∈ C } = U, where P(U) is the powerset of U.\nUnless stated otherwise, U is a finite universe, the covering C consists of finite number of sets, and the ordered pair (U,C ) is called a covering approximation space, which is an extension of Pawlak’s model using the equivalence relation. Especially, the incomplete information system is corresponding to a covering approximation space or a covering information system in fact.\nWe employ an example to illustrate how to construct the covering approximation space as follows.\nExample 3.2 Let U = {x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8} be eight cars, C = {price} the attribute set, the domain of price is {high,middle, low}. The specialists A and B are employed to evaluate these cars and their evaluation reports are shown as follows:\nhighA = {x1, x4, x5, x7},middleA = {x2, x8}, lowA = {x3, x6};\nhighB = {x1, x2, x4, x7, x8},middleB = {x5}, lowB = {x3, x6},\nwhere highA denotes the cars belonging to high price by the specialist A, and the meanings of other symbols are similar. Since their evaluations are of equal importance, we should consider all their advice. Therefore, we drive the covering approximation space (U,Cprice), where Cprice = {highA∨B,middleA∨B, lowA∨B}, and\nhighA∨B = highA ∪ highB = {x1, x2, x4, x5, x7, x8};\nmiddleA∨B = middleA ∪ middleB = {x2, x5, x8};\nlowA∨B = lowA ∪ lowB = {x3, x6}.\nDefinition 3.3 [57] Let (U,C ) be a covering approximation space, where U = {x1, x2, ..., xn}, C = {C1,C2, ...,Cm}, and N(x) = ⋂ {Ci | x ∈ Ci ∈ C } for x ∈ U. Then the lower and upper approximations of X ∈ P(U) are defined as follows:\nR(X) = {x ∈ U |N(x) ⊆ X};\nR(X) = {x ∈ U |N(x) ∩ X , ∅}.\nThe neighborhood N(x) of x ∈ U is constructed using the covering C , and {N(x)|x ∈ U} is also a covering of U, but the granularity of the covering {N(x)|x ∈ U} is finer than the covering C , and the lower and upper approximation operators given by Definition 3.3 is very effective for computing the lower and upper approximations of sets in the covering approximation spaces."

Then A is referred to as a fuzzy set.\nWe denote the family of all fuzzy subsets of U and µA(x) as F (U) and A(x), respectively, for simplicity. For any A, B ∈ F (U), if A(x) ≤ B(x) for any x ∈ U, then we say A is contained in B, denoted as A ⊆ B. Especially, A = B if and only if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.

(1) By Definition 4.8, Σy∈U(Uc ∩ Ñ γ x )(y) = 0 ≤ k and Σy∈U(∅ ∩ Ñ γ x )(y) = 0 ≤ k for any x ∈ U. It follows that GRk(U) = U and GRk(∅) = ∅.\n(2) For any x0 ∈ GRk(X), we have Σy∈U(X ∩ Ñ γ x0 )(y) ≤ Σy∈U(Y ∩ Ñ γ x0 )(y). Since Σy∈U(X ∩ Ñ γ x0 )(y) > k.\nIt follows Σy∈U(Y ∩ Ñ γ x0 )(y) > k.

      "text" : "In this paper, we have presented the fuzzy γ−covering based probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators. Second, we have provided the fuzzy γ−covering based double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. Third, we have proposed the fuzzy γ∗−coverings based multigranulation probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators. Fourth, we have presented the fuzzy γ∗−coverings based multi-granulation double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. Finally, we have employed several examples to illustrate how to construct the lower and upper approximations of fuzzy sets with the relative and absolute information.\nThere are a lot of fuzzy covering information systems in practical situations, we should further study the fuzzy covering based lower and upper approximation operators and knowledge discovery of fuzzy covering information systems, so as to build the bridge between the fuzzy covering rough set theory and other rough set models in the future.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers very much for their professional comments and valuable suggestions.

In this paper, we first present the γ−fuzzy covering based probabilistic and grade approximation operators and double-quantitative approximation operators. We also study the relationships among the three types of γ−fuzzy covering based approximation operators. Second, we propose the γ−fuzzy coverings based multi-granulation probabilistic and grade lower and upper approximation operators and multi-granulation double-quantitative lower and upper approximation operators. We also investigate the relationships among these types of γ−fuzzy coverings based approximation operators. Finally, we employ several examples to illustrate how to construct the lower and upper approximations of fuzzy sets with the absolute and relative quantitative information.",
