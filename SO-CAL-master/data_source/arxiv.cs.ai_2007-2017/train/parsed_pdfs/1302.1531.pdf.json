This pa­ per focuses on perturbations that can be ex­ pressed locally in Bayesian networks through convex sets of distributions. Two approaches for combination of local models are consid­ ered. The first approach takes the largest set of joint distributions that is compatible with the local sets of distributions; we show how to reduce this type of robust inference to a linear programming problem. The sec­ ond approach takes the convex hull of joint distributions generated from the local sets of distributions; we demonstrate how to apply interior-point optimization methods to gener­ ate posterior bounds and how to generate ap­ proximations that are guaranteed to converge to correct posterior bounds. We also discuss calculation of bounds for expected utilities and variances, and global perturbation mod­ els.",
