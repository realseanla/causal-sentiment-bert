The system has a critical shortcoming in that it does not sanction inheritance across exceptional sub­ classes. In this paper we propose an exten­ sion to System z+ that rectifies this short­ coming by extracting additional conditions between worlds from the defaults database. We show that the additional constraints do not change the notion of the consistency of a database. We also make comparisons with competing default reasoning systems.",
