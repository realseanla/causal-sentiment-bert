Rough sets provide a theoretical foundation for the issue. Matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields, particularly greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reduction. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine matroids with rough sets to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an existing algebraic structure called dependence space to study the reduction problem in terms of matroids. First, a dependence space of matroids is constructed. Second, the characterizations for the space such as consistent sets and reducts are studied through matroids. Finally, we investigate matroids by the means of the space and present two expressions for their bases. In a word, this paper provides new approaches to study attribute reduction.\nKeywords: Rough set, Matroid, Dependence space"

      "text" : "In many applications, information and knowledge are stored and represented in an information table, where an object is described by a set of attributes. It is nature for us to fact such a problem that for a special property whether all the attributes in the attribute set are always necessary to preserve this property or not, because using entire attribute set to describe the property is time consuming, and obtained rules may be difficult to understand, to apply and to verify. In order to solve these problems, attribute reduction is required [2, 11, 12, 22]. Rough sets proposed by Pawlak [16] may be the most recent one marking significant contributions to deal with the issues of knowledge reduction in the sense of reducing attributes. It can describe knowledge via set-theoretic analysis based on equivalence classification for the universe set. On one hand, in order to solve practical problems preferably through rough sets, its axiom systems have been built [5, 9, 10] and generalization works have been done [24, 25, 26].\n∗Corresponding author. Email address: williamfengzhu@gmail.com (William Zhu)\nOn the other hand, as is known, many optimization issues related to rough sets, including attribute reduction, are NP-hard, and thus, typically require greedy algorithms. To find effective methods for solving these problems, rough sets have been combined with other theories [1, 3, 19, 20], especially matroid theory [6, 8, 17, 18, 21, 27], which borrows extensively from linear algebra and graph theory. With abundant theories and a perfect system, matroid theory has been widely used in many fields including combinatorial optimization, network flows [7], and algorithm design, especially greedy algorithm design [4]. Therefore, studying rough sets in conjunction with matroids may help solve some optimization issues. A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.\nIn many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time. The most wonderful thing is that the question whether a greedy algorithm produces an optimal solution for a particular problem can be converted to the question whether there exists a translation of the problem into a matroid. Furthermore, the optimal solutions are bases of the matroid. There are two well-known optimization problems solved by greedy algorithms designed by matroids. One is the minimum-weight spanning tree problem, the other is job assignment problem. The solution for the former problem is a base of the corresponding graphic matroid, and the solution for the latter one is a base of the corresponding transversal matroid. This prompts us to establish relationships between the bases of a matroid and the attribute reduction.\nIn this paper, we construct a dependence space in the context of matroids and apply it to attribute reduction problems. First, a dependence space of matroids is proposed from the viewpoint of closure operator. Second, we study the dependence space by means of matroids. It is interesting to find that the set of consistent sets and the set of reducts of the dependence space are the family of independent sets and the family of bases of the corresponding matroid, respectively. Finally, matroids are studied conversely by dependence spaces and two expressions for bases of matroids are presented. Therefore, this work provides new viewpoints for studying the issues of attribute reduction.\nThe rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 reviews some fundamental concepts related to rough sets, information systems, and matroids. In Section 3, we propose a dependence space of matroids. Section 4 studies the dependence space in terms of matroids. The dependence spaces are studied matroids in Section 5, while Section 6 concludes this paper."

      "text" : "To facilitate our discussion, some fundamental concepts related to rough sets and matroids are reviewed in this section.\n2.1. Rough sets Rough sets, based on equivalence relations, provide a systematic approach to data preprocessing in data mining. The lower and upper approximation operations, which\nare two key concepts in the theory, are used to describe objects.\nDefinition 1. (Approximation operators [16]) Let U be a finite set, R be an equivalence relation of U , and X ⊆ U . Then the lower and upper approximations of X , denoted by R∗(X) and R∗(X), respectively, are defined as:\nR∗(X) = {x ∈ U : ∀ y ∈ U, xRy ⇒ y ∈ X} = {x ∈ U : [x]R ⊆ X}, R∗(X) = {x ∈ U : ∃ y ∈ U s.t. xRy} = {x ∈ U : [x]R ⋂ X 6= ∅},\nwhere [x]R = {y ∈ U : xRy} denotes the equivalence class of x with respect to relation R.\n2.2. Matroids Matroid theory borrows extensively from the terminology of linear algebra and graph theory, largely because it is an abstraction of various notions of central importance in these fields, such as independent sets, bases, and rank functions. One of the most valuable definitions of matroids is presented in terms of independent sets.\nDefinition 2. (Matroid [15]) A matroid M is an ordered pair (U, I) consisting of a finite set U and a collection I of subsets of U satisfying the following three conditions: (I1) ∅ ∈ I. (I2) If I ∈ I and I ′ ⊆ I , then I ′\n∈ I. (I3) If I1, I2 ∈ I and |I1| < |I2|, then there is an element e ∈ I2 − I1 such that I1 ⋃ {e} ∈ I, where |X | denotes the cardinality of X .\nThe members of I are the independent sets of M and U is the ground set of M . We often write I(M) for I, particularly when several matroids are being considered. The bases and rank function of a matroid are defined based on independent sets. To describe these concepts intuitively, certain denotations are presented.\nDefinition 3. [15] Let A be a family of subsets of U . Then we denote Max(A) = {X ∈ A : ∀ Y ∈ A, if X ⊆ Y, then X = Y }, Min(A) = {X ∈ A : ∀ Y ∈ A, if Y ⊆ X, then X = Y }.\nFirst, the bases of a matroid, generalized from the maximal linearly independent group in vector space, are defined as follows.\nDefinition 4. (Base [15]) Let M = (U, I) be a matroid. Then a subset of U is said to be a base of M if it is maximal in the sense that it is not contained in any other element of I. If we denote the collection of bases of M by B(M), B(M) = Max(I).\nThe rank function rM : 2U → N of a matroid, which is a generalization of the rank of a matrix, is defined as rM (X) = max{|I| : I ⊆ X, I ∈ I} (X ⊆ U ). The value rM (X) is called the rank of X in M . Based on the rank function, the closure operator clM : 2U → 2U of a matroid is defined as clM (X) = {x ∈ U : rM (X) = rM (X ⋃\n{x})} (X ⊆ U ). If clM (X) = X , then X is called a closed set of matroid M . If X is a closed set and rM (X) = rM (U) − 1, then X is called a hyperplane of matroid M and the set of all hyperplanes of M is denoted by H(M). It is clear that the ground set of M is a closed set of M . The following proposition defines a matroid in terms of closure operators.\nProposition 1. (Closure axiom [15]) Let U be a set. Then the function cl : 2U → 2U is the closure operator of a matroid if and only if cl satisfies the following conditions: (CL1) : If X ⊆ U , then X ⊆ cl(X). (CL2) : If X ⊆ Y ⊆ U , then cl(X) ⊆ cl(Y ). (CL3) : If X ⊆ U , then cl(cl(X)) = cl(X). (CL4) : If X ⊆ U , x ∈ U and y ∈ cl(X ⋃ {x})− cl(X), then x ∈ cl(X ⋃ {y}).\nSimilar to the operation from a vector space to its subspace, the restriction matroid is defined.\nDefinition 5. (Restriction matroid [15]) Let M = (U, I) be a matroid. Then for any X ⊆ U , the order pair (X, I|X) is a matroid, where I|X = {I ⊆ X : I ∈ I}. This is called a restriction of M to X and is denoted by M |X ."

      "text" : "The information about the objects of an information system yielded by different sets of attributes may depend on each other in various ways. For example, it may turn out that a proper subset of a set of attributes classifies the objects with the same accuracy as the original sets. Dependence spaces were introduced by Novotný and Pawlak [13] as a general abstract setting for studying such informational dependency. Matroids provide well-established platforms for greedy algorithms, and just for this reason, matroids arise naturally in a number of problems in combinatorial optimization. In order to give play to the two theories’ respective advantages in attribute reduction, this section constructs a dependence space by matroids firstly. At the beginning of this section, the concept of dependence space is presented.\nDefinition 6. (Dependence space [13]) Let U be a nonempty set and Θ an equivalence relation of 2U . For all B1, B2, C1, C2 ∈ 2U ,\n(B1, C1) ∈ Θ, (B2, C2) ∈ Θ ⇒ (B1 ⋃ B2, C1 ⋃ C2) ∈ Θ.\nThen Θ is referred to as a congruence relation of 2U and the pair (U,Θ) is called a dependence space.\nThe dependence space in compliance with the above definition is a pair containing a nonempty set and a congruence relation. In other words, through constructing a congruence relation, one can obtain a dependence space.\nDefinition 7. Let M be a matroid of U . Then one can define a relation of 2U as follows: For all X,Y ∈ 2U ,\n(X,Y ) ∈ ΘM ⇔ clM (X) = clM (Y ).\nIt is clear that the relation is an equivalence relation.\nExample 1. Let M = (U, I) be a matroid, where U = {1, 2, 3} and I = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {2, 3}}. Then utilizing the definition of closure, we have clM (∅) = ∅, clM ({2}) = {2}, clM ({1}) = clM ({3}) = clM ({1, 3}) = {1, 3} and clM ({1, 2}) = clM ({2, 3}) = clM (U) = U . Thus, ΘM = {(∅, ∅), ({1}, {1}), ({1}, {3}), ({3}, {1}), ({1}, {1, 3}), ({{3}, {3}), ({3}, {1, 3}), ({1, 3}, {1}), ({1, 3}, {1, 3}), ({1, 3}, {3}), ({2}, {2}), ({1, 2}, {1, 2}), ({1, 2}, {2, 3}), ({1, 2}, U), ({2, 3}, {1, 2}), ({2, 3}, {2, 3}), ({2, 3}, U), (U, {1, 2}), (U, {2, 3}), (U,U)}.\nIn order to verify whether the relation is a congruence relation or not, we study certain properties of closed sets in matroids first.\nLemma 1. [15] Let X be a closed set of a matroid M which ground set is U and suppose that rM (X) = rM (U)−k where k ≥ 1. Then M has a set {H1, H2, · · · , Hk} of hyperplanes such that X = ⋂ k\ni=1 Hi.\nBased on the result, we find that any closed set whose rank is less than that of ground set can be expressed by the intersection of some hyperplanes containing the set.\nCorollary 1. Let X be a closed set of a matroid M which ground set is U and suppose that rM (X) < rM (U). Then X = ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H}.\nPROOF. It is obvious that X ⊆ ⋂\n{H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H}. Let us assume that X = ⋂k\ni=1 Hi, utilizing Lemma 1, we have {Hi ∈ H(M) : i = 1, 2, · · · , k} ⊆ {H ∈\nH(M) : X ⊆ H}, thus X ⊆ ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H} ⊆ ⋂ k\ni=1 Hi = X . Therefore,\nX = ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H}.\nIn fact, the result can be generalized to the closure of any subset. In other words, the closures of subsets can be characterized by hyperplanes.\nProposition 2. Let M be a matroid of U . Then for all X ⊆ U ,\nclM (X) =\n{\nU rM (X) = rM (U), ⋂\n{H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H} rM (X) 6= rM (U). (1)\nPROOF. First, we prove clM (X) = U when rM (X) = rM (U). For all x ∈ U , rM (X) ≤ rM (X ⋃ {x}) ≤ rM (U) = rM (X) which implies rM (X) = rM (X ⋃\n{x}), i.e., x ∈ clM (X). Hence U ⊆ clM (X). Combining with clM (X) ⊆ U , we have proved the result. For all X ⊆ U , rM (clM (X)) = rM (X) ≤ rM (U). Then rM (X) 6= rM (U) implies rM (clM (X)) < rM (U). Utilizing Corollary 1, we know {H ∈ H(M) : clM (X) ⊆ H} 6= ∅. It is clear that {H ∈ H(M) : clM (X) ⊆ H} ⊆ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H} because X ⊆ clM (X). For all H ∈ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H}, clM (X) ⊆ clM (H) = H . Thus {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H} ⊆ {H ∈ H(M) : clM (X) ⊆ H}. Therefore, {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H} = {H ∈ H(M) : clM (X) ⊆ H}, i.e., clM (X) = ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : clM (X) ⊆ H} = ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H}.\nTherefore, the properties of the closures of subsets can be equivalently described by hyperplanes.\nProposition 3. Let M be a matroid of U and X,Y ⊆ U . Then clM (X) ⊆ clM (Y ) ⇔ ∀H ∈ H(M)(Y ⊆ H → X ⊆ H).\nPROOF. (“⇒”): If clM (Y ) = U , then for all H ∈ H(M), Y * H . Thus we have the result. If clM (Y ) 6= U , then {H ∈ H(M) : Y ⊆ H} 6= ∅. Since Y ⊆ H , X ⊆ clM (X) ⊆ clM (Y ) ⊆ clM (H) = H . (“⇐”): If for all H ∈ H(M), Y * H , then clM (Y ) = U . Otherwise, rM (Y ) 6= rM (U) holds. Utilizing Proposition 2, there exists H ∈ H(M) such that Y ⊆ H , which implies a contradiction. Thus clM (X) ⊆ U = clM (Y ). For all H ∈ H(M), if Y ⊆ H , then by assumption we have {H ∈ H(M) : Y ⊆ H} ⊆ {H ∈ H(M) : X ⊆ H}, which implies that clM (X) ⊆ clM (Y ).\nBased on the result, we find that the equivalence relation defined by Definition 7 is a congruence relation. Therefore, a dependence space of matroids is constructed.\nTheorem 1. Let M be a matroid of U . Then (U,ΘM ) is a dependence space.\nPROOF. Let us assume that A1, A2, B1, B2 ⊆ U satisfy (A1, A2) ∈ ΘM and (B1, B2) ∈ ΘM . Then clM (A1) = clM (A2) and clM (B1) = clM (B2). Now we need to prove (A1 ⋃ B1, A2 ⋃ B2) ∈ ΘM , i.e., clM (A1 ⋃ B1) = clM (A2 ⋃\nB2). Case 1: clM (A1) = clM (A2) = U or clM (B1) = clM (B2) = U . We may as well suppose clM (A1) = clM (A2) = U , then U = clM (A1) ⊆ clM (A1 ⋃\nB1) ⊆ clM (U) = U and U = clM (A2) ⊆ clM (A2 ⋃ B2) ⊆ clM (U) = U , i.e., clM (A1 ⋃\nB1) = U = clM (A2 ⋃\nB2). Case 2: clM (A1) = clM (A2) 6= U and clM (B1) = clM (B2) 6= U . According to Proposition 3, we have {H ∈ H(M) : A2 ⊆ H} = {H ∈ H(M) : A1 ⊆ H} and {H ∈ H(M) : B1 ⊆ H} = {H ∈ H(M) : B2 ⊆ H}. If clM (A1 ⋃\nB1) 6= U , then clM (A1 ⋃ B1) = ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : A1 ⋃ B1 ⊆ H} = ⋂\n{{H ∈ H(M) : A1 ⊆ H} ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : B1 ⊆ H}} = ⋂ {{H ∈ H(M) : A2 ⊆ H} ⋂\n{H ∈ H(M) : B2 ⊆ H}} = ⋂ {H ∈ H(M) : A2 ⋃ B2 ⊆ H} = clM (A2 ⋃\nB2). If clM (A1 ⋃ B1) = U , then we claim clM (A2 ⋃ B2) = U . If clM (A2 ⋃\nB2) 6= U , then clM (A1 ⋃ B1) = clM (A2 ⋃\nB2) 6= U , which implies a contradiction. Therefore, ΘM is a congruence relation, i.e., (U,ΘM ) is a dependence space."

      "text" : "In matroid theory, there are many greedy algorithms designed using bases of matroids. In practice, the local optimal solutions obtained using these algorithms in matroidal structures are often global ones. As is known, the algorithms for the issues of attribute reduction are almost greedy one. These promote us to establish relationships between the bases of matroids and the reducts of dependence spaces. In Section 3, we have constructed a dependence space by matroids. In this section, we study the reduction problems of the dependence space. It is interesting that the set of redusts of the dependence space is the set of bases of the corresponding matroid. First, we present the concept of consistent sets.\nDefinition 8. (Consistent set [13]) Let (U,Θ) be a dependence space. A subset X of U is consistent in (U,Θ) if X is minimal with respect to the inclusion relation in its\nΘ−class. Otherwise it is inconsistent. The collection of consistent sets of (U,Θ) is denoted by INDΘ.\nIn fact, the consistent sets of the dependence space induced by matroids can be equivalently characterized by other words.\nProposition 4. Let M be a matroid of U and X ⊆ U . X ∈ INDΘM if and only if (X,X − {x}) /∈ ΘM for all x ∈ X .\nPROOF. According to Theorem 1, we know (U,ΘM ) is a dependence space. If X ∈ INDΘM , then obviously (X,X − {x}) /∈ ΘM for all x ∈ X . Conversely, if X /∈ INDΘM , then there exists Y ⊂ X such that (Y,X) ∈ ΘM . Since Y ⊂ X , there exists x ∈ X − Y such that Y ⊆ X − {x} ⊂ X . According to (Y,X) ∈ ΘM , (X − {x}, X − {x}) ∈ ΘM and (U,ΘM ) is a dependence space, then (Y ⋃\n(X − {x}), X ⋃\n(X − {x})) = (X − {x}, X) ∈ ΘM which contradicts the assumption.\nFrom the equivalent characterization, we find that the consistent sets have a close relationship with the independent sets of matroids. First, we review a well-known result of matroid theory.\nLemma 2. [15] Let M be a matroid of U and X ⊆ U . X ∈ I(M) if and only if x /∈ clM (X − {x}) for all x ∈ X .\nFor a matroid M , the following theorem indicates that any independent set of the matroid is a consistent set of the corresponding dependence space, and vice versa.\nTheorem 2. Let M be a matroid of U . Then INDΘM = I(M).\nPROOF. Suppose X ⊆ U . According to Proposition 4 and Lemma 2, we need to prove that for all x ∈ X , (X,X − {x}) /∈ ΘM if and only if x /∈ clM (X − {x}). First, we prove the sufficiency. For all x ∈ X , x ∈ clM (X) because X ⊆ clM (X). Combining with x /∈ clM (X−{x}), we have clM (X) 6= clM (X−{x}), i.e., (X,X−{x}) /∈ ΘM . Conversely, if there exists x ∈ X such that x ∈ clM (X − {x}), then rM (X) = rM (X − {x}) which implies X ⊆ clM (X − {x}), i.e., clM (X) ⊆ clM (X − {x}). Since X − {x} ⊆ X , clM (X − {x}) ⊆ clM (X). Hence clM (X) = clM (X − {x}), i.e., (X,X − {x}) ∈ ΘM which implies a contradiction.\nBased on the concept of consistent sets, reducts of a dependence space are defined.\nDefinition 9. (Reduct of dependence space [13]) Let (U,Θ) be a dependence space. For all X ⊆ U , a subset Y of X is called a reduct of X , if (X,Y ) ∈ Θ and Y ∈ INDΘ. The set of all reducts of X is denoted by REDΘ(X).\nTheorem 2 reveals the relationship between the consistent sets of dependence spaces and the independent sets of matroids. Naturally, it motives us to connect the reducts of dependence spaces with other concepts of matroids. At first, an important result in matroids is shown as follows.\nLemma 3. [15] Let M be a matroid of U and X ⊆ U . If BX ∈ B(M |X), then clM (BX) = clM (X).\nIn fact, the reducts of dependence spaces have a close relationship with the bases of matroids. For a given set, we find that the family of reducts of the set in the dependence space induced by a matroid is a collection of bases of the matroid imposed restriction on the set.\nTheorem 3. Let M be a matroid of U and X ⊆ U . REDΘM (X) = B(M |X).\nPROOF. According to the definition of bases of restriction matroids and Theorem 2, we know B(M |X) = Max({B ⊆ X : B ∈ INDΘM}). For any Y ∈ REDΘM (X), then Y ∈ {B ⊆ X : B ∈ INDΘM}. Next, we need to prove Y ∈ Max({B ⊆ X : B ∈ INDΘM }). Otherwise, there exists Y1 ∈ {B ⊆ X : B ∈ INDΘM} such that Y ⊂ Y1. Since Y ∈ REDΘM (X), (X,Y ) ∈ ΘM . According to (Y1, Y1) ∈ ΘM and ΘM is a congruence relation, we have (X ⋃ Y1, Y ⋃\nY1) ∈ ΘM , i.e., (X,Y1) ∈ ΘM . Since ΘM is an equivalence relation, (Y, Y1) ∈ ΘM which contradicts Y1 ∈ INDΘM . Therefore, REDΘM (X) ⊆ B(M |X). Conversely, since B(M |X) ⊆ I(M), B(M |X) ⊆ INDΘM . According to Lemma 3, we know for all Y ∈ B(M |X), clM (Y ) = clM (X), i.e., (X,Y ) ∈ ΘM . Therefore B(M |X) ⊆ REDΘM (X).\nFinally, an example is provided to conclude this section.\nExample 2. Suppose matroid M is given in Example 1. Let X = {1, 3}. Since clM ({1}) = clM ({3}) = clM ({1, 3}) = {1, 3}, (X, {1}) ∈ ΘM , (X, {3}) ∈ ΘM and (X,X) ∈ ΘM . Utilizing the definition of consistent sets and clM (∅) = ∅, we know {1} ∈ INDΘM and {3} ∈ INDΘM . Therefore, REDΘM (X) = {Y ⊆ X : (X,Y ) ∈ ΘM , Y ∈ INDΘM } = {{1}, {3}} = Max({B ⊆ X : B ∈ I(M)}) = B(M |X)."

Then REDΘ(X) = Min({Y ⊆ X : (X,Y ) ∈ Θ}).\nPROOF. For all B ∈ REDΘ(X), then B ∈ INDΘ and B ∈ {Y ⊆ X : (X,Y ) ∈ Θ}.

Hence Min({Y ⊆ X : (X,Y ) ∈ Θ}) ⊆ REDΘ(X).\nBased on the above results, the following proposition presents an expression of bases from the viewpoint of closed set. For a given subset X of U , it is interesting that any base of the restriction of matroid M to X is minimal in the sense that it does not contain any other element of the family whose any element is contained in X and has the same closure with X .\nTheorem 4. Let M be a matroid of U and X ⊆ U . B(M |X) = Min({Y ⊆ X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}).\nPROOF. According to Theorem 1, 3 and Proposition 5, B(M |X) = REDΘM (X) = Min({Y ⊆ X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}).\nAs is known, each family H of 2U can define a congruence relation by defining\nΓ(H) = {(B1, B2) ∈ 2 U × 2U : ∀H ∈ H(B1 ⊆ H ↔ B2 ⊆ H}).\nBased on the relation, in [14], Novotnỳ introduce the concept of dense family. It shows that the family H is dense in a dependence space (U,Θ) if and only if the congruence relation Γ(H) defined by H equals to Θ. The second part of this section, we aim to present the other expression for bases of matroids through dependence spaces. For the purpose, we take the hyperplane family H(M) to induce a congruence relation Γ(H(M)). The following example help to illustrate the congruence relation.\nExample 3. Suppose matroid M is given in Example 1. It is clear that H(M) = {{2}, {1, 3}}. Let B1 = {1} and B2 = {3}. Then (B1, B2) ∈ Γ(H(M)). Because when we take H = {2}, B1 * H and B2 * H which implies B1 ⊆ H ↔ B2 ⊆ H holds. When we take H = {1, 3}, B1 ⊆ H and B2 ⊆ H which implies B1 ⊆ H ↔ B2 ⊆ H holds. Let B1 = {2} and B2 = {1, 2}. Then (B1, B2) /∈ Γ(H(M)). Because when we take H = {2}, B1 ⊆ H and B2 * H which implies B1 ⊆ H → B2 ⊆ H dose not hold. By this way, we can obtain Γ(H(M)) = Θ.\nInspired by the example, we find that the congruence relation Γ(H(M)) is dense in the dependence space (U,ΘM ).\nProposition 6. Let M be a matroid of U . Then H(M) is dense in (U,ΘM ).\nPROOF. By the definition of dense family, we need to prove ΘM = Γ(H(M)). Utilizing Proposition 3, we have proved the result.\nFor a dependence space, the redusts of a given subset can be characterized by its dense family through the following way.\nLemma 4. [23] Let Γ be dense in a dependence space (U,Θ). For all X ⊆ U , REDΘ(X) = Min({B ⊆ U : B ⋂\nT 6= ∅ (∀T ∈ Com(Γ)}), where Com(Γ) = {T 6= ∅, X − T ∈ Γ}.\nTherefore, we present the other expression for bases of matroids in terms of hyperplanes. In fact, for any element of B(M |X), it is a minimal set with respect to the property of containing at leat one element from each nonempty difference X −H , where H is a hyperplane of M .\nTheorem 5. Let M be a matroid of U and X ⊆ U . Then B(M |X) = Min({B ⊆ U : B ⋂\nT 6= ∅ (∀T ∈ Com(H(M))}), where Com(H(M))}) = {T 6= ∅, X − T ∈ H(M))}}.\nPROOF. The result is obtained by combining Proposition 6 with Lemma 4.\nFinally, we show an example to conclude this section.\nExample 4. Suppose the matroid M is given in Example 1 and X = {1, 3}. By Example 1, clM ({1, 3}) = clM ({1}) = clM ({3}) = {1, 3}. On one hand, Min({Y ⊆ X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}) = {{1}, {3}}. On the other hand, since H(M) = {{2}, {1, 3}}, Com(H(M)) = {T 6= ∅, X − T ∈ H(M)} = {{1, 3}}. Thus Min({T ⊆ U : B ⋂\nT 6= ∅ (∀T ∈ Com(H(M))}) = Min({{1}, {3}, {1, 3}}) = {{1}, {3}}. Therefore B(M |X) = Min({Y ⊆ X : clM (Y ) = clM (X)}) = Min({B ⊆ U : B ⋂ T 6= ∅ (∀T ∈ Com(H(M))})."

Matroids generalized from matrices have been widely used in many fields, particularly greedy algorithm design, which plays an important role in attribute reduction. Therefore, it is meaningful to combine matroids with rough sets to solve the optimization problems. In this paper, we introduce an existing algebraic structure called dependence space to study the reduction problem in terms of matroids. First, a dependence space of matroids is constructed. Second, the characterizations for the space such as consistent sets and reducts are studied through matroids. Finally, we investigate matroids by the means of the space and present two expressions for their bases. In a word, this paper provides new approaches to study attribute reduction.",
