      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Rough set theory is first proposed by Pawlak [17,18] for dealing with vagueness and granularity in information systems. In theory, rough sets have been connected with matroids [23,25], lattices [4,7,14,26], hyperstructure theory [30], topology [11,12,38], fuzzy sets [10,27], and so on. Rough set theory is built on equivalence relations or partitions. But equivalence relations and partitions are too restrictive for many applications. To address this issue, several meaningful extensions of Pawlak rough sets have been proposed. Among them, Zakowski [35] has used coverings to establish covering based rough set theory. Many scholars [1,2,5,19,20,40] have done deep researches on this theory. Recently, covering based rough set theory gained some new development [6,31,33,36].\nIn covering based rough sets, the neighborhood of an element is the intersection of all the covering blocks containing the element. All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. Among various types of covering based rough sets, there are some [22,21,32,28,37] defined by neighborhoods. Furthermore, there are many properties [9,15,16,39] of covering based rough sets associated with the properties of coverings of neighborhoods. This makes coverings of neighborhoods be important research subject. Lin [13] augmented the relational database with neighborhoods.\n⋆ Corresponding author. E-mail: williamfengzhu@gmail.com(William Zhu)\nYao [32] presented a framework for the formulation, interpretation, and comparison of a specific class of neighborhood systems (called 1-neighborhood systems) induced by binary relations and rough set approximations. By means of consistent functions based on neighborhoods, Wang et al. [24] dealt with the reduction issues on covering decision systems. Many scholars [3,8,21,34] and we studied under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a partition. In the course of studying this issue, we proposed the concept of repeat degree. With the help of this concept, we addressed this issue as well as the issue that under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is equal to the covering inducing it.\nIn this paper, we study further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. We prove these two issues are equivalent. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree and prove that partial information of repeat degree cannot determine the covering.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the relevant concepts. In Section 3, we introduce the concept of repeat degree and study some properties of it. In Section 4, we first study under what condition a subset of a set family is a reduct of the set family. Then we present a sufficient and necessary condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be the reduct of the covering inducing it. In Section 5, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for two coverings to induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. In Section 6, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree. Section 7 concludes this paper."

      "text" : "For a better understanding to this paper, in this section, some basic concepts are introduced. In this paper, we denote ∪X∈SX by ∪S, where S is a set family.\nDefinition 1. (Covering) Let U be a universe of discourse and C be a family of subsets of U . If ∅ /∈ C and ∪C = U , C is called a covering of U . Every element of C is called a covering block.\nIn the following discussion, unless stated to the contrary, the universe of discourseU is considered to be finite and nonempty. Neighborhood [1,13,20,21,24,32] is a concept used widely in covering based rough sets. It is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2. (Neighborhood) Let C be a covering of U . For any x ∈ U , the neighborhood of x is defined by: NC(x) = ∩{K ∈ C : x ∈ K}. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nIt is obvious x ∈ NC(x) and for any x ∈ K ∈ C, NC(x) ⊆ K . The following proposition gives an important property of neighborhoods.\nProposition 1. [24] Let C be a covering of U . For any x, y ∈ U , if y ∈ N(x), N(y) ⊆ N(x).\nIf y ∈ N(x) and x ∈ N(y), by the above proposition, we have N(x) = N(y). All the neighborhoods induced by a covering of a universe form a set family. This set family is still a covering of the universe. This type of set families have been studied by many scholars [3,8,21,24,34]. However, both the term and the mark of it are not identical. In this paper, we call it covering of neighborhoods and cite the mark proposed by Wang et al. [24].\nDefinition 3. (Covering of neighborhoods) Let C be a covering of U . The covering of neighborhoods induced by C is defined by: Cov(C) = {N(x) : x ∈ U}.\nAccording to x ∈ N(x), it is obvious ∪Cov(C) = ∪C."

In the following discussion, unless stated to the contrary, for any set family C, ∪C is considered to be finite and nonempty.\nDefinition 4. (Repeat degree) Let C be a covering on ∪C and X ⊆ ∪C. The repeat degree of X with respect to covering C is defined by: ∂C(X) = |{K ∈ C : X ⊆ K}|. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nFor the convenience of writing, we denote ∂C({x}) as ∂C(x). According to the above definition, for any X ⊆ Y ⊆ ∪C, it follows that ∂C(X) ≥ ∂C(Y ). To illustrate the concept of repeat degree, let us see the following example.\nExample 1. Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4} and C = {{1, 2}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4}}. Then ∂(∅) = 3, ∂(1) = 1, ∂(2) = ∂(3) = ∂(4) = 2, ∂({1, 2}) = ∂({2, 3}) = ∂({2, 4}) = 1, ∂({1, 3}) = ∂({1, 4}) = 0, ∂({3, 4}) = 2, ∂({2, 3, 4}) = 1, ∂({1, 3, 4}) = ∂({1, 2, 4}) = ∂({1, 2, 3}) = 0 and ∂({1, 2, 3, 4}) = 0.\nRepeat degree has the following basic property.\nProposition 2. Let C be a covering on ∪C. For any x, y ∈ ∪C, ∂(x) = ∂({x, y}) ⇔ {K ∈ C : {x} ⊆ K} = {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K}.\nProof. (⇒): It is obvious {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K} ⊆ {K ∈ C : {x} ⊆ K}. If {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K} 6= {K ∈ C : {x} ⊆ K}, {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K} is a proper subset of {K ∈ C : {x} ⊆ K}. Since {K ∈ C : {x} ⊆ K} is a finite set, |{K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K}| < |{K ∈ C : {x} ⊆ K}|. Thus ∂({x, y}) < ∂(x). This is a contradiction to that ∂(x) = ∂({x, y}).\n(⇐): It is straightforward.\nAccording to the above proposition, we obtain an important relationship between repeat degree and neighborhoods.\nProposition 3.

      "heading" : "4 A condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct",
      "text" : "In 2003, Zhu et al. [40] proposed two concepts called reducible element and the reduct of a covering, which have important applications in covering based rough set theory. In this section, we will discuss under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a reduct. First, we propose a new mark.\nDefinition 5. Let C be a covering on ∪C. We define I(C) = {∪D : D ⊆ C}.\nI(C) has the following simple property.\nProposition 4. Let C be a covering on ∪C and B ⊆ C. Then I(B) ⊆ I(C).\nProof. For any K ∈ I(B), we know that there exists some D ⊆ B such that K = ∪D. It is obvious D ⊆ C. Thus K ∈ I(C), therefore I(B) ⊆ I(C).\nBased on Definition 5, we introduce the concept of reducible element, which is somewhat different in form from its definition in [40].\nDefinition 6. Let C be a covering on ∪C. The reducible element family of C is defined by: S(C) = {K ∈ C : K ∈ I(C − {K})}. If K ∈ S(C), K is called a reducible element of C, otherwise K is called an irreducible element of C.\nThe following proposition presents a simple property of S(C).\nProposition 5. Let C be a covering on ∪C and B ⊆ C. Then S(B) ⊆ S(C).\nProof. For any A ∈ S(B), by Definition 6, we know that A ∈ B∧A ∈ I(B−{A}). By B ⊆ C and Proposition 4, we have that A ∈ C ∧A ∈ I(C− {A}). Hence A ∈ S(C). Therefore S(B) ⊆ S(C).\nThe following proposition indicates that deleting a reducible element in a covering will not make any original reducible element become an irreducible element of the new covering.\nProposition 6. [40] Let C be a covering on ∪C and K1 ∈ S(C). K ∈ S(C)−{K1} iff K ∈ S(C− {K1}).\nFor the convenience of application, we extend the above proposition.\nProposition 7. Let C be a covering on ∪C and F ⊆ S(C). K ∈ S(C) − F iff K ∈ S(C− F ).\nProof. (⇒): Let |F | = n. We prove this proposition using induction on n. If n = 1, this proposition follows from Proposition 6. Assume that this proposition is true for n = t. Now assume that |F | = t + 1. For any L ∈ F , by Proposition 6, we have that K ∈ S(C−{L}). Let F ′ = F −{L}. For any B ∈ F ′, by Proposition 6, we have that B ∈ S(C− {L}). Thus F ′ ⊆ S(C− {L}). By K /∈ F , we know that K /∈ F ′. Hence K ∈ S(C− {L})− F ′. It is obvious |F ′| = t. By the induction hypothesis, we know that K ∈ S((C−{L})−F ′). Since (C−{L})−F ′ = (C−{L})−(F−{L}) = C−F , K ∈ S(C− F ).\n(⇐): By Proposition 5, we have that S(C− F ) ⊆ S(C). For any K ∈ S(C− F ), it is obvious K /∈ F . Therefore K ∈ S(C)− F .\nBelow we give the definition of the reduct of a covering, which is somewhat different in form from its definition in [40].\nDefinition 7. (Reduct) Let C be a covering on ∪C. The reduct of C is defined by: reduct(C) = C− S(C).\nreduct(C) has the following property.\nProposition 8. C ⊆ I(reduct(C)).\nProof. For any K ∈ C, K ∈ reduct(C) or K ∈ S(C). If K ∈ reduct(C), {K} ⊆ reduct(C). By K = ∪{K}, we have thatK ∈ I(reduct(C)). If K ∈ S(C), reduct(C) ∪ {K} = (C − S(C)) ∪ {K} = C − (S(C) − {K}). By Proposition 7, we have that K ∈ S(C − (S(C) − {K})). Hence K ∈ S(reduct(C) ∪ {K}). By Definition 6, we know that K ∈ I((reduct(C) ∪ {K}) − {K}) = I(reduct(C)). Thus C ⊆ I(reduct(C)).\nBased on the above proposition, we obtain the following proposition.\nProposition 9. Let C be a covering on ∪C and B ⊆ C. If C ⊆ I(B) and for any K ∈ B, C * I(B − {K}), B = reduct(C).\nProof. Suppose reduct(C) − B 6= ∅ and A ∈ reduct(C) − B. It is obvious A /∈ S(C). Thus for any D ⊆ C − {A}, it follows that A 6= ∪D. Since B ⊆ C − {A}, A 6= ∪F for any F ⊆ B. Hence A /∈ I(B). Thus C * I(B). It is contradictory. Therefore reduct(C) ⊆ B. Suppose B − reduct(C) 6= ∅ and L ∈ B − reduct(C). It is obvious reduct(C) ⊆ B − {L}. By Proposition 8 and Proposition 4, we have that C ⊆ I(reduct(C)) ⊆ I(B − {L}). It is contradictory. Thus B − reduct(C) = ∅. Hence B ⊆ reduct(C). Therefore B = reduct(C).\nAccording to Propositions 8 and 9, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the family.\nTheorem 1. Let C be a covering on ∪C and B ⊆ C. B = reduct(C) iff C ⊆ I(B) and for any K ∈ B, C * I(B − {K}).\nProof. (⇒): By Proposition 8, we have that C ⊆ I(reduct(C)) = I(B). For any K ∈ reduct(C), we know that K /∈ I(C − {K}). By (reduct(C) − {K}) ⊆ (C − {K}) and Proposition 4, we have that K /∈ I(reduct(C)− {K}) = I(B − {K}).\n(⇐): It follows from Proposition 9.\nConsidering both the concepts of reduct and covering of neighborhoods, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 10. reduct(Cov(C)) = Cov(C).\nProof. By Definition 7, we need to prove only S(Cov(C)) = ∅. We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose S(Cov(C)) 6= ∅ and N(x) ∈ S(Cov(C)), where x ∈ ∪C. By Definition 6, we know that there exists some D ⊆ Cov(C) − {N(x)} such that N(x) = ∪D. Thus x ∈ ∪D. Then there exists some N(y) ∈ D such that x ∈ N(y). By Proposition 1, we have that N(x) ⊆ N(y). But byN(y) ∈ D ⊆ Cov(C)−{N(x)}, we have that N(y) ⊂ N(x). It is contradictory.\nFor obtaining a necessary and sufficient condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct, we propose the following concept.\nDefinition 8. Let C be a covering on ∪C. For any x ∈ ∪C, we define ΓC(x) by: ΓC(x) = {K ∈ C : x ∈ K ∧ ∀y(y ∈ K → ∂C({x, y}) = ∂C(x))}. When there is no confusion, we omit the subscript C.\nTo illustrate the above definition, let us see an example.\nExample 2. Let C = {{1, 2}, {1, 2, 3}, {3, 4}}. Then ΓC(1) = ΓC(2) = {{1, 2}}, ΓC(4) = {{3, 4}}, ΓC(3) = ∅ and {1, 2, 3} /∈ ΓC(1) ∪ ΓC(2) ∪ ΓC(3) ∪ ΓC(4).\nΓC(x) has the following property.\nProposition 11. |ΓC(x)| ≤ 1.\nProof. Let K1 ∈ ΓC(x), K2 ∈ ΓC(x) and y ∈ K1. By Definition 8, we know that ∂C({x, y}) = ∂C(x). By Proposition 2, we have that {K ∈ C : x ∈ K} = {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K}. Since x ∈ K2, K2 ∈ {K ∈ C : x ∈ K}. Hence K2 ∈ {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K}, then {x, y} ⊆ K2, thus y ∈ K2. Hence K1 ⊆ K2. Similarly, K2 ⊆ K1. Therefore K1 = K2. Hence |ΓC(x)| ≤ 1.\nBy the above proposition, we obtain the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. If ΓC(x) 6= ∅, ∪ΓC(x) ∈ C.\nThe following proposition gives a relationship between ΓC(x) and NC(x).\nProposition 12. If ΓC(x) 6= ∅, ∪ΓC(x) = NC(x).\nProof. Let x ∈ A ∈ C and y ∈ ∪ΓC(x). By Definition 8, we know that ∂C({x, y}) = ∂C(x). By Proposition 2, we have that {K ∈ C : x ∈ K} = {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K}. Since A ∈ {K ∈ C : x ∈ K}, A ∈ {K ∈ C : {x, y} ⊆ K}. Hence {x, y} ⊆ A, thus y ∈ A. Therefore ∪ΓC(x) ⊆ A. By Definition 8 and Corollary 1, we know that ∪ΓC(x) ∈ {K ∈ C : x ∈ K}. Therefore ∪ΓC(x) = ∩{K ∈ C : x ∈ K} = NC(x).\nBased on the above proposition, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 13. NC(x) ∈ C iff ΓC(x) 6= ∅.\nProof. (⇒): We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose ΓC(x) = ∅. For any K ∈ {L ∈ C : x ∈ L}, it is obvious there exists some y ∈ K such that ∂C({x, y}) 6= ∂C(x). By Proposition 3, we know that y /∈ NC(x). Thus K 6= NC(x). Hence NC(x) /∈ {L ∈ C : x ∈ L}. Since x ∈ NC(x), NC(x) /∈ C. It is a contradiction to the hypothesis.\n(⇐): It follows from Proposition 12 and Corollary 1.\nFor obtaining and proving a necessary and sufficient condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct, we need the following simple property of neighborhoods.\nProposition 14. C ⊆ I(Cov(C)).\nProof. For any K ∈ C and any x ∈ K , we have that {x} ⊆ NC(x) ⊆ K . Then ∪x∈K{x} ⊆ ∪x∈KNC(x) ⊆ ∪x∈KK . Thus K ⊆ ∪x∈KNC(x) ⊆ K . Hence K = ∪x∈KNC(x). Therefore C ⊆ I(Cov(C)).\nBased on some above propositions, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a covering of neighborhoods to be a reduct.\nTheorem 2. Cov(C) = reduct(C) iff for any x ∈ ∪C, ΓC(x) 6= ∅.\nProof. (⇒): We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose there exists some x ∈ ∪C such that ΓC(x) = ∅. By Proposition 13, we know that NC(x) /∈ C. Thus Cov(C) 6= reduct(C).\n(⇐): By Proposition 13, we know that Cov(C) ⊆ C. For any NC(x), by Proposition 10, we know that NC(x) /∈ I(Cov(C) − {NC(x)}). Since NC(x) ∈ C, C * I(Cov(C)−{NC(x)}). Again by Proposition 14 and Theorem 1, we know that Cov(C) = reduct(C)."

Afterwards, this type of binary relation has been studied further [36,39]. In this section, we will give a necessary and sufficient condition for two coverings to induce a same relation. In addition, we will prove that under the same condition two coverings induce a same covering of neighborhoods.\nDefinition 9. (Successor neighborhood) Let R be a binary relation on U and x ∈ U . The successor neighborhood of x is defined by: SR(x) = {y : xRy}.\nNow we introduce the method of inducing a relation by a covering.\nDefinition 10.

By NC2(x) 6= Ki, we know that there exists some w ∈ U − {x} such that NC2(w) = Ki. By Proposition 1, we have that NC2(x) ⊂ NC2(w). Thus Kj ⊂ Ki.

Let C1 be a covering on ∪C1 and C2 be a covering on ∪C2. If C1 6= C2, D(C1) 6= D(C2).\nProof. We use the proof by contradiction. Suppose D(C1) = D(C2). Then ∪C1 = ∪C2. Let U = ∪C1 = ∪C2 and |U | = n. For any K ⊆ U , we claim that ρC1(K) = ρC2(K). We prove this assertion using induction on n− |K|. If n− |K| = 0, K = U . Thus ρC1(U) = ∂C1(U) = ∂C2(U) = ρC2(U). Assume this assertion is true for n−|K| ≤ t−1. Now assume n−|K| = t. By Proposition 19, we have that ρC1(K) = ∂C1(K) − ΣK⊂X⊆∪CρC1(X) = ∂C2(K) − ΣK⊂X⊆∪CρC2(X) = ρC2(K). Hence δ(C1) = δ(C2). By Proposition 20, we have that C1 = C2. It is contradictory.\nBelow we give a method of calculating the covering by repeat degree. In fact, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 6. Let U be a finite and nonempty set. Let for any Y ⊆ U , mappings f : 2U → R and g : 2U → R satisfy f(Y ) = ΣY⊆X⊆Ug(X). Then for any V ⊆ U , g(V ) = ΣV⊆Z⊆U ((−1)|Z|−|V |f(Z)).\nProof. Let |U | − |V | = k. We prove this assertion using induction on k. By f(Y ) = ΣY⊆X⊆Ug(X), we have that f(U) = g(U). Thus this assertion is true for k = 0. Assume this assertion is true for k ≤ t − 1. Now assume k = t. Let Z ⊆ U such that V ⊂ Z . Let V (i) = {X ⊆ U |V ⊂ X ∧ |X | − |V | = i} and Z(i) = {H ∈ V (i)|H ⊆ Z}. We have that |Z(i)| = Ci|Z|−|V |. For any V ⊂ X ⊆ U , it is obvious |U |− |X | ≤ t−1. By the assumption of the induction and Σni=0(−1) iCin = 0, we have that\nf(V ) = ΣV⊆X⊆Ug(X)\n= g(V ) +ΣV⊂X⊆Ug(X)\n= g(V ) +ΣV⊂X⊆UΣX⊆Z⊆U (−1)|Z|−|X|f(Z)\n= g(V ) +Σki=1(ΣV⊂Z⊆U (−1) |Z|−|V |−iCi|Z|−|V |f(Z))\n= g(V ) +ΣV⊂Z⊆U (f(Z)Σ k i=1(−1) |Z|−|V |−iCi|Z|−|V |)\n= g(V ) +ΣV ⊂Z⊆U ((−1)|Z|−|V |−1f(Z)).\nThus\ng(V ) = f(V )−ΣV ⊂Z⊆U ((−1)|Z|−|V |−1f(Z))\n= f(V ) +ΣV ⊂Z⊆U ((−1)|Z|−|V |f(Z))\n= ΣV ⊆Z⊆U (−1)|Z|−|V |f(Z).\nBy the above theorem and Proposition 19, we have the following corollary.\nCorollary 2. ρC(V ) = ΣV ⊆Z⊆U ((−1)|Z|−|V |∂C(Z)).\nGiven a D(C), by the above corollary, we can calculate the δ(C). Again by Proposition 21, we obtain C. On the other hand, let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U and |U | = n. If W ⊂ {1, 2, · · · , n}, C1 6= C2 does not imply DC1(W ) 6= DC1(W ). To illustrate this, let us see an example.\nExample 6. Let C1 = {{a, b}, {b, c}, {a, c}} and C2 = {{a, b, c}, {a}, {b}, {c}}. ThenDC1({1, 2}) = {({a}, 2), ({b}, 2), ({c}, 2), ({a, b}, 1), ({b, c}, 1), ({a, c}, 1)}= DC2({1, 2}).\nIn fact, we have the following proposition, in which we denote |X | as Card(X).\nProposition 23. Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U and Card(U) = n > 1. C1 6= C2 and DC1({1, 2, · · · , n − 1}) = DC2({1, 2, · · · , n − 1}) iff {C1,C2} = {{X ⊆ U : 2|Card(X)}, {X ⊆ U : 2 ∤ Card(X)}}.\nProof. (⇒): Suppose ∂C1(U) = ∂C2(U). ThenD(C1) = {(U, ∂C1(U))}∪DC1({1, 2, · · · , n − 1}) = {(U, ∂C2(U))} ∪ DC2({1, 2, · · · , n − 1}) = D(C2). By Proposition 22, we have that C1 = C2. It is contradictory. Thus ∂C1(U) 6= ∂C2(U). Without loss of generality, suppose ∂C1(U) = 0 and ∂C2(U) = 1. It is obvious ρC1(U) = 0 and ρC2(U) = 1. For any X ⊆ U , let Card(U) − Card(X) = k. We claim that X ∈ C1 iff 2 ∤ k and X ∈ C2 iff 2|k. We prove this assertion using induction on k. If k = 1, by Proposition 19, we have that ∂C1(X) = ρC1(X) + ρC1(U) ≤ 1 and ∂C2(X) = ρC2(X) + ρC2(U) ≥ 1. Thus ∂C1(X) = ∂C2(X) = 1, ρC1(X) = 1 and ρC2(X) = 0. Hence X ∈ C1 and X /∈ C2. If k = 2, by Proposition 19, we have that ∂C1(X) = ρC1(X) + ΣX⊂Y⊆∪CρC1(Y ) = ρC1(X) + C 1 2 = ρC1(X) + 2 ≥ 2 and ∂C2(X) = ρC2(X) + ρC2(U) = ρC2(X) + 1 ≤ 2. Thus ∂C1(X) = ∂C2(X) = 2, ρC1(X) = 0 and ρC2(X) = 1. Hence X /∈ C1 and X ∈ C2. Assume this assertion is true for k ≤ t − 1. Now assume k = t. It is obvious 2|t or 2 ∤ t. If 2|t, by Proposition 19 and the assumption of the induction, we have that ∂C1(X) = ρC1(X) + ΣX⊂Y⊆∪CρC1(Y ) = ρC1(X) + Σ t 2 i=1C 2i−1 t and ∂C2(X) = ρC2(X) + ΣX⊂Y⊆∪CρC2(Y ) = ρC2(X) + Σ t 2 i=1C 2i t . By Σ t 2 i=1C 2i t = Σ t 2 i=1C 2i−1 t − 1 and ∂C1(X) = ∂C2(X), we have that ρC2(X) − ρC1(X) = 1. Hence ρC1(X) = 0 and ρC2(X) = 1. Therefore X /∈ C1 and X ∈ C2. If 2 ∤ t, by Proposition 19 and the assumption of the induction, we have that ∂C1(X) = ρC1(X)+ΣX⊂Y⊆∪CρC1(Y ) = ρC1(X) + Σ t−1 2 i=1 C 2i t and ∂C2(X) = ρC2(X) + ΣX⊂Y⊆∪CρC2(Y ) = ρC2(X) + Σ t+1 2\ni=1C 2i−1 t . By Σ\nt−1\n2 i=1 C 2i t = Σ\nt+1\n2 i=1C 2i−1 t − 1 and ∂C1(X) = ∂C2(X), we have that\nρC1(X) − ρC2(X) = 1. Hence ρC1(X) = 1 and ρC2(X) = 0. Therefore X ∈ C1 and X /∈ C2.\n(⇐): Without loss of generality, suppose C1 = {X ⊆ U : 2 ∤ Card(X)} and C2 = {X ⊆ U : 2|Card(X)}. It is obvious C1 6= C2. Let X ⊂ U and |X | = t. It is obvious 2|t or 2 ∤ t. If 2|t, ∂C1(X) = Σ [n−t−1 2 ] i=0 C 2i+1 n−t and ∂C2(X) = Σ [n−t 2 ]\ni=0 C 2i n−t. If 2 ∤ t, ∂C1(X) = Σ\n[n−t 2 ] i=0 C 2i n−t and ∂C2(X) = Σ [n−t−1 2 ] i=0 C 2i+1 n−t . Since\nΣ [n−t−1 2 ]\ni=0 C 2i+1 n−t = Σ\n[n−t 2 ] i=0 C 2i n−t, ∂C1(X) = ∂C2(X). Thus DC1({1, 2, · · · , n− 1}) =\nDC1({1, 2, · · · , n− 1}).\nBy the above proposition, we know that partial information of repeat degree cannot determine the covering. In order to calculate the covering by repeat degree, we have to know D(C). It is obvious PC(x) depends on only DC({1, 2}). Let C1 and C2 be two coverings on U . By the above proposition, we know that for any x ∈ U , PC1(x) = PC2(x) does not imply C1 = C2. Thus if we know nothing about C but DC({1, 2}), we cannot calculate C. However, we can still calculate Cov(C) by Theorem 5. And in this case, with the help of repeat degree, some issues, such as whether Cov(C) is a reduct, whether Cov(C) is a partition, can also be determined."

All the neighborhoods form a new covering called a covering of neighborhoods. In the course of studying under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is a partition, the concept of repeat degree is proposed, with the help of which the issue is addressed. This paper studies further the application of repeat degree on coverings of neighborhoods. First, we investigate under what condition a covering of neighborhoods is the reduct of the covering inducing it. As a preparation for addressing this issue, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of a set family to be the reduct of the set family. Then we study under what condition two coverings induce a same relation and a same covering of neighborhoods. Finally, we give the method of calculating the covering according to repeat degree.",
