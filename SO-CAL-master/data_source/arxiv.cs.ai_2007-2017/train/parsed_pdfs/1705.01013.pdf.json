      "text" : "Data fusion has been widely studied in the last decades, especially its military applications. Multi-sensor data fusion (MSDF) technology plays a more and more significant role for the fighting demand. How to fuse the sensor data is still an open issue[1–4]. Due to the powerful ability of handling uncertain information, DS evidence theory is widely used in MSDF[5–8]. However, Lots of interference exist in the complex practical situation. The information provided by a sensor report is likely to be disturbed and incorrect. In this case, strong conflict may exist among evidences and lead to a wrong fusion result. Handling conflict is crucial in data fusion[9–12]. To address it, many approaches have been proposed[13–15].\nTo deal with conflictive information, most previous methods handle evidences based on the relationship among the data collected by sensors[16–19]. In this letter, however, an method which bases on the properties of a sensor itself is proposed. To evaluate the reliability of sensor reports, a confidence coefficient curve is determined based on a quantum mechanical approach. Interest in quantum approach to classical fuzzy logic has increased over the last decades[20–23]. In classical mechanics, a particle is located in an exact place. If a particle is known to be in M, then it can never in any other places, like in N. In quantum mechanics, however, a particle can never be exactly located due to the well-known Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation. Only the probability of finding the particle in a given area like M or N can be determined (shown as Figure ??). This interesting property of quantum mechanics is used to describe the reliability degree of a sensor report as it is hard to assert that one sensor report is totally reliable or unreliable. Then we use the curve to calculate the credibility of evidences. The fusion results of the modified evidences show the effectiveness of our method."

      "text" : "fusion\nRadar plays an important role in the modern battlefield. Usually, to obtain the overall information, data from several radars need to be fused. Aiming to do a more reasonable fusion, we propose an method based on quantum mechanics to determine the confidence coefficient curve of radar sensor reports. We assume that the reliability of sensor reports relates to the distance between object and sensor in some degrees. For each distance x, the sensor has an according confidence coefficient whose maximum value is 1. Hence, confidence coefficient curve µ (x) is defined as a function to describe this relationship.\nThe signal of the object is received by k radars. The transmit power of the object is Pt, the antenna gain of the object is Gt, the antenna gain of the reconnaissance radar is Gr, the distance between object and a radar is denoted as x. The signal power received by radar is:\nPr = PtGtGrσλ\n2\n(4πx)2 (6)\nwhere λ is the wavelength and σ is Radar Cross-Section which is the product of geometric cross-section, reflection coefficient and direction coefficient.\nIf the sensitivity of a radar is Prmin, the maximal reconnaissance distance xr is calculated as follows. If the object is far beyond this distance, it will not be effectively reconnoitred.\nxr =\n[\nPtGtGrσλ 2 (4π)2Prmin\n] 1 2\n(7)\nAccording to the quantum-mechanical rules of quantification, we should write\nan operator which corresponds to the received signal power:\nH = −c2 ∂ 2\n∂x2 − V (x) (8)\nwhere c is a scale factor. V (x) is a quasi-potential function to model the received power.\nV (x) =\n{\nγ x2 0 < x ≤ xr ∞ x ≤ 0, x > xr (9)\nwhere γ ∝ PtGtGrσλ2 (4π)2 corresponds to the parameters in Eq. (6). The quasipotential function V (x) is roughly illustrated as Figure 1.\nBased on quantum-mechanical rules, a quasi time-independent Schrödinger equation can be obtained.\nHψ (x) = Lψ (x) (10)\nwhere L relates to the level of the radar sensitivity Prmin.\nThe solution of Eq. (10) is a quasi-amplitude distribution ψ (x). When the\nobject is within the maximal reconnaissance distance xr, we can obtain:\nψ (x) ∝ √ x\n[\nJα\n(√ L\nc\n)\n+ Yα\n(√ L\nc\n)]\n(11)\nwhere Jα and Yα are the Bessel function of the first kind and the second kind respectively. α is their order:\nα = 1\n2\n√\nc2 − 4γ c2\n(12)\nThen let us consider the other situation, when the object is beyond xr, the value of V (x) is infinite. According to quantum mechanics, it is impossible for a particle to penetrate the well wall if it is within a infinite well potential. Hence, we can conclude that ψ (x) = 0 in this case.\nThen we can obtain the probability distribution P (x), which is illustrated graphically in Figure 2.\nP (x) = |ψ (x)|2 ∝ x [\nJα\n(√ L\nc\n)\n+ Yα\n(√ L\nc\n)]2\n(13)\nBy amplifying Eq. (13), we can obtain the confidence coefficient curve µ (x). Seen from Figure 3, the curve rises rapidly when x is smaller than x0 and comes to its maximum when x equals to x0. Then it declines slowly until x comes to xr, which is reasonable. In practical situation, due to precision and some other intricate issues, a radar do not work well when it is too close to the object. There exists an optimal distance x0 for a radar to work. Then the performance of a radar becomes poorer as it is located further. When the distance is further than the maximal reconnaissance distance, the radar can not reconnoitre the object effectively. With the basis of this curve, we can evaluate the reliability of radar reports effectively. For different types of radars, we\ncan obtain their according confidence coefficient curves as Figure 4. The parameters of these curves are in Table 1. In the following, the curves are used in combining evidences. Assume we have k pieces of BOEs: m1, m2, . . . , mk, collected from k radar sensors. By using confidence coefficient curves, each BOE corresponds to one confidence coefficient: µ1, µ2, . . . , µk. The credibility\ndegree Crdi of BOE mi is defined as:\nCrdi = µi k ∑\ni=1\nµi\n(14)\nIt is easy to find that ∑k\ni=iCrdi. Hence, the credibility degree reveals the\nrelatively importance of the collected evidence. After determining the credibility of each BOE, we do a modified average for all k pieces of BOEs to obtain a new evidence m′.\nm′ =\nk ∑\ni=1\nCrdi ×mi (15)\nThen we can combine m′ with itself for k − 1 times by using classical combining rule (Eq. (4)), which is same as Murphy’s approach[18]. Obviously, if a BOE is collected from a sensor with high reliability, it will have more effect on the final combination results. On the contrary, if a BOE is collected from a sensor with relatively low reliability, it will matter little in the final combination results."

      "text" : "In this section, a numerical example is illustrated to show the effectiveness of our method. In a target recognition system, five radar sensors have collected five pieces of BOEs shown as follows:\n(R1, m1) = ([{A} , 0.6] , [{B} , 0.15] , [{A,C} , 0.25]) (R2, m2) = ([{A} , 0.5] , [{B} , 0.3] , [{C} , 0.2]) (R3, m3) = ([{B} , 0.95] , [{C} , 0.05]) (R4, m4) = ([{A} , 0.55] , [{B} , 0.25] , [{A,C} , 0.2]) (R5, m5) = ([{A} , 0.6] , [{B} , 0.3] , [{B,C} , 0.1])\nThe reliability of these sensor reports is 0.55, 0.6, 0.25, 0.45 and 0.5 respectively, which is obtained based on their confidence coefficient curves. Then fusion results and comparison are shown in Table 2. Four evidences prefer to\nrecognizing the target as A. Hence, data from the third sensor is probable to\nbe interfered and incorrect. As can be seen from Table 2, in this situation, our method works better than Murphy’s while the classical combining rule does not work. The target can be effectively recognized with our method."

    "abstractText" : "Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is wildly applied in multi-sensor data fusion. However, lots of uncertainty and interference exist in practical situation, especially in the battle field. It is still an open issue to model the reliability of sensor reports. Many methods are proposed based on the relationship among collected data. In this letter, we proposed a quantum mechanical approach to evaluate the reliability of sensor reports, which is based on the properties of a sensor itself. The proposed method is used to modify the combining of evidences.",
