      "text" : "intelligence and visual recognition, well surpassing traditional shallow architectures trained using hand-designed features. The power of deep networks stems both from their ability to perform local computations followed by pointwise non-linearities over increasingly larger receptive fields, and from the simplicity and scalability of the gradient-descent training procedure based on backpropagation. An open problem is the inclusion of layers that perform global, structured matrix computations like segmentation (e.g. normalized cuts) or higher-order pooling (e.g. log-tangent space metrics defined over the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices) while preserving the validity and efficiency of an end-to-end deep training framework. In this paper we propose a sound mathematical apparatus to formally integrate global structured computation into deep computation architectures. At the heart of our methodology is the development of the theory and practice of backpropagation that generalizes to the calculus of adjoint matrix variations. We perform segmentation experiments using the BSDS and MSCOCO benchmarks and demonstrate that deep networks relying on second-order pooling and normalized cuts layers, trained end-to-end using matrix backpropagation, outperform counterparts that do not take advantage of such global layers."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Recently, the end-to-end learning of deep architectures using stochastic gradient descent, based on very large datasets, has produced impressive results in realistic settings, for a variety of computer vision and machine learning domains[2, 3, 4]. There is now a renewed enthusiasm of creating integrated, automatic models that can handle the diverse tasks associated with an able perceiving system.\nOne of the most widely used architecture is the convolutional network (ConvNet) [5, 2], a deep processing model based on the composition of convolution and pooling with pointwise nonlinearities for efficient classification and learning. While ConvNets are sufficiently expressive for classification tasks, a comprehensive, deep architecture, that uniformly covers the types of non-linearities required for other visual calculations has not yet been established. In turn, matrix factorization plays a central role in classical (shallow) algorithms for many different computer vision and machine learning problems, such as image segmentation [6], feature extraction, descriptor design [7, 8], structure from motion [9], camera calibration [10], and dimensionality reduction [11, 12], among others. Singular value decomposition (SVD) in particular, is extremely popular because of its ability to efficiently produce global solutions to various problems.\nIn this paper we propose to enrich the dictionary of deep networks with layer generalizations and fundamental matrix function computational blocks that have proved successful and flexible over years in vision and learning models with global constraints. We consider layers which are explicitly structure-aware in the sense that they preserve global invariants of the underlying problem. Our paper makes two main contributions. The first one is mathematical, devoted to showing how to operate with structured layers when learning a deep network. For this we outline a matrix generalization of backpropagation that offers a rigorous, formal treatment of global properties. Our second main contribution is to instantiate the methodology to learn convolutional networks with two different and very successful types of structured layers: 1) second-order pooling [8] and 2) normalized cuts [6]. An illustration of the resulting deep architecture for O2P is given in fig. 1. In challenging datasets like BSDS and MSCOCO, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility and added value of these two types of networks over counterparts not using global computational layers. ∗This is an extended version of the ICCV 2015 article [1] †catalin.ionescu@ins.uni-bonn.de ‡orestis.vantzos@ins.uni-bonn.de §cristian.sminchisescu@math.lth.se\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n07 83\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n5 Se\np 20\n15\nRelated Work. Our work relates both to the extensive literature in the area of (deep) neural networks (see [4] for a review) with particular emphasis on ConvNets[2, 5] and with (shallow) architectures that have been proven popular and successful in computer vision[6, 13, 8, 14]. While deep neural networks models have focused, traditionally, on generality and scalability, the shallow computer vision architectures have often been designed with global computation and visual structure modeling in mind. Our objective in this work is to provide one possible approach towards formally marrying these two lines of work.\nBach and Jordan [13] introduced a (shallow) learning formulation for normalized cuts which we build upon in this work with several important differences. First, we aim to also learn the rank of the affinity matrix. Moreover while [13] aims to learn the parameters of their affinity model, we learn the feature representation of the data. Turaga et al [15] learn a model end-to-end based on a CNN by optimizing a standard segmentation criterion. While they used a simple connected component labeling as the grouping machinery, we demonstrate here the ability to group using more complex spectral techniques that are broadly applicable to a variety of problems.\nDeep architectures have been recently designed for visual recognition by operating on top of figure-ground regions proposals from object segmentation[16, 17]. R-CNN [18] uses standard networks (e.g. AlexNet [2] or VGG-16 [3], which is an improved, deeper AlexNet). SDS [19] uses two AlexNet streams, one on the original image and the second one on the image with the background of the region masked. Relevant are also the architectures of He et al [20, 21] having a global spatial pyramid pooling layer before the fully connected layers, which performs simple max-pooling over pyramid-structured cells of the image. Our architecture is also complementary to structured output formulations such as CRFs[22, 23, 14] which have been demonstrated to provide useful smoothing on top of high-performing CNN pixel classifier predictions [24]. Models developed at the same time with this work focus on the joint, end-to-end training of the deep feature extractor and the CRF[25, 26, 27]. We also show how a deep architecture can be trained jointly with structured layers, but in contrast focus on models where global dependencies can be expressed as matrix functions. For recognition, we also illustrate deep fully trainable architectures with a type of pooling layer that proved dominant for free-form region description [8], at the time on top of standard manually designed local features such as SIFT.\nOur work is also related to kernel learning approaches over the manifold of positive-definite matrices [28]. However, we introduce different mathematical techniques related to matrix backpropagation, which has both the advantage of scalability and the one of learning compositional feature maps.\nMatrix partial derivatives, the basis of our work, were first systematically studied in the seminal paper [29]. Since then it has seen interest mainly in the context of studying estimators in statistics and econometrics [30]. Recently, the budding field of automatic differentiation has also shown interest in this theory when considering matrix functions[31]. This very powerful machinery has however appeared only scarcely in computer vision and machine learning in general. Some examples are in the context of camera calibration [32], as mentioned, for learning parameters in a normalized cuts model[13], learning the parameters of Gaussian CRFs for denoising [33] and learning deep canonical correlation models [34]. The recent surge of interest in deep networks has exposed limitations of current architectures and this in turn has pushed research in the direction of structured models requiring matrix based representations. [35] multiplied the outputs of two networks as matrices to obtain improved fine-grained recognition models. From another direction, in an effort to generalize convolutions to general non-Euclidean and non-equally spaced grids the work of [36] realizes the necessity of spectral layers for learning the graph structure but, since the computational issues brought on in the process are not the focus there, they post-pone dealing with them. In [37] these are partially addressed but they limit themselves to learning parameters applied to the eigenvalues instead of learning the eigenvectors and eigenvalues as we do. In this context our focus is on the underlying theory of backpropagation when dealing with structured objects like matrices which allows one to derive those and many other similar but also more complex results."

      "text" : "Let D = {(d(i),y(i))}i=1...N be a set of data points (e.g. images) and their corresponding desired targets (e.g. class labels) drawn from a distribution p(d,y). Let L : Rd → R be a loss function i.e. a penalty of mismatch between the model prediction function f : RD → Rd with parameters W for the input d i.e. f(d(i),W ) and the desired output y(i). The foundation of many learning approaches, including the ones considered here, is the principle of empirical risk minimization, which states that under mild conditions, due to concentration of measure, the empirical risk R̂(W ) = 1N ∑N i=1 L(f(d (i),W ),y(i)) converges to the true risk R(W ) = ∫ L(f(d,W ),y)p(d,y). This means it suffices to minimize the empirical risk to learn a function that will do well in general i.e.\narg min W\n1\nN N∑ i=1 L(f(d(i),W ),y(i)) (1)\nIf L and f are both continuous (though not necessarily with continuous derivatives) one can use (sub-)gradient descent on (1) for learning the parameters. This allows a general yet very effective framework for learning with the only requirement the existence of a (sub-)gradient.\nDeep networks, as a model, considers a class of functions f , which can be written as a series of successive function compositions f = f (K) ◦ f (K−1) ◦ . . . ◦ f (1) with parameter tuple W = (wK ,wK−1, . . . ,w1), where f (l) are called layers, wl are the parameters of layer l and K is the number of layers. Denote by L(l) = L ◦ f (K) ◦ . . . ◦ f (l) the loss as a function of the layer xl−1. This notation is convenient because it conceptually separates the network architecture from the layer design.\nSince the computation of the gradient is the only requirement for learning an important step is the effective use of the principle of backpropagation (backprop). Backprop, as described in the literature, is an algorithm for efficiently computing the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters. The algorithm recursively computes gradients with respect to both the inputs to the layers and their parameters (fig. 2) by making use of the chain rule. For a data tuple (d,y) and a layer l this is computing\n∂L(l)(xl−1,y) ∂wl = ∂L(l+1)(xl,y) ∂xl ∂f (l)(xl−1) ∂wl (2)\n∂L(l)(xl−1,y) ∂xl−1 = ∂L(l+1)(xl,y) ∂xl ∂f (l)(xl−1) ∂xl−1 (3)\nwhere xl = f (l)(xl−1) and x0 = d (data). The first expression is the gradient we seek (required for updating wl) whereas the second one is necessary for calculating the gradients in the layers below and updating their parameters."

This simplifies processing significantly because in order to compute ∂L (l)(xl−1,y)\n∂xl−1 there\nis a well defined notion of partial derivative with respect to the layer ∂f (l)(xl−1)\n∂xl−1 as well as a simple expression\nfor the chain rule. However this processes spatial coordinates independently and does not immediately generalize to more complex mathematical objects. Consider a matrix view of the (3-dimensional tensor) layer, X = xl−1, where Xij ∈ R, with i being the spatial coordinate1 and j the index of the input feature. Then we can define a non-linearity on the entire X ∈ Rml×dl , as a matrix, instead of each (group) of spatial coordinate separately. As the matrix derivative with respect to a vector (set aside to a matrix) is no longer well-defined, a matrix generalization of backpropation is necessary."

      "text" : "To motivate the use of structured layers we will consider the following two models from computer vision:\n1. Second-Order Pooling is one of the competitive hand-designed feature descriptors for regions [8] used in the top-performing method of the PASCAL VOC semantic segmentation, comp. 5 track [38, 39]. It represents global high-order statistics of local descriptors inside each region by computing a covariance matrixX>X then applying a tangent space mapping [40] using the matrix logarithm, which can be computed using SVD. Instead of pooling over hand-designed local descriptors, such as SIFT [41], one could learn a ConvNet end-to-end, with a structured layer of the form\nC = log(X>X + I) (4)\nwhere I is a regularizer preventing log singularities around 0 when the covariance matrix is not full rank. 1For simplicity and without loss of generality we reshape (linearize) the tensor’s spatial indices to one dimension with ml coordinates.\n2. Normalized Cuts is an influential global image segmentation method based on pairwise similarities [6]. It constructs a matrix of local interactions e.g. W = XX> then solves a generalized eigenvalue problem to determine a global image partitioning. Instead of manually designed affinities, one could, given a ground truth target segmentation, learn end-to-end the deep features that produce good normalized cuts."

      "text" : "We call matrix backpropagation (MBP) the use of matrix calculus[29, 30, 31] to map between the partial derivatives ∂L(l+1)\n∂xl and\n∂L(l) ∂xl−1 at two consecutive layers. Note that since for all layers l the functionL(l) maps to real numbers by\nconstruction thus both derivatives are perfectly well defined. In this section we simplify notation writing L = L(l+1), X,Y are the matrix versions of xl and xl−1 respectively, f = f (l) thus f(X) = Y .\nThe basis for the derivation is best understood starting from the Taylor expansions at the two layers\nL ◦ f(X + dX)− L ◦ f(X) = ∂L ◦ f ∂X : dX + O(‖dX‖2) (5)\nL(Y + dY )− L(Y ) = ∂L ∂Y : dY + O(‖dY ‖2) (6)\nwhere we introduced the notation A : B = Tr(A>B) = vec(A)> vec(B) for convenience. Thus A : B is an inner product in the Euclidean vec’d matrix space.\nOur strategy of derivation, outlined below, involves two important concepts we sketch here2. A variation, which corresponds to the forward sensitivity and it allows us to easily manipulate first and higher order terms of a Taylor expansion e.g. for a function g we write dg = dg(X; dX) = g(X + dX)− g(X) = A(X) : dX +O(‖dX‖2), with A(X) a matrix of the same size as X and depending on X but not on dX . The (partial) derivative is by definition the linear “coefficient” of a Taylor expansion i.e. the coefficient of dX ergo ∂g∂X = A(X). These two are very different objects, in particular dg is always defined if g is defined and it can have matrix inputs and map to a space of matrices (unlike the partial derivative). Also, the variation is used for convenience of the derivation and need not be implemented in practice. What we are ultimately after, for the purpose of backpropagation, is the partial derivative.\nThe important thing is to understand that when\ndY = df(X; dX) (7)\nthe expressions (5) and (6) should be equal, since they both represent the variation of L for a given perturbation dX of the variable X . Looking at the Taylor expansions, their first order terms should also match which gives us the chain rule\n∂L ◦ f ∂X : dX = ∂L ∂Y : dY (8)\nThe aim is to use this identity to express the partial derivative of the left hand side as a function of the partial derivative in the right hand side. The derivation process follows 2 steps3:\n1. Derive L, the functional describing the variations of the upper layer variables with respect to the lower layer variables.\ndY = L(dX) = df(X; dX) (9)\nIn many cases, for simplicity, we will only consider the first order variations since in the second step will disregard the higher order variations anyways thus this simplification, which makes the derivations more readable, remains correct. The variation derivation involves not only the forward mapping of the layer, f (l), but also the invariants associated to its variables. IfX satisfies certain invariants, these need to be preserved to first (leading) order when computing dX . Invariants such as diagonality, symmetry, or orthogonality are explicitly enforced by our methodology.\n2See [30] for an in-depth treatment including questions about existence and uniqueness of the partial derivatives. 3The appendices contain some basic identities and material necessary for each of these steps.\n2. With the dY produced in the first step we know (8) holds thus we can use the properties of the matrix inner product A : B = Tr(A>B) to obtain partial derivatives with respect to the lower layer variables. This holds for a general variation, e.g. for a non-symmetric dX even if X itself is symmetric. To remain within a subspace like the one of symmetric, diagonal or orthogonal matrices, we can consider a projection of dX onto the space of admissible variations and then transfer the projection onto the derivative, to obtain the projected gradient. We use this technique repeatedly in our derivations.\nSince the “:” operator is an inner product on the space of matrices, this is equivalent to constructively producing L∗, a non-linear adjoint operator of L\n∂L(l+1)\n∂Y : dY =\n∂L(l+1)\n∂Y : L(dX) , L∗\n( ∂L(l+1)\n∂Y\n) : dX ⇒ L∗ ( ∂L(l+1)\n∂Y\n) = ∂L(l)\n∂X by the chain rule (10)"

This is equivalent to producing a matrix E ∈ {0, 1}m×k such that E(i, j) = 1 if i ∈ Pj and 0 otherwise. Let X ∈ Rm×d be a feature matrix with descriptor of size d and let W be a similarity matrix with positive entries. For simplicity we consider W = XΛX>, where Λ is a d × d parameter matrix. Note that one can also apply global non-linearities on top using the material in the previous section. Finally, let D = [W1], where [v] is the diagonal matrix with main diagonal v. That is the diagonal elements of D are the sums of the corresponding rows of W . The normalized cuts criterion is then\nC(W,E) = Tr(E>WE(E>DE)−1) (37)\nFinding theE that minimizesC(W,E) is finding a partitioning that minimizes the cut energy but penalizes unbalanced solutions.\nIt is easy to show that C(W,E) = k − Tr(Y >D−1/2WD−1/2Y ), where Y is such that a) Y >Y = I and b) D1/2Y is piecewise constant with respect to E (i.e. it is equal to E times some scaling for each column). Ignoring the\nsecond condition we obtain a relaxed problem that can be solved, due to Ky Fan theorem, by an eigen-decomposition of\nM = D−1/2WD−1/2 (38)\n[13] propose to learn the parameters Λ such that D1/2Y is piecewise constant because then, solving the relaxed problem is equivalent to the original problem. In [13] the input features were fixed thus Λ are the only parameters to permit the alignment. This is not our case, as we place our global objective on top of convolutional network inputs. We can can therefore take leverage the network parameters in order to change X directly, thus training the bottom layers to produce a representation that is appropriate for normalized cuts.\nTo obtain a Y that is piecewise constant with respect to D1/2E we can align the span of M with that of Ω = D1/2EE>D1/2. This can be done by minimizing the Frobenius norm of the corresponding projectors\nJ1(W,E) = 1\n2 ‖ΠM −ΠΩ‖2F (39)\nWe will again obtain the partial derivatives of an objective with respect to the matrices it depends on. We first start with a lemma that simplifies the calculations for the variations because it is common to both objectives.\nLemma 1. Consider a symmetric matrixA and its orthogonal projection operator ΠA. If dA is a symmetric variation of A then\ndΠA = 2 ( (I −ΠA)dAA+ ) sym ) (40)\nProof 1. (We skip the subscript in ΠA for brevity.) Taking the variation of the basic properties of the projector Π2 = Π and ΠA = A, we have\ndΠΠ + ΠdΠ = dΠ (41) dΠA+ ΠdA = dA (42)\nWe then consider the following decomposition of dΠ:\ndΠ = ΠMΠ + (I −Π)QΠ + ΠQ>(I −Π) + (I −Π)R(I −Π)\nwith M and R symmetric, so that dΠ is symmetric by construction. Plugging into the equations above, we get\n2ΠMΠ + (I −Π)QΠ + ΠQ>(I −Π) = dΠ ΠMA+ (I −Π)QA = (I −Π)dA\nComparing the first equation with the decomposition of dΠ above, we deduce that M = R = 0, and so\n(I −Π)QΠ + ΠQ>(I −Π) = dΠ (I −Π)QA = (I −Π)dA\nMultiplying the second equation with A+ from the right gives (I − Π)QΠ = (I − Π)dAA+. Plugging this into the first equation gives the desired result.\nThe derivation relies only on basic properties of the projector with respect to itself and its matrix: Π2A = ΠA (idempotency of the projector) and ΠAA = A (projector leaves the original space unchanged). Note that since ΠA = AA\n+, there exists a spectral decomposition in training but it is hidden in A+ (where A+ is the Moore-Penrose inverse).\nProposition 5. The partial derivative of J1 with respect to W is\n∂J1 ∂W = D−1/2 ∂J1 ∂M D−1/2 + diag\n( D−1Ω ( ∂J1 ∂Ω ) sym −D−1M ( ∂J1 ∂M ) sym ) 1>\nProof. Working on the total variation of J we have\ndJ1 = ∂J1 ∂ΠM : dΠM + ∂J1 ∂ΠΩ : dΠΩ\n= (ΠM −ΠΩ) : dΠM + (ΠΩ −ΠM ) : dΠΩ = 2(ΠM −ΠΩ)sym : ((I −ΠM )dMM+) + 2(ΠΩ −ΠM )sym : ((I −ΠΩ)dΩΩ+) (by (40)) = 2(I −ΠM )(ΠM −ΠΩ)symM+ : dM + 2(I −ΠΩ)(ΠΩ −ΠM )symΩ+ : dΩ = −2(I −ΠM )ΠΩM+ : dM − 2(I −ΠΩ)ΠMΩ+ : dΩ\nand so ∂J\n∂M = −2(I −ΠM )ΠΩM+ (43)\nand ∂J\n∂Ω = −2(I −ΠΩ)ΠMΩ+ (44)\nFor a diagonal matrix D under a diagonal variation dD, we can show that d(Dp) = pDp−1dD (by means of element-wise differentiation). For the particular D = [W1], we have dD = [dW1]. Using these, we get\ndΩ = 1\n2 dDD−1/2EE>D1/2+\n1 2 D1/2EE>D−1/2dD =\n( D1/2EE>D−1/2dD ) sym = ( ΩD−1[dW1] ) sym (45)\nand\ndM = −1 2 dDD−3/2WD−1/2 +D−1/2dWD−1/2 − 1 2 D−1/2WD−3/2dD\n= D−1/2dWD−1/2 − ( MD−1[dW1] ) sym\nThen\ndJ1 = ∂J1 ∂M : dM + ∂J1 ∂Ω : dΩ\n= ( D−1/2\n∂J1 ∂M\nD−1/2 ) : dW − ( D−1M\n∂J1 ∂M sym\n) : [dW1] + ( D−1Ω\n∂J1 ∂Ω sym\n) : [dW1]\nthen identifying we obtain\n∂J1 ∂W = D−1/2 ∂J1 ∂M D−1/2 + diag\n( D−1Ω\n∂J1 ∂Ω sym −D−1M ∂J1 ∂M sym\n) 1>\nwhere we used the property A : [Bx] = Aii(Bijxj) = (Aiixj)Bij = ( diag(A)x> ) : B.\nA related optimization objective is\nJ2 = 1\n2 ‖ΠW −ΠΨ‖2F , (46)\nwith Ψ = E(E>E)−1E>. Here we consider ΠW = V (V >V )−1V >, where V = D1/2U . We can check that this is a projector for W by noting that ΠW = D1/2U(U>DU)−1U>D1/2 and M = UΣU> = D−1/2WD−1/2 (by eigen decomposition and (38)). Then indeed\n1. Idempotency of ΠW\nΠ2W = D 1/2U(U>DU)−1U>DU(U>DU)−1U>D1/2 = ΠW\n2. ΠW leaves W unchanged\nΠWW = ΠW (D 1/2MD1/2)\n= D1/2U(U>DU)−1(U>DU)ΣU>D1/2\n= D−1/2UΣU>D−1/2 = W\nProposition 6. The corresponding partial derivative for J2 is\n∂J2 ∂W = −2(I −ΠW )ΠΨW+ (47)\nProof. The derivation is trivial, since Ψ does not depend on W and a direct application of Lemma 1 gives\n∂J2 ∂W = −2(I −ΠW )ΠΨW+ (48)\nIn both cases, we can propagate the partial derivatives of Ji down to Λ and X . First we compute the first order variations dW = dXΛX> + XdΛX> + XΛdX>. Then use the trace properties make the partial derivatives identifiable\ndJi = ∂Ji ∂W : dW = ∂Ji ∂W\n: ( XdΛX> ) + 2\n∂Ji ∂W : (dXΛX>)sym\n= ( X>\n∂Ji ∂W X\n) : dΛ + 2 ( ∂Ji ∂W sym XΛ> ) : dX\nThus we obtain ∂Ji ∂Λ = X> ∂Ji ∂W X (49)\nand ∂Ji ∂X = 2 ( ∂Ji ∂W ) sym XΛ> (50)\nNote that when J = J2 then ∂J2 ∂Λ = 0, since (I − ΠW )X = X>(I − ΠW ) = 0. Thus we cannot learn Λ with our projector trick but there is no problem learning X which is much more interesting anyway.\nAn important feature of our approach is that we do not restrict the rank in training. During alignment the optimization may choose to collapse certain directions thus reducing rank. We can prove a topological lemma implying that if the Frobenius distance between the projectors (such as in the two objectives J1, J2) drops below a certain value, then the ranks of the two projectors will match. Conversely, if for some reason the ranks can not converge, the objectives are bounded away from zero. The following lemma shows that when the projectors of two matricesA and B are close enough in the ‖·‖2 norm, then the matrices have the same rank:\nLemma 2. Let A,B ∈ Rm×n, and ΠA, ΠB their respective orthogonal projectors. If ‖ΠA − ΠB‖2 < 1 then rankA = rankB.\nProof 2. The spectral norm ‖·‖2 can indeed be defined as ‖A‖2 = sup‖x‖2 6=0 ‖Ax‖ ‖x‖ . We assume w.l.o.g. that rankA > rankB, so that by the fundamental theorem of linear algebra there exists a vector v in the range of A (so that ΠAv = v), that is orthogonal to the range of B (so that ΠBv = 0). We have then\n‖ΠA −ΠB‖2 ≥ ‖ΠAv −ΠBv‖ ‖v‖ = ‖ΠAv‖ ‖v‖ = 1\nwhich is a contradiction.\nGiven that the Frobenius norm controls the spectral norm, i.e. ‖A‖2 ≤ ‖A‖F , (section 2.3.2 of [42]) an immediate corollary is that when\nJ2(W ) < 1\n2 ⇒ rank(W ) = rank(EE>) (51)"

      "text" : "For recognition we use the MSCOCO dataset [43], which provides 880k segmented training instances across 80 classes, divided into training and validation sets. The main goal is to assess our second-order pooling layer in various training settings. A secondary goal is to study the behavior of ConvNets learned from scratch on segmented training data. This has not been explored before in the context of deep learning because of the relatively small size of the datasets with associated object segmentations, such as PASCAL VOC [46].\nThe experiments in this section use the convolutional architecture component of AlexNet[2] with the global O2P layers we propose in order to obtain DeepO2P models with both classification and fully connected (FC) layers in the same topology as Alexnet. We crop and resize each object bounding box to have 200 pixels on the largest side, then pad it to the standard AlexNet input size of 227x227 with small translation jittering, to limit over-fitting. We also randomly flip the images in each mini-batch horizontally, as in standard practice. Training is performed with stochastic gradient descent with momentum. We use the same batch size (100 images) for all methods but the learning rate was optimized for each model independently. All the DeepO2P models used the same = 10−3 parameter value in (4).\nArchitecture and Implementation details. Implementing the spectral layers efficiently is challenging since the GPU support for SVD is still very limited and our parallelization efforts even using the latest CUDA 7.0 solver API have delivered a slower implementation than the standard CPU-based. Consequently, we use CPU implementations thus we incur a penalty for moving data back and forth to the CPU. The numerical experiments revealed that an implementation in single precision obtained a significantly less accurate gradient for learning. Therefore all computations in our proposed layers, both in the forward and backward passes, are made in double precision. In experiments we still noticed a significant accuracy penalty due to inferior precision in all the other layers (above and below the structured ones), still computed in single precision, on the GPU.\nA second formal derivation of the non-linear spectral layer based on an eigen-decomposition of Z = X>X + I instead of SVD of X is also possible. Our experiments favor the formulation using SVD. The alternative implementation, which is formally correct, exhibits numerical instability in the derivative when multiple eigenvalues have very close values, thus producing blow up in K̃. Such numerical issues are expected to appear under some implementations, when complex layers like the ones presented here are integrated in deep network settings. Results. The results of the recognition experiment are presented in table 1. They show that our proposed DeepO2PFC models, containing global layers, outperform standard convolutional pipelines based on AlexNet, on this problem. The bottom layers are pre-trained on ImageNet using AlexNet, and this might not provide the ideal initial input features. However, despite this potentially unfavorable initialization, our model jointly refines all parameters (both convolutional, and corresponding to global layers), jointly, end to end, using a consistent cost function.\nWe note that the fully connected layers on top of the DeepO2P layer offer good performance benefits. O2P over hand-crafted SIFT performs considerably less well than our DeepO2P models, suggesting that large potential gains can be achieved when deep features replace existing descriptors."

BSDS contains 200 training images and 100 testing images and human annotations of all the relevant regions in the image. Although small by the standards of neural network learning it provides exactly the supervision we need to refine our model using global information. Note that since the supervision is pixel-wise, the number of effective datapoint constraints is much larger. We evaluate using the average and best covering metric under the Optimal Image Scale (OIS) criterion [44]. This amounts to, given a set of full image segmentations computed for an image, selecting the one that maximizes the average and best covering, respectively, compared to the pool of ground truth segmentations. Architecture and Implementation details. We use both the AlexNet[2] and the VGG-16[3] architectures to feed our global layers. All the parameters of the deep global models (including the low-level features, pretrained on ImageNet) are refined end-to-end. We use a linear affinity but we need all entries of W to be positive. Thus, we use ReLU layers to feed the segmentation ones. Initially, we just cascaded our segmentation layer to different layers in AlexNet but the resulting models were hard to learn. Our best results were obtained by adding two Conv-ReLU pairs initialized randomly before the normalized cuts layer. This results in many filters in the lower layer (256 for AlexNet and 1024 for VGG) for high capacity but few in the top layer (20 dimensions) to limit the maximal rank of W . For AlexNet we chose the last convolutional layer while for VGG we used both the first ReLU layer in block4 4 and the top layer from block 5. This gives us feeds from layers with different invariances, receptive field sizes (32 vs. 132 pixels) and coarseness (block 4 has 2× the resolution of 5). We used an initial learning rate of 10−4 but 10× larger rates for the newly initialized layers. A dropout layer between the last two layers with a rate of .25 reduces overfitting. In inference, we generate 8 segmentations by clustering[13] then connected components are split into separate segments. Results. The results in table 2 show that in all cases we obtain important performance improvements with respect to the corresponding models that perform inference directly on original AlexNet/VGG features. Training using our Matlab implementation takes 2 images/s considering 1 batch of images while testing at about 3 images/s on a standard Titan Z GPU with an 8 core E5506 CPU. In experiments we monitor both the objective and the rank of the similarity matrix. Rank reduction is usually a good indicator of performance in both training and testing. In the context of the\n4We call a block the set of layers between two pooling levels.\nrank analysis in §5, we interpret these findings to mean that if the rank of the similarity is too large compared to the target, the objective is not sufficient to lead to rank reduction. However if the rank of the predicted similarity and the ground truth are initially not too far apart, then rank reduction (although not always rank matching) does occur and improves the results."

We provide detailed derivations, operating conditions for spectral and non-linear layers, and illustrate the methodology for normalized cuts and second-order pooling layers. Our extensive region recognition and segmentation experiments based on MSCoco and BSDS show that that deep networks relying on second-order pooling and normalized cuts layers, trained end-to-end using the introduced practice of matrix backpropagation, outperform counterparts that do not take advantage of such global layers.\nAcknowledgements.

The power of deep networks stems both from their ability to perform local computations followed by pointwise non-linearities over increasingly larger receptive fields, and from the simplicity and scalability of the gradient-descent training procedure based on backpropagation. An open problem is the inclusion of layers that perform global, structured matrix computations like segmentation (e.g. normalized cuts) or higher-order pooling (e.g. log-tangent space metrics defined over the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices) while preserving the validity and efficiency of an end-to-end deep training framework. In this paper we propose a sound mathematical apparatus to formally integrate global structured computation into deep computation architectures. At the heart of our methodology is the development of the theory and practice of backpropagation that generalizes to the calculus of adjoint matrix variations. We perform segmentation experiments using the BSDS and MSCOCO benchmarks and demonstrate that deep networks relying on second-order pooling and normalized cuts layers, trained end-to-end using matrix backpropagation, outperform counterparts that do not take advantage of such global layers.",
