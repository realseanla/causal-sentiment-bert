    "abstractText" : "Most traditional models of uncertainty have focused on the associational relationship among variables as captured by conditional dependence. In order to successfully man­ age intelligent systems for decision making, however, we must be able to predict the ef­ fects of actions. In this paper, we attempt to unite two branches of research that address such predictions: causal modeling and deci­ sion analysis. First, we provide a definition of causal dependence in decision-analytic terms, which we derive from consequences of causal dependence cited in the literature. Using this definition , we show how causal depen­ dence can be represented within an influence diagram. In particular, we identify two in­ adequacies of an ordinary influence diagram as a representation for cause. We introduce a special class of influence diagrams, called causal influence diagrams, which corrects one of these problems, and identify situations where the other inadequacy can be elimi­ nated. In addition, we describe the relation­ ships between Howard Canonical Form and existing graphical representations of cause.",
