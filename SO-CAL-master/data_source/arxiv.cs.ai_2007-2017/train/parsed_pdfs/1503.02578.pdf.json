      "text" : "This paper investigates the role of factorial speech processing models in noise-robust automatic speech recognition tasks. Factorial models can embed non-stationary noise models using Markov chains as one of its source chain. The paper proposes a modeling scheme for modeling state-conditional observation distribution of factorial models based on weighted stereo samples. This scheme is an extension to previous single pass retraining for ideal model compensation and here we used it to construct ideal state-conditional observation distributions. Experiments of this paper over the set A of the Aurora 2 dataset shows that by considering noise models with multiple states, system performance can be improved especially in low SNR conditions up to 4% absolute word recognition performance. In addition to its power in accurate representation of state-conditional observation distribution, it has an important advantage over previous methods by providing the opportunity to independently select feature spaces for both source and corrupted features. This opens a new window for seeking better feature spaces appropriate for noise-robust tasks independent from clean speech feature space.\nKeywords: factorial speech processing models, state-conditional observation distribution, stereo samples"

      "text" : "Despite long term efforts and great successes in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems, rapid degradation of performance in the presence of noise and other competing sources remains the Achilles Heel of these systems [1]. While some feature enhancement and model adaptation techniques loosely use noise source characteristics to increase performance of speech recognition systems, model based methods try to use as much as information they can acquire from noise sources [2]. Such information ranges from static distortion occurred in the extracted features of noisy signals to dynamic information of cyclo-stationary noises.\nFactorial speech processing models [3]–[5] are extension of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) which model audio sources and the way that these sources are combined in a generative manner. They model each of audio sources separately; this can include modeling dynamic changes of audio sources by hidden Markov models. Additionally factorial models, model how these audio sources are combined to produce output or distorted features. Because of this, factorial models can use noise characteristics for improving system performance.\nFrom modeling point of view, factorial models are powerful modeling tools for speech processing applications. They can be used for speech enhancement, noise-robust speech recognition, multi-talker speech recognition, and robust speaker identification. These models perform well in the specific application of multi-talker speech recognition where the sound sources have significant dynamic information and there are two or more competing speakers speaking simultaneously. Recent researches achieve higher performance even than human in the multi-talker speech recognition challenge by use of factorial models of speech processing in some specific conditions [6], [7]. Despite their successes in the mentioned challenge and their modeling power, factorial models are not widely used for real noise-robust speech processing applications [8]; their computational demand for inference and difficulties in representing their central conditional probability distribution (CPD) are the two main reasons for this lack of use [2].\nFigure 1 shows a generic HMM for conventional acoustic modeling in speech recognition and a factorial model for noise robust speech recognition expressed in the Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGM) language. HMM is extended in the two ways for creating factorial model of speech processing. The first one is that factorial models have multiple state chains which are useful for modeling systems with multiple underlying independent processes [9], i.e. two audio sources with their corresponding temporal models (in Figure 1.b \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC61 \uD835\uDC5B and \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC61 \uD835\uDC65 are noise and speech source state variables). The second one is the interaction model, [2]; CPD of the observed signal features conditioned on features of its corresponding sources, \uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC61|\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC61 , \uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC61) in Figure 1.b. This CPD in its deterministic form is called mismatch function [10], [11].\nEach of the two extensions imposes its own complexity to the basic HMM during learning and inference. On the one hand, multiple state sequence increases computational complexity of inference (which is also required for learning) to \uD835\uDC42(\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC3E) in which \uD835\uDC47 is inference window or lag, \uD835\uDC3E is number of underlying chain, and \uD835\uDC46 is maximum number of states in the chains [12], [13]. In comparison with standard HMM with \uD835\uDC42(\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC462) as its required calculations for inference, we see exponential growth of calculations by increasing the number of audio sources.\nOn the other hand, accurate modeling of probabilistic relationship between the observed features and their sources is not always possible in speech recognition applications [2]. Several approximations are used for developing mismatch functions so far. Ignoring phase difference between spectral features of audio sources or use of pseudo inverse of DCT matrix for transforming features from Cepstral domain back to log-spectral domain are two examples of these approximations. Moreover, the interaction model is not directly used in the inference. Inference on factorial models requires State-Conditional Observation Distribution (SCOD); i.e. observed feature distribution conditioned on states of the source chains, \uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC61|\uD835\uDC60 \uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC5B). This distribution is directly calculated by marginalizing-out source features variables (\uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC8F); i.e. ∬ \uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC9A, \uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC8F|\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC65, \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC5B)\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC8F. The direct calculation of SCOD causes more challenges in the use of factorial models which necessitates additional approximations. As a result, having more accurate interaction models leads to more approximations in calculation of SCOD and doing exact SCOD calculations forced us to use approximate interaction models.\nThis paper focuses on the second challenge of factorial models by incorporating the idea of single-pass retraining [10], [14] for ideal SCOD modeling to be used in factorial speech processing models. We want to evaluate whether these models are effective against non-stationary noises as good as they are in multi-talker tasks. In addition it presents a modified expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for parametric modeling of this ideal SCOD. Next section briefly reviews previous methods for modeling the SCOD by starting with description of the commonly used environment model and the most useful mismatch function inference especially in speech recognition. Then it shows how the previous VTS based and IDPMC techniques can be used for the SCOD modeling. Finally it presents the way we perform inference in factorial models based on the SCOD models and an extended Viterbi algorithm. The proposed method of SCOD modeling is proposed in section 3; this section first describes the way that combined features are sampled and become weighted and then the extension of the EM algorithm for parametric modeling of SCODs is described. Section 4 describes experiments by providing the block diagram of the proposed method for SCOD modeling and then presents the results; we used the Aurora 2 dataset for this evaluation. Finally section 5 concludes the paper."

In the power spectrum domain by short-term discrete Fourier transform we have:\n|\uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC61| 2 = |\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC89| 2 + |\uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC61| 2 + 2|\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC89||\uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC61| cos(\uD835\uDF53\uD835\uDC61) (2)\nin which \uD835\uDF53\uD835\uDC61 is vector of phase difference between frequency bins of \uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC89 and \uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC61 complex vectors. In (2), frequency index is omitted since variables are written in vector form. Additionally, time index will be removed in subsequent expressions for brevity. While (2) provides a mismatch function useful for speech enhancement applications, power\nspectrum is not appropriate for speech recognition. By applying filterbank, taking logarithm and use of truncated DCT\nmatrix, the following interaction model is derived for MFCC features [11]:\n\uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC50|\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC50, \uD835\uDC89\uD835\uDC50 , \uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC50) = \uD835\uDEFF (\uD835\uDC9A\uD835\uDC50 − \uD835\uDC02 \uD835\uDC25\uD835\uDC28\uD835\uDC20 (\uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC29(\uD835\uDC02−\uD835\uDFCF(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC50 + \uD835\uDC89\uD835\uDC50)) + \uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC29(\uD835\uDC02−\uD835\uDFCF\uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC50) + \uD835\uDF50(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC50 , \uD835\uDC89\uD835\uDC50 , \uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC50))) (3)\nwhere its residual equals to:\n\uD835\uDF50(\uD835\uDC99, \uD835\uDC89, \uD835\uDC8F) = 2\uD835\uDF36 \uD835\uDC1E\uD835\uDC31\uD835\uDC29(\uD835\uDC02−\uD835\uDFCF(\uD835\uDC99 + \uD835\uDC89 + \uD835\uDC8F)/2) (4)\nThis residual reflects the effects of the phase difference of (2) and by considering uniform distribution for phase difference, \uD835\uDF36 in this residual becomes stochastic; its properties is investigated in [16]. Interaction models useful for speech recognition applications contain this residual. The interaction model is usually approximated by removing the residual [8] or considering its \uD835\uDF36 as constant; same value for all frequency bins [17]. Based on these interaction models (or mismatch functions) most of model compensation techniques were developed before."

But this domain is not\nappropriate for speech recognition applications. Therefore, instead of direct calculation, the SCOD model is extracted by transforming the source models or use of Monte Carlo methods.\nThree categories of approaches are used for SCOD modeling. Approaches in the first set, by making an assumption\nthat the SCOD is Gaussian in specific feature domains, estimate approximate Gaussian parameters. Parallel model combination (PMC) is an example of this group [19]. Methods in the second set, approximate the non-linear mismatch\nfunctions by its linearization around an expansion point with Taylor series. Then transform source model parameters by applying this approximation. Several variations of these methods were developed, depending on linearization point,\nsupport of dynamic coefficients order of approximation, and compensation of channel effect. A successful and\ncomplete VTS based compensation is presented in [17]. The third set, uses conditional samples of observation distribution for estimating parameters of the SCOD model which is usually modeled by Gaussian Mixture Models\n(GMM). Samples are generated by forward sampling and consequent use of mismatch function. Developed methods in this set are known as variations of data-driven PMC [10]. Next sub-sections describe VTS and DPMC based SCOD\nmodeling adopted for factorial speech processing models. Most of the previous works consider stationary noises and\ntherefore consider only one noise state in their SCOD models. Actually in this case, clean source models are replaced with their corresponding SCODs, which means plugging new observation models into the original HMMs. This is the\nreason for naming this kind of robust speech recognition, “model compensation” [11]."

Sampling of corrupted feature distribution, is started from source signals\nin time domain.

These feature vectors are known as stereo features [8], [21]. We also called them “stereo” due to one to one mapping between these features but here three sets of features are related together.\nSource features are then examined in their corresponding source models to compute their state-conditional likelihoods, (\uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC99\uD835\uDC59|\uD835\uDC56) and \uD835\uDC5D(\uD835\uDC8F\uD835\uDC59|\uD835\uDC57)).

Framing and windowing are done similar to the standard Aurora 2 recognition scripts. Despite the fact that the proposed method for SCOD modeling allows us independently select feature spaces of source and observed features, but for comparing the performance of the ideal SCOD models to other methods, we limit ourselves to Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) with an specific configuration which is supported by the mismatch functions. Since second order derivatives of MFCCs provide no significant improvements in the experiments we only use first order derivatives. Instead of log energy of frame, zero order coefficient of MFCC features is used. In addition, the applied filterbank to power spectrum only contains 13 filters which enables us to use full DCT matrix in feature extraction and normal inverse of DCT matrix in the mismatch functions. Feature spaces of speech, noise and corrupted signal are selected to be the same with 26 coefficients (MFCC_0_D(26)).\nFor each digit of the dataset, a sixteen states HMM model is trained by the Aurora 2 standard scripts. In addition for silence and short pause models, three and one state HMMs are used. Observation models of digits consist of three component GMMs while silence and short pause models use six component GMMs. All GMMs have diagonal covariance matrices.\nTwo sets of noise models are used in the experiments. In the first set, noise models have only one component multivariate Gaussians for each noise while in the second set, an HMM with optimized number of states are trained. Noise models of the second set are created by STACS tool [26] and noise modeling is done for each noise separately. This tool starts with single sate model and increases HMM states while train new models in an efficient manner to find best model selected by the BIC criterion. Each state has a multivariate Gaussian as its observation distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix. Trained models for Subway, Babble, Car, and Exhibition noises contain 3, 8, 4 and 4 states accordingly. These models are used in VTS, IDPMC and the proposed WSS SCOD modeling experiments."

In addition Figure 4-right, shows absolute improvement in average recognition accuracy for these three methods when multiple noise states are used.\nTable 1 shows detailed recognition accuracy for this case. As we can see use of multiple noise states improves recognition accuracy in all cases and more improvement is achieved in low level SNRs. Additionally while IDPMC based factorial models gain more from using multiple state noise models but WSS based factorial models achieve the best results. This is due to this fact that “stereo” data provides frame-level mapping between the clean speech noise\nsignal and corrupted utterances, hence better implicit mapping of actual corrupted features to clean speech and noise signal features. While the other methods establish this relationship using approximated mismatch functions.\nFigure 4-left depicts the performance of multi-conditioned trained system against three compensation schemes.

In fact the idea behind this method is similar to single pass retraining scheme presented in [10] for model compensation. We present this method with different formulation in addition to its support for non-stationary noises. As it is shown in our experiments, using multiple noise-states increases recognition accuracy especially in low SNR conditions. Due to the use of “stereo” data, the proposed method cannot be used directly in many real applications because this data is not available always. But similar to the ideal compensated models in the single pass retrained systems, we are able to train ideal SCOD models here to assess capabilities of other useful modeling techniques. The purpose for presenting this method is to provide a way to investigate whether increasing the number of noise states in noise models is useful for non-stationary noises in order to improve the overall system performance. As the result, increasing system performance in our experiments encourages researchers for developing methods capable of handling non-stationary noises to be used in factorial speech processing models. Moreover the proposed method is still applicable in noise specific environments where noise information is available in advance in the training phase and it performs far better than multi-condition trained systems."

By considering particle weights as the replicating order of the particles (similar to (21)), this replication has no effect on the component responsibilities to each particle.

Factorial models can embed non-stationary noise models using Markov chains as one of its source chain. The paper proposes a modeling scheme for modeling state-conditional observation distribution of factorial models based on weighted stereo samples. This scheme is an extension to previous single pass retraining for ideal model compensation and here we used it to construct ideal state-conditional observation distributions. Experiments of this paper over the set A of the Aurora 2 dataset shows that by considering noise models with multiple states, system performance can be improved especially in low SNR conditions up to 4% absolute word recognition performance. In addition to its power in accurate representation of state-conditional observation distribution, it has an important advantage over previous methods by providing the opportunity to independently select feature spaces for both source and corrupted features. This opens a new window for seeking better feature spaces appropriate for noise-robust tasks independent from clean speech feature space.",
