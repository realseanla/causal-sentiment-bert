    "abstractText" : "MAP is the problem of finding a most prob­ able instantiation of a set of variables in a Bayesian network, given (partial) evidence about the complement of that set. Unlike computing priors, posteriors, and MPE (a special case of MAP), the time and space complexity of MAP is not only exponen­ tial in the network treewidth, but also in a larger parameter known as the \"constrained\" treewidth. In practice, this means that com­ puting MAP can be orders of magnitude more expensive than computing priors, pos­ teriors or MPE. For this reason, MAP com­ putations are generally avoided or approxi­ mated by practitioners. We have investigated the approximation of MAP using local search. The local search method has a space complexity which is ex­ ponential only in the network treewidth, as is the complexity of each step in the search process. Our experimental results show that local search provides a very good approxima­ tion of MAP, while requiring a small number of search steps. Practically, this means that the average case complexity of local search is often exponential only in treewidth as op­ posed to the constrained treewidth, mak­ ing approximating MAP as efficient as other computations.",
