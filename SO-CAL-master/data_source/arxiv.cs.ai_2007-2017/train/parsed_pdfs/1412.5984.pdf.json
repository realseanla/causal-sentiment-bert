      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "There have been growing interest in the field of pattern set mining in stead of pattern mining in the recent years [1]. One of the most important task in pattern set mining is to find a particular set of patterns in data that successfully partitions the dataset and discriminates the classes from one another [2]. This is called concept learning task in the literature [2]. Such pattern sets are desirable incase of selecting a particular small set of patterns from a large dataset, where traditional pattern mining algorithms fail to produce good results.\nIn the concept learning task, we are given a set of classes and a set of patterns or features. The task is to select a small set of the features or the patterns so that the classification accuracy is maximized. This is a complex combinatorial optimization task. Most of the algorithms that are applied to solve the problem earlier in the literature are mostly exhaustive or greedy in nature [2]. Declarative frameworks like constraint programming methods [2, 3] have gained some significant success. However, with increasing problem size, these methods struggle to produce good quality solutions within a short period of time. On the other hand, local search methods in general can quickly find good quality solutions and have been very effective to find satisfactory results for many combinatorial optimization problems.\nIn this paper, we propose to apply a large variety to local search algorithms to solve the concept learning task in the context of pattern set mining. The set of algorithms that we use includes random walk, random valid walk, hill climbing, hill climbing with restart and genetic algorithm. We performed our experiments to solve standard benchmark datasets extensively used by the researchers in the literature. The key contributions in the paper are as follows:\n• Demonstrate the overall strength of stochastic local search methods solving the pattern set mining task.\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n59 84\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\n8 D\nec 2\n01 4\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the concept learning task in the context of pattern sets mining; Section 3 reviews the related work; Section 4 describes the algorithms used; Section 5 discusses and analyzes the experimental results; and finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and outlines our future work."

      "text" : "In this section, we briefly describe the problem model that we use. We adopt the itemset mining [3] setting used earlier by Guns et al. in [2]. In the concept learning task we are given a database of transactions, D. Which is a binary matrix, meaning all items are either 0 or 1. The columns of this binary matric corresponds to a set of patterns or items, I and the rows corresponds to actual data items or transactions. The set of transactions is denoted by T . For example consider the dataset given in Table 1. Here, we have four items in the itemset, I = {A,B,C,D} and five transactions in the transaction set, T = {t1, t2, t3, t4, t5}. The itemsets or pattern sets and the transaction sets are generally represented by binary vectors. The coverage ϕD(I) of an itemset I consists of all transactions in which the itemset occurs:\nϕD(I) = {t ∈ T |∀i ∈ I : Dti = 1}\nFor example, given an itemset, I = A,D, it is represented as 〈1, 0, 0, 1〉 and the the coverage is ϕD(I) = {t1, t3, t4} which is represented by 〈1, 0, 1, 1, 0〉. Support of the itemset is SupportD(I) = 3. Where, Support of an itemset is the size of its coverage set, SupportD(I) = |ϕD(I)|.\nAny item set I is closed over T , if no other supersets of this itemset covers the same transaction set T as I. Formally,\nclosedness ψ(I, T ) is defined as the following constraint:\nψ(I, T ) = 1⇔ (∀i ∈ I : Ii = 1⇔ ∧ t∈T (Dti = 1 ∨ Tt = 0))\nFor example, the itemset I1 = A,D is closed and the itemset, I = A,C is not closed. Each of the transactions in the dataset are associated with two distinct classes: positive transactions T + and negative transactions T −. Now, we can\ndefine the accuracy of an itemset or patternset which is defined by its coverage set T as following:\naccuracy(T ) = ∑ t∈T + Tt − ∑ t∈T − Tt\nIn pattern set mining, we are interested to find k−pattern sets [4]. A k−pattern set Π is a set of k tuples, each of type\n〈Ip, T p〉. The pattern set is formally defined as following:\nΠ = {π1, · · · , πk}, where, ∀p = 1, · · · , k : πp = 〈Ip, T p〉\nThe concept learning task is to find a set of itemsets or patterns that together cover as many positive transactions as\npossible, while covering only few negative transactions. This can be formalized as the following optimization problem:\nmaximize Π,T accuracy(T ) where,\n∀t ∈ T : Tt = (∨p=1···kT pt ) ∀π ∈ Π : ϕD(Ip) = T p ∀π ∈ Π : ψ(I, T +) = 1\nIn this paper, we attempt to solve this problem using different types of stochastic local search algorithms: random walk,\nrandom valid walk, hill climbing, hill climbing with restart and genetic algorithm."

In the the pattern mining problem [6], we are interested to find patterns in the dataset that are correlated [7], discriminative [8], contrast [9], diverse [10] etc. A large variety of algorithms has been proposed to solve the pattern set mining in the last decade [1].\nRecent advancements in the field shows the use of declarative programming frameworks i.e. constraint programming [3]. State-of-the-art constraint solvers i.e. COMET [11] are used to solve the pattern set mining and related tasks [2]. It opens a huge research area by combining data mining or machine learning tasks with constraint programming [12, 13]. However, most of these methods use systematic search methods to search and shrink the solution space. Most of the systematic search algorithms are exhaustive in nature and require huge amount of time and resources to solve the problem efficiently. Where as greedy methods does not guarantee optimality. The necessity of efficient global optimization algorithms and effective search heuristics for such problems is higher than ever.\nIn [10], stochastic search algorithms are applied to solve a related problem to find diverse pattern sets. However, Guns et al. [2] applied large neighborhood search, using constraint programming platform to solve both of the concept learning task and the diverse pattern set mining problem."

      "text" : "In this section, we describe the algorithms that we have implemented to solve the concept learning task. The basic framework contains two important functions that calculates the coverage and checks the closedness or maximal property of the itemsets or patternsets.\nAlgorithm 1: getCoverage(ItemSet I, TransactionSet T ) 1 coverage = [0, · · · , 0] 2 for each transaction t ∈ T do 3 if all items in I appears in t then 4 coverage[t] = 1 5 return coverage\nThe getCoverage algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. It simply searches for occurrences of items in an itemset in all transactions in the dataset and returns them all. The next important function is the isClosed function that verifies the maximal property of an itemset. The algorithm is pictured in Algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 2: isClosed(ItemSet I,Database D) 1 s0 = SupportD(I) 2 for each item i ∈ D do 3 if i /∈ I then 4 In = I ∪ {i} 5 sn = SupportD(In) 6 if sn ≥ s0 then 7 return false 8 return true\nThe calculation of accuracy is done by calculating the number of positive transactions, covered by any of the coverage sets of the itemsets in the pattern set and subtracting the number of negative transactions covered by any of the coverage sets of the itemsets, in the pattern set. The algorithm for calculating accuracy in Algorithm 3.\nRest of the section describes the algorithms that we have implemented on this setup using these functions."

Which is needed to cover the huge search space for global optimization problem. For this reason, multi-point search algorithms are preferred. They keep a number of solutions in the population and runs single point search in parallel. Moreover, combinations of the individuals in the population helps the search to create high quality solutions that resembles the natural process of evolution of species. One such algorithm is genetic algorithms. The genetic algorithm that we propose here keeps a population of pattern sets and then iteratively recombines and mutates the individuals to create new solutions.

In each generation of the genetic algorithm, the algorithm goes through two phases: crossover and mutation. In the crossover phase, two parent individuals are choosen randomly from the population and a child individual in created. This new individual is created using the one point crossover operation. After the validity of the individual checking, only a valid solution is added to the crossover population. This process iterates until the crossover population size is equal to the population size. Then the mutation phase begins. From each of the valid individuals in the crossover population a valid individual is created and added to the mutation population list. At the end of the mutation phase best solutions from these three population lists are selected for the next generation."

However, in a few cases hill climbing with restart (denoted by HC+Restart in the table) works better. However, the margin is not much higher. The random walk Monte Carlo simulation performs poorly since there not much of intelligent decisions taken during the search. The performance of the random valid search improves since random walk wastes a good amount of time finding valid pattern sets that are closed over the positive transaction set. The hill climbing search quickly gets stuck into the local maximum and once stagnates, it can not improve further due to lack of escaping mechanism. The situation improves when we add random restart strategy along with the hill climbing search. The performance of the algorithms somehow varies with the size of the pattern sets. The situation is pictured in Figure ??. In this figure, accuracy of the search algorithms are shown as vertical bars for all the datasets for different pattern set sizes. It is evident from the bar diagrams that the increase in the pattern set size favors the genetic algorithm.\nWe also depict the performance of the search algorithms in Figure 7. It shows the progress of different search algorithms in 10 minutes for a single run of the hepatitis dataset. The random walk algorithm lacking intelligent decision through the search can not improve much. Where as, hill climbing improves very quickly by taking greedy best choice moves.
