The key idea behind game-theoretic approach to network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties. Next, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen game-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as the payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of game-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according to their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role played by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally challenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a wide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in polynomial time.\nOur focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and its various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues. Furthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in connectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it. Finally, we analyse computational properties of generalized version of cooperative games in which order of player matters. We propose a new representation for such games, called generalized marginal contribution networks, that allows for polynomial computation in the size of the representation of two dedicated extensions of the Shapley value to this class of games.\nKeywords: the Shapley value, the Owen value, Semivalues, social networks, centrality measures\n5\nStreszczenie\nW niniejszej rozprawie autor porusza problem złożoności obliczeniowej teoriogrowych centralności. W teoriogrowym podejściu do analizy sieci traktujemy wierzchołki jako graczy w koalicyjnej grze, w której wartość koalicji wierzchołków wynika ze struktury sieci. W takiej grze ważność każdego wierzchołka może być określona przez dowolne rozwiązanie gry koalicyjnej (w szczególności przez wartość Shapleya). Z jednej strony zaletą takiego podejścia do centralności jest fakt, że ranking wierzchołków wynika nie tylko z indywidualnej roli każdego wierzchołka, lecz także z tego, ile dany wierzchołek wnosi do roli każdego podzbioru wierzchołków w grafie. Jednakże z drugiej strony liczenie rozwiązań gier koalicyjnych jest bardzo trudne. Główną kontrybucją tej rozprawy jest pokazanie, jak liczyć w czasie wielomianowym teoriogrowe centralności dla wielu różnych rozwiązań gier koalicyjnych.\nW tej pracy autor skupia się na szybkim liczeniu teoriogrowych centralności opartych na wartości Shapleya i jej różnych rozszerzeń.

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The Shapley value is arguably the most well-known normative payoff division scheme (solution concept) in cooperative game theory [Shapley, 1953]. One of its interesting applications is to measure importance (or centrality) of nodes in networks. Unfortunately, although such game-theoretic approach to centrality is often more advantageous than the classical measures, the Shapley value as well as other, related solution concepts from cooperative game-theory are computationally challenging. In particular, they typically require to consider all marginal contributions that n players in the cooperative game could make to all 2n coalitions (subsets of players). Clearly, applying such a direct approach to compute game-theoretic solution concepts on networks would be prohibitive even for very small systems.\nThe main thesis of this dissertation is that it is possible to compute various measures based on game-theoretic solution concepts in polynomial time. This includes, among others, game-theoretic extensions of three most well-known classical centrality measures: degree, closeness and betweenness. Polynomial running time in our algorithms is achieved by probabilistic analysis of marginal contributions of players to coalitions and taking advantage of the network topology.\nNetworks underpin the number of real-life domains of our everyday live: from the quite obvious examples of computer networks, communications networks, or road networks to the more hidden networks like protein networks, internet network, or social networks. The studies of the structure of real-life networks were undertaken by many scientists resulting with a number of astonishing breakthroughs. Discovered and explained by Albert et al. [2000] the scale-free nature of many real-life networks were undoubtedly one of those. The other was done by Watts and Strogatz [1998] who proposed the model inspired by the network phenomenon of the Six Degrees of Separation. Another significant breakthrough was done much earlier by Freeman [1979] who provided the conceptual classification of centrality measures—functions evaluating the importance of nodes in the network. More specifically, Freeman distinguished three basic concepts upon which various centrality measures are built: the distance between nodes (closeness centralities), the number of shortest paths between nodes (betweenness centralities), and direct connections to other nodes (degree centralities).\nDue to a wide variety of applications of centrality measures, analyzing and developing them is one of the major research topics in the network science. For instance, identifying key nodes in network can be used to study network vulnerability [Holme et al., 2002], to\n11\nbuild recommendation systems [Liu et al., 2013], to identify the focal hubs in a road network [Schultes and Sanders, 2007], to point the most critical functional entities in a protein network [Jeong et al., 2001], or to find the most influential people in a social network [Kempe et al., 2003].\nThe common feature of the standard centrality measures introduced by Freeman [1979] is that they assess the importance of a node by focusing only on the role that a node plays by itself. However, in many applications such an approach is inadequate due to existence synergies that may occur if the functioning of nodes is considered in groups.1 In order to capture such synergies Everett and Borgatti [1999] introduced the concept of group centrality. Its idea is broadly the same as the one of standard centrality, but now the focus is on the functioning of a given group of nodes, rather than individual nodes. In particular, Everett and Borgatti [1999] extended three Freeman’s measures to group degree centrality, group closeness centrality, and group betweenness centrality.\nHowever, while the concept of group centrality addresses the issue of quantifying synergy among nodes in a particular group, there is still another fundamental problem to be solved. In particular, it is unclear how to rank individual nodes given an exponential number of potential groups of nodes they may belong to. In other words, we need to answer the question: how to rank individual nodes based on their group centralities? Here, the coalitional game theory comes into play.\nIn particular, the coalitional (or cooperative) game theory is a part of game theory in which individual players are allowed to form coalitions with an aim to increase their profits. Now, assuming that players have all decided to cooperate (i.e. to form the grand coalition), one of the fundamental problems in coalitional game theory is how to divide the payoff achieved by cooperation? The most popular answer to this question was offered by L.S. Shapley [Shapley, 1953]—the 2012 Noble Prize Laureate—who proposed to consider marginal contributions of players to all coalitions they could potential belong to. He proved that there exists the unique payoff division scheme, now called the Shapley value, that satisfies the following four fairness axioms: Efficiency—the whole available payoff is distributed among players; the Null Player—the player that cannot contribute anything should receive zero; Symmetry—two players whose contributions to any coalition are always the same should be given the same payoff; and Additivity—the payoff division scheme should be additive.\nThe alternative axiomatizations of the Shapley value have been studied by numerous authors in the literature. Unfortunately, while this value has many interesting properties, computing the Sahpley value is often #P-complete [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994]. This obstacle will be overcome in this thesis in the context of game-theoretic centrality.\n1 Intuitively, synergy can be fought of as a value added from group performance. Note that synergy can be also negative and, in such a case, it is called antergy. For an overview of various concepts of synergy see the work by Rahwan et al. [2014].\n12\nNow we have all necessary tools to introduce game-theoretic centrality measures. In a nutshell, the idea behind them is to treat nodes as players in a coalitional game, where the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by a group centrality. In such settings, the value of each individual node can be determined by cooperative game solution such as the Shapley value. In other words, in order to provide the ranking of individual nodes that accounts for group centrality measure, we use the Shapley value that evaluates (fairly in a certain sense) marginal contributions of each node to all groups it could potentially belong to. The key advantage of such an approach is that nodes are ranked not only according to their individual roles in the network but also according to how they contribute to the role played by all possible subsets of nodes.\nUnfortunately, as already mentioned, potential downside of game-theoretic solution concepts is that they are, in general, computationally challenging. However, in this dissertation, we show that this is not always true in the network context, i.e., we are able to compute the Shapley value and the related solution concepts in polynomial time for various centrality-related games on networks.\nOur contributions in this dissertation can be summarized as follows. Firstly, we compute on networks in polynomial time the Semivalues [Dubey et al., 1981] which are the generalization of the Shapley value and offer more flexibility to define any particular game-theoretic network centrality. Secondly, we propose polynomial-time algorithm on networks for the Owen value [Owen, 1977] that is the most important solution concept to games with coalitional structure, and the Coalitional Semivalue our extension of the Owen value. Finally, we propose the new representation of generalized coalitional games, the games in which the permutations of players are considered. Our representation allows to compute Nowak-Radzik value [Nowak and Radzik, 1994] and Sánchez-Bergantiños value [Sánchez and Bergantiños, 1999]. The polynomial time algorithms for the last two values are still unknown, but we propose algorithms that significantly reduce computational complexity of the problem. We also show how to use our representation on networks."

In particular, we define the Shapley value—the most popular normative solution concept to cooperative games. We also introduce a parametrized generalization to the Shapley value called the Semivalue. Since the standard model (or representation) of cooperative games, i.e. the characteristic function, is computationally challenging, we discuss an alternative representation, called the Marginal Contribution Networks. For certain games, this representation allows for computing the Shapley value in polynomial time in the number of agents.\nSecondly, we define the basic notation of a graph and introduce elementary concepts related\nto social network analysis such as: centralities and communities."

      "text" : "Game Theory consists of two broad areas: non-cooperative (or strategic) games and cooperative (or coalitional) games. The first class of games is one in which players make decisions independently. In the second class, groups of players, called coalitions, are allowed to form profitable coalitions [Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994].\nDefinition 1 (Coalitional game). A coalitional game consists of a set of players (or agents) A “ ta1, a2, . . . , a|A|u, and the characteristic function ν : 2A Ñ R, which assigns to each coalition of playersC Ď A a real value (or payoff) indicating its performance, where νpHq “ 0. Thus, the coalitional game g in the characteristic function form is a pair g “ pA, νq.\nIn such defined game the number of all coalitions equals 2|A|—the number of all subsets of A. The set of all coalitional games will be denoted by V , so we can write pA, νq P V , or sometimes we simplify notation and write ν P V . The coalition of all players A is called grand coalition.\nExample 1. Let us consider the game where players collect cards with famous rock stars. Each card has its own value, which could be doubled if only player possesses all cards from the set.\n16\nThe game consists of two sets of cards K “ tk1, k2u M “ tm1,m2,m3u, and four players A “ ta1, a2, a3, a4u who have the following cards:\na1 ÐÑ k1,m3 a2 ÐÑ k2 a3 ÐÑ m1 a4 ÐÑ m2,m3\nAssuming that each card has individually value 1 the characteristic function describing this game g1 “ pA, ν1q is:\nν1pHq “ 0 ν1pta1uq “ ν1pta2uq “ ν1pta3uq “ ν1pta4uq “ 1\nν1pta2, a3uq “ 2 ν1pta1, a3uq “ ν1pta2, a4uq “ 3\nν1pta1, a4uq “ 4 ν1pta1, a2uq “ 5\nν1pta3, a4uq “ ν1pta1, a2, a3uq “ 6 ν1pta2, a3, a4uq “ ν1pta1, a2, a4uq “ 7\nν1pta1, a3, a4uq “ 8 ν1pAq “ 11\nPlayer a3 has one card m1, so individually its value is ν1pta3uq “ 1. The player a4 has two cards from the same set m2,m3 and playing alone he can receive ν1pta4uq “ 2. Now, if these two players cooperate, they will have all cards from the same set, what makes them more valuable. Playing together they will receive ν1pta3, a4uq “ 6, so they have a big incentive to cooperate.\nForm the above example we see that the assumption ν1pHq “ 0 is natural, because the empty coalition without players cannot obtain any profits. Additionally, the characteristic function in this example incites players to collaborate, because joining new members to coalition can only improve its performance. This property of characteristic function is called superadditivity and may cause the forming of the grand coalition.\nDefinition 2 (Superadditivity). The characteristic function in the game pA, vq is superadditive if only the following expression holds:\n@ C1,C2ĎA C1XC2“H vpC1 Y C2q ě vpC1q ` vpC2q\nThe property strongly connected to superadditivity is called monotonicity.\n17\nDefinition 3 (Monotonicity). The characteristic function in the game pA, vq jest monotonic if only the following expression holds:\n@ C1ĎC2ĎA vpC2q ě vpC1q\nCaulier [2009] showed that for the games with non-negative characteristic function the superadditivity implies monotonicity. However, in general the implication in neither direction holds.\nWhen the game is superadditive, or monotonic the grand coalition, i.e., the coalition of all the players in the game, has the highest value and, therefore, is formed. One of the fundamental questions in cooperative game theory is then how to divide the payoff of the grand coalition (νpAq) among the players and the most popular normative solution to that problem is the Shapley value."

      "text" : "In principle, there may be an infinite number of divisions of the value of grand coalition among players, however, we are interested in those that meet certain desirable criteria. In order to present these criteria we introduce the notion of marginal contribution.\nDefinition 4 (Marginal contribution). The marginal contribution of player ai P A to the coalition C Ď Aztaiu is:\nMCpC, aiq “ νpC Y taiuq ´ νpCq (2.1)\nNow, let us consider four fairness properties that a given division scheme should meet. We denote by φipA, νq the payoff received by a player ai in game pA, νq.\nSymmetry payoffs do not depend on the players’ names. That is, φpA, πpνqq “ πpφqpA, vq for every game ν and permutation π P ΠpAq.\nNull Player players that make no contribution should receive nothing. In other words, ` @C Ď A,MCpC, aiq “ 0 ˘ ñ ` φipA, νq “ 0 ˘ .\nEfficiency the entire payoff of each coalition should be distributed among its members. That is, ř\naiPA φipAq “ νpAq.\nAdditivity given three games, g1 “ pA, ν1q, g2 “ pA, ν2q and g3 “ pA, ν3q, where ν1pCq “ ν2pCq ` ν3pCq for all C Ď A, the payoff of a player in g1 should be the sum of his payoff in g2 and in g3.\n18\nThe Symmetry property implies that two players that contribute the same value to all coalitions should be given the same payoff. More formally:\n` @CĎAztai,aju,MCpC, aiq “ MCpC, ajq ˘ ñ ` φipA, νq “ φjpA, νq ˘\n(2.2)\nThe Efficiency property assures that the whole available payoff is distributed among players. The Null Player property indicates that player that can not contribute anything should receive value 0. The Additivity property says that if players anticipate in two separate games then their importance in the game consisting of these two games, is the sum of the importance in these two subgames. Interestingly, there exist only one division scheme that satisfies the above four criteria—Shapley value.\nExample 2. Let us consider the coalitional game g2 “ pA, vq, in which three players A “ ta1, a2, a3u collect apples from trees. Each player posses a stand allowing him to collect apples from the top of the trees. Additionally, on two stands of the same height it is possible to put third stand. Now, let us introduce the function s : A Ñ N evaluating the high of each stand that a given player have:\nspaiq “\n$ ’ ’ &\n’ ’ % 20 if i “ 1 40 if i “ 2 20 if i “ 3\nThe characteristic function ν2 in this game is defined as follows:\nν2pCq “\n$ ’ ’ &\n’ ’ % 0 if C “ H 60 ˚ 10 if C “ A max aiPC tspaiqu ˚ 10 otherwise.\nThe players a1 and a3 contributes the same value to each coalition, so based on the Symmetry property they should have the same payoff. We also know that the Efficiency property implies that the whole gain 600 should be distributed among all players. Based on these two information we obtain two equations: φ1 “ φ2 φ1 ` φ2 “ φ3 “ 600\nAt this point we haven’t enough information to solve the above equation. In order to do it, we need to use Additivity and Null Player properties.\nThe solution of the above game should satisfy the four fairness properties. To this end, Shapley [1953] proposed to evaluate the role of each player in the game proportionally to a weighted average marginal contribution of this player to all possible coalitions. Formally:\n19\nDefinition 5 (Shapley value). In a coalitional game pA, νq the Shapley value for a player ai is given by:\nφSVi pA, νq “ ÿ\nCĎAztaiu\n|C|!p|A| ´ |C| ´ 1q! A! pvpC Y taiuq ´ vpCqq (2.3)\nImportantly, the Noble prize winner L. S. Shapley [Shapley, 1953] showed that the vector φSV is the only solution concept satisfying properties p1q ´ p4q. Furthermore, if the characteristic function is superadditive than Shapley value satisfies one additional property:\nIndividual Rationality: ÿ\naiPA φSVi pνq ě νptaiuq\nIndividual Rationality indicates that each player has no incentive to play alone. If he do so, he will receive the payoff no greater than the payoff obtained during his collaboration with others.\nThe set of all players A will be sometimes considered as a ordered list (|A|-tuple) A “ pa1, a2, . . . , a|A|q in order to use the notion of the permutation of all players π P ΠpAq.\nThe important fact about the Shapley value is that for a given player ai P A in the game pA, νq it is the expected marginal contribution of this player to the set of players Pπpaiq that precede ai in a random permutation π P ΠpAq of all players in the game.\nDefinition 6 (Shapley value as an expected value). In a coalitional game pA, νq the Shapley value for a player ai is given by:\nφSVi pA, νq “ ErMCpPπpaiq, aiqs “ 1 |A|! ÿ\nπPΠpAq\nMCpPπpaiq, aiq (2.4)\nThe equivalence between Definition 5 and Definition 6 can be easily derived by using a simple combinatorial fact: the number of permutations ofA in which the set of players occurring before i-th player equals Pπpaiq is exactly |Pπpaiq|!p|A| ´ 1´ |Pπpaiq|q!.\nφSVi pvq “ 1|A|! ´ MCpPπ1paiq, aiq `MCpPπ2paiq, aiq ` . . .`MCpPπn!paiq, aiq ¯\n“ 1|A|! ´\np|H|!qp|A|´1q! hkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkj pMCpH, aiq ` . . .`MCpH, aiqq` . . .` |C|!p|A|´1´|C|q! hkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkj pMCpC, aiq ` . . .`MCpC, aiqq` . . .\n. . .` p|A|´1q!p|A|´1´p|A|´1qq! hkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkikkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkj pMCpAztaiu, aiq ` . . .`MCpAztaiu, aiqq ¯\n“ 1|A|! ´ p|A| ´ 1q!pMCpH, aiqq ` . . .` |C|!p|A| ´ 1´ |C|q!pMCpC, aiqq ` . . .\n. . .` p|A| ´ 1q!pMCpAztaiu, aiqq ¯\n“ 1|A|! ÿ\nCĎAztaiu\n|C|!p|A| ´ |C| ´ 1q! MCpC, aiq\n20\nUsing the Definition 6 we can compute the Shapley value for the game in Example 2.\nExample 3. We will consider all permutations of the set A from the game g2 defined in Example 2. For each permutation we will compute the marginal contribution of the agent a2 to the set Pπpa2q.\na1, a2, a3 MCpta1u, a2q “ ν2pta1, a2uq ´ ν2pta1uq “ 200 a1, a3, a2 MCpta1, a3u, a2q “ 400 a2, a1, a3 MCpH, a2q “ 400 a2, a3, a1 MCpH, a2q “ 400 a3, a1, a2 MCpta1, a3u, a2q “ 400 a3, a2, a1 MCpta3u, a2q “ 200\nThus, for the game g2 we have:\nφSV2 “ 200`400`400`400`400`2006! “ 333 1 3 φSV1 “ 13313 φSV3 “ 13313\nGenerally, using equation (2.3) computing Shapley value requires iterating through 2|A| subsets of A, and using equation (2.4) requires iterating through all |A|! permutations of A. Furthermore, computing the Shapley value has been shown to be NP-Hard (or even worse, #P-Complete) for many specific classes of games [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994, Nagamochi et al., 1997].\nTherefore, many new succinctly representations were proposed in the literature. The most\npopular we introduce in Section 2.4 and Section 2.5."

      "text" : "The Shapley value is designed to divide payoff, which is equivalent to evaluating the power of agents in cooperative game. However, if we focus only on the power index of players, we can drop the Efficiency axiom. Semivalues introduced by Dubey et al. [1981] represent an important class of power indexes, among which only Shapley value satisfies Efficiency. To define Semivalues, we will use the notion of marginal contribution of the player i to the coalition C introduced in Definition 4. Let β : t0, 1, . . . , |A| ´ 1u Ñ r0, 1s be a function such that\nř|N |´1 k“0 βpkq “ 1. Intuitively, when we calculate the expected marginal contribution of a\nnode, βpkq will be the probability that a coalition of size k is chosen for this node to join. This is why βpkq is defined on values ranging from 0 to |N |´1. Note that the function β is a discrete\n21\nprobability distribution. Since a player ai cannot join a coalition that it is already in, we only need to look at coalitions not containing ai.\nDefinition 7 (Semivalue). Given β and a coalitional game pA, νq the Semivalue for a player ai is given by:\nφSEMIi pA, νq “ ÿ\n0ďkă|V |\nβpkqECkrMCpCk, iqs, (2.5)\nwhere Ck is the random variable of all possible coalitions of size k drawn with uniform probability form the set Aztaiu, and ECkr¨s is the expected value operator for the random variable Ck.\nThe Shapley value (Definition 5) and the Banzhaf index of power [Banzhaf, 1965] are two prominent and well-known examples of Semivalues. They are defined by β-functions βShapley and βBanzhaf , respectively:\nβShapleypkq “ 1|A| and β Banzhaf pkq “\n`|A|´1 k ˘\n2|A|´1 .\nAll Semivalues satisfy Symmetry, Null player and Additivity axioms and except for the Shapley value, all these solutions violate the Efficiency axiom, which makes them of limited use as fair cost sharing values. However, they are widely used as indicators of power in cooperative games [Monderer and Samet, 2002]."

      "text" : "The size of the representation of coalitional games in the characteristic function form is exponential in the number of agents and consequently computing Shapley value for such games is generally hard. In order to overcome this limitation the researchers look for for more concise representations. One of the most interesting and very intuitive techniques for representing coalitional games was introduced by Ieong and Shoham [2005]. The authors proposed marginal contribution nets (MC-Nets). This representation has a number of desirable properties: it is fully expressive, concise for many characteristic function games of interest, and facilitates a very efficient technique for computing the Shapley value. More specifically, in such representation we can compute the Shapley value in the linear time in respect to the size of a representation.\nLet us introduce the syntax of Boolean formulas:\nA :“ ai | ai i P t1 . . . nu, F :“ pFq | F ^ F | F _ F | F ‘ F | A ,\n22\nwhere each literal ai represents the agent in the game. In other words, this formula is a binary rooted tree with positive or negative literals on leafs and internal nodes labeled with one of the following logical connectives: conjunction (^), disjunction (_) and exclusive disjunction (‘).\nDefinition 8 (General Marginal Contribution Network). The coalitional game in the form of General Marginal Contribution Network is a pair pA,Rq, where A is a set of players, and R is the set of rules.

Rules are of the form of F˚ Ñ V , where F˚ is a conjunction of positive or negative literals.\nA coalition C is said to meet a given formula F˚ if and only if F˚ evaluates to true when the values of all Boolean variables that correspond to players in C are set to true, and the values of all Boolean variables that correspond to players not in C are set to false.

Taking advantage of the additivity property of the Shapley value, every basic rule can be considered separately as a game on its own. Thus, we need to compute the Shapley value for a single rule, and based on this we will be able to compute the Shapley value for the entire game.\nTheorem 1. [Ieong and Shoham, 2005] In coalitional game pA,R˚q in which R˚ consists of a single rule F˚ Ñ V , where p is the number of positive literals and n is the number of negative ones, the Shapley value for the player ai P F˚ is:\nφSVi “ V\np ` p`n n\n˘ ,\n23\nand for a player aj P N the Shapley value is:\nφSVj “ ´V n `\np`n p\n˘ .\nProof. From the Symmetry axiom we know that all players ai P F˚ have the same Shapley value, because they are indistinguishable. This observation also applies to all players aj P F˚. In this proof we will use Definition 6. We want to count the number of permutations such that for the given player ai P F˚ the MCpPπpaiq, aiqq ‰ 0. To satisfy this condition all players corresponding to positive literals from F˚ must appear before ai and all players corresponding to negative literals from F˚ after him. Now, we will construct such permutations:\n— Let us choose p ` n positions in the sequence of all elements from A. We can do this in ` |A| p`n ˘ ways. — Than, in the first p chosen positions place all players corresponding to positive literals and in\nthe last n place all players corresponding to negative literals . The number of such line-ups\nis pp´ 1q!n!. — The remaining players can be arranged in p|A| ´ pp` nqq! ways.\nThus, we have:\nφSVi “ 1|A|! ř πPΠpAq MCpPπpaiq, aiq “ 1|A|! ` |A| p`n ˘\npp´ 1q!n!p|A| ´ pp` nqq!V “ pp´1q!n!pp`nq!

Next, we will compute the Shapley value based on the above theorem.\nExample 4. Firstly, we define the set of rules R˚ that corresponds to the characteristic function ν2 form the game g2.\nr1 : a2 Ñ 400 r2 : a1 ^ a2 Ñ 200 r3 : a3 ^ a1 ^ a2 Ñ 200 r4 : a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 Ñ 200\nSecondly, in order to compute ν2pta1, a2, a3uq we need to iterate through all rules that this coalition meets. We see that ta1, a2, a3u |ù a2 and ta1, a2, a3u |ù a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, so\n24\nν2pta1, a2, a3uq “ 400 ` 200 “ 600. In the same manner we can compute the value of any other coalition. Now, let us consider the Shapley value vector for each game defined by a single rule.\nr1 : p0, 4001p11q , 0q “ p0, 400, 0q r2 : p 2001p21q , ´200 1p21q , 0q “ p100,´100, 0q r3 : p´2002p31q , ´200 2p31q , 200 1p32q q “ p´331 3 ,´331 3 , 662 3 q r4 : p 2003p30q , 200 3p30q , 200 3p30q q “ p662 3 , 662 3 , 662 3 q\nWe sum up all vectors, and we obtain the final solution of this game:\nφSV1 “ 0` 100´ 3313 ` 66 2 3 “ 1331 3 φSV2 “ 400´ 100´ 3313 ` 66 2 3 “ 3331 3 φSV3 “ 0` 0` 6623 ` 66 2 3 “ 1331 3\nTo conclude the above example, we have obtain the same results as in Example 2 but in order to compute the Shapley value for each player we have performed less operation than when iterating through all permutations.

      "text" : "One of the important aspects of research on networks is to determine which nodes and edges are more critical (or central) to the functioning of the entire network than others. For example,\n26\none may want to identify the focal hubs in a road network [Schultes and Sanders, 2007], the most critical functional entities in a protein network [Jeong et al., 2001], or the most influential people in a social network [Kempe et al., 2003]. To this end, various centrality metrics, such as degree, closeness, eigenvalue or betweenness, have been extensively studied in the literature.1\nDefinition 14 (Centrality). For a given graphG “ pV,Eq the classic (also standard) centrality is a function c : V Ñ R that for each node v P V it determines the importance of this node measured in real value.\nGenerally speaking, centrality analysis aims to create a consistent ranking of nodes within a network. To this end, centrality measures assign a score to each node that in some way corresponds to the importance of that node given a particular application. Since “importance” depends on the context of the problem at hand, many different centrality measures have been developed. The three well-known and widely applied measures introduced by Freeman [1979] are: degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality.\nDefinition 15 (Degree centrality). For a given graphG “ pV,Eq degree centrality is a function cd : V Ñ R:\ncdpvq “ degpvq\nwhere degpvq is a degree of the node v.\nThe intuition standing behind this measure is that it reflects the activity of a given node. This activity can be expressed as a number of friends in social portal, or number of articles published together with other peers in science collaboration network.\nDefinition 16 (Betweenness centrality). For a given graphG “ pV,Eq betweenness centrality is a function cb : V Ñ R:\ncbpvq “ ÿ\ns‰v‰t\nσstpvq σst\nwhere σst is the number of shortest paths between s and t (if s “ t then σst “ 1), and σstpvq is the number of shortest paths between s and t passing through a node v (if v P ts, tu then σstpvq “ 0).2\nThis measure and its different variants is generally used to indicate the most important nodes in the process of controlling information flow. For instance it can be used to determine the most important routers in computer network.\nDefinition 17 (Closeness centrality). For a given graph G “ pV,Eq closeness centrality is a function cc : V Ñ R:\nccpvq “ ÿ\ns‰v dps, vq\n1 Koschützki et al. [2005] presented an overview of the most important centrality metrics. 2 To deal with unconnected graphs it is assumed that 00 “ 0.\n27\nwhere distps, vq is a distance between nodes s and v.\nThis centrality has two aspects: one that evaluates the most important nodes in the process of discrimination of information, and one that evaluates the most independent nodes. For instance, if we want to construct an efficient network of communication in our company, the CEO should be in the middle of this structure that his orders would immediately hit the targets. On the other hand, the person with the lowest closeness centrality is the most independent person, because the information coming to him from others requires the smallest number of brokers. For unconnected networks this measure is sometimes presented as a sum of fractions: ř\ns‰v 1 dps,vq .\nIn the sample network in Figure 2.1, nodes v1 and v2 have degree 5 and, if judged by degree centrality, these are the most important nodes within the entire network (cdpv1q “ cdpv2q “ 5). Conversely, closeness centrality focuses on distances among nodes and gives high value to the nodes that are close to all other nodes. With this measure, node v8 in Figure 2.1 is ranked top with lowest value ccpv8q “ 22. The last measure—betweenness centrality—considers shortest paths (i.e., paths that use the minimal number of links) between any two nodes in the network. The more shortest paths the node belongs to, the more important it is.

Clearly, all these measures expose different characteristics of a node. Consider, for instance, an epidemiology application, where the aim is to identify those people (i.e., nodes) in the social network who have the biggest influence on the spread of the disease and should become a focal point of any prevention or emergency measures. Here, degree centrality ranks top nodes with the biggest immediate sphere of influence—their infection would lead to the highest number of adjacent nodes being exposed to the disease. On the other hand, closeness centrality identifies those nodes whose infection would lead to the fastest spread of the disease throughout the society. Finally, betweenness centrality reveals the nodes that play a crucial role in passing the disease from one person in a network to another.\n28"

Intuitively, a community (also called a cluster) is a group of nodes in a network such that there are comparatively many edges among the nodes within the group and fewer with nodes outside the group. The communities can be non-overlapping, which mean that node can belong to only one community, and overlapping. In this dissertation we focus on non-overlapping communities.

      "text" : "Centrality measures constitute one of the main research directions in the literature on network analysis. In his classic work, Freeman [1979] proposed and formalized three different concepts of centrality: (i) degree centrality is based on being directly connected to other nodes; (ii) closeness centrality is based on being close to all other nodes; and (iii) betweenness centrality is based on lying between other nodes. Importantly, these three centralities are build upon three conceptually different properties extracted from networks: connections, distances and geodesics, respectively, and all three can be easily used as a basic ground for various extensions. To name only the few, Newman [2004] proposed weighted degree centrality, a appropriate measure of degree for weighted networks, Brandes [2008] introduced distance-scaled betweenness centrality, and Boldi and Vigna [2013] harmonic centrality, the extension of closeness one.\nThe fourth classical measure is eigenvector centrality, which is based on the idea that connections to more important nodes should be valued more than otherwise equal connections to less important nodes [Bonacich, 1972]. One of the most known extension of this measure was proposed by Brin and Page [1998], who proposed famous PageRank metric\nThe topics closely related to centralities are that of the percolation on complex networks and social capital. Regarding percolation, Callaway et al. [2000] studied different models of nodes failures, where each element of the graph have some probability of being disabled. Such studies gives answer to the problem how a given network is vulnerable to a random node or edge failure. Here the centralities can be used to determine the most important nodes to protect. Such studies were done by Holme et al. [2002], who compared degree and betweenness centralities. He postulated that betweenness centrality is a good basis for strategies of protecting nodes against random nodes failures.\n30\nThe ”social capital” term is much wider than ”centrality” and is is used to describe both “the value of an individual’s social relationships” [Burt, 1992] and “a quality of groups” [Everett and Borgatti, 1999] within the society. Borgatti et al. [1998] propose to classify social capital along two dimensions. The first is whether it concerns individual actor or a group, or whether we focus on internal or external links (see Table 3.1).\nThis classification distinguishes three fields of social capital studies (or centrality): (A) in this category are examined the internal properties of autonomous actors and this is not part of the studies on social capital nor social networks analysis; (B) in this field the individual actor is examined in the context of its relations to external world and most standard centralities belong to this category; (C) in this category the group of actors are studied in the context of internal relations among them; (D) the last type of social capital is engaged in studying group of actors and their relationships with external world. For all types of social capital many different measures have been proposed (see Table 3.1) and most of them the literature refers to as centralities. Although the three categories of social capital are considered separately, there are cases where they influence each other. For instance, in situations where actors are divided into groups, the role of each individual strictly depends on the role of the entire group and the role of the group simply depends on its members.\nSocial capital is related to social networks describing people and their relationships.\nCentrality measures can be used to analyze any kind of networks."

      "heading" : "3.2. Game-theoretic Apporach to Centrality Measures",
      "text" : "Game-theoretic centrality is an extension of standard centrality based on cooperative game theory. The basic idea behind game-theoretic centrality is to consider the nodes of the network to be a players in a cooperative game, where the payoffs of coalitions are derived from the network topology. Such an analogy between graph and game theory allows to use various game-theoretic solution concepts as a centrality measure of individual nodes.1\n1 See the next chapter for more details.\n31\nThe first author to introduce game-theoretic centrality were Grofman and Owen [1982], who used the Banzhaf index of power [Banzhaf, 1965]. This is a widely-used solution concept that quantifies the power of a player by counting the number of coalitions in which this player is a swing player—a player whose addition to the coalition changes it from being unsuccessful (e.g., in achieving some goal) to being successful. Grofman and Owen mapped a simple coalitional game, a coalitional game where every coalition has a value of 1 or 0, onto a directed graph by considering paths in the graph to be coalitions. Here, a swing player is a node that is crucial to maintain communication among the nodes in the path. Then, Grofman and Owen’s Banzhaf index-based centrality says that the more times a node is a swing node within all possible paths of nodes, the more important this node is in the entire network.\nThe game-theoretic centrality were reinvented by Gómez et al. [2003], who proposed a slightly different approach. Instead of restricting themselves to simple coalitional games, the authors study arbitrary games where a coalition’s value can be any real number. In this context, the authors propose a centrality measure based on the two prominent solution concepts: the Shapley value [Shapley, 1953] and the Myerson value [Myerson, 1977].\nThe first value is arguably the best normative solution concept known to date, and was discussed in Section 2.2. The Myerson value is based on graph-restricted games, where the underlying assumption is that only connected coalitions (i.e., the group of nodes that between any pair exists a path passing through only members of this group) can communicate and create any value added. Myerson assumed that the value of disconnected coalition would simply be the sum of the values of its connected components. A celebrated result of Myerson for this setting is a dedicated solution concept—closely related to the Shapley value—called the Myerson value. In fact, it is the Shapley value, but evaluated for the characteristic function sensible to coalitions connectivity, as was described above.\nTaking Shapley value and Myerson value, Gómez et al. [2003] defined the centrality of a node vi to be the difference between the Shapley value of vi (which is independent of the network connectedness) and the Myerson value of vi (which takes the network connectedness into consideration). Thus, by interpreting the Shapley value as a power index in a coalitional game, Gómez et al.’s Shapley/Myerson-based centrality measure represents the increase (or decrease) in vi’s power due to its position in the network.\nThis direction of research took also del Pozo et al. [2011], who proposed a measure for directed graphs, based on generalised coalitional games [Nowak and Radzik, 1994], where the value of a coalition is influenced by the sequence in which the players have joined it. More specifically, the authors adapted these games to networks in the spirit of Myerson and then based their measure on a parametric family of solution concepts that include two extensions of the Shapley value to generalised coalitional games: one by Nowak and Radzik [1994] and\n32\nthe other by Sánchez and Bergantiños [1999]. In a similar spirit, Amer et al. [2007] defined a game-theoretic centrality measure called accessibility in oriented networks.\nA computational study of game-theoretic centrality measures based on connectivity games on networks (inspired by Myerson) was done in Chapter 7. We showed that the efficient computation of the Shapley value is impossible even in the case of a very simple definition of the connectivity game on graph. We also proposed algorithm that significantly improve the computation of such game-theoretic centrality measures. We need to mention that our algorithm was further improved by Skibski et al. [2014] and modified and applied to analyze social networks by Narayanam et al. [2014].\nAll the above works are inspired in one way or the other by the graph-restricted games in the spirit of Myerson [1977], where the value of a group of nodes is mainly determined by connectedness of this group.\nThis dissertation contributes to a parallel stream of literature in which coalitions of nodes are not graph-restricted, i.e., their values do not depend directly on whether they are connected or not. The origins of this approach can be traced back to the concept of group centrality introduced by Everett and Borgatti [1999] which takes into account synergies among nodes. By computing group centrality for every possible group of nodes (not necessarily connected) we obtain a well-defined coalitional game. Next, one can apply a solution concept, such as the Shapley value or the Banzhaf index, to evaluate each individual nodes. Such evaluation attribute synergies to individual nodes, that were captured by group centrality measure.\nThe measure that captured the ability of nodes to dominate other nodes in directed networks was proposed by van den Brink and Borm [2002]. The authors do not refer to their measure as centrality, but from the social network analysis perspective it is. van den Brink and Gilles [2000] continue this line of research by analysing these measures more deeply and, more importantly, by providing an axiomatic approach to them. These are the first works to use general Shapley value approach to game-theoretic centralities.\nThis second line of research was also used by Suri and Narahari [2010] in the interesting application of influence propagation in networks. Specifically, the authors constructed a coalitional game by assigning to coalitions payoffs equal to their group degree. Then, the authors used the Shapley value to approximate the solution of the top k-node problem, i.e., the problem of identifying the k most influential nodes in the network. This approach was followed up by Adamczewski et al. [2014], who studied different versions of group degree."

      "text" : "Let us now turn our attention to the computational issues. In more detail, the computational challenges related to the game-theoretic solution concepts that are tackled in this dissertation\n33\nhave been extensively studied in the literature on algorithmic aspects of coalitional games. Since the path-breaking work by Deng and Papadimitriou [1994], a considerable attention has been paid to developing more efficient representations of games. Such representation can be divided into two main categories [Wooldridge and Dunne, 2006].\nThe first category, to which also this dissertation indirectly contributes, models the characteristic function using specific combinatorial structures such as graphs. This line of research include works by Deng and Papadimitriou [1994], Greco et al. [2009], Wooldridge and Dunne [2006], and the representations discussed by Aziz and de Keijzer [2011]. Such representations are guaranteed to be succinct, however they can express only certain games. In our case, the characteristic function is the function of the group betweenness centrality.\nIn the second category of representations the emphasis is placed on full expressiveness, often at the expense of succinctness. These representations include MC-Nets [Ieong and Shoham, 2005], its read-once extension [Elkind et al., 2009b], Synergy Coalition Groups [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2006], the Decision-Diagrams-based representations [Aadithya et al., 2011, Sakurai et al., 2011], the vector-based representation [Tran-Thanh et al., 2013], and the representation for graph-restricted weighted voting games [Skibski et al., 2015] .\nWe note that even for some succinctly representable games, computing the Shapley value and other game-theoretic solution concepts can be challenging (NP-Hard or even #P-Complete). This is the case with weighted voting games [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994], threshold network flow games [Bachrach and Rosenschein, 2009] and minimum spanning tree games [Nagamochi et al., 1997]. Also Aziz et al. [2009] proved negative results for the Shapley-Shubik power index for the spanning connectivity games on multigraphs, and Bachrach et al. [2008] for the Banzhaf index for certain class of connectivity games.\nPerhaps the most widely known positive results are those aforementioned due to Deng and Papadimitriou [1994] and Ieong and Shoham [2005]. In particular, Deng and Papadimitriou proposed a representation based on graphs, weighted edges of which represent the marginal contribution of both adjacent nodes (agents) to any coalition they belong to. While this representation is clearly not fully expressive, the Shapley value can be computed in time linear in the size of the graph. The representation of Ieong and Shoham [2005] consists of a finite set of logical rules of the following form: Boolean Expression Ñ Real Number, where agents are represented by atomic boolean variables (see Definition 9). The value of a coalition is equal to the sum of the Real Numbers in those rules whose that are satisfied by the coalition. Unlike the representation by Deng and Papadimitriou, the representation by Ieong and Shoham is fully expressive and, for certain types of Boolean Expressions, it allows for the Shapley value to be computed in time linear in the size of the representation.\nThe number of authors proposed alternative representations of coalitional games: coalitional skill games [Bachrach and Rosenschein, 2008] or synergy coalitional groups [Aadithya et al.,\n34\n2011], which allow for representing input compactly for certain games and admit algorithms (e.g. for computing the Shapley value) that run in polynomial time in the size of such a compact input. Finally, one can find in the literature the representation of the extension of coalitional games to games with externalities [Michalak et al., 2009, 2010]."

      "heading" : "4.1. Why Use Game-Theoretic Centrality Measures?",
      "text" : "In many network applications, it is important to chose which nodes and edges are the most important. To this end, the concept of centrality (see Section 2.7), which aims to quantify the importance of individual nodes/edges, has been extensively studied in the literature [Koschützki et al., 2005, Brandes and Erlebach, 2005].\nGenerally speaking, centrality analysis aims to create a consistent ranking of nodes within a network. To this end, centrality measures assign a score to each node that in some way corresponds to the importance of that node given a particular application. Since “importance” depends on the context of the problem at hand, many different centrality measures have been developed. Three of the most well-known that were introduced in Section 2.7: degree centrality, closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. Recall that we refer to these measures as classic/standard centralities (Definition 14).\nThe common feature of all standard measures is that they assess the importance of a node by focusing only on the role that a node plays by itself. However, in many applications such an approach is inadequate because of synergies that may occur if the functioning of nodes is considered in groups. Referring to Figure 4.1 and epidemiology example, a vaccination of individual node v6 (or v7 or v8) would not prevent the spread of the disease from the left to the right part of the network (or vice versa). However, the simultaneous vaccination of v6, v7 and v8 would achieve this goal. Thus, in this particular context, nodes v6, v7 and v8 do not play any significant role individually, but together they do. To quantify the importance of such groups of nodes, the notion of group centrality was introduced by Everett and Borgatti [1999]. Intuitively, group centrality works broadly the same way as standard centrality, but now the focus is on the functioning of a given group of nodes, rather than individual nodes. For instance, in Figure 4.1, the group degree centrality of tv1, v2u is 7 as they both have 7 distinct adjacent nodes.\n37\nAlthough the concept of group centrality addresses the issue of synergy between the functions is played by various nodes, it suffers from a fundamental deficiency. It focuses on particular, a priori determined, groups of nodes and it is not clear how to construct a consistent ranking of individual nodes using such group results. Specifically, should the nodes from the most valuable group be ranked top? Or should the most important nodes be those which belong to the group with the highest average value per node? Or should we focus on the nodes which contribute most to every coalition they join? In fact, there are very many possibilities to choose from.\nA framework that does address this issue is the game theoretic network centrality measure. In more detail, it allows the consistent ranking of individual nodes to be computed in a way that accounts for various possible synergies occurring within possible groups of nodes [Grofman and Owen, 1982, Gómez et al., 2003]. Specifically, the concept builds upon cooperative game theory—a part of game theory in which agents (or players) are allowed to form coalitions in order to increase their payoffs in the game. Now, one of the fundamental questions in cooperative game theory is how to distribute the surplus achieved by cooperation among the agents. To this end, Shapley proposed to remunerate agents with payoffs that correspond to their individual marginal contributions to the game (Definition 5). In more detail, for a given agent, such an individual marginal contribution is measured as the weighted average marginal increase in the payoff of any coalition that this agent could potentially join. Shapley famously proved that his concept—known since then as the Shapley value—is the only division scheme that meets certain desirable normative properties. Given this, the key idea of the game theoretic network centrality is to define a cooperative game over a network in which agents are the nodes, coalitions are the groups of nodes, and payoffs of coalitions are defined so as to meet requirements of a given application. This means that the Shapley value of each agent in such a game can then be interpreted as a centrality measure because it represents the average marginal contribution made by each node to every coalition of the other nodes.1. In other words, the Shapley value answers the question of how to construct a consistent ranking of individual nodes once groups of nodes have been evaluated.\nIn more detail, the Shapley value-based approach to centrality is, on one hand, much more sophisticated than the conventional measures, as it accounts for any group of nodes from which the Shapley value derives a consistent ranking of individual nodes. On the other hand, it confers a high degree of flexibility as the cooperative game over a network can be defined in a variety of ways. This means that many different versions of Shapley value-based centrality can be developed depending on the particular application under consideration, as well as on the features of the network to be analyzed. As a prominent example, in which a specific Shapley value-based\n1 We note that other division schemes or power indices from cooperative game theory can also serve as a good solution.\n38\ncentrality measure is developed that is crafted to a particular application, consider the work of Suri and Narahari [2010] who study the problem of selecting the top-k nodes in a social network. This problem is relevant in all those applications where the key issue is to choose a group of nodes that together have the biggest influence on the entire network. These include, for example, the analysis of co-authorship networks, the diffusion of information, and viral marketing. As a new approach to this problem, Suri and Narahari define a cooperative game in which the value of any group of nodes is equal to the number of nodes within, and adjacent to, the group. In other words, it is assumed that the agents’ sphere of influence reaches the immediate neighbors of the group. Whereas the definition of the game is a natural extension of the (group) degree centrality discussed above, the Shapley value of nodes in this game constitutes a new centrality metric that is, arguably, qualitatively better than standard degree centrality as far as the node’s influence is concerned. The intuition behind it is visible even in our small network in Figure 4.1. In terms of influence, node v1 is more important than v2, because it is the only node that is connected to v4 and v5. Without v1 it is impossible to influence v3 and v4, while each neighbor of v2 is accessible from some other node. Thus, unlike standard degree centrality, which evaluates v1 and v2 equally, the centrality based on the Shapley value of the game defined bySuri and Narahari recognizes this difference in influence and assigns a higher value to v1 than to v2.\nUnfortunately, despite the advantages of Shapley value-based centrality over conventional approaches, efficient algorithms to compute it have not yet been developed. Indeed, given a network GpV,Eq, where V is the set of nodes and E the set of edges, using the original Shapley value formula involves computing the marginal contribution of every node to every coalition which is Op2|V |q. Such an exponential computation is clearly prohibitive for bigger networks (of, e.g, 100 or 1000 nodes). For such networks, the only feasible approach currently outlined in the literature is Monte-Carlo sampling [Suri and Narahari, 2010, Castro et al., 2009]. However, this method is not only inexact, but can be also very time-consuming (see Section 4.4).\nThe computational challenges are hard to overcome, but fortunately in this dissertation we develop the number of algorithms allowing to compute game-theoretic centralities in polynomial time."

These measured introduced by Everett and Borgatti [1999] are the natural extension of standard centralities (Section 2.7) to evaluate group of nodes. Everett and Borgatti introduced three requirements that group centrality should meet. Firstly, these metrics should\n39\nbe build upon existing concepts of centralities. Secondly, the group centrality applied to the group containing a single individual should yield the same result as standard centrality of this individual. Finally, the group centrality must stem from the relationships between individuals, not between groups. In other words, the value of the group C Ď V of nodes is an intrinsic property of this group and its relationships, and the other group of nodes has no impact on it as long as the relationships of C are not changed.\nDefinition 20 (Group centrality). For a given graph G “ pV,Eq the group centrality is a function cg : 2V Ñ R that for each subset of nodes C Ď V determines the importance of this group measured in real value.\nNow, the extension of degree, centrality (Definition 15) is:\nDefinition 21 (Group degree centrality). For a given graph G “ pV,Eq and a group of nodes C Ď V group degree centrality is a function cgd : 2V Ñ R:\ncgdpCq “ degpCq\nwhere degpCq is a degree of the set C (see Section 2.6).\nThe extension of betweenness centrality (Definition 16) is:\nDefinition 22 (Group betweenness centrality).

For a given graph G “ pV,Eq and a group of nodes C Ď V closeness centrality is a function cgc : 2V Ñ R:\ncgcpCq “ ÿ\nsRC dpC, sq\nwhere distpC, sq is a distance between group C and node s (see Section 2.6).\n40\nIn this dissertation, we will be looking at cooperative games on graphs, with the set of players V for some pV,Eq “ G P G , where G is an infinite set of all graphs.2 A coalition of players C will simply be any subset of C Ď V . The characteristic function, νG P VG, will be any function νG : 2V pGq Ñ R, but in this work we focus on the group centralities, so we have νG “ cg. For the purposes of defining a cooperative game on any network, we will systematically associate characteristic functions with graphs through representation functions.\nDefinition 24 (Representation function). A representation function is a function ψ : G Ñ VG that maps every graph G “ pV,Eq onto a cooperative game pN, νGq P VG with N “ V .\nNow, solution concepts like Shapley value can be used in the network setting by applying\nthem to the characteristic function that a network represents.\nDefinition 25 (Game-theoretic centrality measure). Formally, we define a game-theoretic centrality measure as a pair pψ, φq consisting of a representation function ψ and a solution concept φ.\nExample 5. Let us consider a game-theoretic centrality measure pψB, φSV q. We say that ψB is a representation function since it associates a coalitional game with any graph G “ pV,Eq, i.e. every graph represents a cooperative game. We have ψBpGq “ pV, νGq, where V is the set of nodes and νG : 2V Ñ R is the characteristic function. Let νG be the ranking of groups of nodes in G based on group betweenness centrality. In other words, ψB is simply the group betweenness cgb centrality for any graph. For a specific graph G, the importance of each node u P V according to pψB, φSV q is evaluated by the Shapley value of the game ψBpGq, i.e. φSV pνGq. Since we started off with a well-known centrality measure (betweenness centrality) and applied a game-theoretic solution concept to it (the Shapley value), we call the resulting centrality measure a game-theoretic extension of betweenness centrality, or the Shapley-value based betweenness centrality.\nThe algorithms presented in the next section are designed for the generalization of the\nfollowing two game-theoretic centralities.\nDefinition 26 (Shapley-value based degree centrality).

It is simply the Shapley-value based degree centrality. g2 In this game the value of coalition C is a function of its own size and of the number of nodes\nthat are immediately reachable in at least k different ways from C. This game is inspired by Bikhchandani et al. [1992] and is an instance of the general threshold model introduced by Kempe et al. [2005]. It has a natural interpretation: an agent “becomes influenced” (with ideas, information, marketing message, etc.) only if at least k of his neighbors have already become influenced. g3 This game concerns weighted graphs (unlike g1 and g2). Here, the value of coalition C\ndepends on its size and on the set of all nodes within a cutoff distance of C, as measured by the shortest path lengths on the weighted graph. g4 This game generalizes g3 by allowing the value of C to be an arbitrary non-increasing\nfunction fp.q of the distance between C and the other nodes in the network. The intuition here is that the coalition has more influence on closer nodes than on those further away—a property that cannot be expressed with the standard closeness centrality. Thus, g4 is the Shapley-value based closeness centrality. g5 The last game is an extension of g2 to the case of weighted networks. Here, the value of C\ndepends on the adjacent nodes that are connected to the coalition with weighted edges whose sum exceeds a given threshold wcutoff (recall that in g2 this threshold is defined simply by the integer k). Whereas in g3 and g4 weights on edges are interpreted as distance, in g5 they should be interpreted as a power of influence.\nThe relationships among all five games are graphically presented in Figure 4.2.\n42\nThe computation of the Shapley value for each of the above five games (see Table 4.1 for an overview) is the main focus of the paper by Michalak et al. [2013a]. In this dissertation we skip the technical part of constructing algorithms, and instead of this, for each game we present the extensive evaluation."

      "text" : "Let GpV,Eq be an unweighted, undirected network. The characteristic function is defined as:\nψ1pGqpCq “ ν1pCq “ νgdpCq ` |C|\n.\nThe above game was applied by Suri and Narahari [2010] to find out influential nodes in social networks and it was shown to deliver very promising results concerning the target set selection problem (see Kempe et al. [2003]). It is therefore desired to compute the Shapley values of all nodes for this game. We shall now present an exact algorithm for this computation rather than obtaining results through Monte Carlo simulation as was done by Suri and Narahari.\nIn more detail, to evaluate the Shapley value of node v, consider all possible permutations of the nodes in which v would make a positive marginal contribution to the coalition of nodes occurring before itself. Let the set of nodes occurring before node v in a random permutation of nodes be denoted Pπpvq. Let the neighbours of node v in the graph GpV,Eq be denoted Npvq and the degree of node v be denoted degpvq.\n43\nThe key question to ask is: what is the necessary and sufficient condition for node v to marginally contribute node u P Npvq Y tvu to fringepPπpvqq? Clearly, this happens if and only if neither u nor any of its neighbours are present in Pπpvq. Formally, pNpuqYtvuqXPπpvq “ H.\nNow we are going to show that the above condition holds with probability 1 1`degpuq .\nProposition 1. The probability that in a random permutation none of the vertices from Npuq Y tuu occurs before v, where v and u are neighbours, is 1\n1`degpuq .\nProof. We need to count the number of permutations that satisfy:\n@nPpNpvqYtuuqπpvq ă πpnq. (4.1)\nTo this end:\n— Let us choose |pNpuq Y tuu| positions in the sequence of all elements from V . We can do this in\n` |V | 1`degpuq ˘ ways.\n— Then, in the last degpuq chosen positions, place all elements from pNpuq Y tuuqztvu. Directly before these, place the element v. The number of such line-ups is pdegpuqq!. — The remaining elements can be arrange in p|V | ´ p1` degpuqq! different ways.\nAll in all, the number of permutations satisfying condition (4.1) is:\n` |V | 1`degpuq ˘ pdegpuqq!p|V | ´ p1` degpuqq! “ |V |! 1`degpuq ;\nthus, the probability that one of such permutations is randomly chosen is 1 1`degpuq .\n44\nAlgorithm 1: Computing the Shapley value for Game 1\nInput: Unweighted graph GpV,Eq Output: Shapley values of all nodes in V for game g1\n1 foreach v P V do 2 φSVv “ 11`degpvq ; 3 foreach u P Npvq do 4 φSVv ` “ 11`degpuq ; 5 end 6 end 7 return φSV ;\nIt is possible to derive some intuition from the above algorithm. If a node has a high degree, the number of terms in its Shapley value summation above is also high. But the terms themselves will be inversely related to the degree of neighboring nodes. This gives the intuition that a node will have high centrality not only when its degree is high, but also whenever its degree tends to be higher in comparison to the degree of its neighboring nodes. In other words, power comes from being connected to those who are powerless, a fact that is well-recognized by the centrality literature [Bonacich, 1987]. Following the same reasoning, we can also easily predict how dynamic changes to the network, such as adding or removing an edge, would influence the Shapley value.3 Adding an edge between a powerful and a powerless node will add even more power to the former and will decrease the power of the latter. Naturally, removing an edge would have the reverse effect.\nAlgorithm 1 cycles through all nodes and through their neighbours, so its running time is Op|V | ` |E|q. Finally, we note that Algorithm 1 can be adopted to directed graphs with a couple of simple modifications. Specifically, in order to capture how many nodes we can access a given node from, the degree of a node should be replaced with indegree. Furthermore, a set of neighbours of a given node v should consist of those nodes to which an edge is directed from v."

Intuitively, in this model each node can become active if a monotone activation function reaches some threshold. The instance of this problem has been proposed by Goyal et al. [2010], where the authors introduced a method of learning influence probabilities in social networks (from users’ action logs). However, in many realistic situations much less information is available about a network so it is not possible to assess specific probabilities with which individual nodes become active. Consequently, much simpler models are studied. Bikhchandani et al. [1992], for instance, “consider a teenager deciding whether or not to try drugs. A strong motivation for trying out drugs is the fact that friends are doing so. Conversely, seeing friends reject drugs could help persuade the teenager to stay clean”. This situation is modelled by the second game; the threshold for each node is k and the activation function is fpSq “ |S|. Another example is viral marketing or innovation diffusion analysis. Again, in this application, it is often assumed that an agent will “be influenced” only if at least k of his neighbors have already been convinced by Valente [1996]. Note that this game reduces to game g1 for k “ 1. Although this game is a generalization of game g1, it can still be solved to obtain the Shapley values of all nodes in Op|V | ` |E|q time, as formalised by Algorithm 2. An even more general formulation of the game is possible by allowing k to be a function of the agent, i.e., each node v P V is assigned its own unique attribute kpvq. This translates to an application of the form: agent i is convinced if and only if at least kv of his neighbors are convinced, which is a frequently used model in the literature [Valente, 1996].\n46\nThe above argument does not use the fact that k is constant across all nodes. So this generalized formulation can be solved by a simple modification to the original Shapley value expression:\nSV pvq “ kpvq 1` degpvq ` ÿ\nuPNpvq\n1` degpuq ´ kpuq degpuqp1` degpuqq .\nThe above equation (which is also implementable in Op|V | ` |E|q time) assumes that kpvq ď 1`degpvq for all nodes v P V . This condition can be assumed without loss of generality because all cases can still be modelled (we set kpvq “ 1 ` degpvq for the extreme case where node v is never convinced no matter how many of its neighbors are already convinced).\nFinally, we note that Algorithm 2 can be adapted to a case of directed graphs along the same\nlines as Algorithm 1."

      "text" : "Hitherto, our games have been confined to unweighted networks. But in many applications, it is necessary to model real-world networks as weighted graphs. For example, in the co-authorship network mentioned in the introduction, each edge is often assigned a weight proportional to the number of joint publications the corresponding authors have produced [Newman, 2001].\nThis subsection extends game g1 to the case of weighted networks. Whereas game g1 equates νpCq to the number of nodes located within one hop of some node inC, our formulation in this subsection equates νpCq to the number of nodes located within a distance dcutoff of some node in C. Here, distance between two nodes is measured as the length of the shortest path between the nodes in the given weighted graph G “ pV,E, λq (see Definition 13) Formally, we define game g3, where for each coalition C Ď V pGq,\nψ3pGqpCq “ ν3pCq “\n$ &\n%\n0 if C “ H\n|tv : distpC, uq ď dcutoff u| otherwise.\nClearly, g3 can be used in all the settings where g1 is applicable; for instance, in the diffusion of information in social networks or to analyse research collaboration networks [Suri and Narahari, 2010]. Moreover, as a more general game, g3 provides additional modelling opportunities. For instance, Suri and Narahari suggest that a “more intelligent” way for sieving nodes in the neighbourhood would improve their algorithm for solving the target selection problem (top-k problem). Now, g3 allows us to define a different cutoff distance for each node in Suri and Narahari’s setting. Furthermore, g3 is a specific case of the more general model g4 which will be discussed in next subsection.\n47\nAlgorithm 3: Computing the Shapley value for Game 3\nInput: Weighted graph G “ pV,E, λq, dcutoff ą 0 Output: Shapley value of all nodes in G for game g3\n1 foreach v P V pGq do 2 DistanceVector D = Dijkstra(v,G); 3 extNeighbors(v) =H; extDegree(v) = 0; 4 foreach u P V pGq such that u ‰ v do 5 if Dpuq ď dcutoff then 6 extNeighbors(v).push(u); 7 extDegree(v)++; 8 end 9 end\n10 end 11 foreach v P V pGq do 12 φSVv “ 11`extDegreepvq ; 13 foreach u P extNeighborspvq do 14 φSVv ` “ 11`extDegreepuq ; 15 end 16 end 17 return φSV ;\nBefore we propose an algorithm, we need to introduce some extra notation. Define the extended neighborhood Npv, dcutoff q “ tu ‰ v : distpv, uq ď dcutoff u, i.e., the set of all nodes whose distance from v is at most dcutoff . Denote the size of NGpv, dcutoff q by degpv, dcutoff q.\nAlgorithm 3 works as follows: for each node v in the network GpV,Eq, the extended neighborhood Npv, dcutoff q and its size degpv, dcutoff q are first computed using Dijkstra’s algorithm in Op|E| ` |V |log|V |q time [Cormen, 2001]. The results are then used to compute Shapley value, which takes maximum time Op|V |2q. In practice this step runs much faster because the worst case situation only occurs when every node is reachable from every other node within dcutoff . Overall the complexity is Op|V ||E| ` |V |2log|V |q. Furthermore, to deal with directed graphs we need to redefine the notion of extDegree and extNeighbors for a given node u in Algorithm 3. The former will be the number of vertices from which the distance to u is smaller than, or equal to, dcutoff . The latter will be the set of nodes whose distance from u is at most dcutoff .\nFinally, we make the observation that the the above algorithm does not depend on dcutoff being constant across all nodes. Indeed, each node v P V pGq may be assigned its own unique value dcutoff pvq, where νpCq would be the number of agents v who are within a distance dcutoff pvq from C. For this case, the above proof gives:\n48\nφSVv “ ÿ\nu:distpv,uq ďdcutoff puq\n1\n1` degpu, dcutoff puqq ."

In game g3, all agents at distances dagent ď dcutoff contributed equally to the value of a coalition. However, this assumption may not always hold true because in some applications we intuitively expect agents closer to a coalition to contribute more to its value. For instance, we expect a Facebook user to exert more influence over his immediate circle of friends than over “friends of friends”, even though both may satisfy the dcutoff criterion. Similarly, we expect a virus-affected computer to infect a neighboring computer more quickly than a computer two hops away.\nIn general, we expect that an agent at distance d from a coalition would contribute fpdq to its value, where fp.q is a positive valued decreasing function of its argument.

      "text" : "In this section, we discuss different approximation techniques to compute the Shapley value from the literature. Generally speaking, they can be divided into three groups—each referring to a specific subclass of coalitional games under consideration:\n1. First, let us consider the method proposed by Fatima et al. [2007] and elaborated further by\nFatima et al. [2008]. This approach concerns weighted voting games. In these games, each player has a certain number of votes (or in other words, a weight). A coalition is “winning” if the number of votes in this coalition exceeds some specific threshold, or “losing” otherwise. Fatima et al. propose the following method to approximate the Shapley value in weighted voting games. Instead of finding marginal contributions of players to all 2n coalitions, the authors consider only n randomly-selected coalitions, one of each size (i.e., from 1 to n). Only for these n coalitions are the player’s expected marginal contributions calculated and the average of these contributions yields an approximation of the Shapley value. Whereas Fatima et al. method is certainly attractive, it is only applicable to games in which the value of a coalition depends on the sum of associated weights being in some bounds. This is not the case for our games g1 to g4.5 2. Another method was proposed by Bachrach et al. [2008] in the context of simple coalitional\ngames 6 in which the characteristic function is binary—i.e., each coalition has a value of either zero or one. For these games, Bachrach et al. extend the approach suggested by Mann and Shapley 1960 and provide more rigorous statistical analysis. In particular, Mann and Shapley described the Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the Shapley value from a random sample of coalitions. Bachrach at al. use this technique to compute the Banzhaf power index and then they suggested using a random sample of permutations of all players in order to compute the Shapley-Shubik index for simple coalitional games.7 The computation of the confidence interval, which is crucial in such an approach, hinges upon the binary form of the characteristic function for simple coalitional games. This method is more general than the one proposed by Fatima et al. [2007]—as weighted voting games are a subset of simple coalitional games—but still it cannot be effectively used for our games g1 to g4, where the characteristic functions are not binary.\n5 Recall that our approximation algorithm for g5 builds upon Fatima et al. method. This is because in this game the marginal contribution of each node depends on the weights assigned to its incident edges.\n6 Note that weighted voting games are simple coalitional games. 7 The Shapley-Shubik index is a very well-known application of the Shapley value that evaluates the power\nof individuals in voting [Shapley and Shubik, 1954].\n54\nAlgorithm 6: Monte Carlo method to approximate the Shapley value\nInput: ˛ Characteristic function v, maximum iteration maxIter\nOutput: Aproximation of Shapley value for game v\n1 for v P V do 2 φSVv “ 0 ; 3 end 4 for i “ 1 to maxIter do 5 shuffle(V ); 6 Marginal Contribution block 7 P =H ; 8 for v P V do 9 φSVv ` “ νpP Y tvuq ´ νpP q ;\n10 P “ P Y tvu ; 11 end 12 13 end 14 for v P V do 15 φSVv “ φSVv maxIter\n; 16 end 17 return φSVv ;\n3. Unlike the first two methods, the last method described by Castro et al. [2009] can be\nefficiently applied to all coalitional games in characteristic function game form, assuming that the worth of every coalition can be computed in polynomial time. Here, approximating the Shapley value involves generating permutations of all players and computing the marginal contribution of each player to the set of players occurring before it. The solution precision increases (statistically) with every new permutation analysed. Furthermore, the authors show how to estimate the appropriate size of a permutation sample in order to guarantee a low error. Given its broad applicability, this method is used in our simulations as a comparison benchmark."

Recall that, in this game, node vi makes a positive contribution to coalition P through itself and through some adjacent node u under two conditions. Firstly, neither vi nor u are in P . Secondly, there is no edge from P to vi or u. To check for these conditions in Algorithm 6 we store those nodes that have already contributed to the value of coalition P in an array called: Counted. For each node vi, the algorithm iterates through the set of its neighbours and for each adjacent node it checks whether this adjacent node is counted in the array Counted. If not, the marginal contribution of the node vi is increased by one.\nAlgorithm 7: Marginal Contribution block of Algorithm 6 for g2 CountedÐ false ; EdgesÐ 0 ; foreach v P V pGq do\nforeach u P NGpvq Y tvu do Edges[u]++ ; if !Counted[u] and ( Edges[u] ě k[u] or u “ v ) then\nφSVv Ð φSVv ` 1; Counted[u] = true ;\nend end\nend\nAlgorithm 8: Marginal Contribution block of Algorithm 6 for g3 CountedÐ false ; foreach v P V pGq do\nforeach u P extNeighborspvq Y tvu do if !Counted[u] then\nφSVv Ð φSVv ` 1; Counted[u] = true ;\nend end\nend\nFor the rest of the games considered in this chapter the Marginal Contribution block of Algorithm 6 takes a slightly different form. We have explained the functioning of this block for g1. Now, we discuss this block for the remaining four games. In particular: 8 Recall that the characteristic functions v1, v2, . . . , v5 correspond to games g1, g2, . . . , g5, respectively.\n56\nAlgorithm 9: Marginal Contribution block of Algorithm 6 for g4 distÐ infinity ; foreach v P V pGq do\nforeach u P V pGq do if D[u] < dist[u] then\nφSVv Ð φSVv ` fpDrusq ´ fpdistrusq; dist[u] = D[u] ;\nend end φSVv Ð φSVv ` fpdistrusq ´ fp0q; dist[v] = 0 ;\nend\nAlgorithm 10: Marginal Contribution block of Algorithm 6 for g5 CountedÐ false ; WeightsÐ 0 ; foreach v P V pGq do\nforeach u P NGpvq Y tvu do weights[u]+= λpv, uq; if !Counted[u] and ( weights[u] ěWcutoff puq or u “ v ) then\nφSVv Ð φSVv ` 1; Counted[u] = true ;\nend end\nend\ng2: Here, node v makes a positive contribution to a coalition P both through itself and through\nsome adjacent node u also under two conditions. Firstly, neither v nor u are in P . Secondly, there is less than k edges from P to v and there is exactly k ´ 1 edges from P to u. In order to check the first condition in Algorithm 7 we use the array Counted, and to check the second one, we use the array Edges. For each node vi, the algorithm iterates through the set of its neighbours and for each adjacent node it checks whether this adjacent node meets these two conditions. If so, then the marginal contribution of the node v is increased by one.\ng3{4: In Marginal Contribution blocks for games g3 and g4 (Algorithms 8 and 9), all the values\nthat are dependent on the distance (extNeighbours and D) are calculated using Dijkstra’s algorithm and stored in memory. These pre-computations allow us to significantly speed up Monte Carlo methods. Now, in g3 node v makes a positive contribution to coalition P through itself and through some adjacent node u under two conditions. Firstly, neither v nor u are in P . Secondly, there is no edge length of dcutoff from P to v or u. To check for these conditions in Algorithm 8 we again use the array Counted. For each node v, the\n57\nalgorithm iterates through the set of its extended neighbours and for each of them it checks whether this neighbour meets the conditions. If so, the marginal contribution of the node v is increased by one. In game g4, node v makes a positive contribution to coalition P through each node (including itself) that is closer to vi than to P . In Algorithm 9 we use array Dist to store distances from coalition P to all nodes in the graph and arrayD to store all distances from v to all other nodes. For each node vi, the algorithm iterates through all nodes in the graph, and for each node u, if the distance from v to u is smaller than from P to u, the algorithm computes the marginal contribution as fpDrusq´fpDistrusq. The value Distrus is then updated to Drus—this is a new distance from P to u. g5: In game g5, which is an extension of g2 to weighted graphs, node v makes a positive\ncontribution to coalition P (both through itself and through some adjacent node u) under two conditions. Firstly, neither v nor u are in P . Secondly, the sum of weights on edges from P to v is less than Wcutoff pviq and the sum of weights on edges from P to u is greater than, or equal to, Wcutoff puq ´ λpv, uq and smaller than Wcutoff pviq ` λpv, uq. In order to check the first condition in Algorithm 10 we use the arrayCounted, and to check the second one, we use the array Weights. For each node vi, the algorithm iterates through the set of its neighbours and for each adjacent node it checks whether this adjacent node meets these two conditions. If so, then the marginal contribution of the node v is increased by one.\nSome details of how Algorithm 6 is applied to generate the Shapley value approximations for games g1 to g4, for which we propose exact polynomial solutions, differ from g5, for which we developed an approximate solution. Specifically, for games g1 to g4:\n1. We use the exact algorithm proposed in this chapter to compute the Shapley value. 2. Then, we run Monte Carlo simulations 30 times.9 In every run:\n— We perform maxIter Monte Carlo iterations. — After every five iterations, we compare the approximation of the Shapley value obtained\nvia Monte Carlo simulation with the exact Shapley value obtained with our algorithm.\n— We record the algorithm’s runtime and the error, where the error is defined as the\nmaximum discrepancy between the actual Shapley value and the Monte Carlo-based approximation of the Shapley value.\n3. Finally, we compute the confidence interval using all iterations (0.95% confidence level).10\nIn the case of game g5 we cannot determine the exact Shapley value for larger networks. Therefore, we performed two levels of simulation: one level on small networks and one level on large networks. Specifically:\n9 For the purpose of comparison to our method, it suffices to use 30 iterations, as the standard errors converge significantly to indicate the magnitude of the cost of using the Monte Carlo method.\n10 Since for g4 each Monte Carlo iteration is relatively time consuming, we run it only once; thus, no confidence interval is generated, i.e., the third step is omitted.\n58\n1. For small networks, we generate 30 random instances of weighted complete graphs with\n6 nodes (denoted K6) and the same number of graphs with 12 nodes (denoted K12) with weights drawn from a uniform distribution Up0, 1q. Then, for each graph and each of the two parameters Wcutoff pvq “ 14αpvq and Wcutoff pvq “ 3 4 αpvq:11 — We compute the exact Shapley value using formula (6). — Then, we run our approximation algorithm and determine the error in our approximation. — Finally, we run 2000 and 6000 Monte Carlo iterations for K6 and K12, respectively. 2. For large networks, we again generate 30 random instances of weighted complete graphs,\nbut now with 1000 nodes (we denote them K1000). Then, for each graph and each of the three parameters Wcutoff pvq “ 14αpvq, Wcutoff pvq “ 2 4 αpvq, and Wcutoff pvq “ 34αpvq): — We run our approximation algorithm for the Shapley value. — Then, we run the fixed number (200000) of Monte Carlo iterations. — Finally, we compute how the Monte Carlo solution converges to the results of our\napproximation algorithm.\nHaving described the simulation setup, we will now discuss the data sets and, finally, the\nsimulation results."

The dotted line shows the performance of our exact algorithm which needs 0.43ms to compute the Shapley value. In contrast, generating any reasonable Monte Carlo result takes a substantially longer time (the solid line shows the average and the shaded area depicts the confidence interval for Monte Carlo simulations). In particular, it takes on average more than 200ms to achieve a 20% error and more than 2000ms are required to guarantee a 5% error (which is more than 4600 times slower than our exact algorithm).\nFigures 4.4 - 4.6 concern game g2 for different values of k (k “ 2, ki “ degi2 , and ki “ 3 4 degi, respectively, where degi is the degree of node vi).13 The advantage of our exact algorithm over Monte Carlo simulation is again exponential.\nReplacing the distance threshold dcutoff with a hop threshold kcutoff enables game g3 to be played on an unweighted network. Thus, similarly to games g1 and g2, we test it on the Western States Power Grid. The results are shown on Figures 4.7 and 4.8 for kcutoff being equal to 2 and 3, respectively. The third game is clearly more computationally challenging than g1 and g2 (note that the vertical axis is in seconds instead of milliseconds). Now, our exact algorithm takes\n13 Recall that in g2 the meaning of parameter k is as follows: the value of coalition C depends on the number of nodes in the network with at least k neighbours in C.\n60\n13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n13.03 s\nMaximal allowable MC error (%)\nMonte Carlo solution Our exact solution\nFigure 4.8: g3, kcutoff “ 3, WSPG (UW)\nabout 13s to complete. The much lower speedups of the exact methods with respect to Monte Carlo approach stem from the fact that both algorithms have to start with Dijkstra’s algorithm. Although this algorithm has to be run only once in both cases it takes more than 12.5s for the considered network. This means that the exact solution is slower by orders of magnitude (compared to games g1 and g2). The Monte Carlo approach is also slower, but this slowdown is much less significant in relative terms.\nFigures 4.9 and 4.10 show the performance of the algorithms for game g3 on the astrophysics collaboration network that, unlike the Western States Power Grid, is a weighted network. We observe that increasing the value of dcutoff (here from dcutoff “ davg8 to dcutoff “ davg 4 ) significantly worsens the performance of the Monte Carlo-based algorithm. This is because the increasing number of nodes that have to be taken into account while computing marginal contributions (see the inner loop in Algorithm 8) is not only more time consuming, but also increases the Monte Carlo error.\nFor game g4 the performance of algorithms is shown in Figures 4.11 - 4.13 (for fpdq “ 11`d , fpdq “ 1\n1`d2 and fpdq “ e ´d, respectively). Whereas the Monte Carlo methods for the first\nthree games are able to achieve a reasonable error bound in seconds or minutes, for the fourth game it takes more than 40 hours to approach 50% error. This is because the inner loop of the Marginal Contribution block (see Algorithm 9) iterates over all nodes in the network. Due to the time consuming performance we run the simulations only once. Interestingly, we observe that the error of the Monte Carlo method sometimes increases slightly when more iterations are performed. This confirms that the error of the Monte Carlo method to approximate the Shapley value proposed in Castro et al. [2009] is only statistically decreasing in time. Certain new randomly chosen permutations can actually increase the error.\nFigures 4.14, 4.15, 4.16 and 4.17 present comparisons of our approximation algorithm for game g5 against Monte Carlo sampling for small networks (for which the exact Shapley value can be computed from the Definition 5)).

As previously, the solid line shows the average, and the shaded area depicts the confidence interval for the Monte Carlo simulations. We see in Figures 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16 that the approximation error in our proposed algorithm is well-contained for small networks. Specifically, for K6 it is about 10%; whereas for the bigger network K12 it is about 5%. However, we notice that, for higher values of Wcutoff , the Monte Carlo method may slightly outperform our solution. See in Figure 4.15 how the average approximation error of the Monte Carlo sampling achieved in 0.38ms is lower than the average error achieved by our method. Already for K12 this effect does not occur (see Figure 4.17).\nFor large networks, where the exact Shapley value cannot be obtained, we are naturally unable to compute exact approximation error. We believe that this error may be higher than the values obtained forK6 andK12. However, the mixed strategy, that we discussed in Section 4.3.5 and that uses our approximation only for large degree vertices, should work towards containing the error within practical tolerance bounds. As far as we believe that Monte Carlo gives good results, from Figure 4.18, we can infer that our approximation solution for large networks gives good results (within 5%) and is at least two times faster than the Monte Carlo algorithm.\nTo summarise, our exact solutions outperform Monte Carlo simulations even if relatively wide error margins are allowed. However, this is not always the case for our approximation algorithm for game g5. Furthermore, it should be underlined that if the centrality metrics under consideration cannot be described with any of the games g1 to g4 for which exact algorithms are now available, then Monte Carlo simulations are still a viable option."

In this chapter, we extend the standard definition of betweenness centrality and propose a family of game-theoretic measures based on Semivalues—a large family of solution concepts from cooperative game theory that include, among others, the Shapley value and the Banzhaf power index. The key advantage of the game-theoretic betweenness centrality over the standard measure is the ability to rank nodes while taking into account any synergies that may exist in different groups of nodes. We develop polynomial time algorithms to compute the Semivalue-based betweenness centrality in general, and the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality in particular, both in weighted and unweighted graphs. Interestingly, for the unweighted case, our algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based centrality has the same complexity as the best known algorithm due to Brandes [2001] for computing the standard betweenness centrality. The new measures are evaluated in simulated scenario where simultaneous node failures occur. Compared to the standard measure, the ranking obtained by our measures reflects more accurately the influence that different nodes have on the functionality of the network. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms on weighted and unweighted random scale-free graphs, and on two real network: an email communication network, and the neural system of C. elegans. This evaluation shows that our algorithms are significantly faster than the fastest alternative from the literature.\nAll algorithms, experiments and theorems presented in this chapter are an exclusive\ncontribution of the author of this thesis."

      "heading" : "5.1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Betweenness centrality is a measure of control introduced independently by Anthonisse [1971] and Freeman [1979], which aims to determine the importance of a given node in the context of network flow. More specifically, in its standard form, betweenness centrality considers all shortest paths that pass through the node. The more shortest paths go through the node, the more important is the role of this node in the network.\n65\nBetweenness centrality (Definition 16) is one of the classical measures of centrality in network analysis, with the other measures being degree centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality (see Section 2.7). Several applications of betweenness centrality have been considered in the literature [Puzis et al., 2007b, Dolev et al., 2010]. It has also been implemented in numerous software tools for network analysis [Brandes, 2008]. Furthermore, a variety of extensions of betweenness centrality have been proposed in order to suit the needs of particular applications. For instance, a well-known community detection algorithm by Girvan and Newman [2002] is based on edge betweenness centrality.\nOne of the characteristics of betweenness centrality, as well as the other classical centrality measures, is that it focuses on the role played by each node individually. However, such an approach can be inadequate if there exist non-negligible positive or negative synergies between nodes when their role is considered in groups. Simply put, classical centrality measures are not able to account for such synergies.\nTo address this problem, Everett and Borgatti [1999] introduced group centrality (see Definition 22). While group centrality measures have the advantage of taking synergies into account, these measures have their own shortcomings. Specifically, they produce a ranking of an exponential number of groups, which is hard to maintain in memory, and hard to reason about, as it is not obvious how to extract meaningful conclusions from so many groups. What would\n66\nbe more manageable is to produce a ranking of the nodes themselves, based on the ranking of all possible groups. The answer to it was given in the previous chapter where game-theoretic centrality measures was introduced (Definition 25).\nA potential downside of game-theoretic network centralities is that many methods from cooperative game theory are computationally challenging. For instance, given a coalitional game defined over a network of |V | nodes, a straight-forward computation of the Shapley value requires considering all possible 2|V | coalitions (i.e., groups) of nodes. This is clearly prohibitive for networks with hundreds, or even tens, of nodes. Indeed, it has been shown that in some cases the exponential number of computations cannot be avoided, i.e., it is impossible to compute particular game-theoretic network centralities in time polynomial in the size of the network.\nFortunately, the positive computational results have been given in the previous chapter where we analysed various game-theoretic extensions of degree and closeness centrality and showed that sometimes it is possible to leverage the fact that the synergies in coalitions depend on the topology of the network. As a result, it was showed that some game-theoretic centrality measures are indeed computable in polynomial time.\nNevertheless, the aforementioned positive results concerned solely the extensions of degree and closeness centralities which are, in general, computationally less challenging than betweenness centrality. In fact, no game-theoretic extension of betweenness centrality has been developed to date.\nIn this chapter, we fill the above gap in the literature by proposing and analysing the computational aspects of the game-theoretic betweenness centrality. This is the first game-theoretic centrality that is based on Semivalues—a family of generalisations of the Shapley value that offer a wider spectrum of ways in which the role of nodes within various groups can be evaluated.\nAs our main contribution, we propose polynomial time algorithms to compute both the Shapley value-based and Semivalue-based betweenness centralities, for weighted graphs as well as unweighted graphs. Surprisingly, as shown in Table 5.1, for the unweighted case, our algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based centrality has the same complexity as the best known algorithm due to Brandes [2001] for computing the standard betweenness centrality, i.e., Op|V ||E|q, where V is the set of nodes and E set of edges in the network. Moreover, for Semivalues which are, in general, more computationally challenging than the Shapley value, the running time of our algorithm is Op|V |2|E|q (for the unweighted graphs). We consider three applications of the new centrality measures. The first one concerns the protection of computer network against Spyware—the malicious computer programs, the second example is about the issue of measuring systemic importance of financial institutions [European Central Bank, 2010]. Under certain assumptions, the Shapley value- and the\n67\nSemivalue-based centrality measures turn out to be the exact solution to this problem. In the third application we simulate simultaneous node failures in a network. Following Albert et al. [2000] and Holme et al. [2002], among others, we quantify the functionality of the network based on the average inverse geodesic measure. The simulation results show that compared to the standard measure, the cardinal ranking obtained by our measures reflects more accurately the influence that different nodes have on the network functionality."

Now, we discuss the computational properties of the classical betweenness centrality. In particular, the fastest known dedicated algorithm to compute it is due to Brandes [2001]. The algorithm works in Op|V ||E|q time for unweighted graphs, and in Op|V ||E| ` |V |2 logp|V |qq time for weighted graphs, where V is the set of nodes and E set of edges in the network. Furthermore, group betweenness centrality for a pre-defined group of nodes can be computed in Op|V ||E|q time as shown by Brandes [2008]. Puzis et al. [2007b] developed an algorithm to compute group betweenness centrality of a given subset S. The algorithm starts with a preprocessing step (which alone takes Op|V |3q time), and then computes group betweenness centrality in Op|S|3q time.\nTable 5.1 summarises the above complexity results (for betweenness centrality and group betweenness centrality) as well as our computational results (for Shapley-based and Semivalue-based betweenness centralities). As can be seen, our algorithms also run in polynomial time, both for unweighted and weighted graphs. Observe that our algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality for unweighted graphs has the same complexity as the aforementioned algorithm by Brandes [2001] for standard betweenness centrality, which is surprising given the much more complicated nature of our measure.\n68"

In a nutshell, the aim here is to filter the content of a network by installing some anti-spyware software on a chosen set of k nodes. Now, assuming that the majority of the network flow is transmitted through shortest paths, and ignoring the capacities of cables and routers, the best choice is to install the anti-spyware on the set of nodes S Ď V, |S| “ k whose group betweenness centrality cgbpSq (Definition 22) is maximal. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-hard; nonetheless, there exists approximation algorithms to solve it [Puzis et al., 2007a].\nThe solution to the above problem can be used to guide the efforts to protect the most important nodes against a potential spyware attack. However, how to choose the optimal points to protect if we have limited resources and do not known in advance the size of the attack? To model such a situation, let us consider the following scenario. Suppose that nodes in a communication network have been exposed to the possibility of a random spyware infection. The more shortest paths there are that pass through the infected group, the worse it is for the network, because the malicious software may control or monitor the flow. Furthermore, suppose that neither the subset of infected nodes is known nor the size of the attack (i.e., the number of infected nodes). Assuming that the administrators’ resources are limited and that the malicious software can be located at any workstation, a decision has to be made on which node to examine first. In other words, we need to identify a node that makes the biggest contribution to the spyware’s ability to monitor the flow going through the infected nodes. Hence, we formalize this problem as follows:\n69\nProblem 1. Given a discrete probability distribution D : t1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , nu Ñ r0, 1s and a random subset S : |S| „ D, which node v P V in the graph G “ pV,Eq maximizes the expression: cgbpSq ´ cgbpSztvuq.\nNow if it was known that exactly one node has been affected by the spyware attack (|S| “ 1) and that the single target was chosen uniformly at random, then the standard betweenness centrality would solve the above problem; the node with the highest such centrality is the solution. However, if there is a possibility that multiple nodes have been infected (|S| ą 1), then the standard betweenness centrality becomes insufficient. This is because betweenness centrality of a group of nodes is not necessarily equal to the sum of betweenness centralities of individual nodes within this group (see Figure 5.2 for an example). In other words, the following does not necessarily hold for every S Ď V :\ncgbpSq “ ÿ\nvPV cbpvq.\nHence, a node v P V that maximizes the expression cgbpSq ´ cgbpSztvuq for some S Ď V does not have to be the one with the highest standard betweenness centrality.\nIn this chapter we propose the polynomial-time exact solution to Problem 1 for a family of\nprobability distributions of choosing the set S.\nMeasuring Systemic Importance of Financial Institutions\nThe crisis of year 2007 and 2008 clearly showed the need for more stringent supervision of financial systems. As a result, a number of systemic risk monitoring and supervisory bodies have been created worldwide: the Financial Stability Oversight Council (USA), the European Systemic Risk Board and the Financial Stability Board. Furthermore, new prudential policies and regulations were laid out. Most notably, the Basel III accords aim at introducing micro- and macro-prudential regulations such as stricter capital reserve ratios, increased audit transparency and more thorough risk management by banks and other financial institutions.\nAt a discretion of supervising authorities, systemically important institutions may be asked to follow additional macro-prudential policies including a combination of capital surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in debt. As stated in the Financial Stability Board’s interim report to G20 leaders, “Financial institutions should be subject to requirements commensurate with the risks they pose to the financial system” [Financial Stability Board, 2010].\nIn this context, betweenness is considered to be the most suitable centrality to measure systemic importance of institutions in the financial system [European Central Bank, 2010]. In more detail, it has the following natural interpretation: “the betweenness of a bankA connecting pairs of nodes in the network is a measure of the dependence of these other banks from A to transfer the loans.” [Gabrieli, 2011]. As a result, the higher betweenness centrality of an\n70\ninstitution is, the more attention and scrutiny it requires. It is feared that in the worst case, even one of the institution with the highest betweenness centrality may be able to bring down the entire system, due to contagion of illiquidity [Freixas et al., 2000].\nHowever, imposing additional capital requirements on financial institutions according to their standard betweenness centrality ignores the fact that financial crises are often ignited not by factors specific to a particular bank but by (combinations of) factors that simultaneously affect possibly many banks in the system. The infamous financial crises of 2009 started with the collapse of the subprime residential mortgage market in the United States and then spread to the rest of the world, due to the exposure to American real estate assets via a complex array of financial derivatives. As a result, many financial institutions in various countries asked for urgent state interventions [Laeven and Valencia, 2010].\nConsequently, it would be desirable to extend betweenness centrality so that it quantifies the betweenness of an individual institution but taking into account its role in various groups of institutions, as they can be affected simultaneously. We formalize this problem as follows:\nProblem 2. Given graph G “ pV,Eq, what is the (cardinal) ranking of nodes that reflects the marginal contribution of an individual node to group betweenness centrality of a random subset of nodes S : |S| „ D, i.e., cgbpSq ´ cgbpSztvuq, where D : t1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , nu Ñ r0, 1s is a discrete probability distribution.\nThis problem extends the Problem 1 in the way, that we consider the whole cardinal ranking of nodes, instead of looking only for the most important individual. In this chapter, we propose the polynomial-time exact solution to Problem 2 for a family of probability distributions D of choosing set S.\nAnalysis of Network Vulnerability\nOne of the extensive research directions on betweenness centrality involves the analysis of network vulnerability [Bompard et al., 2010, Holme et al., 2002]. The aim is to identify (and possibly protect) the most critical nodes, whose removal degrades the functionality of the network the most. In this context, a standard measure used to assess the condition of the network is called the average inverse geodesic measure which, essentially, is a sum of inverse distances between any pair of nodes in the network [Holme et al., 2002, Albert et al., 2000]. Formally:\nIGMpV,Eq “ ÿ\nvPV\nÿ\nv‰uPV\n1\ndpv, uq\nwhere dpu, vq is the distance, i.e., the length of the shortest path, between nodes u and v [Freeman, 1979].\nIn order to formalize the problem of network vulnerability, let us first note that it is possible to reformulate Problem 1 by assuming that we are looking for a set of nodes C Ď V of a\n71\npre-defined size |C| “ c. This set should maximize the expression: cgbpSq ´ cgbpSzCq, where S is a random subset of nodes S Ď V such that l ď |S| ď k.\nNow, we define the problem of network vulnerability as follows:\nProblem 3. Given a discrete probability distribution D : t1, ¨ ¨ ¨ , nu Ñ r0, 1s and a random subset S : |S| „ D, which set of nodes C Ď V of a given size |C| “ c in the graph G “ pV,Eq maximizes the expression: IGMpV zSq ´ IGMpV zpSzCqq.\nwhere IGM stands for the average inverse geodesic measure.\nTo date, standard betweenness centrality has been advocated as an effective approximation that solves Problem 3 [Holme et al., 2002]. However, in Section 5.5, we experimentally show that the game-theoretic betweenness centrality achieves consistently better results than standard betweenness centrality."

      "text" : "In this subsection we will define group betweeness centrality. Firstly, recall that in our approach, we cast a network into the combinatorial structure of a coalitional game. That is, we consider all subsets of the set of nodes V pGq and we define a function that assigns to every such subset a numerical value; this value is in fact the subset’s group betweenness centrality. Formally, borrowing notation from coalitional games, we define a tuple pV pGq, νq, where function ν : 2V pGq Ñ R assigns to each S Ď V pGq the value cgbpSq, and νpHq “ 0. This means that ν returns the group betweenness centrality of any given subset of nodes. Now since pV pGq, νq has the same combinatorial structure as that of a coalitional game, we can use the Shapley\n72\nvalue to quantify the importance of nodes based on the impact their membership makes on group betweenness centrality. In other words, we obtain a measure of centrality of individual nodes which aggregates information about their role in group betweenness centrality across various groups. Formally, the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure is defined as follows:\nDefinition 28 (Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure). Shapley-value based betweenness centrality is a pair pψB, φSV q consisting of a representation function ψBpGq “ cgb that maps each graph to the game with group betweenness centrality and a Shapleu value solution concept φSV .\nExample 6. Consider again nodes v1 and v2 from Figure 5.2. Here:\nφSV1 pV pGq, ψBpGqq “ 18.2 and φSV2 pV pGq, ψBpGqq “ 16.0833.\nUnlike the standard betweenness centrality, the ranking produced by our Shapley-value based betweenness centrality reflects the fact that node v2 has many common shortest paths with v3, while v1 does not.\nIntuitively, the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality measure represents the load placed on a given node, taking into account the role it plays in all possible groups of nodes in the network. Moreover, the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality satisfies the same properties as the Shapley value (see Section 2.2). Let us translate them to the network context:\n1. Symmetry—any two symmetric nodes vi and vj are assigned the same centrality, where symmetry refers here to the fact that the two nodes can be interchanged in any group of nodes\nwithout affecting the group’s betweenness. Formally, if vpS Y tviuq “ vpS Y tvjuq @S Ď V ztvi, vju, then: φSVi “ φSVj ;\n2. Marginality—if a node’s contribution to the group betweenness centrality of each subset of nodes in network G “ pV,Eq is no less than its contribution to the same subset in another network G1 “ pV,E 1q, then its centrality in the former network should be no less than in the latter one. Formally, for every pair of networks, G “ pV,Eq and G1 “ pV,E 1q, and functions νG and νG1 , defined as in equation (22), and for every node vi P V , if\nνGpS Y tviuq ´ νGpSq ě νG1pS Y tviuq ´ νG1pSq, @S Ď V ztviu,\nthen φSVv in G is not smaller than φ SV v in G 1.\n3. Efficiency—this property simply says that the sum of the Shapley value-based betweenness centralities for all the nodes in the network is normalised to 0, i.e., ř\nviPV φ SV i “ 0.1\n1 Note that the group betweenness centrality of the entire network, i.e., of the group S “ V , equals 0.\n73\nNaturally, it is also possible to normalize the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality so it ranges from 0 to 1. To this end, one should use φ SV i\n2 maxviPV cbpviq ` 1 2 . This is because\n@viPV @CĎV pcgbpC Y tviuq ´ cgbpCqq ď cbpviq.\nObserve that the new centrality solves Problem 1 and Problem 2 exactly for a particular\nprobability distribution PD.\nProposition 3. The Shapley value-based betweenness centrality is the exact solution to Problem 1 and Problem 2 in a particular case in which each set S Ď V of size |S| “ k ą 0 is chosen with probability 1\n|V |p|V |k q .\nProof. To show it, it is enough to rewrite formula (2.3) as follows:\nφSVi pV, νq “ 1 |V | ÿ\n1ďkď|V | 1 `|V |´1 k´1 ˘ ÿ\nSĎV |S|“k viPS\npνpSq ´ νpSztviuqq (5.1)\nThe inner sum in the above equation runs through all subsets of nodes containing vi of a given size k, and `|V |´1 k´1 ˘ is the number of such subsets. The first fraction implies that the size k P t1, . . . , nu is chosen uniformly at random. The second fraction implies that out of all subsets of size k, one is chosen uniformly at random.\nFormula (5.1) has the following interpretation in the context of measuring systemic\nimportance of financial institutions:\n1. Fraction 1|V | means that the probability that the financial crises starts with a group of financial\ninstitutions of size |S| “ k is the same for any k (where k P t1, . . . , |V |u). We will denote this probability PDpV, kq.\n2. Fraction 1p|V |´1k´1 q means that the probability that each particular k-sized subset of institutions\ncontaining vi bankrupts is the same.\nWhile the latter implication seems natural, the former implication seems to be a special case. Arguably, it does not seem natural to assume that the probability of a single institution bankruptcy is exactly the same as the probability of having all institutions bankrupted (especially if the network is very large). To relax this assumption, we need to change the fraction 1|V | in equation (5.1). However, this fraction is inherent in the Shapley value. As such, modifying it requires adopting Semivalues as a centrality measure. In the next section, we show how this can be done.\n74"

Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measure is a pair pψB, φSEMI q consisting of a representation function ψBpGq “ cgb that maps each graph to the game with group betweenness centrality and a Semivalue φSEMI .\nWe observe that the above family of Semivalue-based betweenness centrality measures inherits from Semivalues the properties of symmetry and marginality. Naturally, particular centralities may satisfy additional properties inherited from the corresponding solution concepts in coalitional games. For instance, it is not difficult to see that, similarly to the Banzhaf index [Casajus, 2011], the Banzhaf index-based betweenness centrality measure satisfies the “2-Efficiency” property. In essence, this property says that, for each pair of nodes u, v P V , if you consider them to be a single node vu (note that v and u are not merged, but they appear in each coalition together) then the Banzhaf index-based betweenness centrality of vu equals the sum of the Banzhaf index-based betweenness centralities of u and v.\nProposition 4.

      "text" : "The centrality of a node is measured by computing a weighted average of its marginal contribution to the group-betweenness centrality of all subsets of nodes in the graphs. In this subsection, we show how to compute this weighted average efficiently.\nTo this end, we will use Definition 6. More specifically, given a graph G and some vertex v P V pGq, we would like to compute the expected marginal contribution of this vertex to the set of vertices Pπpvq that precede v in a random permutation of all vertices of the graph. We focus in our analysis on three exhaustive cases, where the marginal contribution is positive, negative, or neutral, respectively.\nFirst, let us consider positive contributions, and let us focus on some particular shortest path p which contains vertex v. Recall that we denote by σst the number of shortest paths between vertices s and t. Furthermore, we denote by σstpvq the number of shortest paths between vertices s and t that each pass through vertex v, where t ‰ v ‰ s (recall that every such path is said to be controlled by v). Every path in σstpvq has a positive contribution to the coalition Pπpvq via vertex v if and only if the path is not controlled by (i.e., does not pass through) any vertex from the set Pπpvq. In this case, the positive contribution equals 1σst . The necessary and sufficient condition for this to happen can be expressed by Ψppq X Pπpvq “ H, where Ψppq is the set of all vertices lying on the path p, including endpoints.\nNow, let us introduce a Bernoulli random variable B`v,p which indicates whether vertex v\nmakes a positive contribution to the set Pπpvq through shortest path p. Thus, we have:\nEr 1 σst B`v,ps “ 1 σst P rΨppq X Pπpvq “ Hs,\nwhere P r¨s denotes probability, and Er¨s denotes expected value. In other words, we need to know the probability of having v precede all vertices from Ψppqztvu in a random permutation of all vertices in the graph.\nTheorem 2. Let K be a set of elements such that |K| “ k. Furthermore, let L and R be two disjoint subsets of K, and let |L| “ l and |R| “ r. Now, given some element x P K, where\n76\nx R LYR, and given a random permutation π P ΠpKq, the probability of having every element in L before x, and every element in R after x, is:\nP r@ePLπpeq ă πpxq ^ @ePRπpeq ą πpxqs “ 1pl`1qpl`r`1r q\nProof. Let us first count the number of ways in which a permutation π P ΠpKq can be constructed such that the following condition holds: @ePLπpeq ă πpxq ^ @ePRπpeq ą πpxq. Specifically:2\n— Let us choose l ` r ` 1 positions in the permutation. There are ` k l`r`1 ˘ such choices.\n— Now, in the first l chosen positions, place all the elements of L. Directly after those, place\nthe element x. Finally, in the remaining r chosen positions, place all the elements of R. The number of such line-ups is: l!r!.\n— As for the remaining elements (i.e., the elements of KzpLYtxuYRq), they can be arranged in the permutation in pk ´ pl ` r ` 1qq! different ways.\nThus, the number of permutations satisfying our condition is:\n`\nk l`r`1\n˘\nl!r!pk ´ pl ` r ` 1qq! “ k! pl`1qpl`r`1r q .\nFinally, since we have a total of k! permutations, the probability that one of them satisfies\nour condition is given by equation (5.3).\nBased on Theorem 2, we can obtain the probability of an event in which the vertex v lies on the path p and precedes all the other vertices from this path in a random permutation of all vertices in the graph G. Now, by setting K “ V pGq, L “ H and R “ Ψppqztvu, we obtain the desired probability: 1|Ψppq| . Thus:\nEr 1 σst B`v,ps “ 1 σst|Ψppq| . (5.3)\nHaving discussed the first case, where marginal contributions are positive, let us now discuss the second case, where the marginal contribution of vertex v to set Pπpvq is negative. This happens when path p ends or starts with v (w.l.o.g. we consider v as the end point). Specifically, if coalition Pπpvq already controls path p (which includes vertex v), then not only is there no value added from v becoming a member of this coalition, but there is a negative effect of this move. In particular, the group betweenness centrality assumes that a set of vertices S controls only those paths with both ends not belonging to S. Therefore, when v becomes a member of\n2 We thank the anonymous reviewer for suggesting this formulation of the proof.\n77\ncoalition Pπpvq, its negative contribution through path p equals ´ 1σsv , where σsv denotes the number of paths that start with s and end with v.\nNext, we analyse the probability of such a negative contribution of vertex v. Observe that if the marginal contribution is negative, then p must end with v. However, the opposite does not necessarily hold, i.e., if p ends with v then the marginal contribution of v is not necessarily negative; it could also be neutral. Based on this, in order to compute the probability of a negative contribution, we will start by focusing on the complementary event where v makes a neutral contribution to the set Pπpvq, as this simplifies the computational analysis. This complementary event happens if and only if either vertex s—the starting point of path p—belongs to set Pπpvq, or the path p is not controlled by any of the vertices in Pπpvq. Formally:\ns P Pπpvq _ pΨppq X Pπpvqq “ H.\nBased on this, we can introduce a Bernoulli random variable B´v,p indicating whether vertex v makes a negative contribution through path p to set Pπpvq as follows:\nEr´ 1 σsv B´v,ps “ ´ 1 σsv p1´ P rs P Pπpvq _ pΨppq X Pπpvqq “ Hsq.\nAgain, one can show with the combinatorial arguments presented in Theorem 2 that this probability is P rΨppq X Pπpvq “ Hs “ 1|Ψppq| . Furthermore, due to symmetry, we have: P rs P Pπpvqs “ 12 . Finally, from the disjointness of the aforementioned complementary events, we have:\nEr´ 1 σsv B´v,ps “ 2´ |Ψppq| 2σsv|Ψppq| . (5.4)\nRecall that our analysis was divided into three exhaustive cases, where the marginal contribution is positive, negative, or neutral. Having dealt with the first two cases, it remains to deal with the case of neutral marginal contribution. Since this case does not affect the expected marginal contribution of v to Pπpvq, we simply disregard it during the computation. Next, let us compute the expected marginal contribution, by aggregating the cases of positive and negative contributions. To this end, let Bst be the set of all shortest paths from s to t, and analogously let Bstpvq Ď Bst be the set of shortest paths from s to t that pass through vertex v.3 Now, using the expected value of the Bernoulli random variables (5.3) and (5.4) we are able to compute the Shapley value of vertex v, which is the expected marginal contribution of v to Pπpvq, as:\n3 Note that σst “ |Bst| and σstpvq “ |Bstpvq|.\n78\nφSVv pV pGq, νq “ ÿ\ns‰v‰t\nÿ\npPBstpvq\nEr 1 σst B`v,ps ` ÿ\ns‰v\nÿ\npPBsv\nEr´ 1 σst B´v,ps\n“ ÿ\ns‰v‰t\nÿ\npPBstpvq\n1\nσst|Ψppq| ` ÿ\ns‰v\nÿ\npPBsv\n2´ |Ψppq| 2σsv|Ψppq| . (5.5)\nInterestingly, the above equation provides insight into the Shapley value-based betweenness centrality, which is a combination of two factors. Firstly, the left sum resembles the standard betweenness centrality, but scaled by the number of vertices that belong to each shortest path. Secondly, the right sum resembles the closeness centrality,4 but with distances measured as the number of vertices on the shortest paths."

So, analogously to the previous subsection, we need to analytically compute the probability that the node v contributes to a coalition through a shortest path p. Again, here we only focus on the case of positive contribution and the case of negative contribution, since the neutral case has no impact on the expected marginal contribution. We will denote by Sk´1 Ď V a random coalition of size k ´ 1 uniformly drawn from the set tS Ď V ztvu : |S| “ k ´ 1u.\nFirstly, we consider positive contributions. In what follows, let us focus on some particular shortest path p which contains vertex v. This path has a positive contribution to the coalition Sk´1 through v if and only if it is not controlled by (i.e., does not pass through) any vertex from set Sk´1. In this case, the positive contribution equals 1σst .

This happens when the path p ends with v and is controlled by the set Sk´1, i.e., p passes through at least one of the nodes in Sk´1, where v R Sk´1. As in the previous subsection, we will simplify the analysis by focusing on the complementary event in which the marginal contribution is neutral.

This process takes Op|V |3q time. Brandes [2001] proposed an algorithm to improve this complexity by using some recursive relation. This algorithm runs in Op|V | ¨ |E|q time, and requires Op|V | ` |E|q space. Next, we propose a framework that generalises Brandes’ algorithm. We start by defining pair-dependency as:\nδs,tpvq “ σstpvq σst fδpdps, tqq, (5.11)\nwhich is the positive contribution that all shortest paths between s and t make to the assessment of vertex v. The value of the function fδ depends solely on the distance between s and t. For instance, if we set fδ “ 1dps,tq we obtain the distance-scaled betweenness centrality introduced by Borgatti and Everett [2006].\nNext, we define one-side dependency as:\nδs,¨pvq “ ÿ\ntPV δs,tpvq, (5.12)\nwhich is the positive contribution that all shortest paths starting in vertex s make to the assessment of vertex v.

More specifically, this framework modifies Brandes’ approach and computes the betweenness centrality parametrised by two functions: fδ and gδ. All lines that differ from the original Brandes’ algorithm were highlighted.\nFirstly, in lines 6 - 12, the algorithm calculates both the distance and the number of shortest paths from a source s to each vertex. These lines are exactly the same as in the original\n83\nalgorithm introduced by Brandes. While executing these lines, for each vertex v, all directly preceding vertices occurring on shortest paths from s to v are stored in memory. This process uses Breadth-First Search [Cormen, 2001] which takes Op|V |q time and Op|V | ` |E|q space. In the second step (lines 18 and 20), the algorithm uses formula (5.14) to calculate the contribution of the source s to the value of our betweenness centrality for each vertex that is reachable from the source. This step also takes Op|V |q time and Op|V | ` |E|q space. Only lines 18 and 20 and additionally line 21 differ from the original Brandes algorithm.\nAs visible in formula (5.14), in an undirected graph, each path is considered twice. Thus, at the end of the algorithm, in line 21, we halve the accumulated result. In line 20, we multiply the influence of the function gδ by two, because the influence of each source even in undirected graphs is considered only once. Finally, we note that it is very easy to adopt Algorithm 11 to directed graphs. To this end, we remove the loop from line 21 and halve the contribution of the vertex s from line 20, which now should look as follows:\n20 : cfgpwq Ð cfgpwq ` δs,¨pwq ` gδpdps, wqq;\nSo, for directed and undirected graphs, the algorithm runs in Op|V | ¨ |E|q time, and requires Op|V | ` |E|q space."

      "heading" : "5.4.4. The Framework for Weighted Graphs",
      "text" : "While the focus of the previous subsections was on unweighted graphs, in this subsection we show how to generalise our framework to deal with weighted graphs. In particular, we consider one of the most popular semantics of weighted graphs, where the weight λpv, uq of the edge between v and u is interpreted as the distance between v and u . Thus, unlike the case with unweighted graphs, where |Ψppq| “ dps, tq, in the case of weighted graphs this equality does not necessarily hold.\nTo introduce our generalised framework, we need additional notation. Let Tstris : i P t1, . . . , |V |u be the number of shortest paths between s and t that contain exactly i vertices. The array Tst uniquely determines the polynomial Wst with terms Tstrisxi. We define the following operations on Tst:\n— Shifting: TÑst and TÐst increase and decrease the indices of all values of the array by one, respectively. This takes Op|V |q time. — Adding: Tsv‘Tsu is the operation of adding two polynomialsWsv andWsu. It takesOp|V |q time. We will denote by À the sum of a series of polynomials. — Multiplying: Tsv b Tvt is the operation of multiplying two polynomials Wsv and Wvt. This takesOp|V | log |V |q time using the polynomial multiplying algorithm from [Cormen, 2001]. — Resetting: Tsv Ð 0 is an operation that assigns 0 to each cell in Tsv.\nNext, we will show how the above operations allow us to tackle two algorithmic problems: (i) how to count all shortest paths and (ii) how to derive the recursive relation in order to compute one-side dependency. We start by considering the first of those problems, i.e., counting the\n86\nshortest paths. Here, we will use the following relation:\nTsv “ à u: dps,uq`λpu,vq“dps,vq TÑsu . (5.17)\nUsing Dijkstra’s algorithm [Cormen, 2001], as well as equation (5.17), we can compute Tst for every pair of nodes s and t. If vertex u immediately precedes vertex v on some shortest path from source s, all shortest paths stored in Tsu extended by vertex v are part of the set of shortest paths stored in Tsv. This procedure takes Op|V |2|E| ` |V |2 log |V |q time. Secondly, in order to count all paths passing through a given node v, we will introduce the following relationship, where Tstpvq is an array defined just like Tst except that it only counts the shortest paths between vertices s and t that pass through v:\nTstpvq “ pTsv b TvtqÐst “ Tsv b TÐvt . (5.18)\nThe above equation can be interpreted as follows. Every path stored in the array Tsv can be extended by every path stored in the array Tvt. The outcome of this operation, which is in fact the multiplication of the two polynomials Wsv and Wvt, gives us information about all shortest paths from s to t passing through v. The vertex v is counted twice. To avoid duplicate counting, we shift the result of multiplication to the left, which effectively reduces the number of nodes in each path by one.\nIn weighted graphs the pair-dependency limited to the shortest paths consisting of i nodes\nis defined as follows:\nδ˚s,tpvqris “ Tstpvqris σst fδ˚piq. (5.19)\nThis limited pair-dependency measures the influence of all shortest paths between s and t consisting of i nodes on the evaluation of vertex v. The value of the function fδ˚ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and t.\nTaking all possible values of i into consideration, we obtain the pair-dependency in weighted\ngraphs:\nδ˚s,tpvq “ |V | ÿ\ni“1 δ˚s,tpvqris, (5.20)\nwhich is the positive contribution that all shortest paths between s and t make to the assessment of vertex v,\nThe definition of one-side dependency is similar to the one presented earlier in\nSubsection 5.4.1, except that we replace δ with δ˚:\nδ˚s,¨pvq “ ÿ tPV δ˚s,tpvq. (5.21)\n87\nThis is the positive contribution that all shortest paths starting with vertex s make to the evaluation of vertex v. The version of equation (5.21) that only considers the shortest paths containing exactly i nodes each is:\nδ˚s,¨pvqris “ ÿ tPV δ˚s,tpvqris, (5.22)\nNow, we are able to infer the recursive relation for weighted graphs:\nδ˚s,¨pvqris “ ÿ\nw: pv,wqPE dps,wq“dps,vq`1\nTsvris σsw\nˆ fδ˚pi` 1q ` δ˚s,¨pwqri` 1s ˙ . (5.23)\nUsing the above equation, we are able to compute a parametrised betweenness centrality for weighted graphs c˚fg. More specifically, for a vertex v, we compute c ˚ fgpvq by iterating over all other vertices and summing their contributions. More formally:\nc˚fgpvq “ ÿ\ns‰v\n|V | ÿ\ni“1\nˆ\nδ˚s,¨pvqris ` Tsvris σsv gδ˚piq ˙ , (5.24)\nwhere the value of the function gδ˚ depends solely on the number of nodes lying on the shortest paths between s and v.\nNow, we are ready to introduce our general framework, namely WPBC (see Algorithm 14) to compute the parametrised betweenness centrality in weighted graphs. All lines that differ from the original Brandes’ algorithm were highlighted. In lines 3 - 12 the algorithm uses Dijkstra’s algorithm [Cormen, 2001] to traverse the graph and count all shortest paths from the source s. In these lines it essentially differs from Brandes algorithm, because it uses polynomial arithmetic to count paths and number of nodes lying on these paths. Next, in lines 18 and 20, which also differ from Brandes’ framework, we implemented the recursive formula (5.23).\nAlgorithm 14 runs in Op|V |2|E| ` |V |2 log |V |q time and requires Op|V |2q space. Furthermore, this algorithm (just like Algorithm 11) can be easily adapted to directed graphs."

      "text" : "In this subsection, we compare the node ranking obtained by the Semivalue-based betweenness centrality against the node ranking obtained by standard betweenness centrality. Note that, by this evaluation, we also implicitly evaluate our Shapley value-based betweenness centrality, as it is a special case of the Semivalue-based one.\nTo this end, let us consider the scenario of network vulnerability (see Section 5.3.1 for more details). The comprehensive work by Holme et al. [2002] examines how different strategies of attack on the network affect its performance. In more detail, the authors studied how removing the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality affects communication throughout\n91\nthe network. They found that, in random scale-free networks, removing the nodes with the highest betweenness centrality causes an exponential decay in network performance. Here, performance is measured as the average distance between nodes—an important measure used, e.g., in the seminal paper of Albert et al. [2000] on network vulnerability to attacks and random node failures.\nThe literature closely related to the work done by Holme et al. [2002] is about network vulnerability analysis based on three-stage Stackelberg games [Stackelberg, 1952]. In a nutshell, two opponents, an interdictor and an operator, try to maximize their gains. In the first stage, the operator fortifies the network by choosing the nodes that should be fully protect. Next, the interdictor performs an attack, which involves removing a limited number of unfortified nodes. Finally, the operator acts on the network in order to fulfill its objectives, e.g., he can travel between two nodes, or send some load between nodes. The interdictor can be human or can be of a different nature such as a natural disaster or a random failure of nodes. In such cases one can assume worst-case scenarios (Murphy’s Law) [Smith and Lim, 2008], or some stochastic model of interdictor attacks [Cormican et al., 1998]. The instance of Stackelberg games closely related to this problem is called Shortest Path Interdiction. In such games the interdictor attempts to remove k edges in order to maximize the distance between two nodes s and t. This problem is proven to be NP-hard [Ball et al., 1989]. However, Malik et al. [1989] proposed an effective approximation algorithm and Corley and Sha [1982] solved this problem in polynomial time for the special case where k “ 1. In this subsection we follow the Holme’s line of research. We study the resilience of a network against random failures, where we assume that the level of protection of each node is determined based on its ranking. In order to carry out our experiment, we first need to agree on the way in which the functionality of the network will be measured. To this end, we use the average inverse geodesic measure (IGM), which was used by Albert et al. [2000] and Holme et al. [2002]. This measure captures the notion of average distance between nodes in a network, and is given by the following formula:\nIGMpV,Eq “ ÿ\nvPV\nÿ\nv‰uPV\n1\ndpv, uq .\nOur experiment consists of two phases. The first involves generating random graphs and\ncomputing node cardinal rankings. This phase involves the following steps:\n1. Generate an unweighted random scale-free graph containing 160 nodes, in which the\naverage node degree is ? 160.6\n2. Set the interval ra, bq, which means that the number of nodes that will be simultaneously exposed to failure is between a (inclusive) and b (exclusive). 6 We also experimented with alternative values; the results exhibited similar trends.\n92\n3. Compute two rankings of nodes. The first is based on standard betweenness centrality. The\nsecond is based on Semivalue-based betweenness centrality with probability distribution:\nPDpV, kq “ # 1 b´a if k P ra, bq 0 otherwise.\nThe second phase of the experiment involves the following steps:\n1. Protect each node v P V . The level of protection of each node is determined based on its position in the ranking, e.g., if a node is ranked first, then it is the most important node and\nso will have the highest level of protection. We study two approaches to nodes protection. The first one assigns to each node in the ranking the specific power of protection. More formally, if we denote by rpvq the position of node v in ranking r, then node v is protected with probability 1\nrpvq2 . The second one is to fully protect the top 10% of nodes in the ranking.\n93\n2. Choose randomly a set of nodes S Ď V , which will be exposed to failure.7 Here, the number of nodes that are exposed to failure is chosen uniformly at random from the range\nra, bq. Likewise, out of all subsets that have exactly this number of nodes, the subset S is chosen uniformly at random.\n3. Using the first approach implies that v will fail with probability 1´ 1 rpvq2 . Using the second\none indicates that each node v P S will fail if rpvq ă 0.1 ˚ |V |.\nHaving explained each phase of the experiment, we now explain how the entire experiment\nworks:\n1. Generate 30 random graphs.\n2. Set the size of the failure to ra, bq, where a “ 1 and b is running form 2 to 160.\n3. For each ra, bq, simulate 5000 simultaneous node failures.\n4. Protect nodes depending on the two rankings: standard betweenness centrality and\nSemivalue-based betweenness centrality.\n5. Compare the average IGM that results from each measure together with confidence interval\nof 75%.\n6. Compare results to the full protection strategy that will protect all nodes from being\nremoved.\nFigure 5.3 depicts the average difference in IGM between the two centrality measures. On the plot the blue line is IGMS ´ IGMB, where IGMS is the functionality of the network when protected according to our centrality measure, while IGMB is the functionality of the network when protected according to the standard betweenness centrality. The protection strategy is set to protect each node with probability 1 rpvq2 . The values below zero indicate that standard betweenness centrality gives better protection to the network, whereas those above zero indicate that our Semivalue-based centrality gives better protection. As can be seen, when b is small, the performance of the Semivalue-based betweenness centrality is almost identical to the standard betweenness centrality. This is expected because our centrality measure, given the failure interval r1, 2q, is exactly the same as the standard measure. However, as we increase b, more nodes can fail simultaneously, and so the difference between our measure and the standard one become more evident. As can be seen, in such cases, our measure outperforms the standard one in terms of network protection, as more influential nodes (in terms of maintaining a low average distance throughout the network) are preserved. Note that for the interval r1, 160q the Semivalue-based centrality is exactly the same as the Shapley value-based 7 In our setting, being exposed to failure does not necessarily imply that the node will fail; this depends on the level of protection that this node has against failure.\n94\ncentrality. Additionally, the red line in Figure 5.3 depicts the performance of the full protection strategy that protects each node from being removed. It is IGMO ´ IGMB, where IGMO is the functionality of the network when protected according to the full protection strategy, and IGMB is the functionality of the network when protected according to the standard betweenness centrality.\nFigure 5.4 depicts the same experiment, except that b “ 160 is now constant and a “ 1, . . . , 159. As can be seen, for all values of a our measure gives better protection. Again note that for the interval r1, 160q the Semivalue-based centrality is exactly the same as the Shapley value-based centrality.\nFigures 5.5 and 5.6 present the repetition of the above two experiments but for the other protection strategy, where we fully protect top 10% of nodes. The results are somewhat similar, but the advantage of our measure is less evident. For instance, given a “ 30 in Figure 5.6, the advantage of our measure is below 7 ¨ 10´5, whereas for the first protection strategy it\n95\nis above 7 ¨ 10´4. This stems from the fact that the top nodes of the two rankings (i.e., the Semivalue-based and standard betweenness) are less different than the middle nodes or the bottom nodes. This is the consequence of the scale-free distribution and existence of powerful hub nodes that dominate two rankings. Thus, if we protect only the top 10% of nodes, the difference in performance will be less visible, but our new measure still outperforms standard betwenneess centrality.\nFinally, Figure 5.7 demonstrates that the performance between two specific Semivalue-based centralities: (1) the Shapley value-based and (2) the Banzhaf-based does not differ much. That is to say, the two measures can be used interchangeably in this application."

Generally speaking, the MC algorithm works by iteratively sampling permutations of players (or nodes in our case). For each such permutation, π, and each node v, the algorithm computes the marginal contribution of v to the coalition consisting of every node that precedes v in π. Finally, after several iterations, the algorithm divides the aggregate sum of\n8 For a formalisation and a discussion of this algorithm, see [Castro et al., 2009] and [Michalak et al., 2013a], respectively.\n96\nall marginal contributions for each node by the the number of iterations performed.

In our simulations, we compute the average relative error (|1´ approx. valueexact value |) for the value of each node in the network.\nStarting with unweighted graphs, Figure 5.8 and Figure 5.9 compare the running time of our exact algorithms against the MC sampling given random networks, and given a real communication network, respectively.

Our new measure provides a ranking of individual nodes while taking into consideration the synergies that may exist in different groups of nodes. The main contributions of this chapter are summarised in contrast to the literature in Table 5.2.\nDespite the fact that Semivalues are, in general, computationally challenging, we showed that the new measure can be computed efficiently. More specifically, we proposed polynomial-time algorithms to compute all Semivalue-based betweenness centralities for weighted graphs as well as unweighted graphs. These include both the Shapley value-based and Banzhaf power index-based betweenness centralities. Interestingly, our algorithm for computing the Shapley value-based centrality for the unweighted networks has the same time complexity as the best known algorithm due to [Brandes, 2001] for computing the standard betweenness centrality.\nWe evaluated our algorithms empirically on weighted and unweighted random scale-free graphs Barabási and Albert [1999] as well as on two real networks. Our algorithms turned\n99\nout to be significantly faster than the Monte Carlo sampling [Castro et al., 2009]—the fastest alternative from the literature.\nWe also evaluated our centrality measures in a simulated scenario in which simultaneous node failures occur. Here, following Albert et al., 2000, and Holme et al.,2002, we quantified the functionality of the network based on the average inverse geodesic measure. The results showed that, compared to the standard measure, the ranking obtained by our game-theoretic network centrality reflects more accurately the influence that different nodes have on the network functionality."

      "text" : "Real-world networks frequently have highly complex structures. They can often be characterized by properties such as heavy-tailed degree distributions, clustering, the small-world property, etc. Another important characteristics that many real-life networks have in common is their community structure [Girvan and Newman, 2002, Newman, 2006] (see Section 2.8). Communities are usually composed of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with other nodes in the network. For instance, the teachers from a particular secondary school may form a community within the social network of all teachers in the city. Similarly, trade links among the European Union countries are usually more intense than their links with the rest of the world. In addition, certain communities may be considered to be stronger than others. Secondary schools may vary in reputation, and some trade blocks may be more important to the global economy than others.\nThe importance of a community is usually increased when a new, powerful individual joins it. Conversely, membership in a strong community may boost the importance of an otherwise weak individual. Quantifying this latter effect is the primary goal of this paper. In other words,\n101\nwe are concerned with the problem of analysing the importance (the centrality) of individual nodes given the underlying community structure of the network.\nIn this chapter, we use the flexibility offered by the game-theoretic approach to centrality measures and constructed first centrality measure in the literature that is able to account for complex community structures in networks. To this end, we model the community structure as the a priori given coalition structure of a cooperative game. By doing so, we are able to build a centrality metric by generalizing the Owen value [Owen, 1977]—a well-known solution concept for cooperative games in which players are partitioned into pre-defined groups.\nIn our approach, the computation of a node’s power is a two-step process. First, we compute the importance of the community (if any) that this node belongs to. Next, we compute the power of the given node within this community. Our generalization of the Owen value, which we call coalitional semivalues, is a much broader solution concept. In fact, coalitional semivalues encompass the Owen value as well as all other solution concepts in the literature that were developed for games with an a priori defined coalition structure of players: the Owen-Banzhaf value [Owen, 1982], the symmetric coalitional Banzhaf value, and p-binomial semivalues [Carreras and Puente, 2012].\nAlthough, in general, the new centrality introduced in this chapter is #P-complete (and hence NP-hard), we are able to give a polynomial algorithm to compute it for problem instances where the value of any group of nodes is determined by their degree centrality [Freeman, 1979] (see Definition 15). We verify the practical aspects of our algorithm on a large citation network that contains more than 2 million nodes and links. Our experiments compare three different degree centralities: group degree centrality [Everett and Borgatti, 1999], the Shapley value-based degree centrality (see Definition 26), and our new centrality. We show that, unlike others, our new centrality produces a ranking in which the power of the top nodes significantly differs, depending on the power of the communities that these nodes belong to."

      "text" : "Coalitional games can be analysed from both the ex ante and ex post perspectives. In the ex ante perspective, it is not known which coalition will actually form. The Semivalues (Definition 7) are ex ante since they consider the sum of the marginal contributions of a player to all possible coalitions without any additional assumptions.\nAnother approach is to consider a coalitional game from the ex post perspective. In this case it is already known which coalitions form by the end of the game. In other words, it is known how the agents have partitioned themselves into a coalition structure. This ex post perspective is especially appealing for our model where networks are or can be divided into communities.\nThe most popular extension of the Shapley value (Definition 5) to “ex post”-like situations was proposed by Owen [1977]. To this end, let us first introduce the concept of the quotient game νQ. Given the coalitional game pA, νq and coalitional structure CS “ tC1, C2, . . . , Cmu, we define a new coalitional game, where the coalitions are considered to be individual players:\nνQpRq “ ν ˆ ď\nrPR Cr\n˙\nfor all R ĎM,\nwhere the set M “ t1, 2, . . . ,mu represents coalitions’ numbers.

The computation of the Owen value can be thought of as a two-step process. In the first step, coalitions play the game pM, νQq between themselves and receive their Shapley values. In the second step, the values of these communities are, in turn, divided among their members according to the Shapley value of the members.\nThe Owen value is the unique division scheme that satisfies the following five often desirable properties: Efficiency, Symmetry, Null player, Additivity, and Component Symmetry [Owen, 1977], which will be discussed more extensively in the next section."

First, we will decide under what conditions v makes a contribution to the set QTk Y C l. Second, we will use a combinatorial argument to compute this contribution for each of the cases distinguished in the first step.\nBefore we start, we need to introduce the following notation: for the node v P Cj P CS we define the set of adjacent communities as NCS pvq “ tCi P CSzCj | Ci X Npvq ‰ Hu, inter-community degree as degCS pvq “ |NCS pvq|, the set of neighbours within a community as Njpvq “ Npvq X Cj , and intra-community degree as degjpvq “ |Njpvq|.\nTheorem 3. The game-theoretic network degree centrality for graph G with community structure CS for the node v P V can be computed in time polynomial in |V |.\n107\nProof. In our proof we will use concepts from probability theory. Thus, we will first define the probability space, which is a triple pΩ,F , P q, where Ω is a sample space containing sets tQTk Y C lu, T k Ď 2|M |´1 is such that |T k| “ k and C l Ď 2|Cj |´1 is such that |C l| “ l. The important observation is that |Ω| “\n`|M |´1 k ˘`|Cj |´1 l ˘ . In our model, F is the set of elementary events (F “ Ω), and P : F Ñ r0, 1s is a probability distribution function such that for each event A P F we have P pAq “ 1|Ω| .\nThere are two types of marginal contribution that a node can make. For the first, let us consider the marginal contribution of a single vertex v to the random set QTk Y C l. When v joins a coalition C, it can contribute to its value with the help of any vertex u P Npvq if and only if u is not in C and u is not already directly connected to C. Let us introduce the Bernoulli random variable Br1sv,u,k,l, which will indicate whether the vertex v makes a contribution through vertex u to the random set QTk Y C l. Equation (6.1) tells us that this contribution will be fpuq. Thus, we have:\nErfpuqBr1sv,u,k,ls “ fpuqP rpNpuq Y tuuq X pQTk Y C lq “ Hs,\nwhere P r¨s denotes probability, and Er¨s denotes expected value. The second type of contribution takes place when vertex v joins a coalition C and takes away the value fpvq. Such a contribution happens when vertex v is directly connected to the coalition C. In particular, weighted group degree centrality νDG assumes that the value of a set of vertices depends only on nodes directly connected to this set, ignoring nodes already inside it. Therefore, when the node v becomes a member of C and it is not any more directly connected with it, the value of C is reduced by fpvq. Let us introduce the Bernoulli random variable B r2s v,u,k,l, which will indicate whether vertex v makes a contribution through itself to the random set QTk Y C l. More formally, we have:\nEr´fpvqBr2sv,k,ls “ ´fpvqP rv P NpQTk Y C lqs.\nNow, we will move on to the second step of the proof and use a combinatorial argument to compute P r1s “ P rpNpuq Y tuuq X pQTk Y C lq “ Hs and P r2s “ P rv P NpQTk Y C lqs.

Thus, the first two methods do not account for the existence of the community structure while the third one does.\n111\nThe real-life network used for simulations is a citation network that consists of 2, 084, 055 publications and 2, 244, 018 citation relationships.2 This dataset is a list of publications with basic attributes (such as: title, authors, venue, or citations), and it is part of the project ArnetMiner being under development by Tang et al. [2008]. All publications extracted from this dataset were categorized into 22954 unique communities representing journals, conference proceedings or single book titles using basic text mining techniques. These communities can be interpreted as scientific groups united under the same topics of interests. In our experiment we use the directed version of our algorithm and assume that fpvq “ 1 #numer of articles citing v . The Shapley value-based centrality (the second method) is computed using the polynomial time algorithm introduced by Michalak et al. [2013a]. The Owen value-based centrality is computed with the modification of Algorithm 17, in which thanks to the form of the α and β (in Owen value these discrete probabilities are uniform) the complexity was reduced to Op|V | ` |E|q. In what follows we focus on the 11 top nodes from the basic ranking νWDG ptvuq. Figure 6.1 shows the relative power of the communities to which these nodes belong. Nodes indexed 5, 6 and 8 belong to significantly less powerful communities than nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10 and 11.\nFigure 6.2 shows how the position of top nodes selected using νDG ptvuq changes in the φSVv and φOVv rankings.

This demonstrates coalitional semivalues-based centrality (in this case the Owen value-based centrality) is able to recognize that these three nodes belong to much weaker communities.\nThe rankings of nodes may differ depending which coalitional semivalue we choose. To illustrate this fact we evaluated top 5 nodes with the highest degree centrality from Zachary Karate Club Network [Zachary, 1977]. This network consists of 34 nodes divided into two communities. We observe in Table 6.3 that the ranking created with the Owen value differs with the one created with Owen-Banzhaf value at the 3rd and 4th positions."

If the community of a node is weak, it can significantly weaken the position of the node in the ranking based on the coalitional semivalue.

      "text" : "Despite enormous efforts to tackle terrorism in the aftermath of 9/11, many terrorist networks are growing in size [Shultz et al., 2009]. For instance, the number of core members of Al’Qaeda, arguably the most infamous terrorist group, is currently estimated to exceed 800, with their operations spreading over more than 20 countries.\nFacing, on the one hand, the increased size of terrorist groups and, on the other hand, inevitable budget cuts, security agencies urgently require efficient techniques to identify who plays the most important role within a terrorist network and, therefore, where scarce resources should predominantly be focused. In this context, a number of authors have proposed using social network analysis to investigate terrorist organisations (e.g., Carley et al. [2003], Krebs [2002], Farley [2003], Lindelauf et al. [2013], Ressler [2006]).\nNow, the key strength of social network analysis is its bottom-up approach in that the structure and the functioning of a group is gradually revealed by considering pairwise relationships between the individuals who create the group (cfr. Ressler [2006]). In this\n114\ncontext the identification of the key individuals within the network is called a centrality analysis. Analyst’s Notebook 8 [I2, 2010]—a software package used worldwide by law enforcement and intelligence agencies—has recently included standard centrality metrics for networks (graphs), such as degree, closeness and betweenness centralities [Brandes and Erlebach, 2005, Friedkin, 1991]. But the usefulness of these metrics for terrorist networks is limited as they are often unable to capture the complex nature of these organisations [Lindelauf et al., 2013].\nRecently, to address these shortcomings, Lindelauf et al. [2013] developed a more advanced method specifically designed to measure centrality in terrorist networks. The new method belongs to a class of so-called Shapley value-based centrality (see Definition 25) and builds upon the notion of coalitional connectivity games proposed by Amer and Gimenez [2004]. These games are defined on graphs, where a coalition of nodes gets a non-zero value if and only if the induced sub-graph is connected. Such a game has an appealing interpretation in our context: it reflects communication capabilities among various groups of terrorists within the network. Indeed, when applied to the terrorist networks responsible for the 9/11 WTC and 2002 Bali attacks (with 23 and 17 members, respectively), Lindelauf et al. showed that their method produces qualitatively better results than standard centrality metrics.\nUnfortunately, the computational aspects of connectivity games by Amer and Gimenez have not been studied to date. This means that the current use of Lindelauf et al.’s method is limited only to small terrorist networks (of 25 members or so) because general-purpose algorithms for coalitional games have to be applied, which exhaustively search the space of all possible coalitions. Thus, they are inapplicable to many real-world applications such as the terrorist networks responsible for the WTC 9/11 attack (from 35 to 63 nodes depending on the considered type of links between terrorist).\nAgainst this background, we provide in this chapter the first computational analysis of\nconnectivity games proposed by Amer and Gimenez:\n— We prove that computing the Shapley value in connectivity games—including the centrality\nmetrics of Lindelauf et al.—is #P-Hard.\n— We propose a dedicated exact algorithm for computing these centrality metrics. While the\ngeneral-purpose Shapley value algorithm requires checking all subsets of vertices in the graph, our algorithm traverses through (most often) much smaller number of connected subgraphs. It also has minimal memory requirements. — We test our algorithm by analysing the aforementioned WTC 9/11 terrorist network with 36\nmembers and 125 identified connections. In this setting, our algorithm returns the solution within 38 minutes, compared to weeks if a general-purpose approach was applied. — In order to study even bigger networks, we propose a dedicated approximate algorithm\nbased on Monte Carlo sampling. By comparing to our exact algorithm, we show that, after\n115\na reasonable number of iterations, the approximate algorithm yields a very accurate ranking of top nodes based on the centrality of Lindelauf et al."

      "heading" : "7.2. Related Work",
      "text" : "A rapidly growing body of work is directed to the analysis of terrorist organisations using the methods of social network analysis. A very good introduction to this line of research can be found in Ressler [2006]. Also worthy of note is the work of Farley [2003], Carley et al. [2003], and Husslage et al. [2012], who conduct quantitative analysis of the terrorist networks.\nSince the work of Grofman and Owen [1982], a number of game-theoretic centrality measures have been developed either to enrich the existing well-known centralities or as completely new ones (see Chapter 3). In the terrorist network context, Lindelauf et al. [2009a] and Lindelauf et al. [2009b] employed the game-theoretic approach to analyze covert networks.\nThe hardness result presented in this chapter is consistent with other studies of the complexity of the Shapley value in various settings. For instance, computing the Shapley value was shown to be #P-Complete for weighted majority games [Deng and Papadimitriou, 1994] and in minimum spanning tree games [Nagamochi et al., 1997]. Aziz et al. [2009] obtained negative results for a related problem of computing the Shapley-Shubik power index for the spanning connectivity games that are based on undirected, unweighted multigraphs. Also, Bachrach et al. [2008] showed that the computation of the Banzhaf index for connectivity games, in which agents own vertices and control adjacent edges and aim to become connected to the certain set of primary edges, is #P-Complete. A comprehensive review of these issues, including some positive results for certain settings, can be found in [Chalkiadakis et al., 2011].\nFinally, it should be mentioned that other types of connectivity games have been considered in the literature. These include vertex connectivity games proposed by Bachrach et al. [2008] and the spanning connectivity games proposed by Aziz et al. [2009]. The common denominator of these games is that they are interested in maintaining the connectivity between certain set of nodes and they further study the ability of each node to affect the outcome of these games. In particular, the concepts like Banzhaf power index and Shapley-Shubik power index are utilized to measure the influence of nodes [Bachrach et al., 2008, Aziz et al., 2009].\nIn the already classic work, Krebs [2002] applied standard centrality measures to determine the key players in the 9/11 terrorist network. Memon et al. [2008] developed an algorithm based on the two well known centrality measures from social network analysis to automatically detect the hidden hierarchy in terrorist networks. Recently, Xu et al. [2009] explored the use of social network analysis methods to analyze terrorist networks mostly focusing on assigning roles to actors in the network. Most of the above mentioned work in the literature focus on identifying key players in the terrorist networks. A complementary approach is proposed by Henke [2009]\n116\nthat combines aspects of traditional social network analysis with a novel multi-agent framework that describes how terrorist groups survive despite the aggressive counterterrorist operations."

      "text" : "Terrorist networks have been recently modeled using a weighted graph, G (Definition 13), composed of individual terrorists and labeled edges [Carley et al., 2003, Krebs, 2002, Farley, 2003, Lindelauf et al., 2013, Ressler, 2006]. Based on available intelligence, an edge represents, for instance, a communication link between two terrorists, and the weight of the edge represents the frequency with which that link is used. Weights can be associated not only with edges but also with vertices. This, as argued by Lindelauf et al., allows for modeling additional information that intelligence agencies gather on individuals within the network, such as access to weapons, financial means, previous experience, and participation in a terrorist training camp. We will denote the weight of vertex vi P V pGq as γpiq P ΓpGq.\nDefinition 35 (Vertex-weighted graph). The vertex-weighted graph G “ pV,E, γq is a simple/directed/weighted graph, with a function γpvq : V Ñ R that evaluates each node. The value γpvq is called the weight of a node v.\nTo address the limitations of standard centrality metrics, Lindelauf et al. proposed a new metric that builds upon connectivity games by Amer and Gimenez [2004]. In these coalitional games on graphs, all subsets of set V pGq are considered to be possible coalitions of terrorists. Apart from the empty set, every single coalition is classified as belonging to either the set of connected coalitions (denoted CpGq) or disconnected coalitions (denoted C̃pGq). We say that C is connected if between any two nodes in C there exists at least one path of which all nodes belong to C. Otherwise C is disconnected. Importantly, any two terrorists in a connected coalition are able to communicate with each other (via a path), whereas in a disconnected coalition this is not the case. In many connected coalitions, from this point of view, some nodes play more important role than others, as their removal makes a coalition disconnected. We will call them pivotal.\nDefinition 36 (Pivotal node). Given connected coalition C P CpGq, a node vi P C is pivotal to C iff Cztviu R CpGq.\nIf such node is removed, the coalition becomes disconnected. In our context, communication between all terrorists within the subgroup becomes impossible.\n117\nDefinition 37 (Connectivity game). The connectivity game is a coalitional game defined on graph pV, νCq, where the characteristic function is defined:\nνCpCq “\n$ &\n%\n1 if C P CpGq\n0 otherwise.\n.\nIn such a game defined by Amer and Gimenez [2004] every connected coalition is evaluated to 1, and disconnected coalitions evaluated to 0. Lindelauf et al. extend this definition by assuming that values of connected coalitions may depend on the network in a variety of ways, i.e., they can be a function of adjacent edges or nodes, their weights, etc. More formally:\nDefinition 38 (Lindelauf centrality). The Lindelauf centrality is a game-theoretic centrality pψf , φSV q, where the representative function ψf is defined:\nψf pGq “ νf pCq “\n$ &\n%\nfpC,Gq if C P CpGq\n0 otherwise.\n.\nThe exact definition of f depends on the availability of information and analytical needs. For instance, to analyse the Jemaah Islamiyah network responsible for the 2002 Bali attack in Indonesia, Lindelauf et al. assume:\nfpCq “ |EpCq|ř pvi,vjqPEpCqλpvi,vjq , (7.1)\nthat is f equals the number of edges in the connected coalition C (denoted by EpCq) divided by their weight.\nLindelauf et al. show that the centrality ranking based on the Shapley value of the connectivity game is much more effective than degree, closeness and betweenness centralities in exposing the key players in the Bali attack. In particular, Azahari bin Husin—the network bomb expert who was considered the “brain” behind the entire operation—is ranked low by standard centralities but according to Lindelauf et al. metric is among top five Bali terrorists. Similarly, Feri (Isa)—again ranked low by standard centralities—was, in fact, the suicide bomber. Lindelauf et al. ranked him third.\nFor big networks networks, the only feasible approach to compute Shapley value currently outlined in the literature is Monte-Carlo sampling (see Section 4.4.1). However, this method is not only inexact, but can be also very time-consuming. For instance, as shown in our simulations, for a weighted network of about 16,000 nodes and about 120,000 edges, the Monte Carlo approach has to iterate 300, 000 times through the entire network to produce the\n118\napproximation of the Shapley value with a 40% error margin.1 Exponentially more iterations are needed to further reduce this error margin."

The main problem of interest is as follows:\nDefinition 39 (#CG-SHAPLEY). Given a connectivity game on graph G, where @CPCpGqfpC,Gq “ 1, we are asked to compute the Shapley value for each node in this graph.\nIn the first step, let us introduce the following problem:\nDefinition 40 (#CONNECTED-SPANNING-SUB (#CSS)). Given a graph G, we are asked to compute the number of connected spanning subgraphs in G.2\nThis problem is #P-Complete even for bipartite and planar graphs [Welsh, 1997]. We will\nuse this hardness result to prove #P-Completeness of the following problem:\nDefinition 41 (#CONNECTED-INDUCED-SUB (#CIS)). Given a graph G, we are asked to compute the number of connected induced subgraphs in G.\nTheorem 4. #CONNECTED-INDUCED-SUB is #P-Complete.\nProof of Theorem 1 We note first that it is possible to check in polynomial time if a given subgraph is induced and connected. Thus, since a witness can be verified in polynomial time, this problem is in #P. Now, we will reduce a #CSS instance to #CIS. To this end, given a graph G “ pV,Eq, we will construct a transformed graph G1 and show that determining the number of connected induced subgraphs in G1 allows us to easily compute the number of connected spanning subgraphs in G.\n1 See Section 7.5 for the exact definition of the error margin. 2 A connected subgraph F of the given graph, G “ pV,Eq, is called spanning if it contains all nodes from G,\ni.e., V pF q “ V pGq.\n119\nOur transformed graph G’ is constructed by adding to each edge in G an extra node. Then, to each node from original graph G we attach a clique KA with A nodes. This reduction is shown in Figure 7.1. More formally we define the following graph G1:\nV pG1q “V pGq Y tvi : v P V pGq ^ i P t1, . . . , Auu Y\ntvu : pv, uq P EpGqu\nEpG1q “tpv, uvq : pu, vq P EpGqu Y\ntpv, viq : v P V pGq ^ i P t1, . . . , Auu Y tpvi, vjq : v P vpGq ^ i, j P t1, . . . , Auu ^ i ă ju\nNow, we arbitrarily choose some connected induced subgraph F of G1. Either this subgraph intersects with the original set of vertices V pGq, or it does not. In the latter case, subgraph F is contained within the single copy of KA and there are exactly |V pGq|p2A ´ 1q such subgraphs. In the former case, we can define some pseudograph F 1, which consists of the following sets of vertices and edges:3\nV pF 1q “V pF q X V pGq EpF 1q “tpu, vq : uv P V pF q ^ pu, vq P EpGqu\nNote that since F is connected, F 1 also has to be connected. There are exactly 2|V pF 1q|A choices of F that can give us a particular pseudograph F 1. Now, we can compute:\nM “ |V pGq|p2A ´ 1q ` ÿ\nF 1\n2|V pF 1q|A (7.2)\nwhich denotes the number of induced connected subgraphs in G1.\nThe crucial observation here is that, if V pF 1q “ V pGq, then F 1 is a connected spanning subgraph of G. This holds because F is an induced connected subgraph. Now, let N denote the number of spanning connected subgraphs in G. Then, we can rewrite (7.2) as:\nM “ |V pGq|p2A ´ 1q `Np2|V pGq|Aq ` ÿ\nF 1:V pF 1q‰V pGq\n2|V pF 1q|A (7.3)\nIn order to compute N we would like to bound the expression X “ M ´ Np2|V pGq|Aq. This expression is the number of induced connected subgraphs in G1 that do not correspond to any\n3 We note that this tuple is not necessarily a properly defined graph, since it can contain some edge pu, vq and does not contain node v.\n120\nconnected spanning subgraph in G. We have:\n0 ď X ď |V pGq|p2A ´ 1q ` 2|V pGq|`|EpGq|2p|V pGq|´1qA\nwhere the number 2|V pGq|`|EpGq| is an upper bound on the number of all subgraphs in G. Now, we can use these bounds to transform equation (7.3) and to determine the approximation of N :\nN “ M 2|V pGq|A ´ X 2|V pGq|A » M 2|V pGq|A\n´ |V pGq| ` 2 |V pGq|`|EpGq|\n2A\nIn order to deal with the expression |V pGq|`2 |V pGq|`|EpGq|\n2A we take A ą logp|V pGq| `\n2|V pGq|`|EpGq|q so that this fraction becomes smaller than 1. We note that A is bounded by a polynomial in the order of the input G. Then, the number of spanning connected subgraphs of G is the least integer N such that N ě M 2A|V pGq| . This is easy to compute given the number of connected induced subgraphs F of G1. This completes the proof. l From Theorem 4, it trivially follows that the next problem is also #P-Complete:\nDefinition 42 (#CONNECTED-INDUCED-SUB-k (#CIS-k)). Given a graph G, we are asked to compute the number of connected induced subgraphs of size k in G.\nClearly, if we can find in polynomial time an answer for the #CIS-k problem, we could efficiently compute #CIS. Now, the #P-Hardness of #CG-SHAPLEY will be shown by the reduction from #CIS-k:\nTheorem 5. #CG-SHAPLEY is #P-Hard.\nProof of Theorem 2: We construct a proof by reduction. In particular, we demonstrate that if there exists an algorithm for solving #CG-SHAPLEY in polynomial time, then it is possible to\n121\nsolve #CIS-k in polynomial time. This contradicts the fact that #CIS-k is #P-complete. Now, we will reduce #CIS-k to #CG-SHAPLEY.\nLet G “ pV,Eq be an arbitrary graph, where |V | “ n and |E| “ m. We extend the set of nodes of G by a single node v, while the set of edges remains unchanged. In other words, we obtain a new graph G0 by adding a single node not connected to any node from G. Now, from the definition of connectivity games, we note that the marginal contribution of the new node v to any coalition C Ď G is either 0 or ´1. More specifically, it is ´1 if C is connected, and 0 otherwise. Based on this, the Shapley value of node v can be computed as follows, where cGs is the number of connected induced subgraphs in G that contain exactly s nodes:\nφSVv,G0 “ ´ n ÿ\ns“0\npsq!pn´ sq! pn` 1q! c G s\nNow, let us consider a new graph Gi constructed by adding to G the set of i nodes in addition to the node v, while keeping the set of edges just as in G. Analogously to G0, the Shapley value of v in Gi is:\nφSVv,Gi “ ´ n ÿ\ns“0\npsq!pn` i´ sq! pn` 1` iq! c G s (7.4)\nThis equation holds because each coalition containing more than n nodes is disconnected, and so the contribution of v to every such coalition is 0. Now, we can build a system of linear equations using each equation (7.4) from graph Gi, where i P t0, . . . , nu. More precisely, we need to solve the following equation:\n»\n— — — –\n0!n! 1!pn´ 1q! ¨ ¨ ¨ n!0! 0!pn` 1q! 1!n! ¨ ¨ ¨ n!1!\n... ... . . . ... 0!p2nq! 1!p2n´ 1q! ¨ ¨ ¨ n!n!\nfi\nffi ffi ffi fl\n»\n— — — – cG0 cG1 ... cGn\nfi\nffi ffi ffi fl “\n»\n— — — –\npn` 1q!φSVv,G0 pn` 2q!φSVv,G1\n... p2n` 1q!φSVv,Gn\nfi\nffi ffi ffi fl\nthat can also be written as Ax “ b. This equation has a unique solution if and only if the determinant of the matrix A is non-zero. We can use Theorem 1.1 from [Bacher, 2002] to prove that it is non-zero. Thus, if we can compute in polynomial time the Shapley value for connectivity games, we would be able to solve this equation and determine all cGi values. Specifically, we can use Gaussian elimination, which works in Opn3q time complexity. We note that the largest possible number in our matrices is n!n!. According to the analysis in (Proposition 2)[Aziz et al., 2009] it is possible to store such a number in km2plogmq2 bits. It is shown in (Theorem 4.10) [Korte and Vygen, 2005] that in Gaussian elimination each number occurring during the algorithm process can be stored in the number of bits quadric of the input size. This final observation ends our proof. l\n122"

To this end, for each vi P V , let us define the following disjoint sets of coalitions:\nC#i “tC Ď V ztviu : C P C ^ C Y tviu P Cu C`i “tC Ď V ztviu : C P C̃ ^ C Y tviu P Cu C´i “tC Ď V ztviu : C P C ^ C Y tviu P C̃u\nwhich correspond to cases (a), (b) and (c) from the previous section. Based on this, the\noriginal formula for Shapley value (Definition 5) can be computed as:\nφSVi pV, νf q “ ÿ\nCĎV ztviu\n|C|!p|V | ´ |C| ´ 1q! |V |! pνf pC Y tviuq ´ νf pCqq\n“ ÿ\nCPtC`i YC # i YC ´ i u\n|C|!p|V | ´ |C| ´ 1q! |V |! pνf pC Y tviuq ´ νf pCqq (7.5)\nwhere case (d), when mcipCq “ 0, is simply omitted. The key idea behind our exact algorithm to compute the Shapley value in connectivity game (FasterSVCG presented in Algorithm 20) is to represent the sets C`i and C´i differently, such that C̃ does not appear in the new representation. As for C#i , it does not depend on C̃, and so there is no need to represent it differently. In particular, we represent C`i and C´i as follows, where PpCq is the set of agents that are pivotal to C, and NpCq is the set of neighbours of C:\nC`i “tC Ď V ztviu : C Y tviu P C ^ vi P PpC Y tviuqu C´i “tC Ď V ztviu : C P C ^ vi R NpCqu\nNow since C̃ no longer appears in the definitions of C#i , C`i and C´i , it is possible to compute the Shapley value as in equation (7.5) without enumerating any of the coalitions in C̃. Based on this, our algorithm enumerates every connected coalition, C P C, and determines for each\n125\nagent vi P C whether Cztviu P C#i or Cztviu P C`i and for vi R C if C P C´i . Note, that we do not consider the impact of agent vi R C that do not disconnect C because the contribution of this agent will be calculated for connected coalition C Y tviu as C P C#i . The enumeration is carried out using Moerkotte and Neumann [2006]’s method—the fastest such enumeration method in the literature. Its basic idea is that, for each connected coalition C P C, it expands C by adding to it certain subsets of its neighbours. These subsets are chosen so as to ensure that no connected coalition is enumerated more than once (see Moerkotte an Neumann [2006] for more details).\nNext, we explain our algorithm. To enhance clarity, for every connected coalition C P C, we will define three disjoint sets of agents: V #C “ tvi P C : Cztviu P C # i u, V `C “ tvi P C : Cztviu P C`i u, and V ´C “ tvi P V zC : C P C´i u. If we compute the above sets for every C P C, then we can compute the Shapley value. Let us take a closer look at the difficulty of computing those sets for a given C.\n— Computing V ´C can be done in Op|V |q time. This is because the agents in V ´C are basically all those that are not members, nor neighbours, of C. — Now, to compute V `C , we need to find the pivotal agents in C. This can be computed using\na method “findPivotals” that runs in Op|V | ` |E|q [Alsuwaiyel, 1999]. — Having computed V `C , it becomes easy to compute V # C . This is because V # C “ CzV `C .\nFrom the above analysis, it is clear that the main difficulty lies in findPivotals. Therefore, whenever possible, we would like to compute V `C using some other, easier, technique. In particular, when we expand a connected coalition, C, into another connected coalition C 1 “ C Y S, we try to update the set of pivotal agents, rather than compute it from scratch with findPivotals. Here, we distinguish between three conditions:\n— Condition 1: The cycles in C 1 are exactly like those in C. In this case, the set V `C1 consists\nof elements of V `C , expanded by the nodes in C that are connected to S.\n— Condition 2: C 1 contains a cycle that is not in C. Here, we need to call findPivotals. — Condition 3: |C| “ 2. In this case, since we assumed that a singleton is a connected coalition, none of the two agents in C is pivotal.\nThe pseudocode of FasterSVCG is presented in Algorithm 20. It is easy to see that it runs in Opp|V | ` |E|q|C|q."

[2009] method. To see discussion about different methods of approximation the Shapley value see Section 4.4.1.\nOur Algorithm 21 is the dedicated application of standard Monte Carlo sampling to connectivity games. The crucial difference between Castro et al. [2009] method and ApproximateSVCG is that instead of sampling permutations our algorithm sample coalitions. The first observation is that during sampling a single set C we can compute two contributions: one νf pC Y viq ´ νf pCq, and the second νf pCq ´ νf pCztviuq. Generally speaking, in our algorithm, we will randomly select C and and approximate the φSVi pνf q using the resulting average. Looking at the equation (7.5) we see that the marginal contributions are calculated with different weights. Thus, to obtain an unbiased estimator we have to compute marginal contributions with appropriate probabilities. To this end, we propose the following process consisting of 3 fazes. In Faze 1, we uniformly select the size of the coalition k P t0, . . . , |V |u. In Faze 2, we choose a random coalition C of size k and, in Faze 3, for every agent, compute the marginal contribution of this agent obtained by leaving/entering C. To better explain our motivation, let us transform the formula for the Shapley value (Definition 5) as follows:\nφSVi pνf q “ 1 |V | ÿ\n0ďkă|V | ¨ 1`|V |´1 k ˘\nÿ\nCĎV ztiu,|C|“k\npvpC Y tviuq ´ vpCqq (7.6)\nThe similar transformation was already made in equation 5.1, when we used it to compute efficiently Semivalues.\nFrom the above formula we infer that to obtain an unbiased estimator the sampling method\nshould satisfy two conditions:\n(i) the probability that a marginal contribution to randomly chosen C is obtained from entering\nvi to a coalition of size k is equal for every k: 1n`1 ¨ n´k n ` 1 n`1 ¨ k`1 n “ 1 n (n “ |V |);4\n(ii) marginal contributions to all coalitions of size k are chosen with the same probability.\nFor instance consider a pivotal node vi in coalition C of size k ` 1. The expected marginal contribution when C P C̃ and C Y tviu P C equals 1n`1 ¨ ` 1 pn´1k´1q ˘\n¨ νf pCq. On the other hand, the same marginal contribution is obtained from leaving connected coalition C – here expected value equals 1 n`1 ¨ ` 1 pn´1k q ˘\n¨ νf pCq. As we won’t consider transfers from the disconnected coalitions, we have to ensure that expected value from this marginal contribution does not change, so if we obtain C with the probability 1 n`1 ¨ ` 1 pn´1k q ˘ we add marginal contribution which equals νf pCq ¨ p1` n´k`1k q “ νf pCq ¨ p n`1 k q.\n4 Note that a given marginal contribution appears twice in our process—the first term represents the probability that we select a coalition of size k without player vi, while the second one—that we select the corresponding coalition of size k ` 1, with player vi.\n128\nAlgorithm 21: ApproximateSVCG Approximation algorithm for the Shapley value Input: Graph G“pV,Eq and characteristic function νf Output: Shapley value φSVi pνf q of each node vi P V 1 foreach vi P V do φSVi pνf q Ð 0; 2 for it “ 1 to maxIter do 3 k Ð random number from t0, . . . , |V |u; 4 C Ð random coalition of size k; 5 if !CheckConnectedness(C) then continue; 6 P Ð FindPivotalspCq; 7 foreach vi P CzP do // case (a) 8 φSVi pνf q Ð φSVi pνf q ` |V |`1 |C| ¨ pνf pCq ´ νf pCztviuqq\n9 foreach vi P P do // case (b) 10 φSVi pνf q Ð φSVi pνf q ` |V |`1 |C| ¨ νf pCq 11 foreach vi P pV zCqzNpCq do // case (c) 12 φSVi pνf q Ð φSVi pνf q ´ |V |`1 |V |´|C| ¨ νf pCq\n13 foreach vi P V do SVipνf q Ð SVipνf q{maxIter;\nThis technique allows us to compute the marginal contributions of all agents for a randomly selected coalition C, which in the connectivity games can be performed much faster than estimating the Shapley value for each player separately [Mann and Shapley, 1962] or by sampling of a random permutation [Castro et al., 2009], where we have to calculate the marginal contributions for a sequence of coalitions growing in size.\nIn the ApproximateSVCG algorithm we merge our technique with the analysis of marginal contribution presented in Figure 7.2. The pseudo code is presented in Algorithm 21. Line 3 corresponds to Faze 1, where we sample the size of a coalition. Now, we modify Faze 2 in order to select only connected coalitions (line 5). See that generating a random connected coalition uniformly will create a biased algorithm. We also modify Faze 3, when we consider cases (a), (b), and (c) from Figure 7.2 (lines 7-12). The modification of Faze 3 has to be done due to the following reason: since we no longer consider disconnected coalitions, any non-zero marginal contribution made to a disconnected coalition have to be transfered to a corresponding connected coalition (lines 8, 10, and 12). Furthermore, this should be done in a way that preserves appropriate probabilities (thus, in lines 8, 10, and 12 we multiply marginal contributions by adequate weights). Finally, we divide the sum of the contributions by the number of iterations (lines 13). For every sample, algorithm runs in time Op|V | ` |E|q."

      "text" : "In this section, we empirically evaluate our FasterSVCG algorithm focusing on randomly generated networks as well as on real-life data from 9/11 terrorists network. We also evaluate\n129\nhow ApproximateSVCG approximates ranking, by benchmarking it against exact solution obtained by our algorithm.\nThe random graphs used in experiments are based on two topologies commonly found in social networks, and in terrorist organizations in particular [Krebs, 2002, Sageman, 2004]: (i) scale-free graphs, where the network is generated according to a power law; and (ii) random trees, which model hierarchical organisations. To construct scale-free graphs, we use the preferential attachment generation model [Albert et al., 2000], with parameters k “ 2, 3. In this model, while gradually constructing a graph, every new node vi is linked to k already existing nodes such that the probability that vi is linked to the node vj is degreepviq ř\nj degreepvjq . To construct\ntrees, every new node is attached to a randomly picked incumbent. Finally, we include in our analysis (iii) complete graphs, where all coalitions are connected. Although complete graphs are unlikely to arise in a terrorist network context, they constitute a suitable benchmark for our simulations. For all the games on random graphs we assume that f is defined as in Lindelauf’s centrality (Definition 38, equation 7.1). FasterSVCG: In Figure 7.3, we compare the performance of FasterSVCG to the general-purpose Shapley value algorithm (called GeneralSV and presented in Algorithm 19). This latter algorithm does not take into account the structure of the network, so its runtime is the same for any type of graph. Unlike GeneralSV, FasterSVCG takes advantage of the sparsity of the network and, consequently, significantly outperforms the benchmark. For instance, for SFG(k “ 2) and |V | “ 30, FasterSVCG needs only 0.39% of GeneralSV runtime! Naturally,\n130\nthe best performance is obtained for tree graphs, where the game over a network of 30 nodes can be computed in about 3 seconds. ApproximateSVCG: In Figure 7.4, we evaluate the time performance of ApproximateSVCG. Importantly, for our purpose of identifying key terrorists, we are mostly interested in the approximation of the correct Shapley value-based ranking of top nodes, and less in the approximation of their actual Shapley values. To this end, we evaluate the time required by ApproximateSVCG to obtain the ranking of the top r ? ns nodes, with at most one error (i.e., one inversion compared to the exact ranking). We present an average time calculated over 500 iterations, each for a randomly selected SFG(k “ 4). ApproximateSVCG returns top nodes much faster than FasterSVCG—for the graph of 24 nodes the former algorithm runs in 0.25 sec. and the exact one in 72 sec.\nFigure 7.5 shows the comparison between the error convergence of the ApproximateSVCG and the error convergence of random permutation sampling studied by Castro et al. [2009] (see Algorithm 6). In this experiment we focus on the maximum absolute error of the Shapley value. It is computed as a percentage of the value of the grand coalition. The plot presents an average error from over 30 iteration for Krebs’ 9/11 WTC terrorist network with 36 nodes. Since connected coalitions constitute only only 0.59% of all coalitions, ApproximateSVCG outperforms Castro’s method. Indeed, after 4 seconds, the average error of ApproximateSVCG equals 0.029%, while the error for Castro et al. exceeds 0.2%. The absolute error in ApproximateSVCG converges to zero which indicates that this sampling method is not biased.\n131\nNew insight on Krebs’ 9/11 WTC network: In the already classic work, Krebs [2002] constructed the 9/11 network from publicly available sources and computed standard centrality metrics to determine the key players in this network. Lindelauf et al. instead used their new centrality metric and, similarly to the case of the Jemaah Islamiyah’s network, showed that the Shapley value-based approach delivers qualitatively better insights. However, Lindelauf et al.’s analysis focuses only on the network of 19 hijackers with 32 relationships, whereas Krebs reported also a bigger network of 36 nodes and 125 edges (mentioned above) that included accomplices. With FasterSVCG, we were able to analyse this bigger network as well.\nImportantly, the five top terrorists (out of 36) identified by FasterSVCG differ from the top five terrorists reported by Lindelauf et al. when only the network of 19 terrorist was taken into account—see Table 7.1. This difference is especially striking with respect to M. Atta, who was\n132\nwidely believed to be one of the ring-leaders of the conspiracy [Krebs, 2002] and was positioned the third place in our computations, but was classified in Lindelauf et al.’s work only on the 6th place.

This class of games is a useful abstraction for a number of realistic settings and economic situations, such as modeling relationships in social networks. To date, two main extensions of the Shapley value have been proposed for generalized characteristic function games: the Nowak-Radzik [1994] value and the Sánchez-Bergantiños [1999] value. In this context, the present chapter studies generalized characteristic function games from the point of view of representation and computation. Specifically, we make two key contributions.

Our representation extends the results of Ieong and Shoham [2005] and Elkind et al. [2009a] for characteristic function games and retains their attractive computational properties.

[2009a] (see Section 2.5). This representation has a number of desirable properties: it is fully expressive, concise for many characteristic function games of interest, and facilitates a very efficient technique for computing the Shapley value. Importantly, our representation, which we call generalized read-once MC-Nets, also has these desirable properties.\nThis section is divided into four subsections. In Section 8.2.1, we introduce the generalized read-once MC-Nets representation to represent generalized characteristic function games compactly. After that, in Sections 8.2.2 and 8.2.3, we prove that this representation facilitates an efficient computation of the NR value and the SB value, respectively.

      "text" : "Having presented the MC-Net representation for characteristic function games in Section 2.4 and read-once MC-Net on Section 2.5, we now present our extension of MC-Nets to generalized characteristic function games. More specifically, we extend the rules so that the formula F on the left hand side of a rule is applicable to an ordered coalition. We introduce two atomic formulas:\nbasic atomic formula (BAF) tam, . . . , anu,\nordered atomic formula (OAF) xai, . . . , ajy.\nThe ordered coalition T meets a basic atomic formula, denoted FBAF , if all literals occurring in FBAF belong to T . More formally\nT |ù FBAF ðñ @ai P FBAF , ai P T.\nExample 8. Let N “ ta1, . . . , a10u and consider T “ pa5, a1, a4, a3, a2q. We have:\nT ( ta2, a5u, T * ta5, a2, a4, a6u.\nNow, we introduce an ordered atomic formula, denoted FOAF . This formula is our crucial extension to MC-Nets; it allows us to fully express the values of all ordered coalitions. Specifically, the ordered coalition T meets FOAF if all literals occurring in FOAF appear in T in the same order as in the FOAF formula.\n138\nTo state this more formally, let us first introduce the notion of an ordered coalition corresponding to FOAF . To this end, for every FOAF “ xai, . . . , ajy, the corresponding ordered coalition of FOAF is simply SOAF “ pai, . . . , ajq. The main difference between the two is that ai is a literal in FOAF , while it is an agent in SOAF . Now, given a particular FOAF and an ordered coalition SOAF corresponding to it, the following holds for every T P T :\nT |ù FOAF ðñ SOAF tĎT.\nIn other words, SOAF is a subsequence of T . This has a natural interpretation: when a group of players joins any coalition in a certain order they contribute to it a certain value. Consider the following example:\nExample 9. Let N “ ta1, . . . , a10u and consider T “ pa5, a1, a4, a3, a2q. We have:\nT ( xa5, a3, a2y, T * xa5, a2, a3y, T * xa5, a3, a2, a6y.\nNow, we are able to formalize our representation which we call the generalized read-once MC-Nets. Specifically, in this representation, a rule, called generalized read-once rule, is as follows:\nF Ñ V, (8.7)\nwhere V is a real value and the syntax of the generalized formula F is:\nA :“ FBAF | FOAF , F :“ pFq | F | F ^ F | F _ F | F ‘ F | A,\nand each literal can only appear once in the formula. This generalized formula is a binary rooted tree with atomic formulas on leafs and internal nodes labeled with one of the following logical connectives: conjunction (^), disjunction (_) or exclusive disjunction (‘). The logical connectives have the following standard interpretation:\nT ( F ðñ T * F ,\nT ( F1 ^ F2 ðñ T ( F1 and T ( F2, T ( F1 _ F2 ðñ T ( F1 or T ( F2, T ( F1 ‘ F2 ðñ T ( pF1 _ F2q ^ pF1 ^ F2q.\n139\nExample 10.

The generalized coalitional game pN, νgq in the form of Generalized Read-once Marginal Contribution Network is a pair pA,GRq, where A is a set of players, and GR is a finite set of generalized rules. The value νgpT q of an ordered coalition T is defined as the sum of all V from the generalized read-once rules that are met by T . More formally:\nνgpT q “ ÿ\nGRQFÑV : T |ùF\nV . (8.8)\nThe following example presents a simple application of generalized read-once MC-Nets to\nthe scheduling problem:\nExample 11. Let G “ pV,Eq be a directed acyclic graph representing a task-based domain, where each vertex in V “ tv1, . . . , vnu represents a task. Each edge pvi, vjq P E illustrates that task vi has to be completed before task vj . We say that the job is done if all tasks of a given graph G are completed, in which case we get some revenue. Next we show how each such graph can be represented by a single generalized read-once rule, where agents represent tasks. In particular, each formula in the rule represents an edge in G, as follows:\nľ\npai,ajqPE\nxai, ajy Ñ revenue of the job defined by G."

We start with\nexpressiveness:\nProposition 5 (Expressiveness). Every ordered coalitional game can be expressed using generalized read-once MC-Nets.\nProof. For any arbitrary generalized characteristic function νg, we show how to construct a set of rules GR such that Equation (8.8) holds for every T P T .

In the following basic example we present that in some games the BAF gives us desirable succinctness.\nExample 12. Let N “ ta1, . . . , anu be the set of tasks. In order to get profit V , all tasks must be done in arbitrary chosen order. It is clear that representing this problem using only OAF requires n! number of formulas:\nxa1, . . . , any Ñ V, ...\nxan, . . . , a1y Ñ V.\nBy introducing BAF we can get exponentially more concise notation: ta1, . . . , anu Ñ V .\nIt is worth making some observations about the conciseness of our representation scheme. Our rule-based representation scheme is ultimately based on propositional formulae, and the use of these formulae is ultimately to define a Boolean function. The use of propositional formulae to define Boolean functions is very standard: a very fundamental result in the theory of propositional logic is that any Boolean function of n Boolean arguments can be represented by a propositional formula in which the variables correspond to these arguments. For many Boolean functions, it might be possible to obtain compact propositional formulae to represent them, but crucially, this will not always be possible; some Boolean functions will require formulae of size exponential in the number of variables (see, e.g., Boppana and Sipser [1990]). It is in fact trivial to produce examples of characteristic functions whose representation in our framework is exponentially more succinct than explicitly listing the value of every coalition, but from the above discussion, it also follows that our representation cannot guarantee compactness in all cases. Finally, note that in the worst case, we can represent a characteristic function with one rule for every possible input, which essentially corresponds to the idea of listing the value of every coalition. Thus, in the worst case, our representation scheme is no worse than simply listing the value of every input. More formally:\nCorollary 1 (Conciseness). Compared to the generalized function game representation, generalized read-once MC-nets are at least as concise, and for certain games exponentially more compact."

Given a generalized coalitional game pN,GRq, Algorithm 22 computes the Nowak-Radzik value (φNRi for all ai P N ) in polynomial time.\nProof. We start by introducing necessary notation, some of which is in the pseudo code of Algorithm 22. For each formula F , we denote by XF the sets of players occurring in F , and by |F | the size of XF , and by TF the set of all ordered coalitions within the set XF , i.e., TF “ Ť\nCĎXF ΠpCq. For all ai P XF and k P t0, . . . , nu, we define the following quantities:\nAk,ipFq “ |T P TF : |T | “ k, ai R T, T * F , pT, aiq ( Fq|, Bk,ipFq “ |T P TF : |T | “ k, ai R T, T ( F , pT, aiq * Fq|, TkpFq “ |T P TF : |T | “ k, T ( F |, FkpFq “ |T P TF : |T | “ k, T * F |.\nThe first quantity Ak,ipFq is the number of ordered coalitions from TF of a given size k (i.e., containing k players) to which the addition of player ai at the end of the coalition causes the formula F to become satisfied. In contrast, the second quantity Bk,i is the number of coalitions to which adding player ai causes the formula F to become unsatisfied. The last two quantities, TkpFq and FkpFq, count the number of ordered coalition being satisfied, and not satisfied, respectively, by the formula F . These quantities can be computed recursively as follows. Let\n142\nus first focus on the case where F is an atomic formula. This case can be divided further into two cases:\n— F “ ta1, . . . , aru: Here, Ak,i “ pr ´ 1q! if k “ r ´ 1 and i P XF , otherwise Ak,i “ 0. Bk,i always equals 0. Tk “ r! if k “ r, otherwise Tk “ 0. Finally, Fk “ k! if k ă r, otherwise Fk “ 0. — F “ xa1, . . . , ary: Here Ak,i “ 1 if k “ r ´ 1 and i “ r, otherwise Ak,i “ 0. Bk,i always equals 0. Tk “ 1 if k “ r, otherwise Tk “ 0. Finally, Fk “ k! ´ Tk if k ď r, otherwise Fk “ 0.\nHaving discussed the case where F is an atomic formula, we now consider the case where F contains logical connectives. If such a connective involves two subformulas F1 and F2, then we know that ai can appear in F1 or F2, but not in both. We also know that logical connectives used in the generalized read-once MC-Nets are symmetric, so we will consider only one case, ai P F1; the other is analogous. In our analysis, for every two disjoint ordered coalitions, T1 and T2, we define a conflation of T1 and T2 as an ordered coalition T such that (1) every agent in T appears in T1 or T2, and (2) the order of the agents in T1 is retained in T , and the order of those in T2 is also retained in T . The set of every conflation of T1 and T2 will be denoted T1 ˆ T2. More formally:\nT P T1 ˆ T2 ðñ XT “ XT1 YXT2 ^ T 1tĂT ^ T2tĂT,\nwhere XT denotes a set of players in T . We note that if T1 ( F and XF X T2 “ H then T ( F@T P pT1 ˆ T2q.\nProposition 6. Two ordered coalitions T1 and T2 can be conflated in `|T1|`|T2|\n|T2|\n˘\nways.\nProof. Consider an sequence of |T1| ` |T2| empty slots, where each slot can take an agent. Out of all these slots, choose any |T2| slots, and place in them the agents from T2 while retaining their order. As for the remaining slots, place in them the agents from T1 while retaining their order. Clearly, every choice of the |T2| slots results in a unique conflation, and every conflation can be constructed by exactly one such choice of the |T2| slots. The number of conflations is then\n`|T1|`1`|T2|´1 |T2| ˘ .\nNext, we show how to compute Ak,i,Bk,i, Tk and Fk. We will do this for each of the possible logical connective (i.e., , ^, _ and ‘) separately:\n— F “ F1: In this case, the negation swaps quantities as follows. For all i and k we have Ak,ipFq “ Bk,ipF1q, Bk,ipFq “ Ak,ipF1q, TkpFq “ FkpF1q, and FkpFq “ TkpF1q. — F “ F1 ^ F2. In this case, let T P T1 ˆ T2, where T1 P ΠpXF1q, |T1| “ s and T2 P ΠpXF2q, |T2| “ k ´ s. We have pT, aiq ( F if and only if pT1, aiq ( F1 and\n143\nT2 ( F2.

In this case, let T P T1 ˆ T2, where T1 P ΠpXF1q, |T1| “ s and T2 P ΠpXF2q, |T2| “ k ´ s. We know that T * F if and only if T1 * F1 and T2 * F2. Furthermore, in this case it holds that pT, aiq ( F ô pT1, aiq ( F1. Thus,\nAk,i “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\nAs,ipF1qFk´spF2q.\nAnalogously, we have pT, aiq * F if and only if pT1, aiq * F1 and T2 * F2, and in this case it holds that: T ( F ô T1 ( F1. Consequently,\nBk,i “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\nBs,ipF1qFk´spF2q.\nFinally, for Tk and Fk, we have:\nTk “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘ pTs ` F1qTk´spF2q ` FspF1qTk´spF2q ` TspF1qFk´spF2q ˘ ,\nFk “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\nFspF1qFk´spF2q.\n— F “ F1 ‘ F2: Let T “ T1 ˆ T2 such that T1 P ΠpXF1q, |T1| “ s and T2 P ΠpXF2q, |T2| “ k´s. Now, the ordered coalition T can contribute to Ak,i in two ways. Firstly, when T1 ( F1 and T2 ( F2 and pT1, aiq * F1. Secondly, when T1 * F1 and T2 * F2 and pT1, aiq ( F1. Thus:\nAk,i “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\npBs,ipF1qTk´spF2q ` As,ipF1qFk´spF2qq,\nBk,i “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\npBs,ipF1qFk´spF2q ` As,ipF1qTk´spF2qq,\nTk “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\npTspF1qFk´spF2q ` FspF1qTk´spF2qq,\nFk “ řk s“0\n`\nk k´s\n˘\npTspF1qTk´spF2q ` FspF1qFk´spF2qq.\n144\nThe above four quantities are computed recursively in the function ShNR which is invoked\nin line 4 of Algorithm 22 (the pseudo code of ShNR can be found in Appendix A).\nNote that Tk and Fk are only used to compute Ak,i and Bk,i, which are then used in lines 6 and 8 of Algorithm 22 to compute φNR. Having proved the correctness of computing Ak,i and Bk,i, it remains to prove that the way they are used in lines 6 and 8 correctly computes φNR. It suffices to prove this for a single rule F Ñ 1, as the extension to multiple rules is straight forward in the MC-Net representation. To this end, some player ai can contribute to any ordered coalition T counted in Ak,i, or Bk,i (one of these quantities is zero), if it appears in a random permutation right after the players from T . The remaining players not occurring in T can be arranged in pm´ k ´ 1q! ways (we have |XF | “ m). In case ai contributes to Ak,i, we have\nφNRi “ 1m! řm´1 k“0 pm´ k ´ 1q!Ak,i.\nIn the second case ai contributes to Bk,i; we get\nφNRi “ ´ 1m! řm´1 k“0 pm´ k ´ 1q!Bk,i.\nThese are exactly lines 6 and 8 of Algorithm 22. This concludes the proof of correctness of Algorithm 22. In terms of runtime, it is clear from the pseudo codes (in Algorithm 22 and Appendix B) that the total number of operations is polynomial in the number of agents. This concludes the proof of Theorem 6."

Additionally in this case it holds that: pT, aiql * F ô pT1, aiqm * F1 for m ď l, when l ´m members of coalition T2 go before the m-th member of coalition T1 during the conflation operation and T2 * F1. Again, using Proposition 7 we get:,\nBk,i,l “ řk s“0 řs`1 m“1 ` l´1 l´m ˘` k´l`1 k´l`m´s ˘ Bs,i,mpF1qTk´spF2q.\n— F “ F1 _ F2: Once again let T “ T1 ˆ T2, where T1 P ΠpXF1q, |T1| “ s and T2 P ΠpXF2q, |T2| “ k ´ s. We know that T * F if and only if T1 * F1 and T2 * F2. Furthermore, in this case it holds that pT, aiql ( F ô pT1, aiqm ( F1 for m ď l. Thus,\nAk,i,l “ řk s“0 řs`1 m“1 ` l´1 l´m ˘` k´l`1 k´l`m´s ˘ As,i,mpF1qFk´spF2q.\nAnalogously, we have pT, aiql * F if and only if pT1, aiqm * F1 for m ď l when l ´ m members of coalition T2 go before the m-th member of coalition T1 during the conflation operation, and T2 * F2. Furthermore, in this case it holds that: T ( F ô T1 ( F1.

Now, the ordered coalition T can contribute to Ak,i,l in two ways. Firstly, when T1 ( F1 and T2 ( F2 and pT1, aiqm * F1. Secondly, when T1 * F1 and T2 * F2 and pT1, aiqm ( F1, so\nAk,i,l “ řk s“0 řs`1 m“1 ` l´1 l´m ˘` k´l`1 k´l`m´s ˘` Bs,i,mpF1qTk´spF2q ` As,i,mpF1qFk´spF2q ˘ .\nBk,i,l “ řk s“0 řs`1 m“1 ` l´1 l´m ˘` k´l`1 k´l`m´s ˘` Bs,i,mpF1qFk´spF2q ` As,i,mpF1qTk´spF2q ˘ .\n147\nThe above two quantities (together with Tk and Fk ) are computed recursively in the function ShSB which is invoked in line 4 of Algorithm 23 (the pseudo code of ShSB can be found in Appendix B).\nNote that Tk and Fk are only used to compute Ak,i,l and Bk,i,l, which are then used in lines 6 and 8 of Algorithm 23 to compute ShSB . Having proved the correctness of computing Ak,i,l and Bk,i,l, it remains to prove that the way they are used in lines 6 and 8 correctly computes ShSB . It suffices to prove this for a single rule F Ñ 1, as the extension to multiple rules is straight forward in the MC-Net representation. To this end, some player ai can contribute to any ordered coalition T counted in Ak,i,l, or Bk,i,l, if it appears in a permutation right after the pl´ 1qth player from T . The remaining players (i.e., those not belonging to T ) can be arranged in pm´ k ´ 1q! ways (we have |XF | “ m). In case ai contributes to Ak,i,l, we have\nφSBi “ 1m! řm´1 k“0 1 k`1 řk`1 l“1 pm´ k ´ 1q!Ak,i,l.\nIn the second case, when ai contributes to Bk,i,l, we get\nφSBi “ ´ 1m! řm´1 k“0 1 k`1 řk`1 l“1 pm´ k ´ 1q!Bk,i,l.\nThese are exactly lines 6 and 8 of Algorithm 23. This concludes the proof of correctness of Algorithm 23. In terms of runtime, it is clear from the pseudo codes (in Algorithm 23 and Appendix B) that the total number of operations is polynomial in the number of agents. This concludes the proof of Theorem 7.\nFinally, it is worth making a few remarks about the problem of generating a representation of a game in our framework. We know that given a representation of a game in our framework, we can for example compute the NR and SB values in polynomial time. But how hard is it to come up with a representation of a game in our framework?\nSuppose we are given a black box representation of a characteristic function, i.e., an oracle for the function that can be queried in unit time to determine the value of any ordered coalition. Then, it is not hard to see that it will require time exponential in the number of players to produce a representation of it in our framework. This is because we cannot avoid having to query the oracle for the value of every possible ordered coalition, and there are clearly exponentially many of them.\nAnother obvious question is whether other representations can easily be “translated” to our representation. Here, we have better news. For example, a representation of a game in Ieong and Shoham’s MC-Nets representation can be transformed into our representation in polynomial time: MC-Net rules correspond directly to rules in our framework requiring only basic atomic formulae (BAFs). In the same way, the subgraph representation introduced by Deng and Papadimitriou [1994] (which is, in fact, a special case of the MC-Net representation)\n148\ncan also be translated into our framework in polynomial time. Each edge of the graph translates to a rule with a BAF containing only two players.\nIt is worth noting that we are not aware of any other attempts in the literature to develop representations for generalized coalitional games. If such were developed, then it would be interesting to consider the problem of translating between representations."

      "text" : "As mentioned in the introduction, it is possible to use the game-theoretic solution concepts, including the Nowak-Radzik and Sánchez-Bergantiños values, to measure centrality of nodes in networks [del Pozo et al., 2011]. In this section, we show how to extend the classic notion of betweenness centrality to generalized game-theoretic betweenness centrality which builds upon generalized characteristic function games and the NR and SB values. After that, we show that it is possible to use generalized read-once MC-Nets to compute the new centrality in time polynomial in the number of shortest paths in the network.\nWhile betweenness centrality (Definition 16) is focused on the role in the network played by individual nodes, and group betweenness centrality (Definition 22) is designed to measure the power of the set of nodes, the measure proposed by Puzis et al. [2007b] captures the notion of the sequences of nodes. Their measure, called path betweenness centrality, evaluates sequences of nodes and counts the proportion of shortest paths that traverse along a given sequence of nodes in an appropriate order. Formally:\nDefinition 48 (Path betweenness centrality). Given a graph G “ pV,Eq, we define the set of all ordered coalitions of nodes in the graph, i.e., T “ Ť\nCP2V ΠpCq. The path betweenness centrality of the ordered group of nodes T is defined as a function cpb : T Ñ R such that:\ncpbpT q “ ÿ\nsRT tRT\nσstpT q σst , (8.9)\nwhere σst denotes the number of all shortest paths from s to t and σstpT q is the number of shortest paths from s to t passing through all nodes from T (if s P T or t P T then σstpT q “ 0) such that the order of visited nodes is maintained (for path p we have T tĎp).\nSimilarly to other game-theoretic extension of classic centrality measures recently considered in the literature (see Section 3.2), the above function, that assigns values to all ordered groups (coalitions) of nodes, can be considered to be a value function, i.e., in our case,\n149\nthe generalized characteristic function. Now, the NR and SB values computed for this function become the generalized game-theoretic betweenness centrality.2\nDefinition 49 (Generalized representation function). A generalized representation function is a function ψg : G Ñ V gG that maps every graph G “ pV,Eq onto a generalized cooperative game pNA, νgGq P V g G with A “ V .\nNow, solution concepts like Nowak-Radzik and Sánchez-Bergantiños values can be used in\nthe network setting by applying them to the characteristic function that a network represents.\nDefinition 50 (Generalized Game-theoretic centrality measure). Formally, we define a generalized game-theoretic centrality measure as a pair pψg, φq consisting of a representation function ψg and a solution concept φ.\nDefinition 51 (Generalized Game-theoretic Betweenness Centrality). The generalized game-theoretic betweenness centrality is a pair pψgB, φq, where ψ g BpGq “ cpb is the path betweenness centrality, the value of each node v P V is given by φvpcpbq, and φ is the Nowak-Radzik value (φNR) or Sánchez-Bergantiños value (φSB ).\nIn the previous chapters we have shown that some game-theoretic centrality measures can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the network, i.e., in the number of nodes and edges. While in the literature there is no such a positive result for the generalized game-theoretic betweenness centrality, we will now show that it is possible to compute it in time polynomial in the number of shortest paths in the network and with the help of our generalized read-once MC-Nets.\nIn particular, given a network G “ pV,Eq, Algorithm 24 builds, for each shortest path in the network, a corresponding generalized read-once rule. More specifically, after initialization, we iterate over all shortest paths in the network. For each shortest path, in line 7, we initialize the formula F with ordered atomic formula corresponding to the sequence of all the nodes on the path. Next, in line 8, we add a conjunction that ensures that no other nodes can appear in an ordered coalition that satisfies our formula.\nThe size of the set GR constructed by this algorithm equals to the number of shortest paths in the graph and can be exponential in the number of vertices. However, in many graphs we have |GR| ! T , which makes this algorithm much more efficient than computing this measure directly using equation (8.3) or equation (8.6) for φNR and φSB , respectively.\n2 We note that the game-theoretic betweenness centrality was introduced in Chapter 5 but this measure does not account for the order of players.\n150\nAlgorithm 24: Computing the generalized game-theoretic betweenness centrality Input: Graph G “ pV,Eq, path betweenness centrality cpb, game solution φ Output: φv for all v P V 1 for v P V do φv Ð 0; GRÐH; // initialize the set of generalized read-once formulas 2 for v P V do 3 for u P V do 4 SP Ð shortestPathspv, uq; // compute using a BFS algorithm all shortest paths\nfrom v to u\n5 for pv, . . . , uq P SP do 6 F Ð xv, . . . , uy; 7 F Ð F ^ tV zXFu; 8 V Ð cpbppv, . . . , uqq; 9 GRÐ GRY pF Ñ V q;\n10 if φ ““ φNR then 11 COMP_NRpGRq; // use Algorithm 22 12 else if φ ““ φSB then 13 COMP_SBpGRq; // use Algorithm 23"

In this chapter we considered both the representation and computational aspects of these games. In particular, building upon the state-of-the-art read-once MC-Nets for the Shapley value by Elkind et al. [2009a], we proposed the first computationally-convenient formalism to model games with ordered coalitions. Moreover, our Generalized Marginal-Contribution Nets representation allows to compute effectively the Nowak-Radzik and Sánchez-Bergantiños values.

      "heading" : "9. Summary and Potential Extensions",
      "text" : "In this dissertation, we developed 10 and analyzed additional 5 efficient algorithms computing different coalitional game solutions on graphs (the most important of them were presented in Table 9.1). These positive results in the domain of networks involved three fundamental centrality metrics: degree, closeness and betweenness. The game-theoretic solution concepts, such as the Shapley value, or Nowak-Radzik value, computed for these three measures gave us the new class of centrality metrics—the game-theoretic centrality measures.\nIn Chapter 4, two algorithms were introduced: Algorithm 1 for Shapley value-based degree centrality and Algorithm 4 for Shapley value-based closness centrality. Both algorithms can be easily applied to weighted and unweighted graphs. In this chapter we also presented three generalizations of these two measures. Additionally, Algorithm 1 was an inspiration for Szczepański et al. [2015a], who computed efficiently on networks Interaction Index based on degree centrality.\nIn the next Chapter 5 four algorithms were introduced to compute different version of game-theoretic betweenness centrality. Algorithm 12 and Algorithm 15 compute Shapley value-based betweenness centrality for weighted and unweighted networks, respectively. The another two Algorithms 13 for unweighted and Algorithms 16 for weighted graphs are an implementation of Semivalue-based betweenness centrality.\nOwen value-based degree centrality was introduced in Chapter 6 together with two polynomial time algorithms. Firstly, in Algorithm 17 the general method for computing Coalitional Semivalue-based centrality measure was introduced. Secondly, in Algorithm 18 we introduced the faster method to compute Owen value-based degree centrality, which was an optimization of Algorithm 17 to calculate this particular Coalitional Semivalue.\nThe contribution of this dissertation not only consists of positive results. In particular, in Chapter 7 it was proven that computing Shapley value for connectivity games is #P-hard. However, against this negative results the Algorithm 20 was developed to compute Shapley value much faster than the brute force approach for connectivity games. This algorithm allows us to study much bigger real-life networks, and also was an inspiration for developing even faster methods to analyze connectivity games and graph-restricted games [Skibski et al., 2014, Michalak et al., 2015a].\nIn the last Chapter 8 the new representation of generalized coalitional games was introduced. Importantly, we developed two algorithms that in time polynomial in the\n152\nsize of the representation computes the Nowak-Radzik value (Algorithms 22) and the Sánchez-Bergantiños value (Algorithms 23). Based on this representation the Algorithm 24 was introduced to compute Nowak-Radzik value-based and Sánchez-Bergantiños value-based betweenness centrality.\nApart from computational results, it was experimentally shown that game-theoretic centrality measures were useful to analyze scale-free and real-life networks. In Chapter 5, the extensive simulations showed that game-theoretic betweenness centrality was a better measure to protect network against simultaneous nodes failures than the standard betweenness centrality.\nThe experiments performed on scientific citation network in Chapter 6 suggested that Owen value-based weighted degree centrality could be successfully used to evaluate the significance of publications, while taking into account the importance of journals and conference venues. Speaking more generally, the importance of a single node stems not only from its individual power, but also from the power of community it belongs to. Owen value-based centrality measure is the first measure in literature that takes this fact into account.\nIn Chapter 7 a terrorist network was analyzed with a centrality build upon connectivity games. In particular, our algorithm proposed in this chapter allowed to analyze real-life WTC 9/11 terrorist network with 36 members and 125 identified connections.\nThere are a number of directions for future work. Table 9.1 presents our main computational results vs. the gaps in the literature. For instance it is still an open question if it is possible to compute Owen value-based betweenness centrality in polynomial time? Such measure would find interesting applications to analyze financial institution networks, in which many institutions form strictly collaborating conglomerates. As can be seen from Table 9.1 there are more open questions regarding computation aspects of the game-theoretic centrality measures.\nIn this dissertation we analyzed three types of coalitional games: the standard games, games with coalitional structure, and generalized coalitional games. Nevertheless, there are still other classes of coalitional games, such as games with either positive or negative externalities [Yi, 1997, Michalak et al., 2009], that have been extensively studied in game theory and that may yield interesting results when applied to network centrality.\nIt is also interesting to analyse the properties of game-theoretic network centralities constructed on solution concepts from cooperative game theory other than the Shapley value, or Semivalues. In particular, more general solution concepts such as the core [Osborne and Rubinstein, 1994] or the nucleolus [Schmeidler, 1969] could be also used as a centrality metric.\nThere are several other potential directions for future work. Firstly, it would be interesting to extend the algorithms proposed in this thesis to streaming graphs [Green et al., 2012]. The challenge here is to efficiently re-compute the centralities and update the ranking of nodes after each change in the structure of the network, i.e., after adding/removing some nodes and/or edges. Secondly, we are keen to develop polynomial-time algorithms for the most specific\n153\nvariation of centralities analyzed in this dissertation, such as routing betweenness centrality [Dolev et al., 2010] built upon betweenness centrality. Finally, we would like to identify various axiomatic systems that each uniquely characterize our centrality measure. Such an axiomatic approach is common in the literature on cooperative game theory, and we believe it would be interesting to follow a similar approach to analyse centrality measures in general, and ours in particular.\nFurthermore, our contribution on representation can be extended in various directions, two of them seem particularly interesting. On the one hand, it would be interesting to consider representation formalism other than MC-Nets, such as Algebraic Decision Diagrams [Aadithya et al., 2011, Sakurai et al., 2011], to model generalized characteristic function games. On the other hand, it is worth analyzing if our representation can produce algorithms that compute generalized game-theoretic centrality measures build upon degree and closness centralities.\nFinally, it would be worth developing a more formal and general approach that would allow us to construct coalitional games defined over networks that correspond to other known centrality metrics or even entire families of them. Such an approach would involve developing a group centrality first and then building a characteristic function of a coalitional game upon it. Of course, while developing new centrality metrics based on coalitional games, one should keep in mind computational properties of the proposed solutions. Although we were able to obtain satisfactory computational results for a number of games, the computation of the game-theoretic network centrality may become much more challenging for more complex definitions of the characteristic function."

    "abstractText" : "In this dissertation, we analyze the computational properties of game-theoretic centrality measures. The key idea behind game-theoretic approach to network analysis is to treat nodes as players in a cooperative game, where the value of each coalition of nodes is determined by certain graph properties. Next, the centrality of any individual node is determined by a chosen game-theoretic solution concept (notably, the Shapley value) in the same way as the payoff of a player in a cooperative game. On one hand, the advantage of game-theoretic centrality measures is that nodes are ranked not only according to their individual roles but also according to how they contribute to the role played by all possible subsets of nodes. On the other hand, the disadvantage is that the game-theoretic solution concepts are typically computationally challenging. The main contribution of this dissertation is that we show that a wide variety of game-theoretic solution concepts on networks can be computed in polynomial time. Our focus is on centralities based on the Shapley value and its various extensions, such as the Semivalues and Coalitional Semivalues. Furthermore, we prove #P-hardness of computing the Shapley value in connectivity games and propose an algorithm to compute it. Finally, we analyse computational properties of generalized version of cooperative games in which order of player matters. We propose a new representation for such games, called generalized marginal contribution networks, that allows for polynomial computation in the size of the representation of two dedicated extensions of the Shapley value to this class of games.",
