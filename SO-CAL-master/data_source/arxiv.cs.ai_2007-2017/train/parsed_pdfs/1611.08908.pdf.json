      "text" : "Modern MILP solvers, e.g., IBM CPLEX or Gurobi, can be defined as “model and run” systems [20]. They embed dynamic procedures so as to to make simple models solved efficiently [2]. Conversely, despite CP is a declarative technology, CP users need significant expertise in order to model their problems appropriately. This expertise is required to select propagators and to state a search strategy, which are main components of the modeling phase. This may put the brakes on a broader uptake of CP.\nIn this paper, we present MICE, a simple API to solve CP models, which may use any MILP engine called from Java. Our objective is not to design a winner between classical, propagation-based CP solvers and MILP engines. Obviously, some problems are best solved by CP and other best solved using MILP; and other require hybridization. Our aim is to help democratizing the “CP-style” modeling standards by providing a black-box tool where models are just variables plus constraints, with solving capabilities good enough for prototyping and teaching. This first step might convince practitioners who are not researchers in optimization or just discover the existence of CP to further increase their expertise. Without such initiation, some developers may not spend time in learning complex concepts, even less a language specifically dedicated to highlevel CP-style modeling. MICE is thus not a competitor to such languages anymore. This idea motivates the design of an API in a popular programming language, where a model just consists of method calls for stating variables and constraints.\nAs CP toolkits are not restricted to a list of linearized global constraints, we provide new theoretical contributions regarding non linear constraints with arithmetic operators (e.g., z = xi × xj or z = xki ), negative and positive tables, and reification. We propose extensions of the CP constraints Deviation and InterDistance to numerical variables. Such case studies show the benefits of the approach for tackling\nproblems that usually require to hybridize discrete and continuous solvers, providing that real constraints can be linearized. Efficiency of solving may then be very good when MICE is associated with a commercial MILP solver. A result of our research is that all new decompositions useful to design MICE revealed to be quite simple."

      "text" : "MILP models support linear constraints, objectives and linearized logical constraints. CP models make no restriction about the constraints. On the other hand, CP variables must range over a finite domain of values. This domain constraint can be encoded by linear constraints, which permitted to linearize many CP global constraints [25,22,6].\nLemma 1 (Domain linearization (from Refalo’s statement [22])). Let D = {v1, . . . , vm} be the domain union of a model. All the domains {d1, . . . , dn} of variables in X can be stated using a set B of O( ∑ i∈{1,...,n} |di|) binary variables and O(n) inequalities. ∀vj ∈ D, ∀xi ∈ X , if vj ∈ di state a binary variable bij . ∀xi, state: (\n∑ vj∈di vjbij)− xi = 0 and ∑ bij :vj∈di bij = 1.\nDomains and table constraints can be represented by linear constraints. As tables are generic and domain are finite, there is no theoretical dominance property between MILP and CP concerning modeling capabilities. CP models are generally more concise than linear models with (global) constraint decompositions. However, some problems require table constraints (without semantics), e.g., in computational biology [18]. Some constraint checkers may not be tractable, even for a ground solution (for instance, min. overlapping variable given a set of rectangles in a fixed plane, stated by length and width variables). At last, it is probably easier to efficiently extend a model with numerical variables using MILP, without the need to discretize space. Modeling in CP and MILP is therefore more complex to compare than it at first seems, which also justifies to investigate how a MILP solver performs as a solution technique for a CP modeler.\nA CP model is not restricted to a set of global constraints whose linear formulations are found in the literature. We need (non linear) constraints built from arithmetic operators, negative and positive tables, and efficient reification. We investigate appropriate solutions to these issues. Especially, we show that table constraints provide a good way to deal with arithmetic operators and can compactly be reified using linear constraints.\nA decomposition of positive table constraints is introduced in [6]: add one binary variable bτk per tuple τk, and state that each variable xi should be constrained by xi =∑|T |\nk=1 bτk .τk[xi]. This formulation needs two additional constraints: (1) ∑|T |\nk=1 bτk ≤ 1. If not, a constraint on {x1, x2, x3} with T = {(1, 1, 1), (3, 3, 3)} would be considered as satisfied if x1 = x2 = x3 = 4. (2) ∑|T |\nk=1 bτk ≥ 1, to have at least one tuple satisfied. As the domain constraint (Lemma 1) ensures unicity of values assigned to variables through some binary variables, we can suppress the first one using a different decomposition. Our new linearization is exclusively stated on binary variables and can be naturally modified to encode negative tables and/or compact reified tables.\nLemma 2 (Positive table linearization). Let c be a constraint defined on var(c) ⊆ X by a set T = {τ1, . . . , τ|T |} of positive tuples. We introduce a set of binary variables\nBT , one-to-one mapped with tuples in T . c can be represented by the domain decomposition of X and O(|T |) inequalities and binary variables. For each tuple τk ∈ T and its corresponding variable bτk ∈ BT state: |var(c)|bτk −( ∑ i,vj∈di:vj=τk[xi] bij) ≤ 0. (1) In addition, state once the constraint: ∑|T |\nk=1 bτk ≥ 1.\nProof. For each tuple, constraint (1) ensures that if bτk = 1 then any variable xi ∈ var(c) takes the value τk[xi]. From such tuple constraints and Lemma 1, ∑ k∈{a,...,|T |} bτk is at most equal to 1, otherwise two tuples in T would be equal. The last inequality constrains ∑ k∈{a,...,|T |} bτk to be at least equal to 1, i.e., the assignment of var(c) corresponds to one tuple of T .\nLemma 3 (Negative table linearization). Let c be a constraint defined on var(c) ⊆ X by a set T = {τ1, . . . , τ|T |} of forbidden tuples. c can be represented by the domain decomposition of X and O(|T |) inequalities. ∀τk ∈ T state: ( ∑ i,vj∈di:vj=τk[xi] bij) ≤ |var(c)| − 1.\nProof. For c to be satisfied, ∀τk ∈ T at least one variable xi ∈ var(c) should take a value vj 6= τk[xi]. From Lemma 1, if xi = vj then bij = 1, otherwise bij = 0.∑\ni,vj∈di:vj=τk[xi] bij must be < |var(c)|.\nSome constraints can be concisely and thus quite efficiently represented by tables, e.g., arithmetic operators. For instance, constraint z = xki where z and xi are integer domain variables and k a positive integer can be stated using |di| allowed tuples. The constraint z = xi × xj requires |di| × |dj | allowed tuples to be stated. Many other constraints are also appropriate for table-based linear representation. The Element constraint can be represented using Lemma 2, thanks to its positive tuples. This formulation is distinct from the existing ones [14,22] and does not add integer variables for indexes.\nLemma 4 (Element linearization). Let xi and xj be two integer domain variables and t an array of integers, not necessarily all distinct. Element is statisfied if an only if xj is equal to the xthi value in the array t. From Lemma 2, Element on (xi, xj) can be decomposed using O(min(|t|, |di|, |dj |)) inequalities and binary variables.\nProof. ∀t[k] ∈ t, add the tuple (k, t[k]) in the table if k ∈ D(xi) and t[k] ∈ D(xj).\nFor sake of space, we do not provide a broader list of constraints that would likely be represented by tables. In some cases, however, the number of tuples may be prohibitive. Let us consider one noticeable case against tables: Alldifferent, that holds iff ∀(xi, xj) ∈ var(c), xi 6= xj . A concise ad-hoc linearization exists [25,22]. In contrast, a positive table would have a number of tuples of the order of magnitude of the number of permutations of the values in domains. The case of a negative table is worst. As some constraints may be difficult to linearize in an ad hoc fashion, we consider two classical CP notions that may help for using tables: decompositions and implied constraints.\nAd Hoc CP Decompositions. In the CP literature, many papers put the focus on decomposing constraints not only using linear equations, but using other (simpler) constraints standardly provided by CP solvers (see, e.g., [9]). In MILP there is no obvious link between the use of global constraints [8] and solving process efficiency, as such constraints must be expressed through linear equations. In the case of Alldifferent, a well-known decomposition is to state for each variable pair a binary inequality. Although representing a binary inequality through table constraints is, to say the least, convoluted, we may note that decomposing makes possible a table-based formulation (using O(d) negative tuples per inequality). Concerning systematic decomposition schemes, the generic automaton based decomposition of the global constraint catalog [4] is well suited to table constraint based linearization, as transition and signature constraints often correspond to positive tables with small scopes. It can be applied on those constraints that can be checked by scanning once through their variables. For instance, using Lemmas 2 and 3, Example 2 of section 3 in [3] provides an exploitable linear decomposition for lexicographical constraints.\nImplied Constraints. The Gcc [23] would likely be implied to any other one, as it refers to occurrences of values in solutions. The Gcc has some particular properties that make it easy to learn from a model [7]. Therefore, it can be an efficient tool for reducing tuples of a negative table (all tuples violating the Gcc are not added to the table).\nDefinition 1 (Gcc). Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a set of variables, t an array of values. Each t[k] ∈ t is associated with two integers t[k] and t[k], 0 ≤ t[k] ≤ t[k]. Gcc holds\nif and only if for all indexes k: t[k] ≤ |{i : xi = t[k]}| ≤ t[k].\nThe next Lemma provides a linear formulation of Gcc that adds O(|t|) binary inequalities to the model. It differs from the existing one [22] because it is related to a simpler version of the Gcc. In Definition 1, bounds on value occurrences are stated using integer values, not variables. In our context variables are useless.\nLemma 5 (Gcc linearization). We use the notations of Lemma 1 and Definition 1. For all t[k] ∈ t, Bt[k] = {bij ∈ B : vj = t[k]}. Gcc can be represented by the domain decomposition of X and O(|t|) inequalities. ∀t[k] ∈ t state: (\n∑ b∈Bt[k] b) ≥\nt[k] and ( ∑\nb∈Bt[k] b) ≤ t[k].\nProof. From Lemma 1, ∀bij ∈ B, bij = 1 if and only if xi = vj .\nUsing a Gcc as an implied constraint introduces only O(|t|) inequalities and no additional variable. Let’s come back to the Alldifferent example. It is worthwhile to notice that adding the implied Gcc eliminates all the tuples of an Alldifferent decomposed by a negative table. We obtain the ad hoc Alldifferent Refalo’s linearization from Lemma 5. This is an extreme case but, more generally, in practical problems implied Gcc’s can have shrink bounds [7].\nReification. Instead of merely posting a constraint c it is often useful to reflect its truth value into a binary variable rc. This process is called reification. It permits to express logical constraints such as ci ∨ cj , or ¬c. Table constraints reification relies to\nideas of Koster’s partial constraint satisfaction formulation in the context of frequency assignment problems [15]. Basically, we can extend the table with variable rc. Naively one may state that rc is equal to 1 for allowed tuples and 0 for forbidden ones. The number of tuples would be all the combinations of values of the cartesian product of |var(c)|. We propose a decomposition that does not increase the number of tuples of c.\nLemma 6 (Table constraint reification). We keep the notations of Lemma 2. The set T can either represent allowed or forbidden tuples. The reification of a table constraint c can be represented by the domain decomposition of X , the binary variable rc used to express the truth value of c and O(|T |) inequalities and binary variables. (1) ∀τk ∈ T state: |var(c)|bτk − ( ∑ i,vj∈di:vj=τk[xi] bij) ≤ 0, and: ( ∑ i,vj∈di:vj=τk[xi] bij) − |var(c)|bτk ≤ |var(c)| − 1. (2) In addition, if tuples in T are allowed tuples state: ( ∑ k∈{a,...,|T |} bτk)− rc = 0, otherwise state: ( ∑ k∈{a,...,|T |} bτk) + rc = 1.\nProof. ∀τk ∈ T the first inequality ensures that if bτk = 1 then all xi ∈ var(c) take the value τk[xi]. If bτk = 0 it is always satisfied. The second one ensures that if bτk = 0 not all the variables xi ∈ var(c) take the value τk[xi]. If bτk = 1 it is always satisfied. From Lemma 1, ∑ k∈{a,...,|T |} bτk ≤ 1. From (2), rc = 1 if and only if the variables in var(c) are fixed with a tuple of T (positive table) or not in T (negative table).\nIf the Gcc is added to the model as an implied constraint related to a reified table, we also need to reify it. For this purpose, or simply as this may be useful in models, we introduce a new linear decomposition.\nLemma 7 (Gcc reification). We use Lemma 5 notations. Let rc be the binary variable for the truth value of the Gcc to be reified. We create O(|t|) binary variables rk+c , mapped with values in t and O(|t|) binary variables rk−c , also mapped. R is the set of all rk−c and all r k+ c variables, of size 2|t|. The reifed Gcc is obtained by the domain decomposition of X . In addition, ∀t[k] ∈ t state:\n( ∑\nb∈Bt[k]\nb)−t[k]rk−c ≥ 0. (1) ( ∑\nb∈Bt[k]\nb)−rk−c (n+1) ≤ t[k]−1. (2)\n( ∑\nb∈Bt[k]\nb) + (t[k] + 1)rk+c ≥ t[k] + 1 ( ∑\nb∈Bt[k]\nb) + nrk+c ≤ t[k] + n.\nMoreover, state once: ( ∑ r∈R r)−rc ≤ 2|t|−1. (3) ( ∑ r∈R r)−2|t|rc ≥ 0. (4)\nProof. We first consider the case of one value t[k] ∈ t. Without loss of generality we restrict to t[k] (the case of maximum occurence is symmetrical). If r−kc = 0 then (1) is always satisfied and (2) is satisfied if and only if\n∑ b∈Bt[k] ≤ t[k]−1, i.e., the minimum\nrequired number of occurrences of t[k] is not reached. If rk−c = 1 then (2) is always satisfied and (1) is satisfied if and only if (\n∑ b∈Bt[k] b) ≥ t[k]. Then, consider all values.\nIf ∑\nr∈R r = 2|t| then all lower and upper cardinalities are in the request bounds, rc = 1 to satisfy constraint (3). Otherwise, (3) is always satisfied. If ∑ r∈R r < 2|t| then rc = 0 to satisfy constraint (4). Otherwise, (4) is always satisfied. The Lemma holds.\nFor sake of space we do not provide a broader list of reified global constraints. It is worth saying that the general idea behind reification is generic: isolate a satisfaction property and then use the “Big-M” principle to obtain the boolean value. This general principle can also be used for the constraints on numerical variables presented in next section. We claim that its simplicity is a valuable result.\n3 The MICE modeler\nMICE is a Java modeler devoted to solve CP models using any MILP engine that can be called from Java. MICE embeds predefined global constraints1, tables, arithmetic and logical operators. The two central ideas of MICE design are the following. 1. Simplicity of use. MICE is primarily designed to provide users who are not expert in optimization with an autonomous tool for solving CP models. A MICE model is just defined by stating variables and high-level constraints, set on integer or numerical variables, to tackle also discrete-continuous problems. 2. Modular design. MICE provides its own API for stating linear constraints. Therefore, all predefined constraints as well as user decompositions are stated using MICE objects. To plug MICE to a new MILP solver, the main class, called Solver, should be augmented by a call to the method creating a new model in the MILP solver. In addition, a unique new class must be created. This class implements an interface that states the methods used to create mathematical variables and linear constraints within the MILP engine (this makes the link with MICE linear expressions), to call specific methods for running the MILP solver, limiting time, and some getters (value of a mathematical variable, solver statistics, etc.). MICE can solve satisfaction and optimization problems. Logical constraints are set through tables on reification variables. Given any two reified constraints c1 and c2, ReifOR is a table2 on the truth variables r1 and r2 and a new variable r: the allowed tuples on {r1, r2, r} are {(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), (1, 1, 1)}. Stating OR is then r = 1. The cases of AND, ¬ and → (implication) are similar. There is no limitation about the number of logical operator combinations on reified constraints.\nMICE permits to use in the same model global constraints on integer and numerical variables. Consider that every variable x comes up with a lower bound x and an upper bound x (without loss of generality, these values can be the minimum and maximum value encodable by the computer). Next definition (derived from the Santa Claus benchmark [12]) generalizes the Deviation constraint [26], stated to obtain balanced solutions to combinatorial problems, by considering a numerical variable for the mean instead of an (arbitrary) integer value.\nDefinition 2 (Extended Deviation). Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a set of variables (integer or numerical). Let z and s be numerical variables. Deviation holds if and only if: nz = ( ∑n i=1 xi) and s = ( ∑n i=1 |xi − z|).\nTo linearize Deviationwe first need to linearize the constraint abs = |x− y|, where x, y and abs are mathematical variables of any type.\n1 A set of global constraints similar to existing CP solvers such as Choco or OR-Tools. 2 To simplify the description we do not use Lemma 6, although the two formulations can obvi-\nously be considered.\nLemma 8 (abs = |x−y| linearization). We use the following notations: Given x, x, y, and y, a is the minimum possible value of |x − y| and A the maximum possible value. d is the minimum possible value of x − y and D the maximum possible value. We then distinguish three cases.\n1. D ≤ 0. Add abs − y + x = 0. 2. d ≥ 0. Add abs − x+ y = 0. 3. d < 0 < D. Add a ≤ abs and abs ≤ A, define three variables dif , difp and difn ,\na binary variable b and state:\ndif − x+ y = 0. (1) 0 ≤ difp and difp ≤ D. (2)\n0 ≤ difn and difn ≤ |d|. (3) d ≤ dif and dif ≤ D. (4)\ndif − difp + difn = 0. (5) difp −Db ≤ 0. (6)\ndifn + |d|b ≤ |d|. (7) abs − difp − difn = 0. (8)\nProof. Cases 1 and 2 are obvious. If d < 0 < D, constraints (2) (3) and (4) state the bounds of difp , difn and dif . From (1), dif = x − y. (5) states x − y = difp − difn . From (2) and (3) difp ≥ 0 and difn ≥ 0. We have: either difp > 0, then from (6) b = 1, and from (7) difn = 0: from (8), abs = x − y; or difn > 0, from (7) b = 0, from (6) difp = 0: from (8), abs = y − x; otherwise, abs = difp = difn = 0.\nFrom Lemma 8 and Definition 2, we decompose Deviation.\nLemma 9 (Deviation linearization). We denote by DistanceXYZ(x, y, abs) the linearization of constraint abs = |x − y| of Lemma 8. Let Z = {abs1, . . . , absn} be numerical variables. Deviation (Definition 2) can be represented by the following set of linear constraints: ∀xi ∈ X,DistanceXYZ(xi, z, abs i). In addition state once: nz − ( ∑n i=1 xi) = 0 and s− ( ∑n i=1 abs i) = 0.\nThe InterDistance constraint [24,21] holds on integer variables {x1, . . . , xn} and a constant p if and only if |xi − xj | ≥ p for all i 6= j. Our decomposition extends it to variables of any type and a numerical variable for p: ∀xi, xj , i < j, state DistanceXYZ(xi, xj , abs ij) and abs ij ≥ p."

We consider CP solvers that can be called from Java, and, to truly compare with classical CP, with an API for stating advanced search strategies. In this paper our goal is to compare with CP, not with hybrid techniques or systems adding implicit constraints to the model, even less to solvers specific to one particular problem.

MICE with Gurobi vs CP: maximization problems.\nthe Alldifferent global constraint (we report the best result among the two solvers/different propagator options). We compare linear decompositions of Alldifferent through negative binary tables and Refalo’s formulation. Surprisingly, the results are quite similar using tables or not on this set of instances. We do not consider, in a short paper, reproducing known results on optimization problems with ad hoc global constraint formulations [25,22,6] that are also implemented in MICE. Using MICE in this context would lead to the same conclusions. Rather, Table 2 reports results about the CP-style modeling features of MICE to solve the Max-Cut nonlinear (quadratic) optimization problem that occurs in physics applications [16], without any handcrafted model transformation. Given an undirected graph with weighted edges Gw = (V,Ew), Max-Cut is the problem of finding a cut in G of maximum weight. A variable xi is stated for each vertex in V . xi = 1 if vertex vi is in S and xi = −1 otherwise. We maximize 12 ∑ i<j wij(1−xixj). We encoded this problem in Choco 3.3.3 and MICE. In MICE, the default product constraint corresponds to a positive table. In CP, the best strategy we found is DomOverWdeg [10] and first assign vertices.We used Beasley instances from the OR-Libary and problems from g05 60 Rudy instances4, with a 10 min. time-limit. Graphs have respectively 50 nodes and weights in [−100, 100], and 30- 50 nodes unweighted. At last, we evaluated our modeler on the Santa Claus benchmark, recently solved by hybridizing discrete and continuous CP solvers, namely Choco 3.3.3 and Ibex 2.3.1 [11]. We use the model provided in [12], with Alldifferent and Element on integer variables and Deviation with a continuous variable for the mean. Table 3 shows time for proving the optimal solution, with a 10 minutes limit.\nThroughout the development of MICE, we revisited linear formulations of global and table constraints and their reification, non linear constraints built from arithmetic/logical operators, and extensions of Deviation and InterDistance to numerical variables. New integer constraint decompositions exclusively involve new binary variables. An interesting result is that all linear formulations in MICE are simple.

Our results are good in the context of promoting the CP-style modeling with a simple library, implemented in a popular programming language.
