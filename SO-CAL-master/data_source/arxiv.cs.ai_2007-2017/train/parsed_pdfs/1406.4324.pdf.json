      "text" : "Set theory as a branch of human endeavour was developed by the efforts of many mathematicians [ Kam ]. Such a theory found many applications in science, technology and other fields. In an effort to capture uncertainity in human reasoning, Zadeh formulated and studied the theory of fuzzy sets. The theory of fuzzy sets found applications in many branches of science and technology. Pawlak, a computer scientist proposed and studied the concept of rough set in an effort to capture other aspects of uncertainity arising in applications such as database design. The theory of rough sets is found to have complemented the theory of fuzzy sets.\nThe author, in his research efforts related\nto the fusion problem in Wireless Sensor Networks ( WSN ) discovered the idea of “graded set” ( discussed in Section 2 ) as a generalization of the idea of rough set. When understanding the details of rough set theory, the author discovered the idea of “granular set”. The basic motivation for such sets is discussed below. Motivation for Granular Sets:\nIn biological systems such as trees, when the tissue\nis examined under a microscope at different resolutions, different cells/parts are observed. It is very clear that as the resolution increases, finer granular structure is observed. Our goal is to arrive at a mathematical abstraction of such sets observed in biological systems ( physical, chemical, biological etc ) as well as artificial systems ( such as databases ). It is expected that a detailed theory of such sets will find many applications as in the case of rough sets, fractal sets etc."

One such application is sensor fusion of interval valued measurements. Particularly we consider the “F” fusion function proposed by Schmidt et.al."

It is clear that the end points c, d depend on the number of faulty intervals ( from say sensors ).\n We are interested in understanding how graded sets naturally arise when the number of faulty intervals ( from sensors ) is varied from a smallest to largest value.\nSpecifically, let \uD835\uDC53 ∈ { \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B , \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B + 1, \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B + 2, … . , \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 }. From the above specified method of computing the left and right end points of fused estimate, we have the following result.

Proof: The result follows from the definition of “F” fusion function of Schmidt et.al. Corollary: The above result also applies to “M”, “N” fusion functions i.e. When f is increased from \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B to \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 , the fused estimates from “M”, “N” functions constitute a graded set.\n Thus, in summary, with the number of faulty intervals/sensors as a parameter, the output of fused function is a graded set\n Suppose the number of faulty sensors assumes only two values i.e { \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B , \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC65 }, then the associated fused set constitutes a rough set. \uD835\uDC45\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5A \uD835\uDC3A\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC51 \uD835\uDC46\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC61: Definition: Consider the case where the number of faulty sensors is a discrete random variable. As a consequence, the output of “F”fusion function assumes various intervals with associated probabilities. Hence when the number of faulty sensors is varied from the lowest to the highest value, we arrive at what we call as a RANDOM GRANULAR SET. The above concept motivates the idea where the outcomes in a probability space are mapped to sets ( unlike the concept of a random variable where the outcomes\nare mapped to real/complex numbers ) i.e. the domain of mapping is outcomes in a finite/countable set and the range is sets."

E. D+\nRemark 1: It should be noted that with X ( the set of all objects ) as the target set and “P” being chosen as one of the various possible graded sets, the associated collection of equivalence classes constitute a granular set.\nRemark 2: The above discussion points to the fact that in any “hierarchical classification” effort ( as in the case of information table based classification in data bases ), the set that naturally arises is a “granular set”.\n Generalization of Rough Set Concepts: Graded Sets: We now reason that,\ngraded sets arise as a natural generalization of rough sets in classification problem.\nFrom the rough set theory, we have that the target set X can be\napproximated using only the information contained within P by constructing the P-lower ( denoted by P X ) and P-upper approximation ( denoted by \uD835\uDC43 \uD835\uDC4B ) of X:\nP X = { x | [x]\uD835\uDC43 is a subset of X }\n\uD835\uDC43 \uD835\uDC4B = \uD835\uDC65 [\uD835\uDC65 ]\uD835\uDC43 ∩ \uD835\uDC4B ≠ ∅ } . Now we are interested in understanding what happens if the target set , \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56 is varied in the following manner i.e.\n\uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56 \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC60 \uD835\uDC4E \uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC62\uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC60\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC61 \uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC53 \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56+1 \uD835\uDC53\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5F 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC56 ≤ (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) .\ni.e. \uD835\uDC4C = [ \uD835\uDC4B1 ∶ \uD835\uDC4B2 ∶ … . ∶ \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC3F ] is a graded set. From the above definitions of lower and upper approximations of P, it is clear that\nP \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56 is a subset of P \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56+1 for 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC56 ≤ (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) and that\n\uD835\uDC43 \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56 is a subset of \uD835\uDC43 \uD835\uDC4B\uD835\uDC56+1 for 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC56 ≤ (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) .\nThus, we necessarily have that the lower and upper approximations constitute “graded sets” when the target set constitutes a graded set.\n Generalization of Information System: We conceive of an information\nsystem which is represented by a three dimensional array ( and not a 2- dimensional matrix as given in the above example ). Thus the 3-dimensional array corresponds to “objects/patterns” versus “various sets of features”. The feature sets could be dependent on one another. Thus, we have a collection of “information tables”, that are all captured in a three-dimensional information array."
