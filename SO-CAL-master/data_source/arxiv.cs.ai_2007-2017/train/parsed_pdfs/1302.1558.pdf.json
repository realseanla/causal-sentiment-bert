    "abstractText" : "This paper introduces a computational framework for reasoning in Bayesian belief networks that derives significant advantages from focused inference and relevance reason­ ing. This framework is based on d-separation and other simple and computationally effi­ cient techniques for pruning irrelevant parts of a network. Our main contribution is a technique that we call relevance-based decom­ position. Relevance-based decomposition ap­ proaches belief updating in large networks by focusing on their parts and decompos­ ing them into partially overlapping subnet­ works. This makes reasoning in some in­ tractable networks possible and, in addition, often results in significant speedup, as the to­ tal time taken to update all subnetworks is in practice often considerably less than the time taken to update the network as a whole. We report results of empirical tests that demon­ strate practical significance of our approach.",
