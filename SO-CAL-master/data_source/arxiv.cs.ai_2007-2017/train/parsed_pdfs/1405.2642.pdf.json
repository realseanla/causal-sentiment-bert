      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Over the last three decades [15], abduction has been embraced in AI as a nonmonotonic reasoning paradigm to address some of the limitations of deductive reasoning in classical logic. The role of abduction has been demonstrated in a variety of applications. It has been proposed as a reasoning paradigm in AI for diagnosis, natural language understanding, default reasoning, planning, knowledge assimilation and belief revision, multi-agent systems and other problems (see [47]).\nIn the concept of knowledge assimilation and belief revision (see [38]), when a new item of information is added to a knowledge base, inconsistency can result. Revision means modifying the Horn knowledge base in order to maintain consistency, while keeping the new information and removing (contraction) or not removing the least possible previous information. In our case, update means revision and contraction, that is insertion and deletion in database perspective. Our previous work [10,11] makes connections with contraction from Horn knowledge base dynamics.\nOur Horn knowledge base dynamics is defined in two parts: an immutable part (formulae or sentences) and updatable part (literals) (for definition and\nproperties see works of Nebel [35] and Segerberg [48]). Horn knowledge bases have a set of integrity constraints (see the definitions in later section). In the case of finite Horn knowledge bases, it is sometimes hard to see how the update relations should be modified to accomplish certain knowledge base updates.\nExample 1. Consider a database with an (immutable) rule that a staff member is a person who is currently working in a research group under a chair. Additional (updatable) facts are that matthias and gerhard are group chairs, and delhibabu and aravindan are staff members in group info1. Our first integrity constraint (IC) is that each research group has only one chair ie. ∀x, y, z (y=z)← group chair(x,y) ∧ group chair(x,z). Second integrity constraint is that a person can be a chair for only one research group ie. ∀x, y, z (y=z)← group chair(y,x) ∧ group chair(z,x).\nImmutable part: staff chair(X,Y)← staff group(X,Z),group chair(Z,Y).\nUpdatable part: group chair(infor1,matthias)← group chair(infor2,gerhard)← staff group(delhibabu,infor1)← staff group(aravindan,infor1)←\nSuppose we want to update this database with the information, staff chair(delhibabu,aravindan), that is\nstaff chair(delhibabu,aravindan)← staff group(delhibabu,Z) ∧\ngroup chair(Z,aravindan)\nIf we are restricted to definite clauses, there is only one plausible way to do this: delhibabu and aravindan belong to groups infor1, this updating means that we need to delete (remove) matthias from the database and newly add (insert) aravindan to the database (aravindan got promoted to the chair of the research group infor1 and he was removed from research group infor1). This results in an update that is too strong. If we allow disjunctive information into the database, however, we can accomplish the update by minimal adding wrt consistency\nstaff group(delhibabu,infor1) ∨ group chair(infor1,aravindan)\nand this option appears intuitively to be correct. When adding new beliefs to the Horn knowledge base, if the new belief is violating integrity constraints then belief revision needs to be performed, otherwise, it is simply added. As we will see, in these cases abduction can be used in order to compute all the possibilities and it is not up to user or system to choose among them.\nWhen dealing with the revision of a Horn knowledge base (both insertions and deletions), there are other ways to change a Horn knowledge base and it has to be performed automatically also. Considering the information, change is precious and must be preserved as much as possible. The principle of minimal\nchange [21,46] can provide a reasonable strategy. On the other hand, practical implementations have to handle contradictory, uncertain, or imprecise information, so several problems can arise: how to define efficient change in the style of AGM [1]; what result has to be chosen [25,29,33]; and finally, according to a practical point of view, what computational model to support for Horn knowledge base revision has to be provided?\nSince Horn knowledge base change is one of the main problems arising in knowledge representation, it has been tackled according to several points of view. In this article, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for belief dynamics (see [3,8,50]).\nThe rest of paper is organized as follows: First we start with preliminaries along with the concept of logical system and properties of consequences operator. In Section 3, we introduce Horn knowledge base dynamics with our logical system. In Section 4, we explore the relationship of Horn knowledge base dynamics with coherence approach. In Section 5, we present how Horn knowledge base dynamics can be realized using abductive explanations. In Section 6, we give brief overview of related works. In Section 7, we make conclusions with a summary of our contribution as well as a discussion of future directions of investigation."

      "heading" : "2 Preliminaries",
      "text" : "A first order language consists of an alphabet A of a language L. We assume a countable universe of variables Var, ranged over x,y,z, and a countable universe of relation (i.e predicate) symbols, ranged over by A. The following grammar defines FOL, the language of first order logic with equality and binary relations:\nϕ ::= x = x | a(x, x) | ¬ϕ | ∨ φ | ∧ φ | ∃X : φ.\nHere φ ⊆ FOL and X ⊆ V ar are finite sets of formulae and variables, respectively.\nDefinition 1 (Normal Logic Program [22]). By an alphabet A of a language L we mean disjoint sets of constants, predicate symbols, and function symbols, with at least one constant. In addition, any alphabet is assumed to contain a countably infinite set of distinguished variable symbols. A term over A is defined recursively as either a variable, a constant or an expression of the form f(t1, ..., tn) where f is a function symbol of A, n its arity, and the ti are terms. An atom over A is an expression of the form P (t1, ..., tn) where P is a predicate symbol of A and the ti are terms. A literal is either an atom A or its default negation not A. We dub default literals those of the form not A. A term (resp. atom, literal) is said ground if it does not contain variables. The set of all ground terms (resp. atoms) of A is called the Herbrand universe (resp. base) of A. A Normal Logic Program is a possibly infinite set of rules (with no infinite descending chains of syntactical dependency) of the form:\nH ← B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm, (with m, n ≥ 0 and finit)\nWhere H, the Bi and the Cj are atoms, and each rule stands for all its ground instances. In conformity with the standard convention, we write rules of the form H ← also simply as H (known as fact). An NLP P is called definite if none of its rules contain default literals. H is the head of the rule r, denoted by head(r), and body(r) denotes the set {B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm} of all the literals in the body of r.\nWhen doing problem modeling with logic programs, rules of the form\n⊥ ← B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm, (with m, n ≥ 0 and finit)\nwith a non-empty body are known as a type of integrity constraints (ICs), specifically denials, and they are normally used to prune out unwanted candidate solutions. We abuse the not default negation notation applying it to non-empty sets of literals too: we write not S to denote {not s : s ∈ S}, and confound not not a ≡ a. When S is an arbitrary, non-empty set of literals S = {B1, ..., Bn, not C1, ..., not Cm} we use:\n- S+ denotes the set {B1, . . . , Bn} of positive literals in S . - S− denotes the set {not C1, . . . , not Cm} of negative literals in S . - |S| = S+ ∪ (not S−) denotes the set {B1, . . . , Bn, C1, . . . , Cm} of atoms of S.\nAs expected, we say a set of literals S is consistent iff S+ ∩ |S−| = ∅. We also write heads(P ) to denote the set of heads of non-IC rules of a (possibly constrained) program P , i.e., heads(P ) = {head(r) : r ∈ P}\\{⊥}, and facts(P ) to denote the set of facts of P - facts(P ) = {head(r) : r ∈ P ∧ body(r) = ∅}.\nDefinition 2 (Level mapping[4]). Let P be a normal logic program and BP its Herbrand base. A level mapping for P is a function ‖: BP → N of ground atoms to natural numbers. The mapping ‖ is also extended to ground literals by assigning | ¬A | = | A | for all ground atoms A ∈ BP . For every literal ground L, | L | is called as the level of L in P.\nDefinition 3 (Acyclic program [4]). Let P be a normal logic program and ‖ a level mapping for P. P is called as acyclic with respect to ‖ if for every ground clause H ← L1, ..., Ln (with n ≥ 0 and finit) in P the level of A is higher then the level of every Li (1 ≤i≤ n). Moreover P is called acyclic if P is acyclic with respect to some level mapping for P.\nUnlike Horn knowledge base dynamics, where knowledge is defined as a set of sentences, here we wish to define a Horn knowledge base KB wrt a language L, as an abductive framework < P,Ab, IC,K >, where,\n* P is an acyclic normal logic program with all abducibles in P at level 0 and no non-abducible at level 0. P is referred to as a logical system. This in conjunction with the integrity constraints corresponds to immutable part of the Horn knowledge base, here P is defined by immutable part. This is discussed further in the next subsection;\n* Ab is a set of atoms from L, called the abducibles. This notion is required in an abductive framework, and this corresponds to the atoms that may appear in the updatable part of the knowledge; * IC is the set of integrity constraints, a set of sentences from language L. This specifies the integrity of a Horn knowledge base and forms a part of the knowledge that can not be modified over time; * K is a set of sentences from L. It is the current knowledge, and the only part of KB that changes over time. This corresponds to the updatable part of the Horn knowledge base. The main requirement here is that no sentence in K can have an atom that does not appear in Ab."

      "text" : "The main idea of our approach is to consider the immutable part of the knowledge to define a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that P defines its own consequence relation |=P and its closure Cnp. Given P , we have the Herbrand Base HBP and GP , the ground instantiation of P .\nAn abductive interpretation I is a set of abducibles, i.e. I ⊆ Ab. How I interprets all the ground atoms of L 1 is defined, inductively on the level of atoms wrt P , as follows:\n* An atom A at level 0 (note that only abducibles are at level 0) is interpreted as: A is true in I iff A ∈ I, else it is false in I. * An atom A at level n is interpreted as: A is true in I iff ∃ clause A ← L1, . . . , Lk in GP s.t. ∀Lj (1 ≤ j ≤ k) if Lj is an atom then Lj is true in I, else if Lj is a negative literal ¬Bj , then Bj is false in I.\nThis interpretation of ground atoms can be extended, in the usual way, to interpret sentences in L, as follows (where α and β are sentences):\n* ¬α is true in I iff α is false in I. * α ∧ β is true in I iff both α and β are true in I. * α ∨ β is true in I iff either α is true in I or β is true in I. * ∀α is true in I iff all ground instantiations of α are true in I. * ∃α is true in I iff some ground instantiation of α is true in I.\nGiven a sentence α in L, an abductive interpretation I is said to be an abductive model of α iff α is true in I. Extending this to a set of sentences K, I is a abductive model of K iff I is an abductive model of every sentence α in K.\nGiven a set of sentences K and a sentence α, α is said to be a P -consequence of K, written as K |=P α, iff every abductive model of K is an abductive model of α also. Putting it in other words, letMod(K) be the set of all abductive models of K. Then α is a P -consequence of K iff α is true in all abductive interpretations in Mod(K). The consequence operator CnP is then defined as CnP (K) =\n1 the set of all the ground atoms of L, in fact depends of L, and is given as HBP , the Herbrand Base of P\n{α | K |=P α} = {α | α is true in all abductive interpretations in Mod(K)}. K is said to be P-consistent iff there is no expression α s.t. α ∈ CnP (K) and ¬α ∈ CnP (K). Two sentences α and β are said to be P -equivalent to each other, written as α ≡ β, iff they have the same set of abductive models , i.e. Mod(α) = Mod(β)."

We do not consider abductive interpretations that are not models of IC, simply because IC does not change during revision. Observe that when IC is empty, S is the set of all abductive interpretations. Given a Horn knowledge base KB, and two abductive interpretations I1 and I2 from S, we can compare how close these interpretations are to KB by using an order ≤KB among abductive interpretations in S. I1 <KB I2 iff I1 ≤KB I2 and I2 KB I1.\nLet F ⊆ S. An abductive interpretation I ∈ F is minimal in F wrt ≤KB if there is no I ′ ∈ F s.t. I ′ <KB I. Let, Min(F ,≤KB) = {I | I is minimal in F wrt ≤KB}.\nFor any Horn knowledge base KB, the following are desired properties of ≤KB:\n(≤ 1) (Pre-order)≤KB is a pre-order , i.e. it is transitive and reflexive.

(≤ 5) (Preservance)] For any Horn knowledge base KB’, if KB ≡ KB′ then\n≤KB=≤KB′.\nLet KB (and consequently K) be revised by a sentence α, and ≤KB be a rational order that satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5). Then the abductive models of the revised Horn knowledge base are given precisely by: Min(Mod({α}∪IC),≤KB). Note that, this construction does not say what the resulting K is, but merely says what should be the abductive models of the new Horn knowledge base.\nRepresentation theorem\nNow, we proceed to show that revision of KB by α, as constructed above, satisfies all the rationality postulates stipulated in the beginning of this section. This is formalized by the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, ≤KB an order among S that satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5). Let a revision operator ∔ be defined as: for any sentence α, Mod(KB ∔ α) = Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB). Then ∔ satisfies all the rationality postulates for revision (∔1) to (∔7).\nProof.\n(∔1) P ′ = P and Ab′ = Ab and IC′ = IC This is satisfied obviously, since our construction does not touch P and Ab, and IC follows from every abductive interpretation in Mod(KB ∔ α). (∔2) α is accepted in KB ∔ α Note that every abductive interpretation M ∈ Mod(KB + α) is a model of α. Hence α is accepted in KB ∔ α. (∔3) α is satisfiable and P -consistent with IC iff KB ∔ α is P -consistent. If part: If KB ∔ α is P -consistent , then Mod(KB ∔ α) is not empty. This implies that Mod({α} ∪ IC) is not empty, and hence α is satisfiable and P -consistent with IC. Only if part: If α is satisfiable and P-consistent with IC, then Mod({α}∪IC) is not empty, and (≤ 4) ensures that Mod(KB ∔ α) is not empty. Thus, KB ∔ α is P -consistent. (∔4) If ¬α is not accepted in KB, then KB ∔ α ≡ KB + α. We have to establish that Min(Mod({α}∪IC),≤KB) = Mod(KB)∩Mod(α). Since ¬α is not accepted in KB, Mod(KB)∩Mod(α) is not empty. The required result follows immediately from the fact that ≤KB is faithful to KB (i.e. satisfies ≤ 3), which selects only and all those models of α which are also models of KB. (∔5) If KB ≡ KB′ and α ≡ β then KB ∔ α = KB′ ∔ β (≤ 5) ensures that ≤KB=≤KB′. The required result follows immediately from this and the fact that Mod(α) = Mod(β). (∔6) (KB ∔ α) + β implies KB ∔ (α ∧ β). We consider this in two cases. When ¬β is accepted in KB∔α, (KB∔α)+β is the set of all sentences from L, and the postulate follows immediately. Instead when ¬β is not accepted in KB ∔ α, this postulates coincides with the next one.\n(∔7) If ¬β is not accepted in KB ∔ α, then KB ∔ (α ∧ β) implies (KB ∔ α) + β. Together with the second case of previous postulate, we need to show that KB ∔ (α ∧ β) = (KB ∔ α) + β. In other words, we have to establish that Min(Mod({α ∧ β} ∪ IC),≤KB) = Mod(KB ∔ α) ∩ Mod(β). For the sake of simplicity, let us represent Min(Mod({α ∧ β} ∪ IC),≤KB) by P, and Mod(KB ∔ α) ∩Mod(β), which is the same as Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB ) ∩Mod(β), by Q. The required result is obtained in two parts: 1) ∀ (abductive interpretation)M: if M ∈ P , then M ∈ Q\nObviously M ∈ Mod(β). Assume that M <Min(Mod({α}∪ IC),≤KB). This can happen in two cases, and we show that both the cases lead to contradiction. Case A: No model of β is selected by ≤KB from Mod({α} ∪ IC). But this contradicts our initial condition that ¬β is not accepted in KB ∔α. Case B: Some model, say M ′, of β is selected by ≤KB from Mod({α} ∪ IC). Since M is not selected, it follows that M ′ <KB M . But then this contradicts our initial assumption that M ∈ P . So, P ⊆ Q. 2) ∀ (abductive interpretation)M: if M ∈ Q, then M ∈ P M ∈ Q implies that M is a model of both α and β, and M is selected by ≤KB from Mod({α}∪ IC). Note that Mod({α∧β}∪ IC) ⊆ Mod({α}∪ IC). Since M is selected by ≤KB in a bigger set (i.e. Mod({α} ∪ IC)), ≤KB must select M from its subset Mod({α ∧ β} ∪ IC) also. Hence Q ⊆ P .\nBut, that is not all. Any rational revision of KB by α, that satisfies all the rationality postulates, can be constructed by our construction method, and this is formalized below.\nLemma 2. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base and ∔ a revision operator that satisfies all the rationality postulates for revision (∔1) to (∔7). Then, there exists an order ≤KB among S, that satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5), and for any sentence α, Mod(KB ∔ α) is given in Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB).\nProof. Let us construct an order ≤KB among interpretations in S as follows: For any two abductive interpretations I and I ′ in S, define I ≤KB I\n′ iff either I ∈ Mod(KB) or I ∈ Mod(KB ∔ form(I, I ′)), where form(I, I ′) stands for sentence whose only models are I and I ′. We will show that ≤KB thus constructed satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5) and Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB) = Mod(KB ∔ α).\nFirst, we show that Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB) = Mod(KB ∔ α).Suppose α is not satisfiable, i.e. Mod(α) is empty, or α does not satisfy IC, then there are no abductive models of {α} ∪ IC, and hence Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB) is empty. From (∔3), we infer that Mod(KB ∔ α) is also empty. When α is satisfiable and α satisfies IC, the required result is obtained in two parts:\n1) If I ∈ Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB), then I ∈ Mod(KB ∔ α) Since α is satisfiable and consistent with IC, (∔3) implies that there exists at least one model, say I ′, for KB∔α. From (∔1), it is clear that I ′ is a model of IC, from (∔2) we also get that I ′ is a model of α, and consequently I ≤KB I ′\n(because I ∈ Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB)). Suppose I ∈ Mod(KB), then (∔4) immediately gives I ∈ Mod(KB ∔ α). If not, from our definition of ≤KB, it is clear that I ∈ Mod(KB∔form(I, I\n′)). Note that α∧form(I, I ′) ≡ form(I, I ′), since both I and I ′ are models of α. From (∔6) and (∔7), we get Mod(KB∔α)∩{I, I ′} = Mod(KB∔form(I, I ′)). Since I ∈ Mod(KB∔ form(I, I ′)), it immediately follows that I ∈ Mod(KB ∔ α). 2) If I ∈ Mod(KB ∔ α), then I ∈ Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB). From (∔1) we get I is a model of IC, and from (∔2), we obtain I ∈ Mod(α). Suppose I ∈ Mod(KB), then from our definition of ≤KB, we get I ≤KB I ′, for any other model I ′ of α and IC, and hence I ∈ Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB). Instead, if I is not a model of KB, then, to get the required result, we should show that I ∈ Mod(KB ∔ form(I, I ′)), for every model I ′\nof α and IC. As we have observed previously, from (∔6) and (∔7), we get Mod(KB∔α)∩{I, I ′} = Mod(KB∔form(I, I ′)). Since I ∈ Mod(KB∔α), it immediately follows that I ∈ Mod(KB∔form(I, I ′)). Hence I ≤KB I ′ for any model I ′ of α and IC, and consequently, I ∈ Min(Mod({α}∪IC),≤KB ).\nNow we proceed to show that the order ≤KB among S, constructed as per our definition, satisfies all the rationality axioms (≤ 1) to (≤ 5).\n(≤ 1) ≤KB is a pre-order. Note that we need to consider only abductive interpretations from S. From (∔2) and (∔3), we have Mod(KB ∔ form(I, I ′)) = {I}, and so I ≤KB I. Thus ≤KB satisfies reflexivity. let I1 ∈ Mod(IC) and I2 < Mod(IC). Clearly, it is possible that two interpretations I1 and I2 are not models of KB, and Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2)) = {I1}. So, I1 ≤KB I2 does not necessarily imply I2 ≤KB I1, and thus ≤KB satisfies anti-symmetry. To show the transitivity, we have to prove that I1 ≤KB I3, when I1 ≤KB I2 and I2 ≤KB I3 hold. Suppose I1 ∈ Mod(KB), then I1 ≤KB I3 follows immediately from our definition of ≤KB. On the other case, when I1 <Mod(KB), we first observe that I1 ∈ Mod(KB∔ form(I1, I2)), which follows from definition of ≤KB and I1 ≤KB I2. Also observe that I2 <Mod(KB). If I2 were a model of KB, then it follows from (∔4) that Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2)) = Mod(KB)∩{I1, I2} = {I2}, which is a contradiction, and so I2 <Mod(KB). This, together with I2 ≤KB I3, implies that I2 ∈ Mod(KB ∔ form(I2, I3)). Now consider Mod(KB+ form(I1, I2, I3)). Since ∔ satisfies (∔2) and (∔3), it follows that this is a non-empty subset of {I1, I2, I3}. We claim that Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2, I3))∩{I1, I2} can not be empty. If it is empty, then it means that Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2, I3)) = {I3}. Since ∔ satisfies (∔6) and (∔7), this further implies that Mod(KB ∔ form(I2, I3)) = Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2, I3))∩{I2, I3} = {I3}. This contradicts our observation that I2 ∈ Mod(KB∔form(I2, I3)), and so Mod(KB∔form(I1, I2, I3))∩{I1, I2} can not be empty. Using (∔6) and (∔7) again, we get Mod(KB∔form(I1, I2)) = Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2, I3))∩{I1, I2}. Since we know that I1 ∈ Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2)), it follows that I1 ∈ Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2, I3)). From (∔6)\nand (∔7) we also get Mod(KB∔form(I1, I3)) = Mod(KB+form(I1, I2, I3))∩ {I1, I3}, which clearly implies that I1 ∈ Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I3)). From our definition of ≤KB, we now obtain I1 ≤KB I3. Thus, ≤KB is a pre-order.\n(≤ 2) ≤KB is total. Since ∔ satisfies (∔2) and (∔3), for any two abductive interpretations I and I ′ in S, it follows that Mod(KB ∔ form(I, I ′)) is a non-empty subset of {I, I ′}. Hence, ≤KB is total. (≤ 3) ≤KB is faithful to KB. From our definition of ≤KB, it follows that ∀I1, I2 ∈ Mod(KB) : I1 <KB I2 does not hold. Suppose I1 ∈ Mod(KB) and I2 < Mod(KB). Then, we have I1 ≤KB I2. Since ∔ satisfies (∔4), we also have Mod(KB ∔ form(I1, I2)) = {I1}. Thus, from our definition of ≤KB, we can not have I2 ≤KB I1. So, if I1 ∈ Mod(KB) and I2 < Mod(KB), then I1 <KB I2 holds. Thus, ≤KB is faithful to KB. (≤ 4) For any non-empty subset F of S, Min(F ,≤KB) is not empty. Let α be a sentence such that Mod({α} ∪ IC) = F . We have already shown that Mod(KB ∔ α) = Min(F ,≤KB). Since, ∔ satisfies (∔3), it follows that Mod(KB ∔ α) is not empty, and thus Min(F ,≤KB) is not empty. (≤ 5) If KB ≡ KB′, then ≤KB=≤KB′. This follows immediately from the fact that ∔ satisfies (∔5).\nThus, the order among interpretations ≤KB, constructed as per our definition, satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5), and Mod(KB ∔α) = Min(Mod({α}∪ IC),≤KB).\nSo, we have a one to one correspondence between the axiomatization and the construction, which is highly desirable, and this is summarized by the following representation theorem.\nTheorem 1. Let KB be revised by α, and KB ∔ α be obtained by the construction discussed above. Then, ∔ is a revision operator iff it satisfies all the rationality postulates (∔1) to (∔7).\nProof. Follows from Lemma 1. and Lemma 2."

We have defined how KB can be expanded, revised, or contracted. The question now is: does our foundational approach (wrt classical first-order logic) on KB coincide with coherence approach (wrt our consequence operator CnP ) of AGM on KB\n•? There is a problem in answering this question (similar practical problem [5]) , since our approach, we require IC to be immutable, and only the current knowledge K is allowed to change. On the contrary, AGM approach treat every sentence in KB• equally, and can throw out sentences from CnP (IC). One way to solve this problem is to assume that sentences in CnP (IC) are more entrenched than others. However, one-to-one correspondence can be established, when IC is empty. The key is our consequence operator CnP , and in the following, we show that coherence approach of AGM with this consequence operator, is exactly same as our foundational approach, when IC is empty."

      "heading" : "5 Realizing Horn knowledge base dynamics using abductive explanations",
      "text" : "In this section, we explore how belief dynamics can be realized in practice (see [7,10,11]). Here, we will see how revision can be implemented based on the construction using models of revising sentence and an order among them. The notion of abduction proves to be useful and is explained in the sequel.\nLet α be a sentence in L. An abductive explanation for α wrt KB is a set of abductive literals 2 ∆ s.t. ∆ consistent with IC and ∆ |=P α (that is α ∈ CnP (∆)). Further ∆ is said to be minimal iff no proper subset of ∆ is an abductive explanation for α.\nThe basic idea to implement revision of a Horn knowledge base KB by a sentence α, is to realize Mod({α} ∪ IC) in terms of abductive explanations for α wrt KB. We first provide a useful lemma.\nDefinition 4. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, α a sentence, and ∆1 and ∆2 be two minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB. Then, the disjunction of ∆1 and ∆2, written as ∆1 ∨∆2, is given as:\n∆1 ∨∆2 = (∆1 ∩∆2) ∪ {α ∨ β|α ∈ ∆1\\∆2 and β ∈ ∆2\\∆1}.\nExtending this to ∆•, a set of minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB, ∨∆• is given by the disjunction of all elements of ∆•.\nLemma 5. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, α a sentence,and ∆1 and ∆2 be two minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB. Then,Mod(∆1 ∨ ∆2) = Mod(∆1) ∪Mod(∆2).\nProof. First we show that every model of ∆1 is a model of ∆1 ∨∆2. Clearly, a model M of ∆1 satisfies all the sentences in (∆1 ∩∆2). The other sentences in (∆1 ∨∆2) are of the form α ∨ β, where α is from ∆1 and β is from ∆2. Since M is a model of ∆1, α is true in M , and hence all such sentences are satisfied by M . Hence M is a model of ∆1 ∨∆2 too. Similarly, it can be shown that every model of ∆2 is a model of ∆1 ∨∆2 too.\nNow, it remains to be shown that every model M of ∆1∨∆2 is either a model of ∆1 or a model of ∆2. We will now show that if M is not a model of ∆2, then\n2 An abductive literal is either an abducible A from Ab, or its negation ¬A.\nit must be a model of ∆1. Since M satisfies all the sentences in (∆1 ∩∆2), we need only to show that M also satisfies all the sentences in ∆1\\∆2. For every element α ∈ ∆1\\∆2: there exists a subset of (∆1 ∨ ∆2), {α ∨ β|β ∈ ∆2\\∆2}. M satisfies all the sentences in this subset. Suppose M does not satisfy α, then it must satisfy all β ∈ ∆1\\∆2. This implies that M is a model of ∆2, which is a contradictory to our assumption. Hence M must satisfy α, and thus a model ∆1. Similarly, it can be shown that M must be a model of ∆2 if it is not a model of ∆1.\nAs one would expect, all the models of revising sentence α can be realized in terms abductive explanations for α, and the relationship is precisely stated below.\nLemma 6. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, α a sentence, and ∆• the set of all minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB. Then Mod({α} ∪ IC) = Mod(∨∆•).\nProof. It can be easily verified that every model M of a minimal abductive explanation is also a model of α. Since every minimal abductive explanation satisfies IC, M is a model of α ∪ IC. It remains to be shown that every model M of {α}∪IC is a model of one of the minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB. This can be verified by observing that a minimal abductive explanation for α wrt KB can be obtained from M .\nThus, we have a way to generate all the models of {α}∪IC, and we just need to select a subset of this based on an order that satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5). Suppose we have such an order that satisfies all the required postulates, then this order can be mapped to a particular set of abductive explanations for α wrt KB. This is stated precisely in the following theorem. An important implication of this theorem is that there is no need to compute all the abductive explanations for α wrt KB. However, it does not say which abductive explanations need to be computed.\nTheorem 10. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, and ≤KB be an order among abductive interpretations in S that satisfies all the rationality axioms (≤ 1) to (≤ 5). Then, for every sentence α, there exists ∆• a set of minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB, s.t. Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB) is a subset of Mod(∨∆•), and this does not hold for any proper subset of ∆•.\nProof. From Lemma 6. and Lemma 5., it is clear that Mod({α} ∪ IC) is the union of all the models of all minimal abductive explanations of α wrt KB. Min selects a subset of this, and the theorem follows immediately. .\nThe above theorem 10. is still not very useful in realizing revision. We need to have an order among all the interpretations that satisfies all the required axioms, and need to compute all the abductive explanations for α wrt KB. The need to compute all abductive explanations arises from the fact that the converse of the above theorem does not hold in general. This scheme requires an universal\norder ≤, in the sense that same order can be used for any Horn knowledge base. Otherwise, it would be necessary to specify the new order to be used for further modifying (KB ∔ α). However, even if the order can be worked out, it is not desirable to demand all abductive explanations of α wrt KB be computed. So, it is desirable to work out, when the converse of the above theorem is true. The following theorem says that, suppose α is rejected in KB, then revision of KB by α can be worked out in terms of some abductive explanations for α wrt KB.\nTheorem 11. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, and a revision function ∔ be defined as: for any sentence α that is rejected in KB, Mod(KB ∔ α) is a non-empty subset of Mod(∨∆•), where ∆• is a set of all minimal abductive explanations for α wrt KB. Then, there exists an order ≤KB among abductive interpretations in S, s.t. ≤KB satisfies all the rationality axioms (≤ 1) to (≤ 5) and Mod(KB ∔ α) = Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB).\nProof. It is easy to define a pre-order s.t. every model of Mod(KB∔α) is strictly minimal than all other interpretations. It is easy to verify that such a pre-order satisfies (≤ 1) to (≤ 5). In particular, since α is rejected in KB, (≤ 3) faithfulness is satisfied, and since non-empty subset of Mod(∨∆•) is selected, (≤ 4) is also satisfied.\nAn important corollary of this theorem is that, revision of KB by α can be realized just by computing one abductive explanation of α wrt KB, and is stated below.\nCorollary 1. Let KB be a Horn knowledge base, and a revision function ∔ be defined as: for any sentence α that is rejected in KB, Mod(KB ∔ α) is a non-empty subset of Mod(∆), where ∆ is an abductive explanations for α wrt KB. Then, there exists an order ≤KB among abductive interpretations in S, s.t. ≤KB satisfies all the rationality axioms (≤ 1) to (≤ 5) and Mod(KB ∔ α) = Min(Mod({α} ∪ IC),≤KB).\nThe precondition that α is rejected in KB is not a serious limitation in various applications such as database updates and diagnosis, where close world assumption is employed to infer negative information. For example, in diagnosis it is generally assumed that all components are functioning normally, unless otherwise there is specific information against it. Hence, a Horn knowledge base in diagnosis either accepts or rejects normality of a component, and there is no ”don’t know” third state. In other words, in these applications the Horn knowledge base is assumed to be complete. Hence, when such a complete Horn knowledge base is revised by α, either α is already accepted in KB or rejected in KB, and so the above scheme works fine."

      "text" : "We begin by recalling previous work on view deletion. Chandrabose [10,11], defines a contraction operator in view deletion with respect to a set of formulae\nor sentences using Hansson’s [20] belief change. Similar to our [14] approach, he focused on set of formulae or sentences in Horn knowledge base revision for view update wrt. insertion and deletion and formulae are considered at the same level. Chandrabose proposed different ways to change Horn knowledge base via only database deletion, devising particular postulate which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for such an update process.\nOur Horn knowledge base consists of two parts, immutable part and updatable part , but focus is on principle of minimal change. There are more related works on that topic. Eiter [17] is focusing on revision from different perspective - prime implication. Segerberg [48] defined new modeling for belief revision in terms of irrevocability on prioritized revision. Hansson [20] constructed five types of non-prioritized belief revision. Makinson [31] developed dialogue form of revision AGM. Papini[39] defined a new version of Horn knowledge base revision.\nWe are bridging gap between philosophical work, paying little attention to computational aspects of database work [32,49]. In such a case, Hansson’s[20] kernel change is related with abductive method. Aliseda’s [2] book on abductive reasoning is one of the motivation keys. Christiansen’s [12,13] work on dynamics of abductive logic grammars exactly fits our minimal change (insertion and deletion).\nIn general, our abduction theory is related to Horn knowledge base dynamics (see how abduction theory is related with other applications, respectively, reasoning [6,41,42], update[44,45], equivalence[22,42,43] and problem solving[23,30]). More similar to our work is paper presented by Bessant et al. [7], local searchbased heuristic technique that empirically proves to be often viable, even in the context of very large propositional applications. Laurent et al.[26] parented updating deductive databases in which every insertion or deletion of a fact can be performed in a deterministic way.\nFurthermore, and at a first sight more related to our work, some work has been done on ”core-retainment” (same as our immutable part) in the model of language splitting introduced by Parikh [37]. More recently, Doukari [16], Özçep [36] and Wu, et al. [51] applied similar ideas for dealing with knowledge base dynamics. These works represent motivation keys for our future work. Second, we are dealing with how to change minimally in the theory of ”principle of minimal change”, but current focuss is on finding second best abductive explanation [27] and 2-valued minimal hypothesis for each normal program [40]. Finally, when we presented Horn knowledge base change in abduction framework, we did not talk about compilability and complexity (see the works of Liberatore [28] and Zanuttini [52])."

      "text" : "The main contribution of this work lies in showing how abductive framework deals with Horn knowledge base dynamics via belief change operation. We consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. We\npresented that relationship of the coherence approach of AGM with this consequence operator is exactly same as our foundational approach, when IC is empty.\nWe believe that Horn knowledge base dynamics can also be applied to other applications such as view maintenance, diagnosis, and we plan to explore it in further works [9]. Still, a lot of developments are possible, for improving existing operators or for defining new classes of change operators. As immediate extension, question raises: is there any real life application for AGM in 25 year theory? [18]. The revision and update are more challenging in Horn knowledge base dynamic, so we can extend the theory to combine results similar to Konieczny’s [24] and Nayak’s [34]."

We introduced the Horn knowledge base dynamics to deal with two important points: first, to handle belief states that need not be deductively closed; and the second point is the ability to declare certain parts of the belief as immutable. In this paper, we address another, radically new approach to this problem. This approach is very close to the Hansson’s dyadic representation of belief. Here, we consider the immutable part as defining a new logical system. By a logical system, we mean that it defines its own consequence relation and closure operator. Based on this, we provide an abductive framework for Horn knowledge base dynamics. Keyword: AGM, Immutable, Integrity Constraint, Knowledge Base Dynamics, Abduction.",
