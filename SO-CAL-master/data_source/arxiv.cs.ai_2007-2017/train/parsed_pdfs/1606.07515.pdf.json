Wáng Zhejiang University, China\nynw@zju.edu.cn\nDistributed knowledge is the sum of the knowledge in a group; what someone who is able to discern between two possible worlds whenever any member of the group can discern between them, would know. Sometimes distributed knowledge is referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic, the formula DGϕ is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of ϕ , that there is enough information in the group to infer ϕ . But this is not the same as reasoning about what happens if the members of the group share their information. In this paper we introduce an operator RG, such that RGϕ means that ϕ is true after G have shared all their information with each other – after G’s distributed knowledge has been resolved. The RG operators are called resolution operators. Semantically, we say that an expression RGϕ is true iff ϕ is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G’s) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge. Of particular interest is the relationship between distributed and common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations."

      "text" : "In epistemic logic [6, 8, 5] different notions of group knowledge describe different ways in which knowledge can be associated with a group. Common knowledge is stronger than individual knowledge: that something is common knowledge requires not only that everybody in the group knows it, but that everybody knows that everybody knows it, and so on. Distributed knowledge, on the other hand, is weaker than individual knowledge: distributed knowledge is knowledge that is distributed throughout the group even if no individual knows it.\nMore concrete informal descriptions of the concept of distributed knowledge abound, but they are often inaccurate descriptions of the concept as formalized in standard epistemic logic. A misconception is that something is distributed knowledge in a group if the agents in the group could get to know it after some (perhaps unlimited) communications between them1. To see that this interpretation must be incorrect, consider the formula D{1,2}(p∧¬K1 p). In this formula, DGϕ and Kiϕ mean that ϕ is distributed knowledge in the group G, and individual knowledge of agent i, respectively. Thus, the formula says that it is distributed knowledge among agents 1 and 2 that p is true and that agent 1 does not know p. This formula is consistent (also when we assume that knowledge has the S5 properties). However, it is not possible that agents 1 and 2 both can get to know that p is true and that agent 1\n1Some examples of informal descriptions of distributed knowledge from the literature include “A group has distributed knowledge of a fact ϕ if the knowledge of ϕ is distributed among its members, so that by pooling their knowledge together the members of the group can deduce ϕ” [6]; “.. it should be possible for the members of the group to establish ϕ through communication” [12, 10]; “.. the knowledge that would result of the agents could somehow ’combine’ their knowledge” [12]. These descriptions can at least give a reader the impression that distributed knowledge is about internal communication in the group of agents.\ndoes not know that p is true (assuming the S5 properties of knowledge), no matter how much they communicate (or “pool” their knowledge). The “problem” here is that in a formula DGψ , ψ describes the possible states of the world as they were before any communication or other events took place, so a more accurate reading of D{1,2}(p∧¬K1 p) would perhaps be that it follows from the combination of 1 and 2’s knowledge that p∧¬K1 p were true before any communication or other events took place. More technically, the “problem” is due to the standard compositional semantics of modal logic: in the evaluation of DGϕ , the DG operator picks out a number of states considered possible by the group G (actually the states considered possible by all members of the group), and then ϕ is evaluated in each of these states in the original model, without any effect of the DG operator.\nBut we don’t really consider this a problem. There are other interpretations of distributed knowledge where the consistency of the mentioned formula makes perfect sense, such that distributed knowledge being the knowledge of a third party, someone “outside the system” who somehow has access to the epistemic states of the group members. It shows, however, that it does not make sense to interpret distributed knowledge as something that is true after the agents in the group have communicated with each other – with the standard semantics.\nIn this paper we introduce and study an alternative group modality RG, where RGϕ means (roughly speaking) that ϕ is true after the agents in the group have shared all their information with each other. We call that resolving distributed knowledge, and the RG operators are called resolution operators.\nSemantically, we say that an expression RGϕ is true iff ϕ is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G’s) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. See Fig. 1 for an illustration.\nIn this paper we capture that model transformation by the new resolution operators, and study resulting logics. For example, the formula R{1,2}(p∧¬K1 p) will be inconsistent in the resulting logics. R{1,2}(p∧K1 p) is true in state t in the model in Fig. 1.\nThis model transformation abstracts away from the issue of how the agents share their information; whether they communicate directly with each other and if so in which language, whether they are informed by some outsider about the information other agents have and if so how, and so on. As noted by van Benthem [11, p. 249], the communication core cannot always be obtained by public announcements using the epistemic language. Similarly, as noted by several researchers [12, 7, 10], standard distributed knowledge does not always follow logically from the knowledge of the individual agents expressible in the epistemic language. Our model, like that of standard distributed knowledge, is purely semantic: we assume that if an agent can discern between two different worlds, then there exists some mechanism that results in other members of the group being able to make the same distinction. This is further discussed Section 5.\nThis model transformation models a particular kind of internal group information sharing event. Exactly which kind depends on what we assume about what other agents, i.e., agents that are not in the group G that resolve their knowledge, know about the fact that this event is taking place. In this paper we will assume that it is common knowledge among the other agents that G resolve their knowledge – but not what the agents in G actually learn. This corresponds to a natural class of events: publicly observable private resolution of distributed knowledge. An example is a meeting in a closed room, where it is observed that a certain group meets in the room to share information.\nWe want to make it clear that we do not consider distributed knowledge with standard semantics to be “wrong”; the important thing is to be clear about its meaning. In particular, the resolution operators are not intended as a “replacement” of distributed knowledge operators, but as a complement: they express different things. The logics we study contains both types of operators, as well as common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations.\nTechnically, the model transformation, which amounts to removing certain edges, is similar to those found in the simplest dynamic epistemic logics [5] such as public announcement logics [9]. [11] has also pointed out the close connection between the communication core and sequences of public announcements. Public announcement logics with distributed knowledge have been studied recently [13]. In the absence of common knowledge, we get reduction axioms for public announcement logic with distributed knowledge. This turns out to be the case for resolution operators as well. It is not the case in the presence of common knowledge, however.\nThere is a close connection between the communication core and common knowledge [11]. By studying complete axiomatizations of logics with the resolution operators we make some aspects of that connection precise and give an answer to the question “when does distributed knowledge become common knowledge?” – under certain assumptions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we review some background definitions and results from the literature, before we introduce logics with the new resolution operators in Section 3, where we also look at some properties of the operators. In Section 4 we prove completeness of resulting logics; the most interesting case being epistemic logic with common and distributed knowledge and resolution operators. We discuss related and future work and conclude in Section 5."

      "text" : "In this section we give a (necessarily brief) review of the main background concepts from the literature. We henceforth assume a countable set of propositional variables PROP and a finite set of agents AG. We let GR be the set of all non-empty groups, i.e., GR =℘(AG)\\ /0. An epistemic model over PROP and AG (or just a model) M= (S,∼,V ) where S is a set of states (or worlds), V : PROP→ 2S associates a set of states V (p) with each propositional variable p, and ∼ is a function that maps each agent to a binary equivalence relation on S. We write ∼i for ∼(i).\ns ∼i t means that agent i cannot discern between states s and t – if we are in s she doesn’t know whether we are in t, and vice versa. Considering the distributed knowledge of a group G – a key concept in the following – we define a derived relation ∼G= ⋂ a∈G ∼a (it is easy to see that ∼G is an equivalence relation). Intuitively, someone who has all the knowledge of all the members of G can discern between two states if and only if at least one member of G can discern between them. We will also consider common knowledge. A similar relation modeling the common knowledge of a group is obtained by taking the transitive closure of the union of the individual relations: vCG= ( ⋃ i∈G ∼i)∗.\nDefinition 1 Below are several languages from the literature.\n(ELD) ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ϕ | Kiϕ | DGϕ (ELCD) ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ϕ | Kiϕ | DGϕ |CGϕ (PACD) ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ϕ | Kiϕ | DGϕ |CGϕ | [ϕ]ϕ,\nwhere p ∈ PROP, i ∈ AG and G ∈ GR. We use the usual propositional derived operators, as well as EGϕ for ∧\ni∈G Kiϕ . ELD and ELCD are static epistemic languages with distributed knowledge, and with distributed and common knowledge, respectively. These are the languages we will extend with resolution operators in the next section. We will also be interested in PACD, the language for public announcement logic with both common knowledge and distributed knowledge, when we look at completeness proofs.\nSatisfaction of a formula ϕ of any of these languages in a state m of a model M, denoted M,m |= ϕ , is defined recursively by the following clauses:\nM,m |= p iff m ∈V (p) M,m |= ¬ϕ iff M,m 6|= ϕ M,m |= ϕ ∧ψ iff M,m |= ϕ & M,m |= ψ M,m |= Kaϕ iff ∀n ∈ S. (m∼a n⇒M,n |= ϕ) M,m |= DGϕ iff ∀n ∈ S. (m∼G n⇒M,n |= ϕ) M,m |=CGϕ iff ∀n ∈ S. (m( ⋃ i∈G ∼i)∗n⇒M,n |= ϕ) M,m |= [ψ]ϕ iff M,m |= ψ ⇒M|ψ,m |= ϕ.\nwhere R∗ denotes the transitive closure of R and M|ψ is the submodel of M restricted to {m∈M |M,m |= ψ}. Validity is defined as usual: |= ϕ means that M,m |= ϕ for all M and m.\nWe now define some axiom schemata and rules. The classical “S5” proof system for multi-agent epistemic logic, denoted (S5), consists of the following axioms and rules:\n(PC) instances of tautologies (K) Ki(ϕ → ψ)→ (Kiϕ → Kiψ) (T) Kiϕ → ϕ (4) Kiϕ → KiKiϕ (5) ¬Kiϕ → Ki¬Kiϕ (MP) from ϕ and ϕ → ψ infer ψ (N) from ϕ infer Kiϕ .\nAxioms for distributed knowledge, denoted (DK):\n(KD) DG(ϕ → ψ)→ (DGϕ → DGψ) (TD) DGϕ → ϕ (5D) ¬DGϕ → DG¬DGϕ (D1) Kiϕ ↔ Diϕ (D2) DGϕ → DHϕ , if G⊆ H.\nAxioms and rules for common knowledge, denoted (CK):\n(KC) CG(ϕ → ψ)→ (CGϕ →CGψ) (TC) CGϕ → ϕ (C1) CGϕ → EGCGϕ (C2) CG(ϕ → EGϕ)→ (ϕ →CGϕ) (NC) from ϕ infer CGϕ .\nThe system that consists of (S5) and (DK) over the language ELD, denoted S5D, is a sound and complete axiomatization of all ELD validities. The system that consists of (S5), (DK) and (CK) over the language ELCD is a sound and complete axiomatization of all ELCD validities."

An immediate question is: whenever the group G is a proper subset of the set of all agents, what do the other agents know about the fact that this event takes place? Here we will model situations where it is common knowledge among the other agents that the event takes place, but not what the members of the group learn. As discussed in the introduction, this corresponds to a natural class of information sharing events, namely publicly observable private communication, such as a meeting in a closed room that is observed to be taking place. This is captured by a global model update: in every state, remove a link to another state for any member of G whenever it is not the case that there is a link to that state for all members of G.\nFormally, given a model M = (S,∼,V ) and a group of agents G, the (global) G-resolved update of M is the model M|G where M|G = (S,∼|G,V ) and\n(∼|G)i = { ⋂\nj∈G ∼ j, i ∈ G, ∼i, otherwise.\nWe consider the following new languages with resolution operators.\nDefinition 2 (Languages)\n(RD) ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ϕ | Kiϕ | DGϕ | RGϕ (RCD) ϕ ::= p | ¬ϕ | ϕ ∧ϕ | Kiϕ | DGϕ |CGϕ | RGϕ,\nwhere p ∈ PROP, i ∈ AG and G ∈ GR.

There does not seem, however, to be a trivial relationship between the two types of dynamic operators. We are nevertheless able to make heavy use of the completeness proof of PACD in [13] when proving completeness of RCD. That proof is again based on the completeness proof for public announcement logic with (only) common knowledge found in [2, 5], extended to deal with the distributed knowledge operators (which is non-trivial since intersection is not modally definable). In the following completeness proof we tweak the PACD proof to deal with resolution operators instead of public announcement operators. The general proof strategy is as follows: define a finite canonical pseudo model, where distributed knowledge\noperators are taken as primitive, and then transform it to a proper model while preserving truth. For the last step we can use a transformation based on unraveling and folding in [13] directly.\nThe most important difference to the PACD completeness proof in [13], and indeed the crux of the proof, is the use of the induction rule for resolved common knowledge (RRC). No corresponding rule is needed in the PACD completeness proof. The rule is used in the proof of Lemma 3(8).\nPseudo Semantics\nDefinition 4 (Pre-models[13]) A pre-model is a tuple M= (S,v,V ) where: • S is a non-empty set of states; • v is a function which maps every agent and every non-empty group of agents to an equivalence\nrelation; we write vi and vG for v(i) and v(G) respectively; • V : PROP→℘(S) is a valuation. vCG is defined as the reflexive transitive closure of ⋃ i∈G vi, just as for a model.\nA pre-model is technically a model with a bigger set of agents (all groups are treated as agents in a pre-model). More precisely, if we make the set of agents A explicit in a pre-model, e.g., M= (A,S,v,V ), then M is in fact a “genuine” model (S,v,V ) where the set of agents is A∪ (℘(A)\\ /0). Definition 5 (Pseudo models[13]) A pseudo model is a pre-model M=(S,v,V ) such that for any agent i and any groups G and H, • v{i}=vi, and • G⊆ H implies vH⊆vG.\nA pointed pre-model (resp. pointed pseudo model) is a tuple (M,s) consisted of a pre-model (resp. pseudo model) M and a state s in M.\nDefinition 6 (Pseudo semantics) Given a pre-model M = (S,v,V ), let m be a state in M.

Then M|G is a pseudo model.\nPROOF See the appendix.\nProposition 9 Propositions 6 and 7 still hold for pseudo models.\nWhen we regard a pre-model as a genuine model, classical (individual) bisimulation becomes an invariance relation. To make this clear, we first elaborate the definition of bisimulation for pre-models, and then introduce its invariance results.\nDefinition 7 (Pre-model bisimulation) Let two pre-models M = (S,v,V ) and M′ = (S′,v′,V ′) be given. A non-empty relation Z⊆ S×S′ is called a bisimulation between M and M′, denoted by M M′, if for all τ ∈ AG∪GR, all s ∈ S and s′ ∈ S′ such that sZs′, the following hold. (at) For all p ∈ PROP, s ∈V (p) iff s′ ∈V ′(p); (zig) For all t ∈ S, if s∼τ t, there is a t ′ ∈ S′ such that s′ ∼′τ t ′ and tZt ′; (zag) For all t ′ ∈ S′, if s′ ∼′τ t ′, there is a t ∈ S such that s∼τ t and tZt ′. We say that pointed pre-models (M,s) and (M′,s′) are bisimilar, denoted (M,s) (M′,s′), if there is a bisimulation Z between M and M′ linking s and s′.\nProposition 10Resolution preserves pre-model bisimulation.

A non-empty binary relation Z ⊆M×N is called a trans-bisimulation between M and N, if for all m ∈M and n ∈ N with mZn: (at) m ∈V (p) iff n ∈ ν(p) for all p ∈ PROP, (zigag) For all m′ ∈M and all i ∈ AG, if m ∼i m′ (and so m ∼{i} m′), then there is an n′ ∈ N such that m′Zn′ and nvτ0 · · ·vτx n′ with each of τ0, . . . ,τx being “i” or “G” such that i ∈ G; (ziggr) For all m′ ∈M and all G ∈ GR with |G| ≥ 2, if m∼G m′, then there is an n′ ∈ N such that m′Zn′ and nvG1 · · ·vGx n′ with G⊆ G1∩·· ·∩Gx; (zag) For all n′ ∈N and all τ ∈ AG∪GR, if nvτ n′, then there is an m′ ∈M such that m′Zn′ and m∼τ m′. We write Z : (M,m) T (N,n) if Z is a trans-bisimulation between M and N linking m and n. We say a pointed model (M,m) and a pointed pre-model (N,n) are trans-bisimilar, denoted by (M,m) T (N,n), if there is a trans-bisimulation Z such that Z : (M,m) T (N,n).\nTo make the notation symmetric, we call Z a trans-bisimulation between N and M if it is a transbisimulation between M and N, and we regard Z : (N,n) T (M,m) just as Z : (M,m) T (N,n).\n(Pseudo) satisfaction of RCD formulas is invariant under trans-bisimulation. We will not prove that directly at this point: it follows from a stronger result we prove later (Lemma 6).\nTheorem 2 (Pseudo soundness) All theorems of RCD are valid in the class of all pseudo models.\nPROOF See the appendix.\nFinitary Canonical Models\nDefinition 9 (Closure) Given a formula ϕ , the closure of ϕ is given by the function cl : RCD → ℘(RCD) which is defined as follows: 1. ϕ ∈ cl(ϕ), and if ψ ∈ cl(ϕ), so are all of its subformulas; 2. If ϕ is not a negation, then ϕ ∈ cl(ϕ) implies ¬ϕ ∈ cl(ϕ); 3. Kiψ ∈ cl(ϕ) iff D{i}ψ ∈ cl(ϕ); 4. CGψ ∈ cl(ϕ) implies {KiCGψ | a ∈ A} ⊆ cl(ϕ); 5.

RG1 · · ·RGnCHψ ∈ cl(ϕ) implies all of the following: • Dδ (H,G1,...,Gn)RG1 · · ·RGnCHψ ∈ cl(ϕ), • {Dδ ({i},G1,...,Gn)RG1 · · ·RGnCHψ | i ∈ H} ⊆ cl(ϕ), • RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈ cl(ϕ). It is not hard to verify that the closure of a formula is finite.\nWe use Γ as shorthand for ∧\nϕ∈Γ ϕ when Γ is a finite set of formulas.\nDefinition 10 (Canonical pseudo model) Let α be a formula. The canonical pseudo model Mc = (S,v ,V ) for cl(α) is defined below: • S = {Γ | Γ is maximal consistent in cl(α)}; • Γvi ∆ iff {Kiϕ | Kiϕ ∈ Γ}= {Kiϕ | Kiϕ ∈ ∆}; • ΓvG ∆ iff {DHϕ | DHϕ ∈ Γ}= {DHϕ | DHϕ ∈ ∆} whenever H ⊆ G; • V (p) = {Γ ∈ S | p ∈ Γ}.\nProposition 11 The canonical pseudo model for any cl(α) is a pseudo model.\nPROOF See the appendix.\nLemma 2 Let S = {Γ | Γ is maximal consistent in cl(α)} with α a formula. It holds that ` ∨\nΓ∈S Γ and ` ϕ ↔ ∨ ϕ∈Γ∈S Γ for all ϕ ∈ cl(α).\nPROOF See [5, Exercise 7.16] for the first result (although cl(α) is different in our case the proof is exactly the same). We give a proof of the second result in the appendix.\nLet (S,v|G1 | · · · |Gn ,V ) be an update of a canonical pseudo model, and P = 〈Φ0 τ0 · · · τn−1 Φn〉 where stands forv|G1 | · · · |Gn and every τx is an agent or a group. If all agents in τ0, . . . ,τn−1 appears in H, we call P a 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path (from Φ0); if a formula ϕ is such that ϕ ∈Φi for all 0≤ i≤ n, we call P a canonical ϕ-path.\nLemma 3 If Γ and ∆ are maximal consistent in cl(α), then 1. Γ is deductively closed in cl(α), i.e., Γ ` ϕ ⇔ ϕ ∈ Γ for any ϕ ∈ cl(α); 2. If ¬ϕ ∈ cl(α), then ϕ ∈ Γ⇔¬ϕ /∈ Γ; 3. If ϕ ∧ψ ∈ cl(α), then ϕ ∧ψ ∈ Γ⇔ ϕ ∈ Γ & ψ ∈ Γ; 4. If Γ∧ K̂i∆ is consistent, Γvi ∆; if Γ∧ D̂G∆ is consistent, ΓvG ∆; 5. If Kiϕ ∈ cl(α), then KiΓ ` ϕ ⇔ KiΓ ` Kiϕ;\n6. If DGϕ ∈ cl(α), then DGΓ ` ϕ ⇔ DGΓ ` DGϕ; 7. If CGϕ ∈ cl(α), then CGϕ ∈ Γ⇔∀∆(ΓvCG ∆⇒ ϕ ∈ ∆); 8. If RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ cl(α), then RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γ iff every 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path from Γ is a\ncanonical RG1 · · ·RGnϕ-path.\nPROOF We give the proof of the clause 8 in the appendix. Other clauses are the same as in [13, Lemma 49] which can be traced back to [5, Chapter 7].\nLemma 4 (Pseudo truth) Let Mc = (S,v,V ) be the canonical pseudo model for cl(α). For all groups G1, . . . ,Gn, all Γ ∈ S, and all RG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈ cl(α), it holds that\nRG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Γ |= ϕ.\nPROOF We show this lemma by induction on ϕ . • The base case.

From left to right.\nRG1 · · ·RGnKiψ ∈ Γ iff Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈ Γ where δ = δ ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn) iff ∀∆.(Γvδ ∆⇒ Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈ ∆) ⇒ ∀∆.(Γvδ ∆⇒ RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈ ∆) (TD) iff ∀∆.(Γvδ ∆⇒Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,∆ |= ψ) (IH) iff ∀∆.(Γvδ ∆⇒Mc,∆ |= RG1 · · ·RGnψ) iff Mc,Γ |= Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnψ iff Mc,Γ |= RG1 · · ·RGnKiψ (7(1), 9) iff Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Γ |= Kiψ . From right to left. Suppose Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Γ |= Kiψ . We must show RG1 · · ·RGnKiψ ∈ Γ. Suppose this is not the case. Then ¬RG1 · · ·RGnKiψ ∈ Γ. Hence Γ∧¬RG1 · · ·RGnKiψ is consistent, and so is Γ∧ D̂δ¬RG1 · · ·RGnψ , where δ = δ ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn). Let S be the set of all maximal consistent sets in cl(α). By Lemma 2, Γ∧ D̂δ ∨ ¬RG1 ···RGn ψ∈Θ∈S\nΘ is consistent. Since conjunction, resolution and the D̂δ -operator all distribute over disjunction, ∨ ¬RG1 ···RGn ψ∈Θ∈S\n(Γ∧ D̂δ Θ) is consistent. Therefore there must be a Θ ∈ S such that ¬RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈Θ and Γ∧ D̂δ Θ is consistent.\nFrom ¬RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈Θ we get RG1 · · ·RGnψ /∈Θ. By the induction hypothesis Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Θ 6|= ψ , and so Mc,Θ 6|= RG1 · · ·RGnψ . By Lemma 3(4) and that Γ∧ D̂δ Θ is consistent, Γ vδ Θ. But this contradicts the supposition that Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Γ |= Kiψ , since by the same reasoning as in the proof of the other direction (see above), Mc,∆ |= RG1 · · ·RGnψ for all ∆ such that Γvδ ∆. • The case for distributed knowledge: similar to the case for individual knowledge, and in the proof we\nuse δ (H,G1, . . . ,Gn) instead of δ ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn). • The case for common knowledge. RG1 · · ·RGnCHψ ∈ Γ\niff all 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-paths from Γ are also canonical RG1 · · ·RGnψ-paths. Namely, for all ∆ such that (Γ,∆) ∈ (v|G1 | · · · |Gn)CH , RG1 · · ·RGnψ ∈ ∆\niff for all ∆ such that (Γ,∆) ∈ (v|G1 | · · · |Gn)CH , Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,∆ |= ψ (by IH) iff Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Γ |=CHψ . • The case for RHψ . RG1 · · ·RGnRHψ ∈ Γ iff Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn |H ,Γ |= ψ (IH applies to ψ)\niff Mc|G1 | · · · |Gn ,Γ |= RHψ .\nCorollary 3 Let Mc = (S,v,V ) be the canonical pseudo model for cl(α). For all Γ ∈ S and all ϕ ∈ cl(α), it holds that ϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γ |= ϕ.\nLemma 5 (Pseudo completeness) Let ϕ be an RCD-formula. If ϕ is valid on all pseudo models, then it is provable in RCD.\nFrom Pseudo Completeness to Completeness By using unraveling and folding from [13, pp. 9–15], we can transform the canonical pseudo model to a bisimilar pre-model and then to a trans-bisimilar proper model. It remains to show that this process preserves truth. We will use T to denote the transbisimulation relation.\nLemma 6 (Invariance of trans-bisimulation) Let (M,m) be a pointed model, (N,n) a pointed premodel, and (S,s) a pointed pseudo model. If (M,m) T (N,n) (S,s), then M,m |= ϕ iff N,n |=p ϕ for all formulas ϕ .\nPROOF The lemma can be shown by induction on ϕ . Here we only show the case for the resolution operators, proofs of other cases are exactly as in the proof of [13, Lemma 26].\nGiven a pointed model (M,m), a pointed pre-model (N,n) and a pointed pseudo model (S,s), such that Z : (M,m) T (N,n) for some Z and (N,n) (S,s), we have the following:\nM,m |= RGψ iff M|G,m |= ψ iff N|G,n |=p ψ (∗) iff N,n |=p RGψ,\nwhere to show (∗) it is sufficient to show that Z : (M|G,m) T (N|G,n), as (∗) is then guaranteed by the induction hypothesis (note that (N|G,n) (S|G,s) by Proposition 10). Let M = (M,∼,V ) and N= (N,v,ν). • The case for (at) holds by Z : (M,m) T (N,n). • As for (ziggr), suppose m(∼|G)Hm′ for some m′ ∈M and |H| ≥ 2.\n– If G∩H = /0, (∼|G)H =∼H . By Z : (M,m) T (N,n) there is an n′ ∈ N such that m′Zn′ and n vH0 · · · vHx n′ with H ⊆ H0 ∩ ·· · ∩Hx. Let H0 = · · · = Hx = H. Thus n vH · · · vH n′. Since (v|G)H =vH , it holds that n(v|G)H · · ·(v|G)Hn′, and so (ziggr) holds in this case. – If G∩H 6= /0, (∼|G)H =∼G∪H . By Z : (M,m) T (N,n) there is an n′ ∈ N such that m′Zn′ and n vH0 · · · vHx n′ with G∪H ⊆ H0 ∩ ·· · ∩Hx. Thus n vG∪H · · · vG∪H n′. Since (v|G)H =vG∪H , It holds that n(v|G)H · · ·(v|G)Hn′. (ziggr) holds also in this case. • The case for (zigag) is analogous. • The case for (zag). For all n′ ∈ N and all τ ∈ AG∪GR, if n(v|G)τn′, then we must show that there is\nan m′ ∈M such that m′Zn′ and m(∼|G)τm′. – If τ is an agent i. Then if i ∈ G, (v|G)i =vG, otherwise (v|G)i =vi. By Z : (M,m) T (N,n), we\nhave m∼G m′ if i ∈ G, or m∼i m′ otherwise. Namely m(∼|G)im′ in either case. – If τ is a group H. Then if G∩H = /0, (v|G)H =vH , otherwise (v|G)H =vG∪H . By Z : (M,m) T (N,n), we have m∼H m′ if G∩H = /0, or m∼G∪H m′ otherwise. Namely m(∼|G)Hm′ in either case.\nWe have shown that the lemma holds for the case for resolution. For other cases we refer to the proof of [13, Lemma 26].\nTheorem 3 (Completeness) For anyRCD formula ϕ , if ϕ is valid then it is provable in RCD.\nPROOF It suffices to show that any RCD-consistent formula is satisfiable. Let ϕ be consistent. Let Mc be the canonical pseudo model for cl(ϕ). By the pseudo truth lemma (with n = 0, i.e., an empty list of resolution operators), ϕ is satisfied in a state Γ in Mc. Now let NMc be the unraveling [13, Definition 18]3 of Mc. NM c is a pre-model [13, Proposition 19]. Now let (NM c )∗ be the folding [13, Definition 22] of NM c . (NM c )∗ is a (proper) model [13, Definition 22]. From [13, Lemma 27] and [13, Lemma 28]\nwe have that unraveling preserves bisimulation and that folding preserves trans-bisimulation, in other words we have that4 (M,Γ) (NMc ,Γ) T ((NMc)∗,Γ). By Corollary 2, (NMc ,Γ) |=p ϕ . By Lemma 6, ((NM c )∗,Γ) |= ϕ and we are done."

      "text" : "In this paper we captured the dynamics of publicly observable private resolution of distributed knowledge. Resolution operators (using update semantics) are both an alternative and a complement to the standard distributed knowledge operators (which use standard modal semantics).\nResolution operators let us reason about the relationship between common knowledge and distributed knowledge in general, and in particular about distributed knowledge as potential common knowledge – when can distributed knowledge become common knowledge? A naive idea would be that DGϕ should imply that RGCGϕ – any information that is distributed can become common knowledge through resolution. This does not hold in general, however, due to Moore-like phenomena – ϕ might even become false after resolution (an example is the formula D{1,2}(p∧¬K1 p) discussed in the introduction). We do, however, have the following (Prop. 4(2) with G = H):\nRGCGϕ ↔ DGRGϕ.\nA fact can become common knowledge after the group have shared their information if and only if it was distributed knowledge before the event that the fact would be true after the event. This is exactly the distributed knowledge that can become common knowledge (in our special case of publicly observable private resolution of distributed knowledge). If the grand coalition resolves its distributed knowledge, there is no distinction between distributed and common knowledge any more: RAGCAGϕ ↔ RAGDAGϕ (Prop. 3).\nAs discussed in the introduction, it has been argued that distributed knowledge in general does not comply with the following principle of full communication [12]: if DGϕ is true, then ϕ follows logically from the set of all formulas known by at least one agent in the group. This is seen as a problem: namely that agents can have distributed knowledge without being able to establish it “through communication” [12]. Several papers [12, 7, 10] have tried to characterize classes of models on which the principle of full communication does hold – the class of all such models is called full communication models [10]. This may seem related to the distinction between distributed knowledge and resolution operators: the latter is intuitively related to internal “full” communication in the group. However, this similarity is superficial: the notion of full communication in the sense of [12] is about expressive power of the\n3While unraveling is a standard general technique; here we mean unraveling exactly in the sense of the mentioned definition. 4Here Γ is any path in the unraveling starting with Γ.\ncommunication language and the limits that puts on the resulting possible epistemic states under certain assumptions about how information is shared. The key point of the resolution operators, on the other hand, compared with the standard distributed knowledge operators, is to make a distinction between before and after the information sharing event. That distinction is not made in standard distributed knowledge – even restricted to full communication models: it is easy to see that, e.g., D{1,2}(p∧¬K1 p) is satisfiable also on full communication models. The two ideas, of limiting models to full communication models and of modeling group information sharing events using model updates, are orthogonal, and there is nothing against restricting logics with the resolution operators to full communication models. We leave that for future work. Furthermore, it would be interesting to look at a combined variant: “update by full communication”, which takes the communication language into account when defining the updated model.\nA main interest for future work is expressive power. Can it be shown that RCD is strictly more expressive than ELCD? Another, related, natural question is the relative expressivity ofRCD and PACD: can the combination of public announcement operators (which eliminate states) and distributed knowledge operators (which pick out states considered possible by everyone) always be used to “simulate” the resolution operators (which eliminate states considered possible by everyone)?\nAlso of interest for future work is to look at other assumptions about the other agents’ knowledge about the group communication event taking place. In this paper we only studied the case that it is common knowledge that the event takes place (but not what the agents in the group learn). That was naturally modeled using a “global” model update: in every state, replace accessibility for each agent in the group with the group accessibility (intersection). An interesting and also natural alternative is doing only a “local” model update: change accessibility in the same way, but only in the current state. That would correspond to it being common knowledge that if this is the current state, then the group resolves their knowledge.\nWhen looking at the interaction of the resolution and common knowledge operators one might be reminded of relativized common knowledge [3, 4]. Here is an open question: can RGCHϕ be expressed using relativized common knowledge, in combination with other operators?\nFinally, there is a conceptual relationship to group announcement logic [1], where formulas of the form 〈G〉ϕ say that G can make a joint public announcement such that ϕ will become true. A difference to the resolution operators in this paper is that latter model private communication. Yet, the exact relationship between these operators is interesting for future work."

S is non-empty, and 2. all vi’s and vG’s are equivalence relations, and 3.

It follows from the definition of closure (Definition 9) that the following formulas: • Dδ ({i},G1,...,Gn)RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ where i ∈ H • Dδ (H,G1,...,Gn)RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ • RG1 · · ·RGnϕ and ¬RG1 · · ·RGnϕ are all in cl(α). From left to right. Suppose RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γ, we continue by induction on the length of the path that every 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path from Γ is a canonical RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ-path. Then the left-to-right\ndirection follows: by ` CHϕ → ϕ , NR and RG-distribution (which follows from RR axioms) we get ` RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ → RG1 · · ·RGnϕ , and by RG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈ cl(α) we have RG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈ Γ.\nSuppose the length of the 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path is 0, i.e., the path is 〈Γ〉, we must show that RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γ. This is guaranteed by the supposition.\nSuppose the length of the 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path is n+ 1, i.e., the path is 〈Γ0 τ0 · · · τn−1 Γn τn Γn+1〉 with Γ0 = Γ and every τx is either in H or a subset of H. By the induction hypothesis we may assume that RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γn. • Suppose τn is an agent i (i ∈ H). By Axiom C1 we have ` CHϕ → KiCHϕ . It follows that `\nRG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ → RG1 · · ·RGnKiCHϕ by the rules NR and RG-distribution. Let δ = δ ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn). By the reduction axioms we move Ki left, i.e., ` RG1 · · ·RGnKiCHϕ → Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ , so we get ` RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ→Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ . Hence Γn `Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ . As Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ cl(α), we have Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γn. Moreover, by Proposition 9, i=vδ . Thus Dδ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γn+1 by the definition of vδ , and so RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γn+1. • Suppose τn is a group I (I ⊆ H). By Axioms C1, D1 and D2 we have ` CHϕ → DICHϕ . By NR\nand RG-distribution, ` RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ → RG1 · · ·RGnDICHϕ . By similar reasoning to the case above, we get the result RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γn+1 (we use δ (H,G1, . . . ,Gn) instead of δ ({i},G1, . . . ,Gn) in this case).\nIn both cases we get RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γn+1 as we wish to show. From right to left. Suppose that every 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path from Γ is a canonical RG1 · · ·RGnϕpath. Let S0 be the set of all maximal consistent sets ∆ in cl(α) such that every 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path from ∆ is a canonical RG1 · · ·RGnϕ-path. Now consider the formula\nλ = ∨\n∆∈S0\n∆\nWe will show the following: 1. ` Γ→ λ 2. ` λ → (EHλ ∧RG1 · · ·RGnϕ). From the above and the reduction rule for resolved common knowledge we get ` Γ→ RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ which furthermore entails RG1 · · ·RGnCHϕ ∈ Γ. We now continue with the proof of the two clauses.\n1. This is trivial, as Γ is one of the disjuncts of λ . 2. Suppose towards a contradiction that\nλ ∧¬(EHλ ∧RG1 · · ·RGnϕ)\nis consistent, i.e., λ ∧ (¬EHλ ∨¬RG1 · · ·RGnϕ) is consistent. Because λ is a disjunction there must be a disjunct Ξ of λ such that Ξ∧ (¬EHλ ∨¬RG1 · · ·RGnϕ) is consistent. It follows that either Ξ∧¬EHλ or Ξ∧¬RG1 · · ·RGnϕ is consistent.\nIf the former is consistent, then there must be an agent i ∈ H such that Ξ∧¬Kiλ is consistent, i.e., Ξ∧ K̂i¬ ∨ ∆∈S0 ∆ is consistent. Since ` ∨ ∆∈S ∆ by Lemma 2, we have ` ¬ ∨ ∆∈S0 ∆→ ∨ ∆′∈S\\S0 ∆\n′, and so there must be a Θ in S \\S0 such that Ξ∧ K̂iΘ is consistent. By item 4 of this lemma Ξ vi Θ (where v is the relation in the canonical pseudo model for cl(α)). But then Ξ cannot be in S0 for Θ /∈ S0. A contradiction!\nIf the latter is consistent, since ¬RG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈ cl(α) and Ξ is maximal, ¬RG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈ Ξ. But RG1 · · ·RGnϕ ∈Ξ since ΞvH Ξ and every 〈G1 · · ·Gn〉-resolved H-path from Ξ is a canonical RG1 · · ·RGnϕpath. We reach a contradiction."

Sometimes distributed knowledge is referred to as the potential knowledge of a group, or the joint knowledge they could obtain if they had unlimited means of communication. In epistemic logic, the formula DGφ is intended to express the fact that group G has distributed knowledge of φ , that there is enough information in the group to infer φ . But this is not the same as reasoning about what happens if the members of the group share their information. In this paper we introduce an operator RG, such that RGφ means that φ is true after G have shared all their information with each other – after G’s distributed knowledge has been resolved. The RG operators are called resolution operators. Semantically, we say that an expression RGφ is true iff φ is true in what van Benthem [11, p. 249] calls (G’s) communication core; the model update obtained by removing links to states for members of G that are not linked by all members of G. We study logics with different combinations of resolution operators and operators for common and distributed knowledge. Of particular interest is the relationship between distributed and common knowledge. The main results are sound and complete axiomatizations.",
