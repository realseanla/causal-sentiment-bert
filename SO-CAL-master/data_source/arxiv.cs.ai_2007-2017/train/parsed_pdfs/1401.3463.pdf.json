We propose an efficient encoding, and we test it on an extensive set of benchmarks, comparing the approach with the main state-of-the-art tools available. Although the encoding is necessarily worst-case exponential, from our experiments we notice that, in practice, this approach can handle most or all the problems which are at the reach of the other approaches, with performances which are comparable with, or even better than, those of the current state-of-the-art tools."

      "text" : "In the last two decades, modal and description logics have provided an essential framework for many applications in numerous areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies. For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated (e.g., Fitting, 1983; Ladner, 1977; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Halpern & Moses, 1992; Baader, Franconi, Hollunder, Nebel, & Profitlich, 1994; Massacci, 2000). In particular, the research in modal and description logics has followed two parallel routes until the seminal work of Schild (1991), which proved that the core modal logic Km and the core description logic ALC are one a notational variant of the other. Since then, analogous results have been produced for a bunch of other logics, so that, nowadays the two research lines have mostly merged into one research flow.\nMany approaches have been proposed for efficiently reasoning in modal and description logics, starting from the problem of checking the satisfiability in the core normal modal logic Km and in its notational variant, the description logic ALC (hereafter simply “Km”). We classify them as follows.\nc©2009 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.\n• The “classic” tableau-based approach (Fitting, 1983; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Massacci, 2000) is based on the construction of propositional tableau branches, which are recursively expanded on demand by generating successor nodes in a candidate Kripke model. Kris (Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Baader et al., 1994), Crack (Franconi, 1998), LWB (Balsiger, Heuerding, & Schwendimann, 1998) were among the main representative tools of this approach.\n• The DPLL-based approach (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996, 2000) differs from the previous one mostly in the fact that a Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) procedure, which treats the modal subformulas as propositions, is used instead of the classic propositional tableaux procedure at each nesting level of the modal operators. KSAT (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996), ESAT (Giunchiglia, Giunchiglia, & Tacchella, 2002) and *SAT (Tacchella, 1999), are the representative tools of this approach.\nThese two approaches merged into the “modern” tableaux-based approach, which has been extended to work with more expressive description logics and to provide more sophisticate reasoning functions. Among the tools employing this approach, we recall FaCT/FaCT++ and DLP (Horrocks & Patel-Schneider, 1999), and Racer (Haarslev & Moeller, 2001). 1\n• In the translational approach (Hustadt & Schmidt, 1999; Areces, Gennari, Heguiabehere, & de Rijke, 2000) the modal formula is encoded into first-order logic (FOL), and the encoded formula can be decided efficiently by a FOL theorem prover (Areces et al., 2000). Mspass (Hustadt, Schmidt, & Weidenbach, 1999) is the most representative tool of this approach.\n• The CSP-based approach (Brand, Gennari, & de Rijke, 2003) differs from the tableauxbased and DPLL-based ones mostly in the fact that a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) engine is used instead of tableaux/DPLL. KCSP is the only representative tool of this approach.\n• In the Inverse-method approach (Voronkov, 1999, 2001), a search procedure is based on the “inverted” version of a sequent calculus (which can be seen as a modalized version of propositional resolution). K K(Voronkov, 1999) is the only representative tool of this approach.\n• In the Automata-theoretic approach, (a symbolic representation based on BDDs – Binary Decision Diagrams – of) a tree automaton accepting all the tree models of the input formula is implicitly built and checked for emptiness (Pan, Sattler, & Vardi, 2002; Pan & Vardi, 2003). KBDD (Pan & Vardi, 2003) is the only representative tool of this approach.\n1. Notice that there is not an universal agreement on the terminology “tableaux-based” and “DPLL-based”. E.g., tools like FaCT, DLP, and Racer are most often called “tableau-based”, although they use a DPLL-like algorithm instead of propositional tableaux for handling the propositional component of reasoning (Horrocks, 1998; Patel-Schneider, 1998; Horrocks & Patel-Schneider, 1999; Haarslev & Moeller, 2001).\n• Pan and Vardi (2003) presented also an encoding of K-satisfiability into QBF-satisfiability (which is PSpace-complete too), combined with the use of a state-of-the-art QBF (Quantified Boolean Formula) solver. We call this approach QBF-encoding approach.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the last four approaches so far are restricted to the satisfiability in Km only, whilst the translational approach has been applied to numerous modal and description logics (e.g. traditional modal logics like Tm and S4m, and dynamic modal logics) and to the relational calculus.\nA significant amount of benchmarks formulas have been produced for testing the effectiveness of the different techniques (Halpern & Moses, 1992; Giunchiglia, Roveri, & Sebastiani, 1996; Heuerding & Schwendimann, 1996; Horrocks, Patel-Schneider, & Sebastiani, 2000; Massacci, 1999; Patel-Schneider & Sebastiani, 2001, 2003).\nIn the last two decades we have also witnessed an impressive advance in the efficiency of propositional satisfiability techniques (SAT), which has brought large and previouslyintractable problems at the reach of state-of-the-art SAT solvers. Most of the success of SAT technologies is motivated by the impressive efficiency reached by current implementations of the DPLL procedure, (Davis & Putnam, 1960; Davis, Longemann, & Loveland, 1962), in its most-modern variants (Silva & Sakallah, 1996; Moskewicz, Madigan, Zhao, Zhang, & Malik, 2001; Eén & Sörensson, 2004). Current implementations can handle formulas in the order of 107 variables and clauses.\nAs a consequence, many hard real-world problems have been successfully solved by encoding into SAT (including, e.g., circuit verification and synthesis, scheduling, planning, model checking, automatic test pattern generation , cryptanalysis, gene mapping). Effective encodings into SAT have been proposed also for the satisfiability problems in quantifier-free FOL theories which are of interest for formal verification (Strichman, Seshia, & Bryant, 2002; Seshia, Lahiri, & Bryant, 2003; Strichman, 2002). Notably, successful SAT encodings include also PSpace-complete problems, like planning (Kautz, McAllester, & Selman, 1996) and model checking (Biere, Cimatti, Clarke, & Zhu, 1999).\nIn this paper we start exploring the idea of performing automated reasoning tasks in modal and description logics by encoding them into SAT, so that to be handled by state-ofthe-art SAT tools; as with most previous approaches, we begin our investigation from the satisfiability in Km.\nIn theory, the task may look hopeless because of worst-case complexity issues: in fact, with few exceptions, the satisfiability problem in most modal and description logics is not in NP, typically being PSpace-complete or even harder —PSpace-complete for Km (Ladner, 1977; Halpern & Moses, 1992)— so that the encoding is in worst-case non polynomial. 2\nIn practice, however, a few considerations allow for not discarding that this approach may be competitive with the state-of-the-art approaches. First, the non-polynomial bounds above are worst-case bounds, and formulas may have different behaviors from that of the pathological formulas which can be found in textbooks. (E.g., notice that the exponentiality is based on the hypothesis of unboundedness of some parameter like the modal depth; Halpern & Moses, 1992; Halpern, 1995.) Second, some tricks in the encoding may allow for reducing the size of the encoded formula significantly. Third, as the amount of RAM\n2. We implicitly make the assumption NP 6= PSpace.\nmemory in current computers is in the order of the GBytes and current SAT solvers can successfully handle huge formulas, the encoding of many modal formulas (at least of those which are not too hard to solve also for the competitors) may be at the reach of a SAT solver. Finally, even for PSpace-complete logics like Km, also other state-of-the-art approaches are not guaranteed to use polynomial memory.\nIn this paper we show that, at least for the satisfiability Km, by exploiting some smart optimizations in the encoding the SAT-encoding approach becomes competitive in practice with previous approaches. To this extent, the contributions of this paper are manyfold.\n• We propose a basic encoding of Km formulas into purely-propositional ones, and prove that the encoding is satisfiability-preserving.\n• We describe some optimizations of the encoding, both in form of preprocessing and of on-the-fly simplification. These techniques allow for significant (and in some cases dramatic) reductions in the size of the resulting Boolean formulas, and in performances of the SAT solver thereafter.\n• We perform a very extensive empirical comparison against the main state-of-the-art tools available. We show that, despite the NP-vs.-PSpace issue, this approach can handle most or all the problems which are at the reach of the other approaches, with performances which are comparable with, and sometimes even better than, those of the current state-of-the-art tools. In our perspective, this is the most surprising contribution of the paper.\n• As a byproduct of our work, we obtain an empirical evaluation of current tools for Kmsatisfiability available, which is very extensive in terms of both amount and variety of benchmarks and of number and representativeness of the tools evaluated. We are not aware of any other such evaluation in the recent literature.\nWe also stress the fact that with our approach the encoder can be interfaced with every SAT solver in a plug-and-play manner, so that to benefit for free of every improvement in the technology of SAT solvers which has been or will be made available.\nContent. The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we provide the necessary background notions on modal logics and SAT. In Section 3 we describe the basic encoding from Km to SAT. In Section 4 we describe and discuss the main optimizations, and provide many examples. In Section 5 we present the empirical evaluation, and discuss the results. In Section 6 we present some related work and current research trends. In Section 7 we conclude, and describe some possible future evolutions.\nA six-page preliminary version of this paper, containing some of the basic ideas presented here, was presented at SAT’06 conference (Sebastiani & Vescovi, 2006). For the readers’ convenience, an online appendix is provided, containing all plots of Section 5 in full size. Moreover, in order to make the results reproducible, the encoder, the benchmarks and the random generators with the seeds used are also available in the online appendix."

      "heading" : "2.1 The Modal Logic Km",
      "text" : "We recall some basic definitions and properties of Km. Given a non-empty set of primitive propositions A = {A1, A2, . . .}, a set of m modal operators B = {21, . . . , 2m}, and the constants “True” and “False” (that we denote respectively with “>” and “⊥”) the language of Km is the least set of formulas containing A, closed under the set of propositional connectives {¬,∧,∨,→,↔} and the set of modal operators in B∪{31, . . . , 3m}. Notationally, we use the Greek letters α, β, ϕ, ψ, ν, π to denote formulas in the language of Km (Km-formulas hereafter). Notice that we can consider {¬,∧} together with B as the group of the primitive connectives/operators, defining the remaining in the standard way, that is: “3rϕ” for “¬2r¬ϕ”, “ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2” for “¬(¬ϕ1 ∧ ¬ϕ2)”, “ϕ1 → ϕ2” for “¬(ϕ1 ∧ ¬ϕ2)”, “ϕ1 ↔ ϕ2” for “¬(ϕ1 ∧ ¬ϕ2) ∧ ¬(ϕ2 ∧ ¬ϕ1)”. (Hereafter formulas like ¬¬ψ are implicitly assumed to be simplified into ψ, so that, if ψ is ¬φ, then by “¬ψ” we mean “φ”.) Notationally, we often write “( ∧ i li) → ∨ j lj” for the clause “ ∨ j ¬li ∨ ∨ j lj”, and “( ∧ i li) → ( ∧ j lj)” for the\nconjunction of clauses “ ∧ j( ∨\ni ¬li ∨ lj)”. Further, we often write 2r or 3r meaning one specific/generic modal operator, where it is assumed that r = 1, . . . ,m; and we denote by 2ir the nested application of the 2r operator i times: 2 0 rψ := ψ and 2 i+1 r ψ := 2r2 i rψ. We call depth of ϕ, written depth(ϕ), the maximum number of nested modal operators in ϕ. We call a propositional atom every primitive proposition in A, and a propositional literal every propositional atom (positive literal) or its negation (negative literal). We call a modal atom every formula which is either in the form 2rϕ or in the form 3rϕ.\nIn order to make our presentation more uniform, and to avoid considering the polarity of subformulas, we adopt the traditional representation of Km-formulas (introduced, as far as we know, by Fitting, 1983 and widely used in literature, e.g. Fitting, 1983; Massacci, 2000; Donini & Massacci, 2000) from the following table:\nα α1 α2 β β1 β2 π r πr0 ν r νr0 (ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) ϕ1 ϕ2 (ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2) ϕ1 ϕ2 3rϕ1 ϕ1 2rϕ1 ϕ1 ¬(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2) ¬ϕ1 ¬ϕ2 ¬(ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2) ¬ϕ1 ¬ϕ2 ¬2rϕ1 ¬ϕ1 ¬3rϕ1 ¬ϕ1 ¬(ϕ1 → ϕ2) ϕ1 ¬ϕ2 (ϕ1 → ϕ2) ¬ϕ1 ϕ2\nin which non-literal Km-formulas are grouped into four categories: α’s (conjunctive), β’s (disjunctive), π’s (existential), ν’s (universal). Importantly, all such formulas occur in the main formula with positive polarity only. This allows for disregarding the issue of polarity of subformulas.\nThe semantic of modal logics is given by means of Kripke structures. A Kripke structure for Km is a tuple M = 〈U ,L,R1, . . . ,Rm〉, where U is a set of states, L is a function L : A×U 7−→ {True, False}, and each Rr is a binary relation on the states of U . With an abuse of notation we write “u ∈M” instead of “u ∈ U”. We call a situation any pair M, u, M being a Kripke structure and u ∈ M. The binary relation |= between a modal formula\nϕ and a situation M, u is defined as follows:\nM, u |= >; M, u 6|= ⊥; M, u |= Ai, Ai ∈ A ⇐⇒ L(Ai, u) = True; M, u |= ¬Ai, Ai ∈ A ⇐⇒ L(Ai, u) = False; M, u |= α ⇐⇒ M, u |= α1 and M, u |= α2; M, u |= β ⇐⇒ M, u |= β1 or M, u |= β2; M, u |= πr ⇐⇒ M, w |= πr0 for some w ∈ U s.t. Rr(u,w) holds in M; M, u |= νr ⇐⇒ M, w |= νr0 for every w ∈ U s.t. Rr(u,w) holds in M.\n“M, u |= ϕ” should be read as “M, u satisfy ϕ in Km” (alternatively, “M, u Km-satisfies ϕ”). We say that a Km-formula ϕ is satisfiable in Km (Km-satisfiable henceforth) if and only if there exist M and u ∈M s.t. M, u |= ϕ. (When this causes no ambiguity, we sometimes drop the prefix “Km-”.) We say that w is a successor of u through Rr iff Rr(u,w) holds in M.\nThe problem of determining the Km-satisfiability of a Km-formula ϕ is decidable and PSPACE-complete (Ladner, 1977; Halpern & Moses, 1992), even restricting the language to a single Boolean atom (i.e., A = {A1}; Halpern, 1995); if we impose a bound on the modal depth of the Km-formulas, the problem reduces to NP-complete (Halpern, 1995). For a more detailed description on Km— including, e.g., axiomatic characterization, decidability and complexity results — we refer the reader to the works of Halpern and Moses (1992), and Halpern (1995).\nA Km-formula is said to be in Negative Normal Form (NNF) if it is written in terms of the symbols 2r, 3r, ∧, ∨ and propositional literals Ai, ¬Ai (i.e., if all negations occur only before propositional atoms in A). Every Km-formula ϕ can be converted into an equivalent one NNF (ϕ) by recursively applying the rewriting rules: ¬2rϕ=⇒3r¬ϕ, ¬3rϕ=⇒2r¬ϕ, ¬(ϕ1 ∧ ϕ2)=⇒(¬ϕ1 ∨ ¬ϕ2), ¬(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2)=⇒(¬ϕ1 ∧ ¬ϕ2), ¬¬ϕ=⇒ϕ.\nA Km-formula is said to be in Box Normal Form (BNF) (Pan et al., 2002; Pan & Vardi, 2003) if it is written in terms of the symbols 2r, ¬2r, ∧, ∨, and propositional literals Ai, ¬Ai (i.e., if no diamonds are there, and all negations occur only before boxes or before propositional atoms in A). Every Km-formula ϕ can be converted into an equivalent one BNF (ϕ) by recursively applying the rewriting rules: 3rϕ=⇒¬2r¬ϕ, ¬(ϕ1 ∧ϕ2)=⇒(¬ϕ1 ∨ ¬ϕ2), ¬(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2)=⇒(¬ϕ1 ∧ ¬ϕ2), ¬¬ϕ=⇒ϕ."

A high-level schema of a modern DPLL engine, adapted from the one presented by Zhang and Malik (2002), is reported in Figure 1. The Boolean formula ϕ is in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form); the assignment µ is initially empty, and it is updated in a stack-based manner.\nIn the main loop, decide next branch(ϕ, µ) chooses an unassigned literal l from ϕ according to some heuristic criterion, and adds it to µ.

(The iterative application of Boolean deduction steps in deduce is also called Boolean Constraint Propagation, BCP.) In the first case, DPLL returns sat. If the second case, analyze conflict(ϕ, µ) detects the subset η of µ which caused the conflict (conflict set) and the decision level blevel to backtrack. If blevel == 0, then a conflict exists even without branching, so that DPLL returns unsat. Otherwise, backtrack(blevel, ϕ, µ) adds the clause ¬η to ϕ (learning) and backtracks up to blevel (backjumping), updating ϕ and µ accordingly. In the third case, DPLL exits the inner loop, looking for the next decision.\nNotably, modern DPLL implementations implement techniques, like the two-watchedliteral scheme, which allow for extremely efficient handling of BCP (Moskewicz et al., 2001; Zhang & Malik, 2002). Old versions of DPLL used to implement also the Pure-Literal Rule (PLR) (Davis et al., 1962): when one proposition occurs only positively (resp. negatively) in the formula, it can be safely assigned to true (resp. false). Modern DPLL implementations, however, often do not implement it anymore due to its computational cost. For a much deeper description of modern DPLL-based SAT solvers, we refer the reader to the literature (e.g., Zhang & Malik, 2002)."

      "heading" : "3. The Basic Encoding",
      "text" : "We borrow some notation from the Single Step Tableau (SST) framework (Massacci, 2000; Donini & Massacci, 2000). We represent uniquely states in M as labels σ, represented as non empty sequences of integers 1.nr11 .n r2 2 . ... .n rk k , s.t. the label 1 represents the root state, and σ.nr represents the n-th Rr-successor of σ (where r ∈ {1, . . . , m}). With a little abuse of notation, hereafter we may say “a state σ” meaning “a state labeled by σ”. We call a labeled formula a pair 〈σ, ψ〉, such that σ is a state label and ψ is a Km-formula, and we\ncall labeled subformulas of a labeled formula 〈σ, ψ〉 all the labeled formulas 〈σ, φ〉 such that φ is a subformula of ψ.\nLet A〈 , 〉 be an injective function which maps a labeled formula 〈σ, ψ〉, s.t. ψ is not in the form ¬φ, into a Boolean variable A〈σ, ψ〉. We conventionally assume that A〈σ, >〉 is > and A〈σ, ⊥〉 is ⊥. Let L〈σ, ψ〉 denote ¬A〈σ, φ〉 if ψ is in the form ¬φ, A〈σ, ψ〉 otherwise. Given a Km-formula ϕ, the encoder Km2SAT builds a Boolean CNF formula as follows: 3\nKm2SAT (ϕ) def= A〈1, ϕ〉 ∧Def(1, ϕ) (1)\nDef(σ, >) def= > (2) Def(σ, ⊥) def= > (3) Def(σ, Ai)\ndef= > (4) Def(σ, ¬Ai) def= > (5)\nDef(σ, α) def= (L〈σ, α〉 → (L〈σ, α1〉 ∧ L〈σ, α2〉)) ∧Def(σ, α1) ∧Def(σ, α2) (6) Def(σ, β) def= (L〈σ, β〉 → (L〈σ, β1〉 ∨ L〈σ, β2〉)) ∧Def(σ, β1) ∧Def(σ, β2) (7) Def(σ, πr,j) def= (L〈σ, πr,j〉 → L〈σ.j, πr,j0 〉) ∧Def(σ.j, π r,j 0 ) (8)\nDef(σ, νr) def= ∧\nfor every 〈σ,πr,i〉\n( ((L〈σ, νr〉 ∧ L〈σ, πr,i〉) → L〈σ.i, νr0 〉) ∧ Def(σ.i, νr0) ) . (9)\nHere by “πr,j” we mean that πr,j is the j-th distinct πr formula labeled by σ. Notice that (6) and (7) generalize to the case of n-ary ∧ and ∨ in the obvious way: if φ is ⊗ni=1 φi s.t. ⊗ ∈ {∧,∨}, then Def(σ, φ) def= (L〈σ, φ〉 → ⊗n i=1 L〈σ, φi〉) ∧ ∧n\ni=1 Def(σ, φi). Although conceptually trivial, this fact has an important practical consequence: in order to encode⊗n\ni=1 φi one needs adding only one Boolean variable rather than up to n−1, see Section 4.2. Notice also that in rule (9) the literals of the type L〈σ, πr,i〉 are strictly necessary; in fact, the SAT problem must consider and encode all the possibly occuring states, but it can be the case, e.g., that a πr,i formula occurring in a disjunction is assigned to false for a particular state label σ (which, in SAT, corresponds to assign L〈σ, πr,i〉 to false). In this situation all the labeled formulas regarding the state label σ.i are useless, in particular those generated by the expansion of the ν formulas interacting with πr,i. 4\nWe assume that the Km-formulas are represented as DAGs (Direct Acyclic Graphs), so that to avoid the expansion of the same Def(σ, ψ) more than once. Then the various Def(σ, ψ) are expanded in a breadth-first manner wrt. the tree of labels, that is, all the possible expansions for the same (newly introduced) σ are completed before starting the expansions for a different state label σ′, and different state label are expanded in the order they are introduced (thus all the expansions for a given state are always handled before those of any deeper state). Moreover, following what done by Massacci (2000), we assume that, for each σ, the Def(σ, ψ)’s are expanded in the order: α/β, π, ν. Thus, each Def(σ, νr) is expanded after the expansion of all Def(σ, πr,i)’s, so that Def(σ, νr) will\n3. We say that the formula is in CNF because we represent clauses as implications, according to the notation described at the beginning of Section 2. 4. Indeed, (9) is a finite conjunction. In fact the number of π-subformulas is obviously finite and Km benefits of the finite-tree-model property (see, e.g., Pan et al., 2002; Pan & Vardi, 2003).\ngenerate one clause ((L〈σ, νr〉 ∧L〈σ, πr,i〉) → L〈σ.i, νr0 〉) and one novel definition Def(σ.i, νr0) for each Def(σ, πr,i) expanded. 5\nIntuitively, it is easy to see that Km2SAT (ϕ) mimics the construction of an SST tableau expansion (Massacci, 2000; Donini & Massacci, 2000). We have the following fact.\nTheorem 1. A Km-formula ϕ is Km-satisfiable if and only if the corresponding Boolean formula Km2SAT (ϕ) is satisfiable.\nThe complete proof of Theorem 1 can be found in Appendix A. Notice that, due to (9), the number of variables and clauses in Km2SAT (ϕ) may grow exponentially with depth(ϕ). This is in accordance to what was stated by Halpern and Moses (1992).\nExample 3.1 (NNF). Let ϕnnf be (3A1 ∨3(A2 ∨A3)) ∧ 2¬A1 ∧ 2¬A2 ∧ 2¬A3. 6 It is easy to see that ϕnnf is K1-unsatisfiable: the 3-atoms impose that at least one atom Ai is true in at least one successor of the root state, whilst the 2-atoms impose that all atoms Ai are false in all successor states of the root state. Km2SAT (ϕnnf ) is: 7\n1. A〈1, ϕnnf 〉 (1) 2. ∧ ( A〈1, ϕnnf 〉 → (A〈1, 3A1∨3(A2∨A3)〉 ∧A〈1, 2¬A1〉 ∧A〈1, 2¬A2〉 ∧A〈1, 2¬A3〉) ) (6) 3. ∧ ( A〈1, 3A1∨3(A2∨A3)〉 → (A〈1, 3A1〉 ∨A〈1, 3(A2∨A3)〉) ) (7) 4. ∧ ( A〈1, 3A1〉 → A〈1.1, A1〉 ) (8) 5. ∧ ( A〈1, 3(A2∨A3)〉 → A〈1.2, A2∨A3〉 ) (8) 6. ∧ ( (A〈1, 2¬A1〉 ∧A〈1, 3A1〉) → ¬A〈1.1, A1〉 ) (9) 7. ∧ ( (A〈1, 2¬A2〉 ∧A〈1, 3A1〉) → ¬A〈1.1, A2〉 ) (9) 8. ∧ ( (A〈1, 2¬A3〉 ∧A〈1, 3A1〉) → ¬A〈1.1, A3〉 ) (9) 9. ∧ ( (A〈1, 2¬A1〉 ∧A〈1, 3(A2∨A3)〉) → ¬A〈1.2, A1〉 ) (9) 10. ∧ ( (A〈1, 2¬A2〉 ∧A〈1, 3(A2∨A3)〉) → ¬A〈1.2, A2〉 ) (9) 11. ∧ ( (A〈1, 2¬A3〉 ∧A〈1, 3(A2∨A3)〉) → ¬A〈1.2, A3〉 ) (9) 12. ∧ ( A〈1.2, A2∨A3〉 → (A〈1.2, A2〉 ∨A〈1.2, A3〉) ) (7)\nAfter a run of Boolean constraint propagation (BCP), 3. reduces to the implicate disjunction. If the first element A〈1, 3A1〉 is assigned to true, then by BCP we have a conflict on 4. and 6. If it is set to false, then the second element A〈1, 3(A2∨A3)〉 is assigned to true, and by BCP we have a conflict on 12. Thus Km2SAT (ϕnnf ) is unsatisfiable. 3"

In our approach, instead, we pre-convert them into BNF (like, e.g., Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996; Pan et al., 2002). For our approach, the advantage of the latter representation is that, when one 2rψ occurs both positively and negatively (like, e.g., in (2rψ ∨ ...) ∧ (¬2rψ ∨ ...) ∧ ...), then both occurrences of 2rψ are labeled by the same Boolean atom A〈σ, 2rψ〉, and hence they are always assigned the same truth value by DPLL. With NNF, instead, the negative occurrence ¬2rψ is rewritten into 3r(nnf(¬ψ)), so that two distinct Boolean atoms A〈σ, 2r(nnf(ψ))〉 and A〈σ, 3r(nnf(¬ψ))〉 are generated; DPLL can assign them the same truth value, creating a hidden conflict which may require some extra Boolean search to reveal. 8\nExample 4.1 (BNF). We consider the BNF variant of the ϕnnf formula of Example 3.1, ϕbnf = (¬2¬A1 ∨ ¬2(¬A2 ∧ ¬A3)) ∧ 2¬A1 ∧ 2¬A2 ∧ 2¬A3. As before, it is easy to see that ϕbnf is K1-unsatisfiable.

In fact, the unit-propagation of A〈1, 2¬A1〉 from 2. causes ¬A〈1, 2¬A1〉 in 8.

With ϕnnf , Km2SAT does not recognize 2¬A1 and 3A1 to be one the negation of the other, so that two distinct atoms A〈1, 2¬A1〉 and A〈1, 3A1〉 are generated. Hence A〈1, 2¬A1〉 and A〈1, 3A1〉 cannot be recognized by DPLL to be one the negation of the other, s.t.

This causes the introduction of duplicated Boolean atoms A〈σ, ψ′〉 and A〈σ, ψ′′〉 and —much worse— of duplicated subformulas Def(σ, ψ′) and Def(σ, ψ′′). This fact can have very negative consequences, in particular when ψ′ and ψ′′ occur with negative polarity, because this causes the creation of distinct versions of the same successor states, and the duplication of whole parts of the output formula.\nExample 4.2. Consider the Km-formula (φ1 ∨¬21(A2 ∨A1))∧ (φ2 ∨¬21(A1 ∨A2))∧ φ3, s.t. φ1, φ2, φ3 are possibly-big Km-formulas. Then Km2SAT creates two distinct atoms A〈1, ¬21(A2∨A1)〉 and A〈1, ¬21(A1∨A2)〉 and two distinct formulas Def(1, ¬21(A2 ∨A1)) and Def(1, ¬21(A1 ∨A2)). The latter will cause the creation of two distinct states 1.1 and 1.2. Thus, the recursive expansion of all 21-formulas occurring positively in φ1, φ2, φ3 will be duplicated for these two states. 3\nIn order to cope with this problem, as done by Giunchiglia and Sebastiani (1996), we apply some normalization steps to modal atoms with the intent of rewriting as many as possible syntactically-different but semantically-equivalent modal atoms into syntacticallyidentical ones. This can be achieved by a recursive application of some simple validitypreserving rewriting rules.\nSorting: modal atoms are internally sorted according to some criterion, so that atoms which are identical modulo reordering are rewritten into the same atom (e.g., 2i(ϕ2∨ ϕ1) and 2i(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2) are both rewritten into 2i(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2)).\nFlattening: the associativity of ∧ and ∨ is exploited and combinations of ∧’s or ∨’s are “flattened” into n-ary ∧’s or ∨’s respectively (e.g., 2i(ϕ1 ∨ (ϕ2 ∨ ϕ3)) and 2i((ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2) ∨ ϕ3) are both rewritten into 2i(ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2 ∨ ϕ3)).\nFlattening has also the advantage of reducing the number of novel atoms introduced in the encoding, as a consequence of the fact noticed in Section 3. One possible drawback of this technique is that it can reduce the sharing of subformulas (e.g., with 2i((ϕ1 ∨ ϕ2) ∨ ϕ3) and 2i((ϕ1∨ϕ2)∨ϕ4), the common part is no more shared). However, we have empirically experienced that this drawback is negligible wrt. the advantages of flattening."

In BNF, in fact, the same subformula 2rψ may occur in the same state σ both positively and negatively (like πr = ¬2rψ and νr = 2rψ). If so, Km2SAT labels both those occurrences of 2rψ with the same Boolean atom A〈σ, 2rψ〉, and produces recursively two distinct subsets of clauses in the encoding, by applying (8) to ¬2rψ and (9) to 2rψ respectively. However, the latter step (9) generates a valid clause (A〈σ, 2rψ〉 ∧ ¬A〈σ, 2rψ〉) → A〈σ.i, ψ〉, so that we can avoid generating it. Consequently, if\nA〈σ.i, ψ〉 no more occurs in the formula, then Def(σ.i, ψ) should not be generated, as there is no more need of defining 〈σ.i, ψ〉. 11\nExample 4.6.

First, for every σ, both positive and negative instances of 〈σ,2r>〉 can be safely simplified by applying the rewriting rule 〈σ,2r>〉 =⇒ 〈σ,>〉.\nSecond, we notice the following fact. When we have a positive occurrence of 〈σ,¬2r⊥〉 for some σ (we suppose wlog. that we have only that πr-formula for σ), 12 by definition of (8) and (9) we have\nDef(σ, ¬2r⊥) = (L〈σ, ¬2r⊥〉 → A〈σ.j, >〉) ∧Def(σ.j, >), (11) Def(σ, 2rψ) = ((L〈σ, 2rψ〉 ∧ L〈σ, ¬2r⊥〉) → L〈σ.j, ψ〉) ∧Def(σ.j, ψ) (12)\nfor some new label σ.j and for every 2rψ occurring positively in σ. Def(σ, ¬2r⊥) reduces to > because both A〈σ.j, >〉 and Def(σ.j, >) reduce to >. If at least another distinct πformula ¬2rϕ occurs positively in σ, however, there is no need for the σ.j label in (11) and (12) to be a new label, and we can re-use instead the label σ.i introduced in the expansion of Def(σ, ¬2rϕ), as follows:\nDef(σ, ¬2rϕ) = (L〈σ, ¬2rϕ〉 → L〈σ.i, ¬ϕ〉) ∧Def(σ.i, ¬ϕ).

(Notice the label σ.i introduced in (13) rather than the label σ.j of (11).) This is motivated by the fact that Def(σ, ¬2r⊥) forces the existence of at least one successor of σ but imposes no constraints on which formulas should hold there, so that we can use some other already-defined successor state, if any. This fact has the important benefit of eliminating useless successor states from the encoding.\n11. Here the “if” is due to the fact that it may be the case that A〈σ.i, ψ〉 is generated anyway from the expansion of some other subformula, like, e.g., 2r(ψ ∨ φ). If this is the case, Def(σ.i, ψ) must be generated anyway. 12. E.g., ¬2r⊥ may result from applying the steps of Section 4.1 and of Section 4.5 to ¬2r(2rA1∧3r¬A1).\nExample 4.7.

(In a practical implementation it is not even generated.) Notice that in clauses 11., 12. and 13. it is used the label 1.1 of clauses 8., 9. and 10. rather than a new label 1.2. Thus, only one successor label is generated.\nWhen DPLL is run on Km2SAT (ϕ), by BCP 1. and 2. are immediately satisfied and the implicants are removed from 3., 4., 5., 6.. Thanks to 5. and 6., A〈1, A1〉 can be assigned only to false, which causes 3. to be satisfied and forces the assignment of the literals ¬A〈1, 2⊥〉, A〈1, 2¬A4〉 by BCP on 3. and 7. and hence of ¬A〈1.1, ⊥〉, ¬A〈1.1, A4〉 and A〈1.1, A4〉 by BCP on 12. and 13., causing a contradiction. 3\nIt is worth noticing that (14) is strictly necessary for the correctness of the encoding even when another π-formula occurs in σ.

Here we make the same consideration as in Footnote 11: if L〈σ.j, ψ〉 is generated also from the expansion of some other subformula, (e.g., 2r(ψ ∨ φ)), then (another instance of) Def(σ.i, ψ) must be generated anyway.\nExample 4.10. Consider Example 4.1, and suppose we apply on-the-fly BCP. During the construction of 1., 2. and 3. in Km2SAT (ϕbnf ), the atoms A〈1, ϕbnf 〉, A〈1, (¬2¬A1∨¬2(¬A2∧¬A3))〉, A〈1, 2¬A1〉, A〈1, 2¬A2〉 and A〈1, 2¬A3〉 are deterministically assigned to true by BCP. This causes the removal from 3. of the first-implied disjunct ¬A〈1, 2¬A1〉, so that there is no need to generate Def(1, ¬2¬A1), and hence label 1.1. is not defined and 4. is not generated. While building 5., A〈1.2, (¬A2∧¬A3)〉, is unit-propagated. As label 1.1. is not defined, 6., 7. and 8. are not generated. Then during the construction of 5., 9., 10., 11. and 12., by applying BCP a contradiction is found, so that Km2SAT (ϕ) is ⊥.\nAn analogous situation happens with ϕbnflift in Example 4.3: while building 1. and 2. a contradiction is found by BCP, s.t. Km2SAT returns ⊥ without expanding the formula any further. Same discourse holds for ϕbnfclift in Example 4.4: while building 1., 2. and 3. a contradiction is found by BCP, s.t. Km2SAT returns ⊥ without expanding the formula any further. 3"

      "heading" : "4.9 A Paradigmatic Example: Halpern & Moses Branching Formulas.",
      "text" : "Among all optimizations described in this Section 4, on-the-fly BCP is by far the most effective. In order to better understand this fact, we consider as a paradigmatic example the branching formulas ϕKh by Halpern and Moses (1992, 1995) (also called “k branch n” in the set of benchmark formulas proposed by Heuerding and Schwendimann, 1996) and their unsatisfiable version (called “k branch p” in the above-mentioned benchmark suite).\nGiven a single modality 2, an integer parameter h, and the primitive propositions D0, . . . , Dh+1, P1, . . . , Ph, the formulas ϕKh are defined as follows: 16\nϕKh def= D0 ∧ ¬D1 ∧\nh∧\ni=0\n2i(depth ∧ determined ∧ branching), (15)\ndepth def=\nh+1∧\ni=1\n(Di → Di−1), (16)\ndetermined def=\nh∧\ni=1\n( Di → ( ( Pi → 2(Di → Pi)) ∧ (¬Pi → 2(Di → ¬Pi)) ) ) , (17)\nbranching def=\nh−1∧\ni=0\n( (Di ∧ ¬Di+1) → ( 3(Di+1 ∧ ¬Di+2 ∧ Pi+1) ∧ 3(Di+1 ∧ ¬Di+2 ∧ ¬Pi+1) ) ) . (18)\nA conjunction of the formulas depth, determined and branching is repeated at every nesting level of modal operators (i.e. at every depth): depth captures the relation between the Di’s at every level; determined states that, if Pi is true [false] in a state at depth ≥ i, then it is true [false] in all the successor states of depth ≥ i; branching states that, for every node at depth i, it is possible to find two successor states at depth i + 1 such that Pi+1 is true in one and false in the other. For each value of the parameter h, ϕKh is K-satisfiable, and every Kripke model M that satisfies it has at least 2h+1− 1 states. In fact, ϕKh is build in such a way to force the construction of a binary-tree Kripke model of depth h+1, each of\n16. For the sake of better readability, here we adopt the description given by Halpern and Moses (1992) without converting the formulas into BNF. This fact does not affect the discussion.\nwhose leaves encodes a distinct truth assignment to the primitive propositions P1, . . . , Ph, whilst each Di is true in all and only the states occurring at a depth ≥ i in the tree (and thus denotes the level of nesting).\nThe unsatisfiable counterpart formulas proposed by Heuerding and Schwendimann (1996) (whose negations are the valid formulas called k branch p in the previously-mentioned benchmark suite, which are exposed in more details in Section 5.1.1) are obtained by conjoining to (15) the formula:\n2hPbh 3 c+1 (19)\n(where bxc is the integer part of x) which forces the atom Pbh 3 c+1 to be true in all depth-h states of the candidate Kripke model, which is incompatible with the fact that the remaining specifications say that it has to be false in half depth-h states. 17\nThese formulas are very pathological for many approaches (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 2000; Giunchiglia, Giunchiglia, Sebastiani, & Tacchella, 2000; Horrocks et al., 2000). In particular, before introducing on-the-fly BCP, they used to be the pet hate of our Km2SAT approach, as they caused the generation of huge Boolean formulas. In fact, due to branching (18), ϕKh contains 2h 3-formulas (i.e., π-formulas) at every depth. Therefore, the Km2SAT encoder of Section 3 has to consider 1 + 2h + (2h)2 + ... + (2h)h+1 = ((2h)h+2− 1)/(2h− 1) distinct labels, which is about hh+1 times the number of those labeling the states which are actually needed. (None of the optimizations of Sections 4.1-4.7 is of any help with these formulas, because neither BNF encoding nor atom normalization causes any sharing of subformulas, the formulas are already in lifted form, and no literal occurs pure. 18)\nThis pathological behavior can be mostly overcome by applying on-the-fly-BCP, because some truth values can be deterministically assigned to some subformulas of ϕKh by on-thefly-BCP, which prevent encoding some or even most 2/3-subformulas.\nIn fact, consider the branching and determined formulas occurring in ϕKh at a generic depth d ∈ {0...h}, which determine the states at level d in the tree. As in these states D0, ..., Dd are forced to be true and Dd+1, ..., Dh+1 are forced to be false, then all but the d-th conjunct in branching (all conjuncts if d = h) are forced to be true and thus they could be dropped. Therefore, only 2 3-formulas per non-leaf level could be considered instead, causing the generation of 2h+1 − 1 labels overall. Similarly, in all states at level d the last h−d conjuncts in determined are forced to be true and could be dropped, reducing significantly the number of 2-formulas to be considered.\nIt is easy to see that this is exactly what happens by applying on-the-fly-BCP. In fact, suppose that the construction of Km2SAT (ϕKh ) has reached depth d (that is, the point where for every state σ at level d, the Def(σ, α)’s and Def(σ, β)’s are expanded but no Def(σ, π) and Def(σ, ν) is expanded yet). Then, BCP deterministically assigns true to the literals L〈σ, D0〉, ..., L〈σ, Dd〉 and false to L〈σ, Dd+1〉, ..., L〈σ, Dh+1〉, which removes all but one conjuncts in branching, so that only two Def(σ, π)’s out of 2h ones are actually expanded; similarly, the last h − d conjuncts in determined are removed, so that the corresponding Def(σ, ν)’s are not expanded.\n17. Heuerding and Schwendimann do not explain the choice of the index “bh 3 c + 1”. We understand that\nalso other choices would have done the job. 18. More precisely, only one literal, ¬Dh+1, occurs pure in branching, but assigning it plays no role in\nsimplifying the formula.\nAs far as the unsatisfiable version Km2SAT (ϕKh ∧ 2hPbh 3 c+1) is concerned, when the expansion reaches depth h, thanks to (19), L〈σ, Pbh3 c+1〉 is generated and deterministically assigned to true by BCP for every depth-h label σ; thanks to determined and branching, BCP assigns all literals L〈σ, P1〉, ..., L〈σ, Ph〉 deterministically, so that L〈σ, Pbh3 c+1〉 is assigned to false for 50% of the depth-h labels σ. This causes a contradiction, so that the encoder stops the expansion and returns ⊥.\nFigure 2 shows the growth in size and the CPU time required to encode and solve Km2SAT (ϕKh ) (1st row) and Km2SAT (ϕ K h ∧ 2hPbh\n3 c+1) (2nd row) wrt. the parameter h,\nfor eight combinations of the following options of the encoder: with and without box-lifting, with and without on-the-fly PLR, with and without on-the-fly BCP. (Notice the log scale of the y axis.) In Figure 2(d) the plots of the four versions “-xxx-bcp” (with on-the-fly BCP) coincide with the line of value 1 (i.e, one variable) and in Figure 2(e) they coincide with an horizontal line of value 2 (i.e, two clauses), corresponding to the fact that the 1-variable/2-clause formula A1 ∧ ¬A1 is returned (see Footnote 14).\nWe notice a few facts. First, for both formulas, the eight plots always collapse into two groups of overlapping plots, representing the four variants with and without on-the-fly BCP respectively. This shows that box-lifting and on-the-fly PLR are almost irrelevant in the encoding of these formulas, causing just little variations in the time required by the encoder (Figures 2(c) and 2(f)); notice that enabling on-the-fly PLR alone permits to encode (but not to solve) only one problem more wrt. the versions without both on-the-fly PLR and BCP. Second, the four versions with on-the-fly-BCP always outperform of several orders magnitude these without this option, in terms of both size of encoded formulas and of CPU time required to encode and solve them. In particular, in the case of the unsatisfiable variant (Figure 2, second row) the encoder returns the ⊥ formula, so that no actual work is required to the SAT solver (the plot of Figure 2(f) refers only to encoding time)."

      "heading" : "5. Empirical Evaluation",
      "text" : "In order to verify empirically the effectiveness of this approach, we have performed a veryextensive empirical test session on about 14,000 Km/ALC formulas. We have implemented the encoder Km2SAT in C++, with some flags corresponding to the optimizations exposed in the previous section: (i) NNF/BNF, performing a pre-conversion into NNF/BNF before the encoding; (ii) lift/ctrl.lift/nolift, performing respectively Box Lifting, Controlled Box Lifting or no Box Lifting before the encoding; (iii) plr if on-the-fly Pure Literal Reduction is performed and (iv) bcp if on-the-fly Boolean Constraint Propagation is performed. The techniques introduced in Section 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 4.6 are hardwired in the encoder. Moreover, as pre-conversion into BNF almost always produces smaller formulas than NNF, we have set the BNF flag as a default.\nIn combination with Km2SAT we have tried several SAT solvers on our encoded formulas (including Zchaff 2004.11.15, Siege v4, BerkMin 5.6.1, MiniSat v1.13, SATElite v1.0, SAT-Elite GTI 2005 submission 19, MiniSat 2.0 061208 and Rsat 1.03).\n19. In the preliminary evaluation of the available SAT solvers we have also tried SAT-Elite as a preprocessor to reduce the size of the SAT formula generated by Km2SAT without the bcp option before to solve it. However, even if the preprocessing can signinificantly reduce the size of the formula, it has turned out\nAfter a preliminary evaluation and further intensive experiments we have selected Rsat 1.03 (Pipatsrisawat & Darwiche, 2006), because it produced the best overall performances on our benchmark suites (although the performance gaps wrt. other SAT tools, e.g. MiniSat 2.0, were not dramatic).\nWe have downloaded the available versions of the state-of-the-art tools for Km-satisfiability. After an empirical evaluation 20 we have selected Racer 1-7-24 (Haarslev & Moeller, 2001) and *SAT 1.3 (Tacchella, 1999) as the best representatives of the tableaux/DPLL-based tools, Mspass v 1.0.0t.1.3 (Hustadt & Schmidt, 1999; Hustadt et al., 1999) 21 as the best representative of the FOL-encoding approach, KBDD (unique version) (Pan et al., 2002; Pan & Vardi, 2003) 22 as the representative of the automata-theoretic approach. No representative of the CSP-based and of the inverse method approaches could be used. 23 Notice that all these tools but Racer are experimental tools, as far as Km2SAT which is a prototype, and many of them (e.g. *SAT and KBDD) are no longer maintained.\nFinally, as representative of the QBF-encoding approach, we have selected the K-QBF translator (Pan & Vardi, 2003) combined with the sKizzo version 0.8.2 QBF solver (Benedetti, 2005), which turned out to be by far 24 the best QBF solver on our benchmarks among the freely-available QBF solvers from the QBF2006 competition (Narizzano, Pulina, & Tacchella, 2006). (In our evaluation we have considered the tools : 2clsQ, SQBF, preQuantor—i.e. preQuel +Quantor— Quantor 2.11, and Semprop 010604.)\nAll tests presented in this section have been performed on a two-processor Intel Xeon 3.0GHz computer, with 1 MByte Cache each processor, 4 GByte RAM, with Red Hat Linux 3.0 Enterprise Server, where four processes can run in parallel. When reporting the results for one Km2SAT +Rsat version, the CPU times reported are the sums of both\nthat this preprocessing is too time-expensive and that the overall time spent for preprocessing and then solving the reduced problem is higher than that solving directly the original encoded SAT formula. 20. As we did for the selection of the SAT solver, in order to select the tools to be used in the empirical evaluation, we have performed a preliminary evaluation on the smaller benchmark suites (i.e. the LWB and, sometimes, the TANCS 2000 ones; see later). Importantly, from this preliminary evaluation Racer turned out to be definitely more efficient than FaCT++, being able to solve more problems in less time. Also, in order to meet the reviewers’ suggestions, we repeated this preliminary evaluation with the latest versions of FaCT++ (v1.2.3, March 5th, 2009) and the same version of Racer used in this paper. In this evaluation Racer solves ten more problems than FaCT++ on the LWB benchmark, and over than one hundred of problems more than FaCT++ on the whole TANCS 2000 suite. Also on 2m-CNF random problems Racer outperforms FaCT++. (We include in the online appendix the plots of this comparison between Racer and FaCT++.) 21. We have run Mspass with the options -EMLTranslation=2 -EMLFuncNary=1 -Sorts=0 -CNFOptSkolem=0 -CNFStrSkolem=0 -Select=2 -Split=-1 -DocProof=0 -PProblem=0 -PKept=0\n-PGiven=0, which are suggested for Km-formulas in the Mspass README file. We have also tried other options, but the former gave the best performances. 22. KBDD has been recompiled to be run with an increased internal memory bound of 1 GB. 23. At the moment K Kis not freely available, and we failed in the attempt of obtaining it from the authors.\nKCSP is a prolog piece of software, which is difficult to compare in performances wrt. other optimized tools on a common platform; moreover, KCSP is no more maintained since 2005, and it is not competitive wrt. state-of-the-art tools (Brand, 2008). Other tools like leanK, 2KE, LWB, Kris are not competitive with the ones listed above (Horrocks et al., 2000). KSAT (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996, 2000; Giunchiglia et al., 2000) has been reimplemented into *SAT. 24. Unlike with the choice of SAT solver, the performance gaps from the best choice and the others were very significant: e.g., in the LWB benchmark (see later), sKizzo was able to solve nearly 90 problems more than its best QBF competitor.\nthe encoding and Rsat solving times. When reporting the results for K-QBF +sKizzo, the CPU times reported are only due to sKizzo because the time spent by the K-QBF converter is negligible.\nWe anticipate that, for all formulas of all benchmark suites, all tools under test —i.e. all the variants of Km2SAT +Rsat and all the state-of-the-art Km-satisfiability solvers— agreed on the satisfiability/unsatisfiability result when terminating within the timeout.\nRemark 1. Due to the big number of empirical tests performed and to the huge amount of data plotted, and due to limitations in size, and in order to to make the plots clearly distinguishable in the figures, we have limited the number of plots included in the following part of the paper, considering only the most meaningful ones and those regarding the most challenging benchmark problems faced. For the sake of the reader’s convenience, however, full-size versions of all plots and many other plots regarding the not-exposed results (also on the easier problems), are available in the online appendix, together with the files with all data. When discussing the empirical evaluation we may include in our considerations also these results."

For a discussion on this benchmark suite, we refer the reader to the work of Heuerding and Schwendimann (1996) and of Horrocks et al.

(2000), and Patel-Schneider and Sebastiani (2003). This is a generalization of the well-known random k-SAT test methods, and is the final result of a long discussion in the communities of modal and description logics on how to to obtain significant and flawless random benchmarks for modal/description logics (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996; Hustadt & Schmidt, 1999; Giunchiglia et al., 2000; Horrocks et al., 2000; Patel-Schneider & Sebastiani, 2003).\nIn the 2m-CNF test methodology, a 2m-CNF formula is randomly generated according to the following parameters:\n• the (maximum) modal depth d; • the number of top-level clauses L; • the number of literal per clause clauses k; • the number of distinct propositional variables N ; • the number of distinct box symbols m; • the percentage p of purely-propositional literals in clauses occurring at depth < d, s.t.\neach clause of length k contains on average p · k randomly-picked Boolean literals and k − p · k randomly-generated modal literals 2rψ, ¬2rψ. 27\n(We refer the reader to the works of Horrocks et al., 2000, and Patel-Schneider & Sebastiani, 2003 for a more detailed description.)\nA typical problem set is characterized by fixed values of d, k, N , m, and p: L is varied in such a way as to empirically cover the “100% satisfiable / 100% unsatisfiable” transition. In other words, many problems with the same values of d, k, N, m, and p but an increasing number of clauses L are generated, starting from really small, typically satisfiable problems (i.e. with a probability of generating a satisfiable problem near to one) to huge problems, where the increasing interactions among the numerous clauses typically leads to unsatisfiable problems (i.e. it makes the probability of generating satisfiable problems converging to zero). Then, for each tuple of the five values in a problem set, a certain number of 2m-CNF formulas are randomly generated, and the resulting formulas are given in the input to the procedure under test, with a maximum time bound. The fraction of formulas which were solved within a given timeout, and the median/percentile values of CPU times are plotted against the ratio L/N . Also, the fraction of satisfiable/unsatisfiable formulas is plotted for a better understanding.\n27. More precisely, the number of Boolean literals in a clause is bp · kc (resp. dp · ke) with probability dp · ke − p · k (resp. 1 − (dp · ke − p · k)). Notice that typically the smaller is p, the harder is the problem (Horrocks et al., 2000; Patel-Schneider & Sebastiani, 2003).\nFollowing the methodology proposed by Horrocks et al. (2000), and by Patel-Schneider and Sebastiani (2003), we have fixed m = 1, k = 3 and 100 samples per point in all tests, and we have selected two groups: an “easier” one, with d = 1, p = 0.5, N = 6, 7, 8, 9, L/N = 10..60, and a “harder” one, with d = 2, p = 0.6, 0.5, N = 3, 4, L/N = 30..150 with p = 0.6 and L/N = 50..140 with p = 0.5, varying the L/N ratio in steps of 5, for a total amount of 13,200 formulas.\nIn each test, we imposed a timeout of 500 seconds per sample 28 and we calculated the number of samples which were solved within the timeout, and the 50%th and 90%th percentiles of CPU time. 29 In order to correlate the performances with the (un)satisfiability of the sample formulas, in the background of each plot we also plot the satisfiable/unsatisfiable ratio."

It contains both satisfiable and unsatisfiable formulas, with scalable hardness. In this benchmark suite, which we call TANCS 2000, the formulas are constructed by translating QBF formulas into K using three translation schemas, namely the Schmidt-Schauss-Smolka translation (240 problems with many different depths, from 19 to 112), the Ladner translation (240 problems, again with depths in the same range 19 – 112), and the Halpern translation (56 problems of depth among: 20, 28, 40, 56, 80 or 112) (Massacci & Donini, 2000).

Table 1(a) reports in the left block the indexes of the hardest formulas encoded within the file-size limit and, in the right block, those of the hardest formulas solved within the timeout by Rsat; Table 1(b) reports the numbers of variables and clauses of Km2SAT (ϕ), referring to the hardest formulas solved within the timeout by Rsat (i.e., those reported in the right block of Table 1(a)). For instance, the BNF-ctrl.lift-plr-bcp encoding of k dum n(21) contains 11·106 variables and 14·106 clauses; it is the hardest k dum n problem solved by Rsat with BNF-ctrl.lift-plr-bcp and it is the first which is not solved with BNF-ctrl.lift.\nLooking at the numbers of cases solved in Table 1(a), we notice that the introduction of the on-the-fly Pure Literal Reduction and Boolean Constraint Propagation optimizations is really effective and produces a consistent performance enhancement (the effect of these optimizations is eye-catching in the branching formulas k branch * – see Section 4.9 – and in the k path * formulas). We also notice that lift sometimes introduces some slight further improvement.\nThe view of Tables 1(a) and 1(b) hides the actual CPU times required to encode and solve the problems. Small gaps in the numbers of Table 1(a) may correspond to big gaps in CPU time. In order to analyze also this aspect, in Figure 3 we plotted the total cumulative amount of CPU time spent by all the variants of Km2SAT +Rsat to solve all the problems of the LWB benchmark, sorted by hardness. For this plot, we also considered three more options —BNF, lift/ctrl.lift/nolift, with plr on and bcp off— so that to evaluate also the effect of plr and bcp separately. We notice that the plots are clearly clustered into three groups of increasing performance: BNF-*, BNF-*-plr, and BNF-*-plr-bcp., “*” representing the three options lift/ctrl.lift/nolift. This highlights the fact that on this suite on-the-fly Pure Literal Reduction significantly improves the performances, that on-the-fly Boolean Constraint Propagation introduces drastic improvements, and that the variations due to Box Lifting are minor wrt. the other two optimizations.\nOverall, the configuration BNF-lift-plr-bcp turns out to be the best performer on this suite, with a tiny advantage wrt. BNF-ctrl.lift-plr-bcp.\n5.2.2 Results on the Random 2m-CNF Benchmark Suite\nThe results on the random 2m-CNF benchmark suite are reported in Figures 4 and 5. In Figure 4 we report the 50%-percentile CPU times required to encode and solve the formulas by the different Km2SAT +Rsat variants for the hardest benchmarks problems. We don’t report the percentage of solved problems since it is always 100%, i.e. Km2SAT +Rsat terminates within the timeout for every problem in the benchmark suite.\nThe tests with depth d = 1 (see the results on the hardest problems of the class in the first row of Figure 4) are simply too easy for Km2SAT +Rsat (but not for its competitors, see Section 5.3) which solved every sample formula in less than 1 second. Although the tests exposed in the second and third row of Figure 4 are more challenging, they are all solved within the timeout as well. We have noticed also that the results are rather regular, since there are no big gaps between 50%- and 90%-percentile values.\nIn general, we do not have relevant performance gaps between the various configurations on this benchmark suite; it seems that in the majority of cases ctrl.lift slightly beats nolift and nolift slightly beats lift. These gaps are even more relevant if we consider the size of the formulas generated (Figure 5). We believe that this may be due to the fact that random 2m-CNF formulas may contain lots of shared subformulas 2rψ, so that lifting may cause a reduction of such sharing (see Section 3). Further, plr-bcp does not seem to introduce relevant improvements here. We believe that this is due to the fact that these random formulas produce pure and unit literals with very low or even zero probability.\nOverall, the configuration BNF-nolift turns out to be the best performer on this suite, with a slight advantage wrt. BNF-ctrl.lift-plr-bcp.\nFinally, from some plots of Figure 4 we notice that for Km2SAT +Rsat the problems tend to be harder within the satisfiability/unsatisfiability transition area. (This fact holds especially for Racer and *SAT, see Section 5.3.) This seems to confirm the fact that the easy-hard-easy pattern of random k-SAT extends also to 2m-CNF, as already observed in literature (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996, 2000; Giunchiglia et al., 2000; Horrocks et al., 2000; Patel-Schneider & Sebastiani, 2003)."

      "text" : "As highlighted by Giunchiglia et al. (2000), and Horrocks et al. (2000), the satisfiability problem in modal logics like Km is characterized by the alternation of two orthogonal components of reasoning: a Boolean component, performing Boolean reasoning within each state, and a modal component, generating the successor states of each state. The latter must cope with the fact that the candidate models may be up to exponentially big wrt. depth(ϕ), whilst the former must cope with the fact that there may be up to exponentially\nmany candidate (sub)models to explore. In the Km2SAT +DPLL approach the encoder has to handle the whole modal component (rules (8) and (9)), whilst the handling of the whole Boolean component is delegated to an external SAT solver.\nFrom the results displayed in Section 5.3 we notice that the relative performances of the Km2SAT +DPLL approach wrt. other state-of-the-art tools range from cases where Km2SAT +Rsat is much less efficient than other state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., the k d4 and k t4p formulas) up to formulas where it is much more efficient (e.g., the k ph p or the 2m-CNF formulas with d = 1). In the middle stands a large majority of formulas in which the approach competes well against the other state-of-the art tools; in particular, Km2SAT +Rsat competes very well or even outperforms the other approaches based on translations into different formalisms (the translational approach, the automata-theoretic approach and the QBF-encoding approach).\nA simple explanation of the former fact could be that the Km2SAT +DPLL approach loses on problems with high modal depth, or where the modal component of reasoning dominates (like, e.g., the k d4 and k t4p formulas), and wins on problems where the Boolean component of reasoning dominates (like, e.g., the k ph n or the 2m-CNF formulas with d = 1), and it is competitive for formulas in which both components are relevant.\nWe notice, however, that Km2SAT +Rsat wins in the hard category of TANCS 2000 benchmarks, with modal depths greater than 50, and on k branch n, where the search is dominated by the modal component. 32 In fact, we recall that reducing the Boolean component of reasoning may produce a reduction also of the modal reasoning effort, because it may reduce the number of successor states to analyze (e.g. Sebastiani, 2007, 2007). Thus, e.g., techniques like on-the-fly BCP, although exploiting only purely-Boolean properties, may produce not only a drastic pruning of the Boolean search, but also a drastic reduction in the size of the model investigated, because they cut a priori the amount of successor states to expand."

      "text" : "In the last fifteen years one main research line in description logic has focused on investigating increasingly expressive logics, with the goal of establishing the theoretical boundaries of decidability and of allowing for more expressive power in the languages defined (Baader, Calvanese, McGuinness, Nardi, & Patel-Schneider, 2003). Consequently, very expressive — though very hard— description logics have today notable application in the field of Semantic Web. For example, the SHOIN (D) logic (which has NExpTime complexity) captures the sub-language OWL DL of the full OWL (Web Ontology Language) language (Bechhofer, van Harmelen, Hendler, Horrocks, McGuinness, Patel-Schneider, & Stein, 2004), that is the recommended standard language for the semantic web proposed by the W3C consortium.\nIn contrast, the recent quest for tractable description logic-based languages arising from the field of bio-medical ontologies (e.g., Spackman, Campbell, & Cote, 1997; Sioutos, de Coronado, Haber, Hartel, Shaiu, & Wright, 2007; The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000;\n32. The k branch n formulas are very hard from the perspective of modal reasoning, because they require finding one modelM with 2d+1−1 states (Halpern & Moses, 1992), but no Boolean reasoning within each state is really required (Giunchiglia et al., 2000; Horrocks et al., 2000): e.g., *SAT solves k branch n(d) with 2d+1−1 calls to its embedded DPLL engine, one for each state of M, each call solved by BCP only.\nRector & Horrocks, 1997) has stimulated the opening of another research line on tractable description logics (also called lightweight description logics), which are suitable for reasoning on these very big bio-medical ontologies. In particular, Baader et al. (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008) have spent a considerable effort in the attempt of defining a small but maximal subset of logical constructors, expressive enough to cover the needs of these practical applications, but whose inference problems must remain tractable. For example, simple and tractable description logics like EL, EL+ and EL++ (Baader et al., 2005) are expressive enough to describe several important bio-medical ontologies such as SNoMed (Spackman et al., 1997), NCI (Sioutos et al., 2007), the Gene Ontology (The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2000) and the majority of Galen (Rector & Horrocks, 1997).\nReasoning on these ontologies represents not only an important application of lightweight description logics, but also a challenge due to the required efficiency and the huge dimensions of the ontologies. In this perspective, it is important to face efficiently not only the basic reasoning services (e.g., satisfiability, subsumption, queries) on logics like EL, EL+ and EL++, but also more sophisticated reasoning problems like e.g., axiom pinpointing (Baader et al., 2007; Baader & Peñaloza, 2008) and logical difference between terminologies (Konev, Walther, & Wolter, 2008)."

We have showed that, despite the intrinsic risk of blowup in the size of the encoded formulas, the performances of this approach are comparable with those of current state-of-the-art tools on a rather extensive variety of empirical tests. Furthermore, we remark that our approach allows for directly benefitting “for free” from current and future enhancements in SAT solver technology.\nWe see many possible directions to explore in order to enhance and extend our approach. An important open research line is to explore the feasibility of SAT encodings for other and more expressive modal and description logics (e.g., whilst for logics like Tm the extension should be straightforward, logics like S4m, or more elaborated description logics than ALC, should be challenging) and for more complex form of reasoning (e.g., including TBoxes and ABoxes).\nOur current investigation, however, focuses on the lightweight logics of Baader et al. (2005). We have investigated (and we are currently enhancing) an encoding of the main reasoning services in EL and EL+ into Horn-SAT, which allows for reasoning efficiently on the (often huge) bio-medical ontologies mentioned in Section 6, and for handling the more sophisticated inference problems mentioned there (e.g., we currently handle axiom pinpointing), by exploiting some of the advanced functionalities which can be implemented on top of a modern SAT solver (Sebastiani & Vescovi, 2009)."

We prove the following theorem, which states the soundness and completeness of Km2SAT .\nTheorem 1. A Km-formula ϕ is Km-satisfiable if and only if the corresponding Km2SAT (ϕ) is satisfiable.\nProof. It is a direct consequence of the following Lemmas 2 and 3.\nLemma 2. Given a Km-formula ϕ, if Km2SAT (ϕ) is satisfiable, then there exists a Kripke model M s.t. M, 1 |= ϕ. Proof. Let µ be a total truth assignment satisfying Km2SAT (ϕ). We build from µ a Kripke model M = 〈U ,L,R1, . . . ,Rm〉 as follows:\nU def= {σ : A〈σ, ψ〉 occurs in Km2SAT (ϕ) for some ψ} (22)\nL(σ,Ai) def= {\nTrue if L〈σ, Ai〉 ∈ µ False if ¬L〈σ, Ai〉 ∈ µ\n(23)\nRr def= {〈σ, σ.i〉 : L〈σ, πr,i〉 ∈ µ}. (24)\nWe show by induction on the structure of ϕ that, for every 〈σ, ψ〉 s.t. L〈σ, ψ〉 occurs on Km2SAT (ϕ), 〈σ : ψ〉 ∈ M if L〈σ, ψ〉 ∈ µ. (25) Base\nψ = Ai or ψ = ¬Ai. Then (25) follows trivially from (23). Step\nψ = α. Let L〈σ, α〉 ∈ µ. As µ satisfies (6), L〈σ, αi〉 ∈ µ for every i ∈ {1, 2}. By inductive hypothesis, 〈σ : αi〉 ∈ M for every i ∈ {1, 2}. Then, by definition, 〈σ : α〉 ∈ M. Thus, 〈σ : α〉 ∈ M if L〈σ, α〉 ∈ µ.\nψ = β. Let L〈σ, β〉 ∈ µ. As µ satisfies (7), L〈σ, βi〉 ∈ µ for some i ∈ {1, 2}. By inductive hypothesis, 〈σ : βi〉 ∈ M for some i ∈ {1, 2}. Then, by definition, 〈σ : β〉 ∈ M. Thus, 〈σ : β〉 ∈ M if L〈σ, β〉 ∈ µ.\nψ = πr,j . Let L〈σ, πr,j〉 ∈ µ. As µ satisfies (8), L〈σ.j, πr,j0 〉 ∈ µ. By inductive hypothesis, 〈σ.j : πr,j0 〉 ∈ M. Then, by definition and by (24), 〈σ : πr,j〉 ∈ M. Thus, 〈σ : πr,j〉 ∈ M if L〈σ, πr,j〉 ∈ µ.\nψ = νr. Let L〈σ, νr〉 ∈ µ. As µ satisfies (9), for every 〈σ, πr,i〉 s.t. L〈σ, πr,i〉 ∈ µ, we have that L〈σ.i, νr0 〉 ∈ µ. By inductive hypothesis, we have that 〈σ : πr,i〉 ∈ M and 〈σ.i : νr0〉 ∈ M. Then, by definition and by (24), 〈σ : νr〉 ∈ M. Thus, 〈σ : νr〉 ∈ M if L〈σ, νr〉 ∈ µ.\nIf µ |= Km2SAT (ϕ), then A〈1, ϕ〉 ∈ µ. Thus, by (25), 〈1 : ϕ〉 ∈ M, i.e., M, 1 |= ϕ.\nLemma 3. Given a Km-formula ϕ, if there exists a Kripke model M s.t. M, 1 |= ϕ, then Km2SAT (ϕ) is satisfiable.\nProof. Let M be a Kripke model s.t. M, 1 |= ϕ. We build from M a truth assignment µ for Km2SAT (ϕ) recursively as follows: 33\nµ def= µM ∪ µM (26) µM def= {L〈σ, ψ〉 ∈ Km2SAT (ϕ) : 〈σ, ψ〉 ∈ M} (27) ∪ {¬L〈σ, ψ〉 ∈ Km2SAT (ϕ) : 〈σ, ψ〉 ∈ M}\nµM def= µπν ∪ µαβ ∪ µA (28) µπν def= {¬L〈σ, πr,i〉 ∈ Km2SAT (ϕ) : σ 6∈ M} (29) ∪ {L〈σ, νr〉 ∈ Km2SAT (ϕ) : σ 6∈ M}\nµαβ def= {¬L〈σ, α〉∈Km2SAT (ϕ) : σ 6∈M and ¬L〈σ, αi〉∈µM for some i∈{1, 2}} (30) ∪ {¬L〈σ, β〉∈Km2SAT (ϕ) : σ 6∈M and ¬L〈σ, βi〉∈µM for every i∈{1, 2}}.\nwhere µA is a consistent truth assignment for the literals L〈σ, Ai〉 s.t. Ai ∈ A and σ 6∈ M.\nBy construction, for every L〈σ, ψ〉 in Km2SAT (ϕ), µ assigns L〈σ, ψ〉 to true iff it assigns L〈σ, ψ〉 to false and vice versa, so that µ is a consistent truth assignment.\nFirst, we show that µM satisfies the definition implications of all Def(σ, ψ)’s and Def(σ, ψ)’ s.t. σ ∈M. Let σ ∈M. We distinguish four cases.\nψ = α. Thus ψ = β s.t. β1 = α1 and β2 = α2.\n– If 〈σ : α〉 ∈ M (and hence 〈σ : β〉 6∈ M), then for both i’s 〈σ : αi〉 ∈ M and 〈σ : βi〉 6∈ M. Thus, by (27), {L〈σ, α1〉, L〈σ, α2〉,¬L〈σ, β〉} ⊆ µM, so that µM satisfies the definition implications of both Def(σ, α) and Def(σ, β).\n– If 〈σ : α〉 6∈ M (and hence 〈σ, β〉 ∈ M), then for some i 〈σ : αi〉 6∈ M and 〈σ : βi〉 ∈ M. Thus, by (27), {¬L〈σ, α〉, L〈σ, βi〉} ⊆ µM, so that µM satisfies the definition implications of both Def(σ, α) and Def(σ, β).\nψ = β. Like in the previous case, inverting ψ and ψ.\nψ = πr,j . Thus ψ = νr s.t. νr0 = π r,j 0 .\n– If 〈σ : πr,j〉 ∈ M (and hence 〈σ : νr〉 6∈ M), then 〈σ.j : πr,j0 〉 ∈ M. Thus, by (27), {L〈σ.j, πr,j0 〉,¬L〈σ, νr〉} ⊆ µM, so that µM satisfies the definition implications of both Def(σ, πr,j) and Def(σ, νr).\n33. We assume that µM, µπν and µαβ are generated in order, so that µαβ is generated recursively starting from µπν . Intuitively, µM assigns the literals L〈σ, ψ〉 s.t. σ ∈M in such a way to mimic M; µM assigns the other literals in such a way to mimic the fact that no state outside those in M is generated (i.e., all L〈σ, π〉’s are assigned false and the L〈σ, ν〉’s, L〈σ, α〉’s, L〈σ, β〉’s are assigned consequently).\n– If 〈σ : πr,j〉 6∈ M (and hence 〈σ : νr〉 ∈ M), then by (27) ¬L〈σ, πr,j〉 ∈ µM, so that µM satisfies the definition implications of Def(σ, πr,j). As far as Def(σ, νr) is concerned, we partition the clauses in (9):\n((L〈σ, νr〉 ∧ L〈σ, πr,i〉) → L〈σ.i, νr0 〉) (31)\ninto two subsets. The first is the set of clauses (31) for which 〈σ : πr,i〉 ∈ M. As 〈σ : νr〉 ∈ M, we have that 〈σ.i : νr0〉 ∈ M. Thus, by (27), L〈σ.i, νr0 〉 ∈ µM, so that µM satisfies (31). The second is the set of clauses (31) for which 〈σ : πr,i〉 6∈ M. By (27) we have that ¬L〈σ, πr,i〉 ∈ µM, so that µM satisfies (31). Thus, µM satisfies the definition implications also of Def(σ, νr).\nψ = νr. Like in the previous case, inverting ψ and ψ.\nNotice that, if σ 6∈ M, then σ.i 6∈ M for every i. Thus, for every Def(σ, ψ) s.t. σ 6∈ M, all atoms in the implication definition of Def(σ, ψ) are not assigned by µM.\nSecond, we show by induction on the recursive structure of µM that µM satisfies the definition implications of all Def(σ, ψ)’s and Def(σ, ψ)’s s.t. σ 6∈ M. Let σ 6∈ M.\nAs a base step, by (29), µπν satisfies the definition implications of all Def(σ, πr,i)’s and Def(σ, νr)’s because it assigns false to all L〈σ, πr,i〉’s. Indeed, µA assigns every literal of the type L〈σ, Ai〉 s.t Ai ∈ A and σ 6∈ M (notice that all the Def(σ, Ai)’s definitions are trivially satisfied and don’t contain any definition implications).\nAs inductive step, we show on the inductive structure of µαβ that µαβ satisfies the definition implications of all Def(σ, α)’s and Def(σ, β)’s\nLet ψ def= α and ψ = β s.t. βi = αi (or vice versa). Then we have that:\n• if both L〈σ, αi〉’s (respectively at least one L〈σ, βi〉) are assigned true by µM, then the definition implications of Def(σ, α) (respectively Def(σ, β)) is already trivially satisfied;\n• if at least one L〈σ, αi〉 (respectively both L〈σ, βi〉’s) is assigned false by µM, then by (30) L〈σ, α〉 (respectively L〈σ, β〉) is assigned false by µαβ , which satisfies the definition implication of Def(σ, α) (respectively Def(σ, β)).\nThus µM satisfies the definition implications of all the Def(σ, ψ)’s and Def(σ, ψ)’s s.t. σ 6∈ M.\nOn the whole, µ |= Def(σ, ψ) for every Def(σ, ψ). By construction, µM |= A〈1, ϕ〉 since 〈1 : ϕ〉 ∈ M. Therefore µ |= Km2SAT (ϕ)."

    "abstractText" : "In the last two decades, modal and description logics have been applied to numerous areas of computer science, including knowledge representation, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies. For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated. In particular, many approaches have been proposed for efficiently handling the satisfiability of the core normal modal logic Km, and of its notational variant, the description logic ALC. Although simple in structure, Km/ALC is computationally very hard to reason on, its satisfiability being PSpace-complete. In this paper we start exploring the idea of performing automated reasoning tasks in modal and description logics by encoding them into SAT, so that to be handled by stateof-the-art SAT tools; as with most previous approaches, we begin our investigation from the satisfiability in Km. We propose an efficient encoding, and we test it on an extensive set of benchmarks, comparing the approach with the main state-of-the-art tools available. Although the encoding is necessarily worst-case exponential, from our experiments we notice that, in practice, this approach can handle most or all the problems which are at the reach of the other approaches, with performances which are comparable with, or even better than, those of the current state-of-the-art tools. 1. Motivations and Goals In the last two decades, modal and description logics have provided an essential framework for many applications in numerous areas of computer science, including artificial intelligence, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies. For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated (e.g., Fitting, 1983; Ladner, 1977; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Halpern & Moses, 1992; Baader, Franconi, Hollunder, Nebel, & Profitlich, 1994; Massacci, 2000). In particular, the research in modal and description logics has followed two parallel routes until the seminal work of Schild (1991), which proved that the core modal logic Km and the core description logic ALC are one a notational variant of the other. Since then, analogous results have been produced for a bunch of other logics, so that, nowadays the two research lines have mostly merged into one research flow. Many approaches have been proposed for efficiently reasoning in modal and description logics, starting from the problem of checking the satisfiability in the core normal modal logic Km and in its notational variant, the description logic ALC (hereafter simply “Km”). We classify them as follows. c ©2009 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved. Sebastiani & Vescovi • The “classic” tableau-based approach (Fitting, 1983; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Massacci, 2000) is based on the construction of propositional tableau branches, which are recursively expanded on demand by generating successor nodes in a candidate Kripke model. Kris (Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Baader et al., 1994), Crack (Franconi, 1998), LWB (Balsiger, Heuerding, & Schwendimann, 1998) were among the main representative tools of this approach. • The DPLL-based approach (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996, 2000) differs from the previous one mostly in the fact that a Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) procedure, which treats the modal subformulas as propositions, is used instead of the classic propositional tableaux procedure at each nesting level of the modal operators. KSAT (Giunchiglia & Sebastiani, 1996), ESAT (Giunchiglia, Giunchiglia, & Tacchella, 2002) and *SAT (Tacchella, 1999), are the representative tools of this approach. These two approaches merged into the “modern” tableaux-based approach, which has been extended to work with more expressive description logics and to provide more sophisticate reasoning functions. Among the tools employing this approach, we recall FaCT/FaCT++ and DLP (Horrocks & Patel-Schneider, 1999), and Racer (Haarslev & Moeller, 2001). 1 • In the translational approach (Hustadt & Schmidt, 1999; Areces, Gennari, Heguiabehere, & de Rijke, 2000) the modal formula is encoded into first-order logic (FOL), and the encoded formula can be decided efficiently by a FOL theorem prover (Areces et al., 2000). Mspass (Hustadt, Schmidt, & Weidenbach, 1999) is the most representative tool of this approach. • The CSP-based approach (Brand, Gennari, & de Rijke, 2003) differs from the tableauxbased and DPLL-based ones mostly in the fact that a CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) engine is used instead of tableaux/DPLL. KCSP is the only representative tool of this approach. • In the Inverse-method approach (Voronkov, 1999, 2001), a search procedure is based on the “inverted” version of a sequent calculus (which can be seen as a modalized version of propositional resolution). K K(Voronkov, 1999) is the only representative tool of this approach. • In the Automata-theoretic approach, (a symbolic representation based on BDDs – Binary Decision Diagrams – of) a tree automaton accepting all the tree models of the input formula is implicitly built and checked for emptiness (Pan, Sattler, & Vardi, 2002; Pan & Vardi, 2003). KBDD (Pan & Vardi, 2003) is the only representative tool of this approach. 1. Notice that there is not an universal agreement on the terminology “tableaux-based” and “DPLL-based”. E.g., tools like FaCT, DLP, and Racer are most often called “tableau-based”, although they use a DPLL-like algorithm instead of propositional tableaux for handling the propositional component of reasoning (Horrocks, 1998; Patel-Schneider, 1998; Horrocks & Patel-Schneider, 1999; Haarslev & Moeller, 2001).",
