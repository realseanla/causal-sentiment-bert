Students are expected to be academically excellent, physically fit and socially active along with managing their daily chores and pursuing their fields of interest. This structure would not only help students to engage all activities but also help them live a balanced life. This practice would eventually help them make better career choices on the basis of their interests. For such a practice one needs to invest a threshold amount of time and effort in all the activities. However only a certain amount of students are involved and excel in such a practice. In recent times various student related issues have been addressed by researchers using fuzzy logic. Patel et al. [1] have evaluated student’s academic performance considering various factors such as attendance, internal exam, lab assignments, and teamwork evaluation. Chrysafiadi and Virvou [2] have developed a fuzzy logic system which understands the forgetting process of a student. Ingoley and Bakal [3] have discarded the traditional methodology of assessment of student performance by also considering personal factors such as stress and accepting the fact that the evaluating system can be non-transparent. Gokmen et al. [4] have made a fuzzy evaluation system which helps to evaluate students on the basis of their performance and the type of examinations by setting up an assessment criteria before an examination. Hameed and Sorensen [5] have developed a reliable and robust system using Gaussian membership functions for student evaluation. Xu et al. [6] have personalized the web-based educational system with respect to learning materials, quiz and advices achieving effectiveness in learning. Huapaya [7] has developed fuzzy student diagnosis model to help teachers evaluate students by providing a high degree of flexibility.\nFrom the review it has been seen that not many references address the student lifestyle issues using fuzzy logic. This paper discusses a novel approach using fuzzy logic to generate an analysis of a student’s daily time expenditure in various categories. Based upon the analysis of the results obtained from the data appropriate recommendations and suggestions must be provided on regular basis. This would help the students work in their non-performing fields and maintain a balanced lifestyle."

      "heading" : "A. About Fuzzy Logic",
      "text" : "Over the past three decades, fuzzy logic is widely used in all problem-solving domains. One of the reasons for such instantaneous growth since its inception is its usability across all sectors be it Dynamic Programming, Process Control or Optimization. Fuzzy logic discards the theory of ‘Absolute Truth’and instead proposes a new theory of ‘Partial Truth’, also referred as degree of membership (suggested by Zadeh in 1965) [8].\nLet S be a non empty set, called the universe set. Now, consider any crisp set A ⊂ S. A characteristic function χA is defined as\nχA(x) = { 1, if x ∈ A 0, otherwise\nA characteristic function assigns value of either 0 or 1 to each element of S. Now consider a fuzzy set B ⊂ S. A membership function µB(x) is defined as µB : S → [0, 1]. Unlike the notion of a set in classical set theory where an element either belongs or does not belong to a particular set based on a bivalent condition, in fuzzy set [9] theory an element’s belongingness to a particular set is decided using membership function which gives a membership value between 0 and 1."

      "heading" : "A. Data Collection",
      "text" : "A college student is carrying his/her smart phone almost everywhere. Hence using the GPS extraction of his/her position throughout the day is possible. In the application and testing of this paper, the mobile application was developed on Android while the point of interest was extracted using Google Maps API by querying the user’s location extracted from\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n03 95\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C Y\n] 1\n3 O\nct 2\n01 6\nGPS. Google Maps API classifies most of the locations into various categories namely restaurant, shopping_mall, city_hall etc. Let us refer to all these categories hence forward as tags. Apart from these existing tags, two additional tags namely home and work are generated. The GPS data for these two additional tags would be user specific. Hence initially every user needs to update their location for these two tags specifically. This step is conducted so as to recognize distinctly one’s home and workplace which in further course would generate accurate results. Consider this example where one might go to a pizza shop to hang out with friends and family. However if someone is working in a pizza shop and the GPS details of the specific pizza shop is not known beforehand, it is very likely that one might consider this entire working time as time utilized for hanging out with friends. However if the person goes to some other pizza shop it is very likely he is going out with friends. To avoid this confusion this initial step has to be carried out.\nLet X be the set of all tags defined as X = {x | x is a tag}. Analysing the way a person lives is governed by many parameters, but in a typical student’s life we are mainly concerned about one’s health, education, leisure and social life. However a person also invests certain amount of time which fails to fall under these categories. A example of this would be travelling time. Activities like these fall under the other category. Now let S, L, H , W , O be subsets of X defined as\nS = {x | x ∈ X, x = social and x 6= home, work} L = {x | x ∈ X, x = leisure and x 6= home, work} H = {x | x ∈ X, x = health and x 6= home, work} W = {x | x ∈ X, x = work and x 6= home} O = {x | x ∈ X and x /∈ S ∪ L ∪H ∪W}\nA tag x might belong to one or more of the sets S, L, H, W . For example, a person might visit an Amusement Park. In this case the person’s social and leisure purposes are fulfilled. Using this categorization technique we can extract one’s location and time spent at each tag for the entire day. TABLE I lists down some locations and their possible purpose of visits. The locations mentioned are basically tags other than home and work.\nWeighing criteria: For a given purpose, different locations would have different amount of productivity and impact. For\nexample, hospital and gym both fall under the health category. However one visits a gym to increase his physical activity and hence visiting a gym has a positive impact on one’s health. However one visits a hospital if he/she has fallen sick. Hence, visiting a hospital has a negative impact on one’s health. So we have to handle these two situations differently.\nA function Y is defined as Y : X→ R such that Y (x) for every x ∈ X denotes the time spent at the location tag x. For example, let x = gym. Say Y (x) = 0.5. This implies a person has spent 30 minutes at a gym in the entire day. The unit of time is set in hours throughout this paper.\nA function ZS is defined as ZS : S → [−100, 100] such that ZS(x) for every x ∈ S denotes the intensity of the tag x with respect to the social category. Similarly one can define ZH , ZL, ZW , and ZO for the health, leisure, work, and other categories respectively. The range [−100, 100] is chosen for normalization purposes. For example, let x = gym. Say ZH(x) = 50 > 0 as gym has a positive health impact. Let y = hospital, then ZH(y) = −20 < 0 as hospital has a negative health impact. However, ZL(x) = ZL(y) = 0 as both x and y don’t contribute to the leisure category. Also note that if a tag t belongs to two different categories, then its weightage in both the categories cannot be 0.\nFor both Y and Z don’t include the home tag as it is a special case. This is explained later.\nAssigning weights: One is free to assign the weights independently. However for better results, one can assign weights by conducting a survey to understand how appropriately a location tag fulfils the purpose of a category. For instance consider the health category. In the survey a sample population\nwas asked to rank every x ∈ H in an order of fulfilment of their positive health benefits. Consider the following survey with\nH = {gym, playground, swimming pool, health club, hospital, pharmacy, physiotherapist, dentist, doctor}\nFig. 2 shows a survey for determining positive weights in the health category. As 54.1% people taking the survey voted playground as their maximum positive benefit from the health category, the corresponding weight for x = playground is computed as ZH(x) = 54.1100 × 100 = 54.1.\nFig. 3 shows a survey for determining negative weights in the health category. As 41% people taking the survey voted doctor as their maximum non fulfilment from the health category, the corresponding weight for x = doctor is computed as ZH(x) = − 41100 × 100 = −41.\nHome tag: The time spent at the home location might not be entirely used for rest and leisure purpose only. One might practice yoga at one’s home and the equivalent time should be added to the health category. Let τ denote the total time spent at home. And τH , τW , τL, τO, τS denote the equivalent time in respective categories. This time is taken as user input through the mobile application. For better results a random push notification system is used to learn the characteristics of the user. The home tag will be associated with weights ξH , ξS , ξL, ξW , ξO which denote the intensity of the tags at home. For instance, ξW = 30 and ZW (office) = 50 > 30 as working at home might not be as productive as working at office."

      "heading" : "B. Fuzzification",
      "text" : "Fuzzification of time: Consider a person p. Suppose p visits tags {x1, x2, . . . , xn}, with the time spent at these locations denoted by {Y (x1), Y (x2), . . . , Y (xn)}. Let KH , KL, KS , KW , KO denote the overall time spent in health, leisure, social, work, and other categories respectively. Then\nKH = ∑ xi∈H Y (xi) + τH\nSimilarly, KW , KS , KL, KO are defined.\nWe define the following fuzzy sets for all the categories. These sets define the type of lifestyle a person is living in each\ncategory. Here leisure also includes rest.\nhealth = {unfit, fit, proactive} leisure = {hectic, ideal, lazy} social = {reserved, sociable, over social} work = {lethargic, hard working, industrious}\nothers = {non productive, productive}\nThe membership functions for these fuzzy sets are constructed by conducting a survey on a sample population. The data from the survey can be approximated by using quantile range and trapezoidal membership functions. However, one can use various other techniques to plot membership functions. For instance, in a sample survey the hours spent by fit students in the health category were: 0.45, 1.25, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.5, 2.75, 2.75, 3, 4, 4.25. So with respect to the inter quantile range Q1 = 2, Q2 = 2.5, Q3 = 3, inf = 0.45, and sup = 4.25. The trapezoidal membership function for the linguistic term “fit” under the health category using these values is shown in Fig. 4.\nFig. 4 shows the membership functions for each linguistic of all categories.\nFuzzification of score: Not only the time spent at a location is important but also how the time is spent is important too. This effective utilisation of time is denoted by a score MS , ML, MO, MW , and MH for the respective categories. The score for the social category is calculated as follows\nMS = ∑ x∈S Y (x)ZS(x) + τSξS\nSimilarly other scores can be defined. The fuzzy set of linguistic terms “low score”, “ideal score” and “high score” define the fuzzy scores in each category. The membership function of these sets in all categories is calculated similar to the fuzzy time membership functions by conducting a survey. For instance, a survey conducted on a sample of fit students is shown in TABLE II. Hence inf = 11.25, Q1 = 29.75, Q3 = 42, sup = 50. Accordingly the membership function for the linguistic term “ideal score” under the health category is shown in Fig. 5. Similarly one can plot plot the membership functions for the entire fuzzy set across all categories."

      "text" : "Given the input data, Y (x), Zi(x), τi, and ξi where x ∈ X and i = S, L, O, W, H , one calculate corresponding Ki and Mi. Using surveys the membership functions for all linguistic terms in all categories for both fuzzification of time and score can be determined. Hence the membership value of Ki and Mi in the respective categories for all the linguistic terms can be determined. Let {R1, R2, . . . , RN} be a set of recommendations. Now every Rk (1 ≤ k ≤ N) will be dependent on a set of linguistic terms. For example, a recommendation R = “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” will be outputted if a person is spending too much time and effort in work and less in his leisure and social life. That is he/she has a “industrious” work life with a high work score and has a “reserved” social life with a low social score and a “hectic” life with respect to leisure with a low score. So attributes of R can be represented as {KW = “industrous”, MW =\n“high score”, KS = “reserved”, MS = “low score”, KL = “hectic”, ML = “low score”}.\nLet Rk be a recommendation with attributes {a1, a2, a3, . . . , an}. Here each aj (1 ≤ j ≤ n) is a combination of score/time with respect to a linguistic term of a category. Hence as shown previously one can calculate its membership value. Let µ1, µ2, µ3, . . . , µn denote the respective membership values for each attribute. Here n can vary for each Rk. For instance, Fig. 6 shows the membership\nfunctions of MH . Let a1, a2, a3 be the following attributes\na1 = MH : low score\na2 = MH : ideal score\na3 = MH : high score\nHence µ1, µ2, µ3 for MH = 17 as seen from Fig. 6 will be 0.6, 0.310, 0.0 respectively. Using equal weighing criteria for each aj , we can calculate a score of each recommendation\nρ(Rk) defined as\nρ(Rk) = 1\nn n∑ j=1 µj\nNow, using the most probable criterion the recommendation with the maximum score value ρ(Rk) will be displayed as output."

      "text" : "Time management has always been a difficult art to master. This paper helps one master it by using fuzzy logic to understand the science behind this art. The use of this technology in the long run would lead to more accurate results. The main highlights of this method is that most of the segments are self configurable. The dynamics of a student studying in university A and that of a student in university B can be very different due to a lot of factors such as geographic location, nature of university and infrastructure. Hence the parameters for analysis of these two students should be significantly different. This paper gives the user this flexibility to configure various attributes such as weight of tags, type of membership functions and the set of recommendations. This practice would yield better results. The long term applications are vast. This method can be used to access the performance of all students in an university. The results can be shared with the university so that the university can take appropriate actions for the welfare of the students in general."
