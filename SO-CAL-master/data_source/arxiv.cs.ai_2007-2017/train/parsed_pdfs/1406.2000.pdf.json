A similar fate had the neutrosophic probability that, except a few sporadic articles published in the meantime, it was barely developed in the 2013 book “Introduction to Neutrosophic Measure, Neutrosophic Integral, and Neutrosophic Probability”.\nNeutrosophic Statistics is an extension of the classical statistics,and one deals with set values instead of crisp values.\nIn most of the classical statistics equations and formulas, one simply replaces several numbers by sets. And consequently, instead of operations with numbers, one uses operations with sets. One normally replaces the parameters that are indeterminate (imprecise, unsure, and even completely unknown). That’s why we made the convention that any number a that is replaced by a set be noted aN, meaning neutrosophic a, or imprecise, indeterminate a. aN can be a neighbour of a, can be an interval that includes a, and in general it can be any set that approximates a. In the worst scenario, aN can be unknown. In the best scenario\n(when there is not indeterminacy related to a), aN = a.\nWhy this passage from crisp numbers to sets? Because in our real life we cannot always compute or provide exact values to the statistics characteristics, but we need to approximate them. This is one way to passing from classical to neutrosophic statistics, but other ways could be possible, depending on the types of indeterminacies, and the reader is kindly invited to do such research to be published in the next issues of the international journal of “Neutrosophic Sets and Systems”, http://fs.gallup.unm.edu/NSS/.\nThe author would like to thank Prof. Yoshio Hada, the President of Okayama University of Science, Prof. Valery Kroumov from Okayama University of Science, Prof. Akira Inoue from the State University of Okayama, also Prof. Masahiro Inuiguchi, Dr.Masayo Tsurumi, and Dr. Yoshifumi Kusuroku from the University of Osaka, and Dr. Tomoe Entani from the Hyogo University for their valuable considerations and opinion during my postdoctoral research in Japan in December 2013 and January 2014 about applications of the neutrosophic science in robotics and other fields.\nAny quantity computed with some indeterminacy from values in a sample (i.e. not exactly) is a neutrosophic statistics.\nA neutrosophic statistic is a random variable and as such has a neutrosophic probability distribution.\nThe long-run behaviour of a neutrosophic statistic’s values is described when one computes this statistic for many different samples, each of the same size.\nNeutrosophic Statistics is an extension of the classical statistics. While in classical statistics the data is known, formed by crisp numbers, in neutrosophic statistics the data has some indeterminacy.\nIn the neutrosophic statistics, the data may be ambiguous, vague, imprecise, incomplete, even unknown. Instead of crisp numbers used in classical statistics, one uses sets (that respectively approximate these crisp numbers) in neutrosophic statistics.\nAlso, in neutrosophic statistics the sample size may not be exactly known (for example the sample size could be between 90 and 100; this may happen because, for example, the statistician is not sure about 10 sample individuals if they belong or not to the population of interest; or because the 10 sample individuals only partially belong to the population of interest, while partially they don’t belong).\nIn this example, the neutrosophic sample size is taken as an interval n = [90, 100], instead of a crisp number n = 90 (or n = 100) as in classical statistics.\nAnother approach would be to only partially consider the data provided by the 10 sample individuals whose membership to the population of interest is only partial.\nNeutrosophic Statistics\nNeutrosophic Statistics refers to a set of data, such that the data or a part of it are indeterminate in some degree, and to methods used to analyze the data.\nIn Classical Statistics all data are determined; this is the distinction between neutrosophic statistics and classical statistics.\nIn many cases, when indeterminacy is zero, neutrosophic statistics coincides with classical statistics.\nWe can use the neutrosophic measure for\nmeasuring the indeterminate data.\nThe neutrosophic statistical methods will enable us to interpret and organize the neutrosophic data (data that may have some indeterminacies) in order to reveal underlying patterns.\nThere are many approaches that can be used in neutrosophic statistics. We present several of them through examples, and afterwards generalizations for classes of examples. Yet, the reader can invent new approaches as well in studying the neutrosophic statistics.\nWe emphasize, as in neutrosophic probability, that indeterminacy is different from randomness. While classical statistics is referring to randomness only, neutrosophic statistics is referring to both randomness and especially indeterminacy."

      "text" : "comprised of all techniques to summarize and describe the neutrosophic numerical data’s characteristics.\nSince neutrosophic numerical data contain indeterminacies, the neutrosofic line graphs, and neutrosophic histograms are represented in 3D-\nspaces, instead of 2D-spaces as in classical statistics. The third dimension, in addition of the XOY Cartesian System, is that of indeterminacy (I). From unclear graphical data displays we can extract neutrosophic (unclear) information.\nNeustrosophic Inferential Statistics consists of methods that permit the generalization from a neutrosophic sampling to a population from which it was selected the sample.\nNeutrosophic Data is the data that contains\nsome indeterminacy.\nSimilarly to the classical statistics it can be\nclassified as:\n- discrete neutrosophic data, if the values are isolated points;for example: 6 + \uD835\uDC561 , where \uD835\uDC561 ∈ [0, 1], 7, 26 + \uD835\uDC562, where \uD835\uDC562 ∈ [3, 5];\n- and continuous neutrosophic data, if the values form one or more intervals, for example: [0, 0.8] or [0.1, 1.0] (i.e. not sure which one).\nAnother classification: - quantitative (numerical) neutrosophic data; for example: a number in the interval [2, 5] (we do not know exactly), 47, 52, 67 or 69 (we do not know exactly);\n- and qualitative (categorical) neutrosophic data; for example: blue or red (we don’t know exactly), white, black or green or yellow (not knowing exactly).\nAlso, we may have:\n- univariate neutrosophic data, i.e. neutrosophic data that consists of observations on a neutrosophic single attribute;\n- and multivariable neutrosophic data, i.e. neutrosophic data that consists of observations on two or more attributes.\nAs a particular cases we mention the bivariate neutrosophic data, and trivariate neutrosophic data.\nA Neutrosopical Statistical Number N has the\nform:\n\uD835\uDC41 = \uD835\uDC51 + \uD835\uDC56,\nwhere d is the determinate (sure) part of N, and i is the indeterminate (unsure) part of N.\nFor example, \uD835\uDC4E = 5 + \uD835\uDC56, where\n\uD835\uDC56 ∈ [0, 0.4], is equivalent to\uD835\uDC4E ∈ [5, 5.4], so for sure \uD835\uDC4E ≥ 5 (meaning that the determinate part of a is 5), while the indeterminate part \uD835\uDC56 ∈ [0, 0.4] means the possibility for number „a” to be a little bigger than 5.\nWe may consider, similarly to the classical statistics, a neutrosophic stem-and-leaf display of data.\nFor example, let’s have the neutrosophic data\nthat follows:\n6 + \uD835\uDC561, with\uD835\uDC561 ∈ (0, 0.2);\n7 + \uD835\uDC562with\uD835\uDC562 ∈ [2, 3];\n6 + \uD835\uDC563, with\uD835\uDC563 ∈ [0, 1];\n9 + \uD835\uDC564, \uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC61ℎ\uD835\uDC564 ∈ [1.1, 1.5);\n9 + \uD835\uDC561.\nIts neutrosophic stem-and-leaf display is:\n6 7 9 ‖ \uD835\uDC561 \uD835\uDC563 \uD835\uDC562 \uD835\uDC561 \uD835\uDC564\nor under the form of interval:\n6 7 9 ‖ (0, 0.2) [0, 1] [2, 3] (0, 0.2) [1.1, 1.5]\nObviously a neutrosophic statistic number can\nbe written in many ways.\nIf you retake: \uD835\uDC4E = 5 + \uD835\uDC56,with\uD835\uDC56 ∈ [0, 0.4], then\n\uD835\uDC4E = 4 + \uD835\uDC561, with \uD835\uDC56 ∈ [1, 1.4], or\uD835\uDC4E = 3 + \uD835\uDC562, with \uD835\uDC562 ∈ [2, 2.4], and in general \uD835\uDC4E = ∝ + \uD835\uDC56∝, with \uD835\uDC56∝ ∈ [5−∝, 5.4−∝], and ∝ any real number.\nOr in opposite way:\n\uD835\uDC4E = 5.4 − \uD835\uDC563, with \uD835\uDC563 ∈ [0, 0.4],\nand in general\n\uD835\uDC4E = \uD835\uDEFD − \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDEFD , with \uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDEFD ∈ [\uD835\uDEFD − 5.4, \uD835\uDEFD − 5], and\uD835\uDEFD any real\nnumber."

For example, the number of families with income in between $10,000 – $29,000 is between 7 and 9 millions of families. Similarly for other classes of income, except for the last class of income in between $110,000 – $129,000 that corresponds to a crisp number: 1 million of families.\nWe represented all types of neutrosophic statistical graphs in a space of dimension two (2D) as in classical statistics, but it is also possible to make the graphs in a space o dimension three (3D), just adding to each of the previous 2D-graphs an indeterminate dimension, which measures the indeterminacy of the data.\n1.b.

      "text" : "observations of a variable listed in almost ascending order (since we deal with sets instead of crisp numbers we have a partial order).\nThe neutrosophic quartiles are similarly as in classical statistics defined: the first (lower quartile) is the 1\n4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1)\uD835\uDC61ℎ, the second is the\n2 4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1)\uD835\uDC61ℎ, and\nthe third the 3\n4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1)\uD835\uDC61ℎ.\nIf (\uD835\uDC5B + 1) is not divisible by 4, then one takes the average of the two neutrosophic observations whose ranks the quartile falls in between. Another procedure is to take the inferior integer part of \uD835\uDC56 4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1), for \uD835\uDC56 = 1, 2, 3.\nLet’s compute the midpoint of a set ⊔ in the\nfollowing way:\nmidpoint ⊔= inf⊔ +sup ⊔\n2 .\nWe can define a total order on the n neutrosophic observation sets in the following way:\nfor any sets ⊔ and ∨ we have ⊔<∨ if\n{ either midpoint (⊔) < midpoint(∨),\normidpoint (⊔) = midpoint(∨)andmin ⊔< min ∨ .\nIf it happens that\nmidpoint (⊔) = midpoint(∨)\nand min ⊔= min ∨, then automatically max ⊔ = max∨, therefore\n⊔≡∨.\nAn example with n = 12 ascending neutrosophic\nobservations:\n1, (2, 3), {4, 6}, 5 , [7, 10], [7, 11], 9 , 12, 14, [14, 15) , 20,\n{21} ∪ (22, 25].\nFirst quartile:\n1 4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1) = 1 4 (12 + 1) = 3.25,\nthen we average the 3rd and the 4th ranked\nobservations: {4, 6} + 5\n2 = {4 + 5, 6 + 5} 2 = {9, 11} 2 = { 9 2 , 11 2 } = {4.5, 5.5}.\nSecond quartile:\n2 4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1) = 2 4 (12 + 1) = 6.50,\nthen we average the 6th and 7th ranked\nobservations:\n[7, 11] + 9\n2 = [\n7 + 9 2 , 11 + 9 2 ] = [8, 10].\nThird quartile:\n3 4 (\uD835\uDC5B + 1) = 3 4 (12 + 1) = 9.75,\nthen we average the 9th and 10th ranked\nobservations:\n14 + [14, 15]\n2 = [\n14 + 14 2 , 14 + 15 2 ] = [14, 14.5).\nNeutrosophic Sample\nA Neutrosophic Sample is a chosen subset of a population, subset that contains some indeterminacy: either with respect to several of its individuals (that might not belong to the population we study, or they might only partially belong to it), or with respect to the subset as a whole. While the classical samples provide accurate information, the neutrosophic samples provide vague or incomplete information.\nBy language abuse one can say that any sample is a neutrosophic sample, since one may consider their determinacy equals to zero.\nNeutrosophic Survey Results are survey results\nthat contain some indeterminacy.\nA Neutrosophic Population is a population not well determined at the level of membership (i.e. not sure if some individuals belong or do not belong to the population).\nFor example, as in the neutrosophic set, a generic element x belongs to the neutrosophic population M in the following way, \uD835\uDC65(\uD835\uDC61, \uD835\uDC56, \uD835\uDC53) ∈ \uD835\uDC40 , which means: x is t % in the population M, f %x is not in the population M, while i % the appurtenance of x to M is indeterminate (unknown, unclear, neutral: neither in the population nor outside).\nExample. Let’s consider the population of a country C1. Most people in this country have only\nthe citizenship of the country, therefore they belong 100% to C1. But there are people that have double citizenships, of countries C1 and C2. Those people belong 50% to C1, and 50% to C2. While citizens with triple citizenships of countries C1, C2, and C3 belong only 33.33% to each country. Of course, considering various criteria these percentages may differ. Also, there are countries with autonomous zones, whose citizens in these zones may not entirely consider themselves as belonging to those countries.\nBut there is another category of people that have been stripped from their C1 citizenship for political reasons and they have other citizenship, while still living (temporarily) in C1.They are called paria, and they do not belong to C1 (not having citizenship), but still belong to C1 (because they still living in C1). They form the indeterminate part of neutrosophic population of country C1.\nA simple random neutrosophic sample of size n from a classical or neutrosophic population is a sample of n individuals such that at least one of them has some indeterminacy.\nExample. One considers a random sample of 1,000 homes, in a city of over one million inhabitants, in order to investigate how many houses have at least a laptop. One finds out that 600 houses have at least one laptop, 300 houses don’t have any laptop, while 100 houses have each of them a single laptop, but not working.\nSome of these 100 house owners tried to have their laptop fixed, others said their laptops’ hard drives have crashed and it is little chance to fix them. Therefore indeterminacy. We have a simple random neutrosophic sample of size 100.\nSimilarly as in classical statistics, in a stratified random neutrosophic sampling the pollster groups the (classical or neutrosophic) population by a strata according to a classification; afterwards the pollster takes a random sample (of appropriate size according to a criterion) from each group. If there is some indeterminacy, we deal with neutrosophic sampling.\nExample. One considers two strata: men and women in the city of Gallup, New Mexico. But, since women represent 51% of the population and men 49%, one takes a random sample of 51 women and a random sample of 49 men.\nBut later learn that „one” man and two “women” are actually transgender. Therefore 3 individuals are indeterminate. Whence one has stratified random neutrosophic sampling.\nIf the (classical or neutrosophic) population is divided into subgroups, such that each subgroup is representative of the population, and then one collects from these subgroups a random sample and there is some indeterminacy, then one has a neutrosophic cluster sampling.\nExample. Suppose 5 professors conduct PhD dissertations in neutrosophic statistics. Each\nprofessor has a number of graduate students, but some students are undecided whether to pursue their dissertations in classical or neutrosophic statistics. The professors represent the clusters. One randomly selects 2 professors to interview their students about research in neutrosophic statistics. But, because some students are undecided (indeterminate) with respect to their research topic, we have a neutrosophic cluster sampling.\nA convenience sample is likely to be inaccurate since the pollster selects a sample of individuals that are readily available, who might answer randomly to the questions in order to finish faster. The less the individuals are interested in the survey results, the more likely inaccurate are the survey results. While a voluntary-response sample is more likely to be biased, since the sample individuals may volunteer in purpose to influence the survey results.\nBesides these two categories of sample individuals there is another one of malicious people that might oppositely answer to the questions in order to produce false results.\nThat’s why data of some sample individuals has to be removed, but often we don’t know which ones. Therefore, we have indeterminacy related to the sample size: how many sample people were from the above three categories, and how to depict their data in order to remove them from the survey results? Again, neutrosophic statistics.\nNeutrosophic Numerical\nMeasures\nExample with Neutrosophic Numbers \uD835\uDC4E + \uD835\uDC4F\uD835\uDC3C , where a, b are real numbers, and I is indeterminacy, such that \uD835\uDC3C2 = \uD835\uDC3C and 0 ∙ \uD835\uDC3C = 0."

Weight Average Style:\nOne assigns a weight to each sample. The sample weight may represent the chance that the respective sample could be the right sample, after discarding the wrong observations.\nIn general, the weights \uD835\uDC641, \uD835\uDC642, … , \uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC5B ∈ [0, 1] such\nthat\n\uD835\uDC641 +\uD835\uDC642 +⋯+\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC5B = 1.\nIn the case when the sample weights are determined from criteria different from each other and therefore the sum of weights is not 1, and the observations are \uD835\uDC4E1 + \uD835\uDC4E2 +⋯+ \uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B , the weight average is: \uD835\uDC641\uD835\uDC4E1 +\uD835\uDC642\uD835\uDC4E2 +⋯+\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC5B\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B\n\uD835\uDC641 +\uD835\uDC642 +⋯+\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC5B .\nIn our example, if \uD835\uDC641 = 0.4,\uD835\uDC642 = 0.1,\uD835\uDC643 = 0.3,\uD835\uDC644 =\n0.2,\uD835\uDC645 = 0.7, then: \uD835\uDC61ℎ\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC54ℎ\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B = 0.4(10.5) + 0.1(10.5) + 0.3(10.0) + 0.2(8.5) + 0.7(8.5) 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.7 ≃ 9.35294; \uD835\uDC61ℎ\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC54ℎ\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC5B = 0.4(11.5) + 0.1(10.75) + 0.3(10.5) + 0.2(9.75) + 0.7(8.5) 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.7 ≃ 9.83824 and \uD835\uDC61ℎ\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC64\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC54ℎ\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC54\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC63\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC4E\uD835\uDC61\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC5B = 0.4(3.5) + 0.1(4.38035) + 0.3(4.5) + 0.2(4.43706) + 0.7(2.5) 0.4 + 0.1 + 0.3 + 0.2 + 0.7 ≃ 3.42673.\nAccording to the sample weights, it’s a larger chance that the right sample is the fifth one. Therefore, the combined statistical metrics of all samples would be inclined to approach the fifth sample’s statistical metrics.\nThis example can be generalized for n observations, such that k observations among them are wrong, where \uD835\uDC5B ≥ 2 and 1 ≤ \uD835\uDC58 ≤ \uD835\uDC5B − 1.\nWith a computer program, one studies each of the ∁\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC5B−\uD835\uDC58 samples resulted after discarding k wrong observations, where ∁\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC5B−\uD835\uDC58 means combinations of n elements taken in groups of n-k elements. Each sample has the size n-k. For each sample one calculates its median, mean, deviations, standard deviations, and of course other statistical metrics required by the neutrosophic problem to solve.\nThen we combine ∁\uD835\uDC5B \uD835\uDC5B−\uD835\uDC58 results using either interval style, the average style, the weighted average style, or other procedures that the reader may design depending on the problem.\nNeutrosophic Binomial\nDistribution\nThe classical Binomial Distribution is extended neutrosophically. That means that there is some indeterminacy related to the probabilistic experiment.\nSuppose each trial can result in an outcome labeled success (S), or its mutually exclusive outcome labeled failure (F), or some indeterminacy (I).\nFor example: tossing a coin on an irregular surface which has cracks, the coin can fall inside a crack on its edge, and thus one gets neither head, nor tale, but indeterminacy.\nWe conduct a fixed number of small experiments (that we call trials). The outcomes of the trials are independent. For each trial, the chance of getting S is the same; similarly for the chance of getting F, or of getting I.\nThe neutrosophic binomial random variable xis then defined as the number of successes when we perform the experiment \uD835\uDC5B ≥ 1 times.\nThe neutrosophic probability distribution of x is also called neutrosophic binomial probability distribution.\nFor n trials it is important the way one defines\nthe indeterminacy.\nFirst, it is clear that getting indeterminacy in each trial means indeterminacy for the whole set of n trials. Secondly, getting indeterminacy in no trial means no indeterminacy for the whole set of n trials.\nBut what about getting indeterminacy in some trials, and determinacy (i.e. success or failure) in other trials?\nThis partially indeterminate and partially determinate set of n trials depends on the problem one needs to solve and on the expert’s point of view.\nOne can define an indeterminacy threshold:\n\uD835\uDC61ℎ = number of trials whose outcome is indeterminate,\nwhere\uD835\uDC61ℎ ∈ {0, 1, 2, … , \uD835\uDC5B}.\nThe cases with a \uD835\uDC61ℎ\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC60ℎ\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC51 > \uD835\uDC61ℎ will belong to the indeterminate part, while for a \uD835\uDC61ℎ\uD835\uDC5F\uD835\uDC52\uD835\uDC60ℎ\uD835\uDC5C\uD835\uDC59\uD835\uDC51 ≤ \uD835\uDC61ℎ they will belong to the determinate part.\nLet P(S) = the chance a particular trial results in\na success,\nand P(F) = the chance a particular trial results in a failure, for both S and F different from indeterminacy.\nLet P(I) = the chance a particular trial results in\nan indeterminacy.\nFor \uD835\uDC65 ∈ {0, 1, 2, … , \uD835\uDC5B}, NP (exactly x successes\namong n trials) = (\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC65 , \uD835\uDC3C\uD835\uDC65 , \uD835\uDC39\uD835\uDC65), with\n\uD835\uDC47\uD835\uDC65 = \uD835\uDC5B!\n\uD835\uDC65!

This association is usually formulated as a neutrosophic equation or formula, which enables prediction of future values of the dependent variable.\nThe graph of this association is, instead of a\ncurve in classical statistics, for example:\na neutrosophic curve (we can call it a „thick curve”, or „strip curve”), like:\nsince in neutrosophic theory one deals with indeterminacy and approximations.\nAs in classical statistics, the neutrosophic regression may be linear (if the association between independent, and dependent variables is linear), or non-linear (if the association is non-linear).

One uses the circumflex accent ̂ above y in order\nto emphasize that \uD835̂\uDC66 is a prediction of y.\nThe only distinction from classical least-square line is that in neutrosophic theory we work with sets instead of numbers.\nTherefore, into the data, some x’s or y’s are imprecise, expressed by sets.

      "text" : "a. Another idea of solving this problem would be to transform the neutrosophic data in classical data, either taking the midpoint of each set, or the average of a discrete set of the form {… }. Or taking small neighborhoods centered in the midpoints of each set. Or taking the minimum values of the sets\nand thus constructing multiple classical data. Then one computes the least-squares line for each data. Afterwards one makes the average of the results, or one considers the min/max interval of the results.\nb. Or one transforms the neutrosophic leastsquares line into a classical least-square line by replacing the set representations of the coefficients «a» and «b» by their corresponding midpoint, or (depending on the application) by other interior points of the two sets.

While the Neutrosophic Alternative Hypothesis, denoted by NHa, is the other hypothesis.\nIn carrying out a test of NH0 versus NHa there are two possible conclusions: reject NH0 (if sample evidence suggest strongly that NH0 is false), or fail to reject NH0 (if the sample does not support string evidence against NH0).\nExamples:\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B0:μ ∈ [90, 100]\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E:μ < 90\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E:μ > 100\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E:μ ∉ [90, 100],\nwhere μ represents the classical average IQ of all children born since 1st January 2001.\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B0: \uD835\uDF0B = 0.2 or 0.3\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E:π < 0.2 \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E:π > 0.3\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E: \uD835\uDF0B ∈ (0.2, 0.3) \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E:μ ∉ {0.2, 0.3},\nwhere π represents the classical proportion of all Ford cars that need repair while under first year of warranty.\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B0: \uD835\uDC5D < 0.1 or\uD835\uDC5D > 0.9\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E: \uD835\uDC5D = 0.1 \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E: \uD835\uDC5D = 0.9\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B0: \uD835\uDC5D > 0.1 and \uD835\uDC5D < 0.9\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E: \uD835\uDC5D ∈ [0.1, 0.9],\nwhere p represents the classical proportion of outliers in a human population with respect to their height, i.e. percentage of people whose height is less than 150 cm, or percentage of people whose height is greater than 190 cm.

Their findings are close, yet different. The owner of the manufacturing plant decided to put both results together, taking for each period the [min, max] or [inf, sup] interval, in order to see the fluctuation of sales.

      "text" : "A census of a large population is hard or even impossible to due. That’s why we have to use samples. The inference we are making from a neutrosophic sample characteristic to a population characteristic is subject to error.\nSimilarly to classical statistics, there are two\ntypes of errors:\n1. Neutrosophic Type I Error, which is the error\nof rejecting NH0 when NH0 is true.\n2. Neutrosophic Type II Error, which is the opposite of the previous error, i.e. the error of not rejecting NH0 when NH0 is false.\nPeriod Sold Quantity (in thousands)\n2001\n[4, 6]\n2002 [7, 8]\n2003 5.5 or 6.0\n2004 (8.0, 8.8)\n2005 7.5\nNo matter what test we do, there is some chance that a neutrosophic type I error will be made, and there is some chance that a neutrosophic type II error will be made too.\nFor example, rejecting the hypothesis H0: μ = 7.0 when it is true in one of the previous examples, would determine the owner of the manufacturing plant to take additional adjustments and spending money when not really needed.\nWhile accepting H0: μ = 7.0 when it is false, will\ndamage the future selling.\nProbabilities of neutrosophic type I error and type II error are denoted by αN (level of significance) and respectively βN.\nDealing with neutrosophic probabilities, αN and βN can be subsets of the interval [0, 1]. The ideal test procedure would haveαN = βN≡ 0, or αN and βN as tiny intervals near zero.\nFor example, ifαN= [0.07, 0.10]in a test procedure, done with different samples, over and over, a true hypothesis H0 is rejected about 7, 8, 9, or 10 times in a hundred.\nIf \uD835\uDEFD\uD835\uDC41 = [0.07,0.10],then a false hypothesis H0 is\naccepted about 7-10 times in a hundred.\nExample.\nA car manufacturer pretends that between 80% and 90% of its car need no repair during the first 2 years of driving. In order to check the claim, a consumer agency obtains a random sample of 50\npurchasers and investigate them whether or not their cars needed repair during the first 2 years of driving. Let p denote the sample proportion of responses that indicate no repair, and let π denote the true proportion of no repairs (called successes). The appropriate neutrosophic hypotheses are:\n\uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B0: \uD835\uDF0B ∈ [0.8, 0.9] versus \uD835\uDC41\uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E: \uD835\uDF0B < 0.8\nin order to check if the sample evidence suggests that \uD835\uDF0B < 0.9.\nNeutrosophic Type I Error is to consider the car manufacturer’s claim fallacious (i.e. \uD835\uDF0B < 0.8) while in fact it is correct.\nAnd Neutrosophic Type II Error if the consumer agency fails to detect the manufacturer’s incorrect claim.\nFor avoiding serious consequences the consumer agency decides a type I error probability of [0.01, 0.05] but no larger can be tolerated. So\n\uD835\uDEFC = [0.01, 0.05] is used for developing a test\nprocedure.\nWe recall, from classical statistics, that a classical standard normal distribution of a random variable z, is a normal distribution with the mean value\n\uD835\uDF07 = 0\nand standard deviation\n\uD835\uDF0E = 1.\nIts corresponding curve is called standard\nnormal curve or z curve.\nA z critical value captures the lower-tail or upper-tail area, or the central area under the z curve.\nThe table of the most used z critical values in\nclassical statistics:\nCritical value, z\nArea to the\nright of z\nArea to the\nleft of –z\nArea\nbetween –z\nand z\n1.28 .10 .10 .80\n1.645 .05 .05 .90\n1.96 .025 .025 .95\n2.33 .01 .01 .98\n2.58 .005 .005 .99\n3.09 .001 .001 .998\n3.29 .0005 .0005 .999"

If the two sets, those of the neutrosophic Pvalue and of the neutrosophic level of significance \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC41 intersect, one has indeterminacy. And one can compute the chance of rejecting \uD835\uDC3B0 at level \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC41 , and the chance of not rejecting \uD835\uDC3B0 at level \uD835\uDEFC\uD835\uDC41 .\nIn classical statistics, the P-value is computed considering theTable of Standard Normal Probabilities.\na. P-value is the area under the z curve to the\nright of computed z, for Upper-tailed z test.\nb. P-value is the area under the z-curve to the\nleft of computed z, forLower-tailed z test.\nc. P-value is twice the area captured in the tail corresponding to the computed z, for Two-tailed z test.\nLet’s insert from the classical statistics the Standard Normal Cumulative Probability Table [for positive z-values only, since this is needed in our below example]:\nIn the previous example, \uD835\uDC3B0 ∙ \uD835\uDF07 \uD835\uDF16[40.0, 41.0] versus \uD835\uDC3B\uD835\uDC4E: \uD835\uDF07 > 41.0,\nwe found the neutrosophic \uD835\uDC67 = [2.24, 3.20]. We have an Upper-tailed z test.\nFrom the above Table of Standard Normal Probabilities, the area under the z curve to the right of\uD835\uDC671 = 2.24 is 1 − 0.9875 = 0.0125\nwhile for \uD835\uDC672 = 3.20 is 1 − 0.9993 = 0.0007.

It tells us how much confidence we have in procedure used in constructing the neutrosophic confidence interval.\nThe classical formulas for the confidence interval are extended from crisp variables to neutrosophic variables (i.e. variables whose values are sets):\n1.

Many individuals partially loose vision because\nof exposure to dust.\nOn a study involving 60 people (a sample), that were constantly exposed to dust to their construction work places, in average they lost 18%-20% of their vision accuracy, with a sample standard deviation of 4%-5%.\nThe study investigator wishes a 90% confidence\ninterval for μ.

If π cannot be estimated using prior neutrosophic information, one uses π = 0.5 which gives a conservatively large sample value (i.e. a larger n than any other value of π would do).\nThe Neutrosophic Central\nLimit Theorem\nThe Neutrosophic Central Limit Theorem, which is an extension of the classical Central Limit Theorem, can be safely applied if \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} exceeds 30, where \uD835\uDC5B is the neutrosophic sample size (i.e. \uD835\uDC5B may be a set).\nThe Neutrosophic Central Limit Theorem states that the neutrosophic sampling distribution of \uD835̅\uDC65 si approximated by a neutrosophic normal curve when \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} is sufficiently large, no matter how is the population distribution.\nOf course, if the population distribution is normal, then \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} may be smaller than 30, and the neutrosophic sampling distribution of \uD835̅\uDC65 is normal too for any neutrosophic sample size \uD835\uDC5B. But, if the population distribution is not normal, then \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} should be greater than 30, and the neutrosophic sampling distribution of \uD835̅\uDC65 is only an approximation to the normal curve: the larger is \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B}, the better approach.\nThe last result has enabled the neutrosophic statisticians in order to infer a population mean, to develop large sample neutrosophic procedures even when one deals with an unknown shape of the population distribution.\nUsing similar notations: \uD835\uDC5B = random neutrosophic sample size; \uD835̅\uDC65 = neutrosophic mean of the sample size; \uD835\uDF07 = population mean; \uD835\uDF0E = population standard deviation; \uD835\uDF07\uD835̅\uDC65 = neutrosophic mean of the \uD835̅\uDC65 distribution; and \uD835\uDF0E\uD835̅\uDC65 = neutrosophic standard deviation of the \uD835̅\uDC65\ndistribution;\none has, as in classical statistics:\n\uD835\uDF07\uD835̅\uDC65 = \uD835\uDF07,\nand \uD835\uDF0E\uD835̅\uDC65 = \uD835\uDF0E\n√\uD835\uDC5B ..\nThe neutrosophic central limit theorem does not apply, as in classical statistics, when \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} is small and the shape of the population distribution is unknown.\nLet’s introduce the Small-Sample Neutrosophic t Confidence Interval for the Mean of the Normal Population, which is just a neutrosophication of the classical one-sample t confidence interval for the population mean μ:\n\uD835̅\uDC65 ± (\uD835\uDC61critical values) ∙ \uD835\uDC60\n√\uD835\uDC5B\nwhere similarly: \uD835̅\uDC65 = neutrosophic sample mean; \uD835\uDC60 =neutrosophic sample standard deviation; \uD835\uDC5B = neutrosophic sample size;\nand\n\uD835\uDC61critical value is based on\n\uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} − 1 degrees of freedom (\uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC53).\n\uD835\uDC65,̅ \uD835\uDC60, and\uD835\uDC5B may be sets instead of crisp numbers. For small \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B}, the neutrosophic t confidence interval for the population mean μ is appropriate when the population distribution is normal or approximately normal. Otherwise, another method should be employed.\nThe neutrosophic t distribution is more spread out, of course, than the neutrosophic standard normal (\uD835\uDC67) curve, because the use of \uD835\uDC60, instead of population deviation σ, produces extra variability.\nThe neutrosophic \uD835\uDC61 distributions are distinguished from one another by the degree of freedom, which can be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, or a set of positive integers greater than or equal to 1, for example:\n{\uD835\uDC5B, \uD835\uDC5B + 1,… , \uD835\uDC5B + \uD835\uDC5A}.\nThe higher is \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B}, the closer the neutrosophic \uD835\uDC61 distribution is to the neutrosophic \uD835\uDC67 curve. For \uD835\uDC5A\uD835\uDC56\uD835\uDC5B{\uD835\uDC5B} > 120 one may use the \uD835\uDC67 critical values. The neutrosophic \uD835\uDC61curve, for a fixed number of degrees of freedom, is in general bell-shaped and centered at zero in neutrosophic style way.\nAn Example.\nA small random sample of 18 workers, at the Rail Road, was investigated regarding the weights these workers are able to lift in their work place. The neutrosophic sample average found was \uD835̅\uDC65 between 8 kg and 10 kg, with a standard deviation \uD835\uDC60 between 3-4 kg.\nLet’s say a confidence level of 95% is required for\ncapturing the population mean μ.Thus:\n\uD835̅\uDC65 = [8, 10](an interval)\n\uD835\uDC60 = [3,4](an interval)\n\uD835\uDC5B = 18,\nhence a small sample size, which requires a neutrosophic \uD835\uDC61 critical value based on 18 − 1 = 17 \uD835\uDC51\uD835\uDC53.\nFrom the below classical statisticsTable of t Critical Values,we find out that for 95% confidence level and 17 df, the corresponding\n\uD835\uDC61critical value = 2.11.\nApply the previous formula:\n\uD835̅\uDC65 ± (\uD835\uDC61critical value) ∙ \uD835\uDC60\n√\uD835\uDC5B = [8, 10] ± 2.11\n[3, 4]\n√18\n= [8, 10] ± [ 2.11(3) √18 , 2.11(4) √18 ] ⋍ [8, 10] ± [1.492, 1.989].\nSplit the calculation into two possibilities:\n[8, 10] + [1.492, 1.989] = [8 + 1.492, 10 + 1.989]\n= [9.492, 11.989],\nand\n[8, 10] − [1.492, 1.989] = [8 − 1.989, 10 − 1.492]\n= [6.011, 8.508].\nNow we combine both results in a conservative way, and we get the neutrosophic t confidence interval for the population average of weight lifting: [6.011, 11.989] kg.\nReferences\n1.
