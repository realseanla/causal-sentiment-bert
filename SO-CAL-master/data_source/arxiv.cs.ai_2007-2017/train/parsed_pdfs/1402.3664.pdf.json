In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the parameter estimation in the case where belief structures are uncertain and represented as interval-valued belief structures. Within our proposed method, the maximization of likelihood criterion and minimization of estimated parameter’s uncertainty are taken into consideration simultaneously.

      "text" : "Dempster-Shafer theory (D-S theory for short) (Dempster, 1967; Shafer,\n1976) has been widely used because it allows to handle uncertain data (Durbach and Stewart, 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Yang and Xu, 2013). In D-S theory, various belief structures are employed to represent the uncertain data. Recently, the study of parameter estimation based on belief structures has attracted many attentions (Come et al., 2009; Denoeux, 2010, 2013; Su et al., 2013). Typically, Denoeux (Denoeux, 2013) proposed an evidential EM algorithm for parameter estimation in the case of crisp belief structures, and Su et al. (Su et al., 2013) developed a parameter estimation approach for fuzzy belief structures. In this paper, the parameter estimation based on interval-valued belief structures (Yager, 2001; Wang et al., 2006) has been considered. A novel parameter estimation method is proposed for the case of interval-valued belief structures. Within the proposed method, two criteria, the maximization of observation data’s likelihood and the minimization of estimated parameter’s uncertainty, are both considered simultaneously. The proposed method is effective for both crisp (deterministic) and interval-valued (uncertain) belief structures, and promising for various applications."

Please refer to (Shafer, 1976; Yang and Xu, 2013) for more knowledge about D-S theory. In D-S theory, various belief structures, such as crisp, interval-valued and fuzzy belief structures, are employed as basic data structures. They are used to express various uncertain information. A crisp belief structure is defined as follows.\nDefinition 1. Let a finite nonempty set Ω be a frame of discernment, and 2Ω denote the power set of Ω. A crisp belief structure is a mapping m : 2Ω →\n[0, 1], satisfying\nm(∅) = 0 and ∑\nA∈2Ω\nm(A) = 1 (1)\nThe crisp belief structure is deterministic because its belief degree is expressed by real numbers. By contrast, the interval-valued belief structure (IBS) is a kind of uncertain belief structures, which is an extension of the crisp belief structure. It is more capable to represent the uncertain information. Some basic concepts about IBS are given as below (Yager, 2001; Wang et al., 2006).\nDefinition 2. Let Ω be a frame of discernment, F1, F2, · · ·, Fn be the n focal elements on Ω. An IBS mI satisfies such conditions\n1. ai ≤ mI(Fi) ≤ bi, where ai, bi ∈ [0, 1] and i = 1, 2, · · · , n; 2. ∑n\ni=1 ai ≤ 1 and ∑n i=1 bi ≥ 1;\n3. mI(F ) = 0, ∀F /∈ {F1, F2, · · · , Fn}.\nAn IBS is valid if it satisfies ∑n i=1 ai ≤ 1 and ∑n i=1 bi ≥ 1. In the rest of\nthis paper, all the IBSs are valid."

Within model P , α is a control parameter to adjust the impact of these two criteria. A point-valued probability distribution will be obtained if α = 1, and a set of interval probabilities will be obtained if α ≥ 2. A global optimization algorithm called OQNLP (Ugray et al., 2007) is employed to solve the optimization model P . Generally, the proposed method is superior to Denoeux’s method because not only can this method handle the case of crisp belief structures, but it can also deal with the case of IBSs, as shown in the next section."

In this paper, a novel method is proposed for the parameter estimation in the case where belief structures are uncertain and represented as interval-valued belief structures. Within our proposed method, the maximization of likelihood criterion and minimization of estimated parameter’s uncertainty are taken into consideration simultaneously. As an illustration, the proposed method is employed to estimate parameters for deterministic and uncertain belief structures, which demonstrates its effectiveness and versatility.",
