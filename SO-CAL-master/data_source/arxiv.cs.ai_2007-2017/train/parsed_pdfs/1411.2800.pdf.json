      "text" : "Dung’s theory of abstract argumentation [Dun95] is a unifying framework able to encompass a large variety of specific formalisms in the areas of nonmonotonic reasoning, logic programming and computational argumentation. It is based on the notion of argumentation framework (AF ), consisting of a set of arguments and an attack relation between them. Different argumentation semantics introduce in a declarative way the criteria to determine which arguments emerge as ‘justified’ from the conflict, by identifying a number of extensions, i.e. sets of arguments that can “survive the conflict together”. In [Dun95] four “traditional” semantics were introduced, namely complete, grounded, stable, and preferred semantics. For an introduction on alternative semantics, see [BCG11].\nThe main computational problems in abstract argumentation include decision and construction problems, and turn out to be computationally intractable for most of argumentation semantics [DW09]. In this paper we focus on the extension enumeration problem, i.e. constructing all extensions prescribed for a given AF : its solution provides complete information concerning the justification status of arguments and subsumes the solutions to the other problems.\nIn this paper we propose the first parallel approach for enumerating preferred extensions — a problem which lies at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy, thus justifying the quest for efficient solutions — which exploits the SCC-recursive schema [BGG05], a semantics definition schema where extensions are defined at the level of the sub-frameworks identified by the strongly connected components. A similar approach has been recently discussed in [CGVZ14] and compared with the state-of-the-art approach [CDGV13], but it does not exploit neither parallel nor dynamic programming techniques.\nAs large-scale argumentation is vastly unexplored, there is no further work directly related to our approach. The closest work is in the context of Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) Frameworks [BDKT97], an abstract framework for default reasoning which can be instantiated with different deductive systems (e.g. logic programming, autoepistemic logic, default logic). [CTC+12] describes a parallel implementation for credulous acceptance under the acceptablity semantics for some specific instances of ABAs in the medical domain. [CTC+12] considers competitive parallel executions: multiple versions — equivalent w.r.t. their outcome — of a sequential process are created and then started in parallel. Once one version finds a solution to the problem, the others are killed.\nOur work can be seen as part of a broader recent push towards large-scale reasoning which, among others, concerns simple semantic web reasoning [UKM+12], fuzzy ontologies [LQWY12] and logic programming [TAF14]. Indeed, the fast-growing field of argument mining from content in the Web [GCME12, CV13] highlights the lack of large-scale reasoning approaches in formal argumentation, and thus increases the importance of our research.\nThe paper is organised as follows. In the first section we recall some necessary background on Dung’s AF , the SCC-recursive schema and the existing algorithmic approach exploiting it. In the subsequent section we present our approach for exploiting the SCC-recursive schema in a parallel fashion, and we discuss the theoretical re-\nmarks granting the correctness of the approach. An exhaustive experimental analysis is then presented in the forthcoming section. The last section concludes the paper and discusses future work."

      "text" : "An argumentation framework [Dun95] consists of a set of arguments1 and a binary attack relation between them.\nDefinition 1. An argumentation framework (AF ) is a pair Γ = 〈A,R〉 where A is a set of arguments and R ⊆ A×A. We say that b attacks a iff 〈b, a〉 ∈ R, also denoted as b → a. The set of attackers of an argument a will be denoted as a− , {b : b → a}, the set of arguments attacked by a will be denoted as a+ , {b : a → b}. We also extend these notations to sets of arguments, i.e. given E ⊆ A, E− , {b | ∃a ∈ E, b → a} and E+ , {b | ∃a ∈ E, a → b}.\nAn argument a without attackers, i.e. such that a− = ∅, is said initial. Moreover, each argumentation framework has an associated directed graph where the vertices are the arguments, and the edges are the attacks.\nThe basic properties of conflict–freeness, acceptability, and admissibility of a set of arguments are fundamental for the definition of argumentation semantics.\nDefinition 2. Given an AF Γ = 〈A,R〉: • a set T ⊆ A is a conflict–free set of Γ if ∄ a, b ∈ T s.t. a → b; • an argument a ∈ A is acceptable with respect to a set T ⊆ A of Γ if ∀b ∈ A s.t.\nb → a, ∃ c ∈ T s.t. c → b; • a set T ⊆ A is an admissible set of Γ if T is a conflict–free set of Γ and every\nelement of T is acceptable with respect to T of Γ.\nAn argumentation semantics σ prescribes for any AF Γ a set of extensions, denoted as Eσ(Γ), namely a set of sets of arguments satisfying the conditions dictated by σ. Here we recall the definitions of complete (denoted as CO), grounded (denoted as GR) and preferred (denoted as PR) semantics.\nDefinition 3. Given an AF Γ = 〈A,R〉: • a set T ⊆ A is a complete extension of Γ, i.e. T ∈ ECO(Γ), iff T is admissible\nand ∀a ∈ A s.t. a is acceptable w.r.t. T , a ∈ T ; • a set T ⊆ A is the grounded extension of Γ, i.e. T ∈ EGR(Γ), iff T is the minimal\n(w.r.t. set inclusion) complete extension of Γ. Its existence and uniqueness have been proved in [DMT06]; • a set T ⊆ A is a preferred extension of Γ, i.e. T ∈ EPR(Γ), iff T is a maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion) complete extension of Γ.\n1In this paper we consider only finite sets of arguments: see [BCDG13] for a discussion on infinite sets of arguments.\nEach extension T implicitly defines a three-valued labelling of arguments: an argument a is labelled in iff a ∈ T ; out iff ∃ b ∈ T s.t. b → a; undec otherwise. Argumentation semantics can be equivalently defined in terms of labellings rather than of extensions [Cam06, BCG11].\nDefinition 4. Given a set of arguments T , a labelling of T is a total function Lab : T −→ {in, out, undec}. The set of all labellings of T is denoted as LT . Given an AF Γ = 〈A,R〉, a labelling of Γ is a labelling of A. The set of all labellings of Γ is denoted as L(Γ).\nComplete labellings can be defined as follows.\nDefinition 5. Let Γ = 〈A,R〉 be an argumentation framework. A labelling Lab ∈ L(Γ) is a complete labelling of Γ iff it satisfies the following conditions for any a ∈ A:\n• Lab(a) = in ⇔ ∀b ∈ a−Lab(b) = out; • Lab(a) = out ⇔ ∃b ∈ a− : Lab(b) = in.\nThe grounded and preferred labelling can then be defined on the basis of complete labellings.\nDefinition 6. Let Γ = 〈A,R〉 be an argumentation framework. A labelling Lab ∈ L(Γ) is the grounded labelling of Γ if it is the complete labelling of Γ minimizing the set of arguments labelled in, and it is a preferred labelling of Γ if it is a complete labelling of Γ maximizing the set of arguments labelled in.\nThe function Ext2Lab provides the connection between extensions and labellings.\nDefinition 7. Given an AF Γ = 〈A,R〉 and a conflict–free set T ⊆ A, the corresponding labelling Ext2Lab(T ) is defined as Ext2Lab(T ) ≡ Lab, where\n• Lab(a) = in ⇔ a ∈ T • Lab(a) = out ⇔ ∃ b ∈ T s.t. b → a • Lab(a) = undec ⇔ a /∈ T ∧ ∄ b ∈ T s.t. b → a\n[Cam06] shows that there is a bijective correspondence between extensions and labellings for complete, grounded, and preferred semantics.\nProposition 1. Given an AF Γ = 〈A,R〉, Lab is a complete (grounded, preferred) labelling of Γ if and only if there is a complete (grounded, preferred) extension T of Γ such that Lab = Ext2Lab(T ).\nThe set of complete labellings of Γ is denoted as LCO(Γ), the set of preferred labellings as LPR(Γ), while LGR(Γ) denotes the set including the grounded labelling."

      "heading" : "SCC-Recursiveness",
      "text" : "In [BG04] an extension-based semantics definition schema has been introduced, called SCC (strongly connected component)-recursiveness, based on the graph-theoretical notion of SCCs [Tar72, Lemma 9] and on the observation that most argumentation semantics can be equivalently defined at the level of SCCs.\nThe following definitions introduce the SCC-recursive schema [BGG05]. First, let us recall the definition of restriction of an AF Γ to a set of arguments I , in symbol Γ↓I .\nDefinition 8. Given an argumentation framework Γ = 〈A,R〉 and a set I ⊆ A, the restriction of Γ to I is defined as Γ↓I ≡ (I,R∩ (I × I)).\nThen, Definition 9 introduces the function GF(Γ, C) which recursively computes the semantics extensions on the basis of the SCCs of Γ. Let us denote as SCCΓ the set including the SCCs of an argumentation framework Γ.\nDefinition 9. A given argumentation semantics σ is SCC-recursive if for any argumentation framework Γ = 〈A,R〉, Eσ(Γ) = GF(Γ,A) ⊆ 2A. For any Γ = 〈A,R〉 and for any set C ⊆ A, E ∈ GF(Γ, C) if and only if\n• E ∈ BFσ(Γ, C) if |SCCΓ| = 1 • ∀S ∈ SCCΓ (E ∩ S) ∈ GF(Γ↓S\\(E\\S)+ , UΓ(S,E) ∩ C) otherwise\nwhere • BFσ(Γ, C) is a function, called base function, that, given an argumentation\nframework Γ = 〈A,R〉 such that |SCCΓ| = 1 and a set C ⊆ A, gives a subset of 2A\n• UΓ(S,E) = {a ∈ S \\ (E \\ S)+ | ∀b ∈ (a− \\ S), b ∈ E+}\nThe schema is based on the notions of extension of an AF in a set of arguments.\nDefinition 10. Given an AF Γ = 〈A,R〉 and a set C ⊆ A, a set E ⊆ A is: an admissible set of Γ in C if and only if E is an admissible set of Γ and E ⊆ C; a complete extension of Γ in C if and only if E is an admissible set of Γ in C, and every argument α ∈ C which is acceptable with respect to E belongs to E; the grounded extension of Γ in C if and only if it is the least (w.r.t. set inclusion) complete extension of Γ in C; a preferred extension of Γ in C if and only if it is a maximal (w.r.t. set inclusion) complete extension of Γ in C.\nThe existence and uniqueness of the grounded extension in C, as well as the existence of at least a preferred extension in C, have been proved in [BGG05]. Moreover, [BGG05] proves that GF(Γ, C), as defined in Def. 9, returns the σ-extensions in C (with σ ∈ {CO,GR,PR}), provided that BFσ(Γ, C) returns the complete, grounded, and preferred extensions in C, respectively.\n[CGVZ14] introduces the notions of complete, grounded and preferred labellings of Γ in C, i.e. the labelling-based counterparts of the corresponding notions of Definition 10, and describes a preliminary algorithm — R-PREF — exploiting the SCCrecursive schema. R-PREF implements GF (Def. 9), where the chosen base function BFPR is computed by a refinement of the algorithm in [CDGV13] which exploits a SAT solver as a NP-oracle to determine the preferred labellings. R-PREF exploits the SCC-recursive schema by constructing a sequence of strongly connected components of Γ in a topological order. Preferred labellings are incrementally constructed along the SCCs, by computing the preferred labellings of each SCC and merging them with those identified in the previous SCCs. In the following, we take advantage of two algorithms mentioned in [CGVZ14], namely GROUNDED [CGVZ14, Alg. 3] and B-PR [CGVZ14, Alg. 4]: their usage is described in the following section."

This is simply achieved by invoking (at line 3) P-SCC-REC(Γ,A), where the function P-SCC-REC (GF in Def. 9) receives as input an argumentation framework Γ = 〈A,R〉 and a set C ⊆ A, and computes the set LPR(Γ, C), i.e. the set of preferred labellings of Γ in C.\nP-SCC-REC first pre-processes (at line 3) — via the function GROUNDED [CGVZ14, Alg. 3] — Γ by computing the grounded labelling in C: Lab contains the restriction of the grounded labelling to those arguments which are either in or out; U is the set of arguments that are labelled undec in the grounded labelling.\nAt line 4 P-SCC-REC initialises to {Lab} the variable Ep, which stores the set of labellings that are incrementally constructed. At line 5 P-SCC-REC restricts Γ to Γ↓U .

Bi — computed by the function B-PR [CGVZ14, Alg. 4] — is the set of preferred labellings for Si when no argument in Si is attacked by in or undec arguments in previous, w.r.t. the L list, SCCs.\nAlgorithm 2 Computing preferred labellings of an AF in C P-SCC-REC(Γ, C)\n1: Input: Γ = 〈A,R〉, C ⊆ A 2: Output: Ep ∈ 2L(Γ) 3: (Lab, U) = GROUNDED(Γ, C) 4: Ep := {Lab} 5: Γ = Γ↓U 6: L:= (L1 := {S11 , . . . , S 1 k}, . . . , L n := {Sn1 , . . . , S n h}) = SCCS-LIST(Γ) 7: M := {. . . , (Si, Bi), . . .} = GREEDY(L,C) 8: for l ∈ {1, . . . , n} do 9: El := {E S1 l := (), . . . , E Sk l := ()}\n10: for S ∈ Ll do in parallel 11: for Lab ∈ Ep do in parallel 12: (O, I) := L-COND(Γ, S, Ll,Lab) 13: if I = ∅ then 14: ESl [Lab] ={{(a, out) | a ∈ O} ∪\n{(a, undec) | a ∈ S \\O}}\n15: else 16: if I = S then 17: ESl [Lab] = B where (S,B) ∈ M 18: else 19: if O = ∅ then 20: ESl [Lab] = B-PR(Γ↓S , I ∩C) 21: else 22: ESl [Lab]={{(a, out) | a ∈ O}} 23: ESl [Lab]= E S l [Lab]⊗\nP-SCC-REC(Γ↓S\\O, I ∩ C)\n24: end if 25: end if 26: end if 27: end for 28: end for 29: for S ∈ Ll do 30: E′p := ∅ 31: for Lab ∈ Ep do in parallel 32: E′p = E ′ p ∪ ({Lab} ⊗ E S l [Lab]) 33: end for 34: Ep := E ′ p 35: end for 36: end for 37: return Ep\nThen, at lines 8− 36, P-SCC-REC performs a first loop among the elements of the list L. At line 9 a rather articulated data structure, El, is initialised. For each S ∈ Ll, ESl is a list of pairs (Lab, E S l [Lab] ⊆ LS): to ease of notation, hereafter we omit the pair-structure thus referring directly to ESl [Lab] which contains the set of preferred labellings of S constructed on the basis of a specific labelling Lab identified in the previous (w.r.t. the list L) SCCs.\nTwo more loops are thus considered and their execution can be safely parallelised: the loop at lines 10−28 exploits Remark 2 by considering each SCC in a given element of the list L; while the loop at lines 11− 27 considers a single preferred labelling, each of which is independent from the others — cf. Remark 1.\nL-COND(Γ, S, Ll,Lab) at line 12 computes the effect of previous SCCs, and returns (O, I), where:\n• O = {a ∈ S | ∃b ∈ T ∩ a− : Lab(b) = in} and • I = {a ∈ S | ∀ b ∈ T ∩ a−,Lab(b) = out},\nwith T ≡ ⋃l−1\ni=1 ⋃ S∈Li\nS. Variable O is set to include arguments of S that are attacked by “outside” in-labelled arguments according to Lab, and variable I is set to include arguments of S that are only attacked by “outside” out-labelled arguments. This gives rise to three cases:\n1. each argument of S is attacked by in or undec arguments in previous SCCs — hence each argument of S is labelled out or undec (line 14); 2. no argument of S is attacked by in arguments in previous SCCs: this is the base case of the recursion and thus either we exploit the memoization technique implemented with the GREEDY algorithm (line 17) or we exploit the function B-PR (line 20); 3. in the remaining case, arguments attacked by in-arguments are labelled as out and P-SCC-REC is recursively called on the restriction of S to the unlabelled arguments (lines 22− 23).\nFinally, at lines 29 − 35 the computed preferred labellings ESl [Lab] are merged together (E1 ⊗ E2 = {Lab1 ∪ Lab2|Lab1 ∈ E1,Lab2 ∈ E2}) with the Lab labelling of previous SCCs. Once again, due to Remark 1, this process can be parallelised (lines 31− 33).\nThen the algorithm considers the next element in the list L. Once the outer loop is exited, all strongly connected components have been processed, thus Ep is returned as the set of preferred labellings in C (line 37).\nAlgorithm 3 Greedy computation of base cases GREEDY(L,C)\n1: Input: L = (L1, . . . , Ln := {Sn1 , . . . , S n h}), C ⊆ A 2: Output: M = {. . . , (Si, Bi), . . .} 3: M := ∅ 4: for S ∈ ⋃n i=1 L\ni do in parallel 5: B := B-PR(Γ↓S , S ∩ C) 6: M = M ∪ {(S,B)} 7: end for 8: return M\nTheorem 1.

      "text" : "The solvers have been run on a cluster with computing nodes equipped with 2.4 Ghz Dual Core AMD OpteronTM, 8 GB of RAM and Linux operating system. As in the International Planning Competition (IPC) [JdlRF+12], a cutoff of 900 seconds was imposed to compute the preferred extensions for each AF . No limit was imposed on the RAM usage, but a run fails at saturation of the available memory. Moreover, we adopted the IPC speed score, also borrowed from the planning community, which is defined as follows. For each AF , each system gets a score of 1/(1 + log10(T/T\n∗)), where T is its execution time and T ∗ the best execution time among the compared systems, or a score of 0 if it fails in that case. Runtimes below 0.01 sec get by default the maximal score of 1. In our experimental analysis, IPC score is normalised to 100. For each solver we recorded the overall result: success (if it finds each preferred extension), crashed, timed-out or ran out of memory.\nAs shown in [CGV14a], most of the state-of-the-art approaches for enumerating preferred extensions hardly solve large (w.r.t. the number of arguments) frameworks. In this work, we focus on extremely large AF s; the largest – as far as we know – that have ever been used for testing solvers.\nWe randomly generated a set of 200 AF s, varying the number of SCCs between 90 and 210, the number of arguments between 2,700 and 8,400, and considering different uniformly distributed probabilities of attacks, either between arguments or between different SCCs, leading to AF s with a number of attacks between approximately 100 thousands and 2 millions. AF s were generated using AFBenchGen [CGV14b].\nIn the following we rely on the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test (WSRT) in order to identify significant subset of data [Wil45].\nTable 1 shows the results of the overall comparison between R-PREF (henceforth P1) and P-SCC-REC (henceforth P2 or P4, according to the number of processors). The latter exploits either two or four processors, and has been run with and without\nthe greedy approach. From Table 1, two main conclusions can be derived. First, the exploitation of greedy approach introduces a significant overhead, due to the required pre-calculation. In our testing instances, pre-calculated knowledge is not used by algorithms and therefore, exploiting a greedy approach has a detrimental effect on P2 and P4 performance. This behaviour is confirmed also by a comparison (not shown) between P1 with/out greedy approach. Given this result, the greedy approach will not be considered in the rest of this section.\nThe second conclusion we derive from Table 1 is that parallelisation improves significantly the performance of both runtime and the number of successfully analysed AF s. Since the normalised IPC score of P4 is equal to its percentage of successes, P4 is always the fastest approach on the whole testing set. Both P4 and P2, according to WRST perform significantly better than P1 (p < 0.05). Using 2 (resp. 4) processors provides a maximum speed-up of 1.9 (resp. 2.8) times w.r.t. serial execution. Such results justify the use of parallel approaches in abstract argumentation.\nP1 vs P2\n0 150 300 450 600 750 900\nIPC value (normalised) w.r.t. di erent atta k probabilities\nFigure 1 provides results in the form of scatterplots, showing the performance of P1 and, respectively, P2 and P4. Using 2 processors have a remarkable impact on runtimes, in particular on complex AF s, which require approximately more than 300 seconds. A larger number of AF s can be successfully analysed by P2: this can be derived by observing the elements on the right axis of the graph. On simple AF s, the impact of using 2 processors is not so clear. On the other hand, parallelising on 4 processors guarantee to obtain lower runtimes on the whole testing set. This behaviour is probably due to the fact that the overhead introduced by parallelisation (generating threads, communication overhead, etc.) is not completely compensated by using 2 processors only, specially when a short amount of CPU time is needed for enumerating the extensions of a given AF .\nThe number of SCCs in the same set, cf. Remark 2, critically affects the performance of the proposed parallel algorithm. The larger the size of each level, the higher the degree of parallelisation that can be reached, since parallelisation is primarily based on processing simultaneously SCCs that are located on the same level. Figure 2 (upper) show the IPC score of parallelised and serial algorithms, with regards to the probability of attacks between SCCs. As expected, the performance gap between parallelised (P2, P4) and serial (P1) algorithms is maximum when the probability is 0 — i.e., all the SCCs are on the same level — and slowly decreases as the percentage increases. With a probability of 75%, most of the levels have a single SCC, therefore parallelisation does not provide a great speedup. It is worthy to notice that at higher attacks probability percentages, enumerating all the preferred extensions is very complex, and requires a significant amount of CPU-time. The differences of performance between P1 and P4 are always statistically significant (p < 0.05). It is not the case of P1 and P2, their performance are statistically indistinguishable on sets with probability of attacks of 50% (p = 0.39) and 75% (p = 0.66).\nFinally, Figure 2 shows how IPC score of considered algorithms changes with regard to the number of SCCs of the AF s. As a general trend, increasing the number of SCCs increases the runtime (and decreases the number of successes) for all implementations. This is expected, as larger inputs are harder to solve. On the other hand, P1 is very quick on smallest considered AF s; on average it is faster than P2. P1 performance rapidly decreases as the number of SCCs increases. This is also confirmed by the WRST: while P4 is always statistically better than P1, P2 performs statistically worse than P1 on AF s with |SCCs| = 90, but it performs statistically better when |SCCs| >= 120. Generally, parallelisation provides best speedup on very large AF s, with lower probability of attacks among SCCs."

      "text" : "In this paper we proposed an approach for exploiting the SCC-recursive schema for computing semantics extensions in Dung’s AF s taking advantage of parallel executions and dynamic programming. It is worth mentioning that Alg. 1, in conjunction with Algs. 2 and 3, are meta-algorithms that implement the SCC-recursive schema independently from the chosen semantics. Although we chose to consider the preferred semantics in order to provide a direct comparison with recent works [CGVZ14] — in\nessence equivalent to P1 — , the same algorithms can work for each semantics that is SCC-recursive [BGG05].\nMoreover, the empirical analysis shows that there is a substantial statistically significant increment of performance due to the partial parallel execution of the proposed algorithms. This results in:\n1. an increment (approx. 50%) of the number of AF s for which we can solve the preferred semantics enumeration problem before the chosen cutoff time; 2. a significant speedup of the computation of preferred extension up to 280% just considering 4 processors.\nFuture work is already envisaged in the area of additional experimentation analyses by considering different benchmarks and by discussing a variation of Alg. 2 where the two inner loops of Alg. 2 (lines 10−24 and 11−23) are swapped. We also plan to apply more dynamic programming techniques (e.g. memoization) by improving the current proposal of the greedy computation of some preferred labelling — Alg. 3. In addition, we will compare our approach with [DGWW11, ES14], which reduce the problem of enumerating preferred extensions to an ASP program which can be solved using the parallel ASP solver clingo. Finally, recent works on Input/Output behaviour characterisation of AF s [BBC+12, BBC+14] can be exploited for determining conditions of independent computation and thus exploiting parallel executions on graph structures different from SCCs."
