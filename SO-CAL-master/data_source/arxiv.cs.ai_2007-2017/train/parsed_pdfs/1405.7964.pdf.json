      "text" : "Many problems including uncertainties are a major issue in many fields of real life such as economics, engineering, environment, social sciences, medical sciences and business management. Uncertain data in these fields could be caused by complexities and difficulties in classical mathematical modeling. To avoid difficulties in dealing with uncertainties, many tools have been studied by researchers. Some of these tools are fuzzy sets [18], rough sets [16] and intuitionistic fuzzy sets [1]. Fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets are characterized by membership functions, membership and non-membership functions, respectively. In some real life problems for proper description of an object in uncertain and ambiguous environment, we need to handle the\nindeterminate and incomplete information. But fuzzy sets and intuitionistic fuzzy sets don’t handle the indeterminant and inconsistent information. Samarandache [13] defined the notion of neutrosophic set which is a mathematical tool for dealing with problems involving imprecise and indeterminant data.\nMolodtsov introduced concept of soft sets [9] to solve complicated problems and various types of uncertainties. In [10], Maji et al. introduced several operators for soft set theory: equality of two soft sets, subsets and superset of soft sets, complement of soft set, null soft sets and absolute soft sets. But some of these definitions and their properties have few gaps, which have been pointed out by Ali et al.[12] and Yang [17]. In 2010, Çağman and Enginoğlu [5] made some modifications the operations of soft sets and filled in these gap. In 2014, Çağman [4] redefined soft sets using the single parameter set and compared definitions with those defined before.\nMaji [11] combined the concept of soft set and neutrosophic set together by introducing a new concept called neutrosophic soft set and gave an application of neutrosophic soft set in decision making problem. Recently, the properties and applications on the neutrosophic sets have been studied increasingly [2, 3, 7, 8].The propose of this paper is to fill the gaps of the Maji’s neutrosophic soft set [11] definition and operations redefining concept of neutrosophic soft set and operations between neutrosophic soft sets. First, we present Maji’s definitions and operations and we verify that some propositions are incorrect by a counterexample. Then based on Çağman’s [4] study we redefine neutrosophic soft sets and their operations. Also, we investigate properties of neutrosophic soft sets operations. Finally we present an application of a neutrosophic soft set in decision making."

      "text" : "In this section, we will recall the notions of neutrosophic sets [15] and soft sets [9]. Then, we will give some properties of these notions. Throughout this paper X , E and P (X) denote initial universe, set of parameters and power set of X , respectively.\nDefinition 2.1 [15] A neutrosophic set A on the universe of discourse X is defined as\nA = { 〈x, TA(x), IA(x), FA(x)〉 : x ∈ X }\nwhere TA, IA, FA : X →] −0, 1+[ and −0 ≤ TA(x) + IA(x) + FA(x) ≤ 3 +. From philosophical point of view, the neutrosophic set takes the value from real standard or non-standard subsets of ]−0, 1+[. But in real life application\nin scientific and engineering problems it is difficult to use neutrosophic set with value from real standard or non-standard subset of ]−0, 1+[. Hence we consider the neutrosophic set which takes the value from the subset of [0, 1].\nDefinition 2.2 [9] Let consider a nonempty set A, A ⊆ E. A pair (F,A) is called a soft set over X, where F is a mapping given by F : A → P (X).\nExample 2.3 Let X = {xl, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6, x7, x8} be the universe which are eight houses and E = {e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6} be the set of parameters. Here, ei (i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) stand for the parameters “modern”, “with parking”, “ expensive”, “ cheap”, “ large” and “ near to city” respectively. Then, following soft sets are described respectively Mr. A and Mr. B who are going to buy\nF = { (e1, {x1, x3, x4}), (e2, {x1, x4, x7, x8}), (e3, {x1, x2, x3, x8}) } G = { (e2{x1, x3, x6}), (e3, X), (e5, {x2, x4, x4, x6}) } .\nFrom now on, we will use definitions and operations of soft sets which are more suitable for pure mathematics based on study of Çağman [4].\nDefinition 2.4 [4] A soft set F over X is a set valued function from E to P (X). It can be written a set of ordered pairs\nF = { (e, F (e)) : e ∈ E } .\nNote that if F (e) = ∅, then the element (e, F (e)) is not appeared in F . Set of all soft sets over X is denoted by S.\nDefinition 2.5 [4] Let F,G ∈ S. Then,\ni. If F (e) = ∅ for all e ∈ E, F is said to be a null soft set, denoted by Φ.\nii. If F (e) = X for all e ∈ E, F is said to be absolute soft set, denoted by X̂.\niii. F is soft subset of G, denoted by F ⊆̃G, if F (e) ⊆ G(e) for all e ∈ E.\niv. F = G, if F ⊆̃G and G⊆̃F .\nv. Soft union of F and G, denoted by F ∪̃G, is a soft set over X and defined by F ∪̃G : E → P (X) such that (F ∪̃G)(e) = F (e) ∪G(e) for all e ∈ E.\nvi. Soft intersection of F and G, denoted by F ∩̃G, is a soft set over X and defined by F ∩̃G : E → P (X) such that (F ∩̃G)(e) = F (e) ∩G(e) for all e ∈ E.\nvii. Soft complement of F is denoted by F c̃ and defined by F c̃ : E → P (X) such that F c̃(e) = X \\ F (e) for all e ∈ E.\nExample 2.6 Let us consider soft sets F ,G in the Example 2.3. Then, we have\nF ∪̃G = {\n(e1, {x1, x3, x4}), (e2, {x1, x3, x4, x6, x7, x8}),\n(e3, X), (e5, {x2, x4, x4, x6}) }\nF ∩̃G = { (e2{x1}), (e3, {x1, x2, x3, x8}) }\nF c̃ = {\n(e1, {x2, x5, x6, x7, x8}), (e2, {x2, x3, x5, x6}), (e3, {x4, x5, x6, x7}), (e4, X), (e5, X), (e6, X) } .\nDefinition 2.7 [11] Let X be an initial universe set and E be a set of parameters. Consider A ⊂ E. Let P (X) denotes the set of all neutrosophic sets of X. The collection (F,A) is termed to be the soft neutrosophic set over X, where F is a mapping given by F : A → P (X).\nFor illustration we consider an example.\nExample 2.8 Let X be the set of houses under consideration and E is the set of parameters. Each parameter is a neutrosophic word or sentence involving neutrosophic words. Consider E = {beautiful, wooden, costly, very costly, moderate, green surroundings, in good repair, in bad repair, cheap, expensive}. In this case, to define a neutrosophic soft set means to point out beautiful houses, wooden houses, houses in the green surroundings and so on. Suppose that, there are five houses in the universe X given by, U = {h1, h2, h3, h4, h5} and the set of parameters A = {e1, e2, e3, e4}, where e1 stands for the parameter ’beautiful’, e2 stands for the parameter ’wooden’, e3 stands for the parameter ’costly’ and the parameter e4 stands for ’moderate’. Suppose that,\nF (beautiful) = {〈h1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3〉, 〈h2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.6〉, 〈h3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3〉,\n〈h4, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2〉, 〈h5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.3〉},\nF (wooden) = {〈h1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.5〉, 〈h2, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3〉, 〈h3, 0.8, 0.1, 0.2〉,\n〈h4, 0.7, 0.1, 0.3〉, 〈h5, 0.8, 0.3, 0.6〉},\nF (costly) = {〈h1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3〉, 〈h2, 0.6, 0.7, 0.2〉, 〈h3, 0.7, 0.2, 0.5〉,\n〈h4, 0.5, 0.2, 0.6〉, 〈h5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.4〉},\nF (moderate) = {〈h1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4〉, 〈h2, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6〉, 〈h3, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4〉,\n〈h4, 0.7, 0.8, 0.6〉, 〈h5, 0.9, 0.5, 0.7〉}.\nThe neutrosophic soft set (NSS) (F,E) is a parameterized family {F (ei); i = 1, 2, ..., 10}of all neutrosophic sets of X and describes a collection of approximation of an object.\nThus we can view the neutrosophic soft set (NSS) (F,A) as a collection of approximation as below:\n(F,A) = {beautiful houses = {〈h1, 0.5, 0.6, 0.3〉, 〈h2, 0.4, 0.7, 0.6〉,\n〈h3, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3〉, 〈h4, 0.7, 0.3, 0.2〉, 〈h5, 0.8, 0.2, 0.3〉},\nwooden houses = {〈h1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.5〉, 〈h2, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3〉,\n〈h3, 0.8, 0.1, 0.2〉, 〈h4, 0.7, 0.1, 0.3〉, 〈h5, 0.8, 0.3, 0.6〉},\ncostly houses = f〈h1, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3〉, 〈h2, 0.6, 0.7, 0.2〉,\n〈h3, 0.7, 0.2, 0.5〉, 〈h4, 0.5, 0.2, 0.6〉, 〈h5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.4〉},\nmoderate houses = 〈h1, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4〉, 〈h2, 0.7, 0.9, 0.6〉,\n〈h3, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4〉, 〈h4, 0.7, 0.8, 0.6〉, 〈h5, 0.9, 0.5, 0.7〉}}.\nDefinition 2.9 [11] Let (F,A) and (G,B) be two neutrosophic sets over the common universe X. (F,A) is said to be neutrosophic soft subset of (G,B) is A ⊂ B, and TF (e)(x) ≤ TG(e)(x), IF (e)(x) ≤ IG(e)(x) FF (e)(x) ≥ FG(e)(x), ∀e ∈ A, ∀x ∈ U . We denote it by (F,A) ⊆ (G,B). (F,A) is said to be neutrosophic soft super set of (G,B) if (G,B) is a neutrosophic soft subset of (F,A). We denote it by (F,A) ⊇ (G,B).\nif (F,A) is neutrosophic soft subset of (G,B) and (G,B) is neutrosophic soft subset of (F,A). We denote it (F,A) = (G,B).\nDefinition 2.10 [11] NOT set of a parameters. Let E = {e1, e2, ...en} be a set of parameters. The NOT set of E, denoted by ⌉E is defined by ⌉E = {¬e1,¬e2, ...¬en}, where ¬ei =not ei ∀i(it may be noted that ⌉ and ¬ are different operators).\nDefinition 2.11 [11] Complement of a neutrosophic soft set (F,A) denoted by (F,A)c and is defined as (F,A)c = (F c, ⌉A), where F c. ⌉A → P (X) is mapping given by F c(α) = neutrosophic soft complement with TF c(x) = FF (x), IF c(x) = IF (x) and FF c(x) = TF (x).\nDefinition 2.12 [11] Empty or null neutrosophic soft set with respect to a parameter. A neutrosophic soft set (H,A) over the universe X is termed to be empty or null neutrosophic soft set with respect to the parameter e if TH(e)(m) = 0, FH(e) = 0 and IH(e)(m) = 0 ∀m ∈ X, ∀e ∈ A\nIn this case the null neutrosophic soft set (NNSS) is denoted by ΦA\nDefinition 2.13 [11] Union of two neutrosophic soft sets. Let (H,A) and (G,B) be two NSSs over the common universe X. Then the union of (H,A) and (G,B) is defined by (H,A) ∪ (G,B) = (K,C), where C = A ∪ B and\nthe truth-membership, indeterminacy-membership and falsity-membership of (K,C) are as follow.\nTK(e)(m) = TH(e)(m), ife ∈ A−B\n= TG(e)(m), ife ∈ B −A\n= max(TH(e)(m), TG(e)(m)), ife ∈ A ∩B\nIK(e)(m) = IH(e)(m), ife ∈ A−B\n= IG(e)(m), ife ∈ B −A = IH(e)(m) + IG(e)(m)\n2 , ife ∈ A ∩B.\nFK(e)(m) = FH(e)(m), ife ∈ A−B\n= FG(e)(m), ife ∈ B −A\n= min(FH(e)(m), FG(e)(m)), ife ∈ A ∩ B\nDefinition 2.14 [11] Let (H,A) and (G,B) be two NSSs over the common universe X.
