The KBMC approach is to encode gen­ eral knowledge in an expressive language, then con­ struct a decision model for each particular situation or problem instance. The interested reader can find more details on KBMC in the review by Wellman, et. al . [1992]. For the purposes of our c:-safe planner, we record knowledge about patterns of causal interaction in a knowledge-base.",

This probabilistic approach commits us to planning to meet some specified goal with a probability of success of at least I f. for some user-supplied c We describe several al­ gorithms for t-safe planning based on condi­ tional planners. The two conditional plan­ ners we discuss are Peot and Smi th 's non­ linear conditional planner, CNLP, and our own linear conditional planner, PLINTH. We present a straightforward extension to con­ ditional planners for which computing the necessary probabilities is simple, employing a commonly-made but. perhaps overly-strong independence assumption. We also discuss a second approach to <-safe planning which re­ laxes this independence assumption , involv­ ing the incremental construction of a proba­ bility dependence model in conjunction with the construction of the plan graph.",
