The value­ directed model allows one to choose approxima­ tion methods for belief state monitoring that have a small impact on decision quality. Using a vec­ tor space analysis of the problem, we devise two new search procedures for selecting an approxi­ mation scheme that have much better computa­ tional properties than existing methods. Though these provide looser error bounds, we show em­ pirically that they have a similar impact on deci­ sion quality in practice, and run up to two orders of magnitude more quickly.",
