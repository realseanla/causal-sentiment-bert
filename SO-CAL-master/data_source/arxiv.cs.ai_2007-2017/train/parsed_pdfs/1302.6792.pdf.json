Selecting belief networks with cer­ tain minimallity properties turns out to be NP-hard, which justifies the use of search heuristics. Search heuristics based on the Bayesian measure of Cooper and Her­ skovits and a minimum description length (MDL) measure are compared with re­ spect to their properties for both limit­ ing and finite database sizes. It is shown that the MDL measure has more desir­ able properties than the Bayesian mea­ sure. Experimental results suggest that for learning probabilities of belief net­ works smoothing is helpful.",
