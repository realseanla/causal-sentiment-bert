We present a subset of proba­ bility logic sufficient for representing the class of Bayesian networks with discrete-valued nodes. We impose constraints on the form of the sentences that guarantee that the knowl­ edge base contains all the probabilistic infor­ mation necessary to generate a network. We define the concept of d-separation for knowl­ edge bases and prove that a knowledge base with independence conditions defined by d­ separation is a complete specification of a probability distribution. We present a net­ work generation algorithm that, given an in­ ference problem in the form of a query Q and a set of evidence E, generates a network to compute P(QIE). We prove the algorithm to be correct.",
