      "text" : "Catastrophic forgetting is a fundamental challenge for artificial general intelligence based on neural networks. When models using stochastic gradient descent learn a new task, the models often forget the information of previous tasks (McCloskey & Cohen, 1989). This online multi-task learning is described as continual learning. Recently, this classical problem has resurfaced with the renaissance of deep learning research (Goodfellow et al., 2013; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Fernando et al., 2017).\nTo resolve this catastrophic forgetting problem, we propose the incremental moment matching (IMM). IMM uses the framework of Bayesian neural networks, which implies\n1Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea 2Naver Labs, Naver Corp., Bundang, South Korea 3Surromind Robotics, Seoul, South Korea.

Mean-IMM simply averages the parameter of two neural networks, whereas mode-IMM tries to find a maximum of the mixture of Gaussian posteriors. For IMM to be reasonable, the search space of the loss function between the posterior means µ1 and µ2 should be reasonably smooth and convex-like. To find a µ2 which satisfies this condition of a smooth and convex-like path from µ1, we propose applying various transfer techniques for the IMM procedure.\nthat an uncertainty is assumed for each parameter in neural networks, and that the posterior distribution is calculated (Blundell et al., 2015). The dimension of the posterior distribution is the number of parameters in the neural networks. To overcome catastrophic forgetting, IMM approximates the mixture of Gaussian posterior with each component representing a single task, to one Gaussian distribution that represents a single combined task.\nIMM incrementally matches the mean and the covariance of posterior distributions based on the assumption that the posterior distributions of parameters are Gaussian distributions. In this approach, the final posterior distribution can be calculated in a closed form, with the moments of posterior distributions trained for the old and new task, respectively. We introduce two novel methods of moment matching. One is mean-IMM, which simply averages the parameters of two networks for old and new tasks as the minimization of KL-divergence between the approximated posterior distribution and the mixture of two Gaussian posteriors. The other is mode-IMM, which merges the parameters of two networks using a Laplacian approximation (MacKay, 1992) to approximate a mode of the mixture of two Gaussian posteriors, which represent the parameters of the two\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n08 47\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n4 M\nar 2\n01 7\nnetworks.\nIn general, it is too naı̈ve to assume that the final posterior distribution for the whole task is Gaussian. To make our IMM work, the search space of the loss function between the posterior means needs to be smooth and convex-like. In other words, there should not exist high cost barriers between the means of the two networks for an old and a new task. To make our assumption of Gaussian distribution for neural network reasonable, we applied three main transfer learning techniques on the IMM procedure: weight transfer, L2-norm of the old and the new parameters, and our newly proposed variant of dropout using the old parameters. The whole procedure of IMM is illustrated in Figure 1.\nWe evaluate our approach mainly on three experiments. First, we analyze the search space of the loss function represented by convolutional neural networks (CNN) in the CIFAR-10 image recognition benchmark. The experimental results show that utilizing weight transfer on IMM is critical to making our assumption of the Gaussian posterior reasonable. Second, our approach is compared with existing models on the MNIST image recognition benchmark. Our models work as well as the comparative models in cases where the comparative models work well, however our models show reasonably successful results in cases where the comparative models fail. Finally, our proposed approach is evaluated on a real-world life-log dataset collected using Google Glass. We show that our mean-IMM model achieved similar performance to the comparative ensemble model without additional computational cost for learning and inference."

      "text" : "One of the major approaches for catastrophic forgetting is to use an ensemble of neural networks. When a new task arrives, the algorithm makes a new network, and shares the representation between the tasks (Lee et al., 2016; Rusu et al., 2016). This approach often improves the performance of the whole task and is practically used in continual learning. However, this approach has a complexity issue, especially in inference, because the number of networks increases with the number of new tasks that need to be learned.\nAnother approach studies methods using implicit distributed storage of information, in typical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning. These methods use the idea of dropout or maxout for distributively storing the information for each task by making use of the large capacity of the neural network (Srivastava et al., 2013). Unfortunately, most studies following this approach had limited success\nand failed to preserve performance on the old task when an extreme change to the environment occurred (Goodfellow et al., 2013). Alternatively, Fernando et al. (2017) proposed PathNet, which extends the idea of the ensemble approach for parameter reuse within a single network. In PathNet, a neural network has 10 ∼ 20 modules in each layer and 3 ∼ 4 modules are picked for one task in each layer by an evolutionary approach. This method alleviates the complexity issue of the ensemble approach to continual learning in a plausible way.\nRecently, the concept of applying a regularization function to the network trained by the old task to learning a new task has received attention. Learning without forgetting (LwF), one example of this approach, uses the pseudo-training data from the old task (Li & Hoiem, 2016). Before learning the new task, LwF puts the training data of the new task into the old network, and uses the output as pseudo-labels of the pseudo-training data. By optimizing both the pseudotraining data of the old task and the real data of the new task, LwF tries to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Their experimental result shows that the performance of LwF approximates joint batch learning if the number of instances in the new dataset is small. Elastic weight consolidation (EWC), another example of this approach, uses sequential Bayesian estimation to update neural networks for continual learning (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017). In EWC, the posterior distribution trained by the previous task is used to update the new prior distribution. This new prior is used for learning the new posterior distribution of the new task in a Bayesian manner. Updating the parameter of complex hierarchical models by sequential Bayesian estimation is not new (Ghahramani, 2000). Sequential Bayes was also used to learn topic models from stream data in Broderick et al. (2013)."

      "text" : "Bayesian neural networks (BNN) assume an uncertainty for the whole parameter in neural networks so that the posterior distribution can be obtained (Blundell et al., 2015). Previous studies have argued that BNN regularize better than NN, and provides a confidence interval for the output estimation of each input instance. The whole study on the BNN, to the best of our knowledge, uses Gaussian distribution as the posterior of the parameters. In the Gaussian assumption, because tracking whole information of covariance matrix is too expensive, researchers usually use only the diagonal term for the covariance matrix, in which case, the posterior distribution is fully factorized for each parameter. However, the methods using full covariance was also suggested recently (Louizos & Welling, 2016). For estimating covariance matrix most of the studies use stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB), where a sampled point from the posterior distribution by Monte Carlo is used in\nthe training phases (Kingma & Welling, 2013). Alternatively, Kirkpatrick et al. (2017) approximated the covariance matrix as an inverse of Fisher matrix. This approximation makes the computational cost of the inference of covariance matrix smaller when the update of covariance information is not needed in the training phase. Our method follows the approach using Fisher matrix."

Similarly to our method, Bayesian moment matching is used for sum-product networks, a kind of deep hierarchical probabilistic model (Rashwan et al., 2016). Though sumproduct networks are usually not scalable to large datasets, their online learning method is useful, and it achieves similar performance to the batch learner. Our method using the moment matching focuses on continual learning, unlike the previous method, deals with significantly different statistics between tasks.\nIn our work, we use a Gaussian distribution to approximate the posterior distribution of parameters. We want to find the optimal parameter µ∗1:2 and Σ ∗ 1:2 of the Gaussian approximation function q for the whole task, from the parameter of the first and second task, (µ1,Σ1) and (µ2,Σ2) of q1 and q2, respectively.\np1:2 ≡ p(θ|X1:2, y1:2) ≈ q1:2 ≡ q(θ|µ1:2,Σ1:2) (1) p1 ≡ p(θ|X1, y1) ≈ q1 ≡ q(θ|µ1,Σ1) (2) p2 ≡ p(θ|X2, y2) ≈ q2 ≡ q(θ|µ2,Σ2) (3)\nq1:2 denotes an approximation of the true posterior distribtion p1:2 for the whole task, q1 denotes an approximation of the true posterior distribtion p1 for the first task, and q2 denotes an approximation of true posterior distribtion p2 for the second task. θ denotes the vector of parameters.

Though mean-IMM minimizes KLdivergence for a mixture of Gaussian (MoG), usually, a weighted average of two mean vectors of Gaussian distributions is not a mode of MoG. In discriminative learning, the maximum of the distribution is of primary interest. Critical points of MoG with two clusters satisfy the following equations (Ray & Lindsay, 2005):\nθ =((1− α)Σ−11 + αΣ −1 2 ) −1\n((1− α)Σ−11 µ1 + αΣ −1 2 µ2),\n(7)\nwhere α = q2q1+q2 . Note that α is a function of θ, so θ cannot be calculated in a closed-form from Equation 7. However, the optimal θ is in the set {θ|θ = ((1 − α)Σ−11 + αΣ−12 ) −1((1− α)Σ−11 µ1 + αΣ −1 2 µ2), 0 < α < 1}, which motivates our mode-IMM method. See Appendix A for more detail.\nWe simply fix α to 1/2 to approximate MoG with Laplacian approximation, in which the logarithm of the function is expressed by Taylor expansion (MacKay, 1992). Using Laplacian approximation, the MoG is approximated as follows:\nlog q1 + log q2 =\n− 1 2 θT (Σ−11 + Σ −1 2 )θ + (Σ −1 1 µ1 + Σ −1 2 µ2)θ + C\n(8)\nIn this assumption, the optimal solution is:\nµ∗1:2 = (Σ −1 1 + Σ −1 2 ) −1(Σ−11 µ1 + Σ −1 2 µ2) (9)\nΣ∗1:2 = (Σ −1 1 + Σ −1 2 ) −1 (10)\nHere, we assume diagonal covariance matrices, which means that there is no correlation among parameters. This diagonal assumption is useful, since it decreases the number of parameters for each covariance matrix from O(d2) toO(d), where d is the dimension of the parameters. Based on this, the µ∗1:2 is defined as follows:\nµ∗1:2,v = µ1,v/σ\n2 1,v + µ2,v/σ 2 2,v\n1/σ21,v + 1/σ 2 2,v\n(11)\nv denotes an index of the parameter vector.\nFor covariance, we use the inverse of Fisher information matrix (Kirkpatrick et al., 2017; Pascanu & Bengio, 2013). The main idea of this approximation is that the square of gradients for parameters is a good indicator of its precision, which is the inverse of the variance. Fisher information matrix for the ith task, Fi is defined as:\nFi = E\n[ ∂\n∂µi ln p(y|x, µi) ·\n∂\n∂µi ln p(y|x, µi)T\n] , (12)\nwhere the probability of the expectation follows x ∼ πi and y ∼ p(y|x, µi), where πi denotes an empirical distribution of Xi."

This is because there might be high cost barriers between the two parameters (Goodfellow et al., 2014). However, we will show that various transfer learning technique can be used to ease this problem, and make the assumption of Gaussian distribution for neural networks reasonable. In this section, we introduce three practical techniques for IMM procedure, weight-transfer, L2-transfer, and drop-transfer."

      "heading" : "4.1. Weight-Transfer",
      "text" : "The first and most important idea is weight-transfer. The parameters for new task µ2 are initialized with the parameters for previous task µ1 (Yosinski et al., 2014). Note that this weight-transfer technique was also applied to an incremental ensemble approach for continual learning (Lee et al., 2016). In our experiments, the use of weight-transfer was critical to the continual learning performance. For this reason, the experiments on IMM in this paper use the weight-transfer technique as default.\nThe weight-transfer technique is motivated by the geometrical property of neural networks discovered in the previous work (Goodfellow et al., 2014). They found that there is a straight path from the initial point to the solution without any high cost barrier, in various types of neural networks and datasets. This discovery may suggest that the weighttransfer from the previous task to the new task makes a smooth loss surface between two solutions for the tasks, so that, the optimal solution for both tasks lies on the interpolated point of the two solutions.\nTo empirically validate the concept of weight-transfer, we use the linear path analysis proposed by Goodfellow et al. (2014). We randomly chose 18,000 instances from the training dataset of CIFAR-10, and divided them into three subsets of 6,000 instances, respectively. These three subsets are used for sequential training by CNN models, parameterized by θ1, θ2, and θ3, respectively. Here, θ2 is initialized from θ1, and then, θ3 is initialized from θ2, in the same way as weight-transfer. In the analysis, each loss and accuracy is evaluated at a series of points θ = θ1 + α(θ2 − θ1) + β(θ3 − θ2), varying α and β.\nThe result of the geometric analysis is shown in Figure 2. In the figure, the loss surface of the model on each online subset is nearly convex. Figure 2 shows that the parameter at 13 (θ1 + θ2 + θ3), which is the same as the solution of mean-IMM, performs better than any other reference points θ1, θ2, or θ3. However, when θ2 is not initialized by θ1, the convex-like shape disappears, since there is a high cost\nbarrier between the loss function of θ1 and θ2.\nWe also found that the distances between two parameters ||θ1 − θ2||2 with and without weight-transfer are similar to each other, when two models are trained by the same hyperparameters. This result implies that the mechanism of the weight-transfer is different to the strategy of simply making two parameters close together in a Euclidean space."

      "heading" : "4.2. L2-transfer",
      "text" : "The second idea is L2-transfer, which is a variant of L2regularization. In L2-transfer, a regularization term of the distance between µ1 and µ2 is added to the following objective function for finding µ2, where λ is a hyperparameter:\nlog p(y2|X2, µ2)− λ · ||µ1 − µ2||22 (15)\nNormally, L2-transfer is used in continual learning with large λ, and can also be interpreted as a special case of EWC where the prior distribution is Gaussian with λI as a covariance matrix. Two studies (Li & Hoiem, 2016; Kirkpatrick et al., 2017) compare their proposed model to L2transfer in their transfer and continual learning.\nUnlike the previous usage of large λ, we use small λ for the IMM procedure. In other words, µ2 is first trained by Equation 15 with small λ, and µ1 and µ2 are then merged to µ1:2 in our IMM. Since we want to make the loss surface between µ1 and µ2 smooth, and not to minimize the distance between µ1 and µ2. In convex optimization, the L2-regularizer makes the convex function strictly convex. Similarly, we hope L2-transfer with small λ will help find a µ2 with a convex-like loss space between µ1 and µ2."

In training phase, the following µ̂2i is used for the weight vector corresponding to the ith node µ2i with dropout ratio p:\nµ̂2i =\n{ µ1i, if ith node is turned off\n1 1−p · µ2i − p 1−p · µ1i, otherwise\n(16)\nNotice that the expectation of µ̂2i is µ2i.\nThere are studies (Srivastava et al., 2014; Baldi & Sadowski, 2013) that interpreted dropout as an exponential ensemble of weak learners. In this perspective, as the marginalization of output distribution over whole weak learner is intractable, the parameters multiplied by the inverse of dropout rate are used for test phase in the procedure. In other words, the parameters of the weak learners are, in effect, simply averaged oversampled learners by dropout.\nIn the perspective of the concept of drop-transfer in our continual learning setting, we hypothesize that the dropout process makes the averaged point of two arbitrary sampled points using Equation 16, a good estimator. In other words, the performance of the averaged parameters is better than the performance of the single points before averaging."

      "text" : "We first evaluate our models on the disjoint MNIST experiment (Srivastava et al., 2013). In this experiment, the MNIST dataset is divided into two datasets: the first dataset\nconsists of only digits {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} and the second dataset consists of the remaining digits {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The first dataset contains 51.39% of the test data, and the second dataset contains 48.61%. This implies that if the model incorrectly classifies every image of the first dataset, the accuracy can be at most 48.61%. Our task is 10-class joint categorization, unlike in the previous work, which considers two independent tasks of 5-class categorization. Therefore, our task is more difficult than the task of the previous work. In our experiment, all models only use one 10- way softmax output layer, except for LwF. As LwF does not originally consider having one output layer for two datasets, we make an ensemble model for LwF with the softmax output of the two last layers, otherwise, LwF did not reach a performance of 50%.\nWe evaluate the models both on the natural setting and the tuned setting. The natural setting refers to the most natural hyperparameter in the equation of each algorithm. For mean-IMM, it is most natural to evenly average two parameters and 1/2 is the most natural α value in Equation 4. For EWC, 1 is the most natural λ value in Equation 13. For L2-transfer, there is no natural hyperparameter value in Equation 15, so we need to choose λ heuristically for each task and dataset.\nThe tuned setting refers to using heuristic hand-tuned hyperparameters. Tuned hyperparameter-setting is often used in practice. For example, when the model needs to learn from the new task after learning from the old task, a low learning rate or early stopping is used.\nHyperparam in Table 1 denotes hyperparameter mainly searched in the tuned setting. In the SGD, epoch per dataset for the second task corresponds to the hyperparameter. The unit is how much of the network is trained from the whole\ndata at once. In the LwF, L2-transfer, and EWC, λ in Equations 13, 15, and 14 corresponds to the hyperparameter, respectively. In the mean-IMM and mode-IMM, α in Equations 5 and 7 corresponds to the hyperparameter, respectively. In the drop-transfer, dropout ratio p in Equation 16 corresponds to the hyperparameter. The whole explained hyperparameter is devised to balance the information between the old and new tasks. If 1/(1 + λ) = 0 or α = 0, the final network of the algorithms is the same as the network for the first task. If 1/(1 + λ) = 1 or α = 1, the final network is the same as the network for the last task.\nWe used multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) with [784-800- 800-10] as the number of nodes, ReLU as the activation function, and vanilla SGD as the optimizer for all of the experiments. We set the epoch per dataset as 10, unless otherwise noted. The entire IMM model uses weight-transfer to smooth the loss surface of the model. Without weighttransfer, our IMM model does not work at all. In SGD, dropout is used as proposed in Goodfellow et al. (2013).\nTable 1 shows the experimental results from the disjoint MNIST experiment. Each accuracy was measured by repeating 10 experiments. In the tuned experiment, the performance of the IMM models exceeds 90%, and the performance increases more when more transfer techniques are applied. Among all the models, weight-transfer + L2transfer + drop-transfer + mode-IMM performs the best and at greater than 94%. However, the comparative models fail to reach greater than 90%. Existing regularizer including dropout does not help much for comparative models. In our experimental setting, the usual SGD-based optimizers always perform less than 50%, because the biases of the output layer for the old task are always pushed to large negative values, which implies that our task is extremely\nhard.\nBetween the two types of moment matching, mode-IMM works more robustly than mean-IMM. In the natural hyperparameter setting, mean-IMM performs worse when more transfer techniques are applied. This is because when the network is trained for the new task it is affected too largely by information from the first task. The Figure 3 also shows that mode-IMM is robust with α and the optimal α of mean-IMM is often not 1/2."

In this experiment, the first dataset is the same as the original MNIST dataset. However, in the second dataset, the input pixels of all images are shuffled with a fixed, random permutation. Therefore, the difficulty of the two datasets is the same, though a different solution is required for each dataset. In previous work, EWC reaches the performance level of the batch learner, and it is argued that EWC overcomes catastrophic forgetting in some domains. In our set-\nting, the training data is divided into sets of 30,000 instances each. The experimental details are similar to the disjoint MNIST experiment, except all models are allowed to use dropout regularization. In mean-IMM, mode-IMM, and SGD, natural hyperparameter is used, where for EWC, an optimal λ is searched.\nTable 2 shows the experimental results from the shuffled MNIST experiment. The result shows that our IMM paradigm does work and performs similarly to EWC where it is known that EWC performs well. We found that dropout regularization in the task makes both our models and comparative models perform better. The performance of meanIMM again does not reach the performance level of modeIMM. Figure 4 illustrates the performance of mean-IMM and mode-IMM. The result shows mode-IMM preserves the performance of two tasks. The performance of SGD can reach to near 97% in the tuned setting with a low learning rate and early stopping. However, we write 95.97% in the table according to the result from the natural setting because we want to emphasize that performance decreases with the usual learning rate and without early stopping.\nKirkpatrick et al. (2017) interpreted that the Fisher matrix F as weight importance in explaining their EWC model. However, this assumption does not always hold. In the shuffled MNIST experiment, their assumption on weight importance holds, since a large number of pixels always has a value of zero. For these areas, the corresponding element of the Fisher matrix is also zero. Therefore, EWC does work by allowing weights to change, which are not used in the previous task. On the other hand, mode-IMM also works by selectively balancing between two weights using variance information. However, these assumptions on weight importance do not hold in the disjoint MNIST\nexperiment. The most important weight in the disjoint MNIST experiment is the bias term in the output layer. Nevertheless, these elements of the Fisher matrix are not guaranteed to get high value nor can be used to balance the class distribution between the first and second task. We believe that using only the diagonal term for the covariance matrix in Bayesian neural networks is too naı̈ve in general and that it is why EWC failed in the disjoint MNIST experiment. We think this could be alleviated in future work by using a more complex prior, such as a matrix Gaussian distribution while assuming correlations between nodes in the network (Louizos & Welling, 2016)."

Imagine two Gaussian distribution q1 and q2, such as in Equations 2 and 3, respectively.\nq1 ≡ q1(θ;µ1,Σ1) = 1√\n(2π)d|Σ1| exp\n( −1\n2 (θ − µ1)TΣ−11 (θ − µ1)\n) (18)\nq2 ≡ q2(θ;µ2,Σ2) = 1√\n(2π)d|Σ2| exp\n( −1\n2 (θ − µ2)TΣ−11 (θ − µ2)\n) (19)\nd is the dimension of the Gaussian distribution. Mixture of two Gaussian q1 and q2 with the equal mixing ratio (i.e., 1:1) is q1/2 + q2/2. The derivation of the MoG is as follows:\n∂(q1/2 + q2/2) ∂θ = −q1 2 (Σ−11 (θ − µ1))− q2 2 (Σ−12 (θ − µ2)) = 0 (20)\nIf we set Equation 20 to 0, to find all critical points, the following equation holds:\nθ = (q1Σ −1 1 + q2Σ −1 2 ) −1(q1Σ −1 1 µ1 + q2Σ −1 2 µ2) (21)\nWhen set α to q2q1+q2 , Equation 17 holds.\nFor MoG with two components in d dimension, the number of modes can be at most d+ 1 (Ray & Ren, 2012). Therefore, it is hard to find all mode in high-dimensional Gaussian in general.\nThe property of critical points of a MoG with two components can be extended to the case of k components. The following equation holds:\nθ = ( k∑ i=1 αiΣ −1 i ) −1( k∑ i=1 αiΣ −1 i µi), (22)\nwhere 0 < αi < 1 for all i and ∑ i αi = 1. There is no tight upper bound on the number of modes of MoG in general. There is a guess that, for all d, k ≥ 1, the upper bound is d+ k − 1 choose d (Améndola et al., 2017)."

To resolve this problem, we propose the incremental moment matching (IMM), which uses the Bayesian neural network framework. IMM assumes that the posterior distribution of parameters of neural networks is approximated with Gaussian distribution and incrementally matches the moment of the posteriors, which are trained for the first and second task, respectively. To make our Gaussian assumption reasonable, the IMM procedure utilizes various transfer learning techniques including weight transfer, L2-norm of old and new parameters, and a newly proposed variant of dropout using old parameters. We analyze our methods on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and then evaluate them on a real-world life-log dataset collected using Google Glass. Experimental results show that IMM produces state-of-the-art performance in a variety of datasets.",
