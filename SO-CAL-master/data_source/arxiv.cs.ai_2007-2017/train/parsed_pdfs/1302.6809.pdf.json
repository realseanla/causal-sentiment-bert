    "abstractText" : "Testing the validity of probabilistic models containing unmeasured (hidden) variables is shown to be a hard task. We show that the task of testing whether models are struc­ turally incompatible with the data at hand, requires an exponential number of indepen­ dence evaluations, each of the form: \"X is conditionally independent of Y, given Z .\" In contrast, a linear number of such evaluations is required to test a standard Bayesian net­ work (one per vertex). On the positive side, we show that if a network with hidden vari­ ables G has a tree skeleton, checking whether G represents a given probability model P requires the polynomial number of such in­ dependence evaluations. Moreover, we pro­ vide an algorithm that efficiently constructs a tree-structured Bayesian network (with hid­ den variables) that represents P if such a net­ work exists, and further recognizes when such a network does not exist.",
