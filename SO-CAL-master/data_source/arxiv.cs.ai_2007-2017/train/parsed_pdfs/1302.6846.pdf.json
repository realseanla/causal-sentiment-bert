    "abstractText" : "Model-based diagnosis reasons backwards from a functional schematic of a system to isolate faults given observations of anoma­ lous behavior. We develop a fully proba­ bilistic approach to model based diagno­ sis and extend it to support hierarchical models. Our scheme translates the func­ tional schematic into a Bayesian network and diagnostic inference takes place in the Bayesian network. A Bayesian network diagnostic inference algorithm is modified to take advantage of the hierarchy to give computational gains.",
