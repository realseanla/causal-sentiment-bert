      "text" : "Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is a challenging issue of urban development in developing countries. Each country having different socio-economic-environmental background, might not accept a particular disposal method as the optimal choice. Selection of suitable disposal method in MSWM, under vague and imprecise information can be considered as multi criteria decision making problem (MCDM). In the present paper, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methodology is extended based on credibility theory for evaluating the performances of MSW disposal methods under some criteria fixed by experts. The proposed model helps decision makers to choose a preferable alternative for their municipal area. A sensitivity analysis by our proposed model confirms this fact.\nKeywords: Waste Disposal; Multiple criteria decision making (MCDM); TOPSIS; Fuzzy Numbers; Credibility theory."

      "text" : "Municipality local body officials or a civic agency plays a vital role in municipal solid waste management (MSWM) since it’s become a major issue of urban development. Solid waste disposal and its proper management problem concern about the social, economic, environmental, technical, political factors of a municipality. Due to inadequate consciousness among citizens, local body officials often struggle to make consensus with them in selecting the site for solid waste facility and the method that is to be adopted in the waste disposal Khan et al., 2008. These factors are conflicting in nature. For example, we need to maximize technical reliability, feasibility while net cost per ton, air pollution and emission levels are of minimizing criteria. Many factors (population growth, competitive economy, urbanization and the rise in community living standards) have\ncaused exponential generation rate of municipal solid waste in developing countries Minghua et al., 2009. Mismanagement of municipal solid waste can cause adverse environmental impacts, public health risk and other socio-economic problem Gupta et al., 2015. A long term deficient disposal of municipal solid waste will cause poverty, poor governance and standards of living, major health, environmental and social issues Ogu, 2000. Thus, selection of disposal methods for municipal solid waste is complex decision making problem. This kind of decision making problems are generally ill-structured and often behavioral decision approach. Researchers have shown that human intelligence is typically quite ineffective at solving such problems Promentilla et al., 2006. Decision support tools (DST) such as multi-criteria decision making (MCDM), in this context, have been acknowledged as a key player in MSWM, Charnpratheep et al., 1997; Hung et al., 2007. Moreover, the DST makes an easier communication among decision makers and stakeholders to produce a systematic, transparent, and documented process in decision making.\nIn this context, MCDM has become a very crucial are approval of management research and decision theory with many methods developed, extended and modified in solving problems in the present and past few decades. Some of them are namely, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) Hwang and Yoon, 1981, MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison) Pamucar and Cirovic, 2015, AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) Saaty, 1977; 1990, ANP (Analytic Network Process) Saaty, 1996; Chatterjee et al., 2015, ELECTRE (ELiminationEt Choice Translating REality) Roy, 1968, DRSA (Dominance based Rough Set Approach) Greco et al., 2001, VIKOR (VIsekriterijumska optimizacija KOmpromisno Resenje) Opricovic, 1998, DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) Charnes et al., 1978.\nEarlier researchers dealt with precise and certain information based MCDM methods. Khoo et al., 1999 pointed out that decision support is based on human knowledge about a specific part of a real or abstract world. If the knowledge is gained by experience, the decision can be induced from empirical data. The data and information in decision making are usually imprecise based on experts’ subjective judgment where a group of experts is invited to implement the final performance evaluation, ranging from individual judgments to aggregate and rank the alternatives. Many theories, such as, fuzzy sets theory Zadeh, 1965, Dempster–Shafer theory of evidence Shafer, 1976, grey theory Julong, 1989, rough set theory Pawlak, 1982, have been developed to\ndeal with imprecise data, human subjective judgment, and real life uncertainty. Suitable techniques and algorithms are proposed based on these theories.\nThe TOPSIS method is widely used in MCDM due to its simple computation. It is based on the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive-ideal solution (PIS) and longest distance from the negative-ideal solution (NIS) Torlak et al. 2010. TOPSIS defines an index called similarity to the positive-ideal solution and remoteness from the negative-ideal solution. An alternative with maximum similarity to the positive-ideal solution is preferred to be chosen Wang and Chang, 2007. Many extensions of TOPSIS model were developed by Jahanshahloo et al., 2006; Chen and Tsao, 2008; Chatterjee and Kar, 2016, and so on. Ye and Li 2014, introduced the concept of Markowitz’s portfolio mean–variance methodology into the traditional TOPSIS methods with fuzzy numbers, and proposed an extended fuzzy TOPSIS method by utilizing the Possibility theory. But a fuzzy event may fail even though its possibility achieves 1, and may hold even though its necessity is 0. On the other hand, the fuzzy event must hold if its credibility is 1, and fail if its credibility is 0. Thus, there is a disadvantage of using possibility of a fuzzy event Liu, 2004. So, to make more accurate decisions under fuzzy environment credibility of a fuzzy event is more preferred than possibility of it. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work on TOPSIS which uses credibility theory in literature.\nWith these considerations, the paper proposes credibilistic TOPSIS, a novel MCDM model, to assist decision makers for evaluation and selection of the suitable disposal methods for municipal solid waste in urban areas in a country.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic concepts on the fuzzy numbers, and credibility of fuzzy variables. Section 3 presents the proposed credibilistic TOPSIS model based on fuzzy variables. The implementation of the proposed model for evaluating the municipal solid waste disposal methods is provided in section 4. Result discussion is given in section 5. Finally, section 6 concludes the paper.\n2. Preliminaries"

      "text" : "5.1 Comparison with other Models In order to verify the validity of our proposed method, we perform a comparison of our proposed method with two other previous methods including fuzzy TOPSIS Chen et al., 2006 and possibilistic TOPSIS Ye and Li, 2014 which also deal with fuzzy numbers. The results are shown as follows:\n<Table 15 about here>\nIt is clear from Table 15 that the three methods have the similar results. Note that \uD835\uDC68\uD835\uDFD1 is best alternative according to all three models under fixed preference of criteria weights. These shows the method we proposed in this paper is reasonable.\n5.2 Sensitivity Analysis Pamučar et al. 2015 pointed that MCDM method depend to a great extent on the values of the weight coefficients of the criteria, that is, on the relative importance attached to specific criteria. Sometimes, the final selections change when there is a very slight change in the weight coefficients of the criteria, because of which, the results of MCDM methods should as a rule be followed by an analysis of their sensitivity to these changes. In this research work, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess how changes in the weights assigned to the criteria would change the ranking of the alternatives. Different weight priorities are given to the criteria (see Table 16) corresponding to different scenarios (1)-(6).\n<Table 16 about here>\nThe resulting rankings are given in Table 17. The results show that assigning different weights (priorities) to the criteria leads to different rankings, i.e., the proposed model is sensitive to these weights, which is necessary for any MCDM models. On comparison of all scenarios we find \uD835\uDC68\uD835\uDFD1 is best choice except in scenario 5. However, scenario\n<Fig. 2 about here>\n1 and scenario 4 provide same ranking order though weight priorities have large change. From scenario (2) and (3), it is clear that a slight change in criteria weights will lead to alter \uD835\uDC68\uD835\uDFD0 and \uD835\uDC68\uD835\uDFD1 as second best choice. Similar arguments could be done for other pairwise comparisons among the scenarios. These comparisons confirms that using different weights to the criteria under consideration may help to choose the best design alternative in different context if needed.\n<Table 17 about here>"

      "heading" : "6. Conclusion",
      "text" : "This study proposes the credibilistic TOPSIS model based on expected value (Credibilistic mean value) operator for a fuzzy variable to facilitate a more precise analysis of the alternatives, considering several criteria in imprecise environment. The proposed method is applied successfully to select the most preferable disposal method(s) for municipal solid waste for imprecise data. Also, this model provides the expected optimal choice for disposal method(s) after effectively avoiding vague and ambiguous judgments. In many practical MCDM problems different relative weights of criteria must be taken into consideration since these are influenced by the socio-economic-environmental-technical condition of a country (for municipal solid waste disposal). So, a particular disposal method might not be accepted as optimal solution to all countries. It is evident that the sensitivity analysis performed (Table 16 & 17) through the proposed model shows that \uD835\uDC68\uD835\uDFD1 is not the optimal choice in all cases (scenario 4 & 5). In future, credibilistic TOPSIS would produce interesting hybrid MCDM methods with the combination of other MCDM techniques like, ANP, DEMATEL and Shannon Entropy etc.\nReferences:\n1.

Each country having different socio-economic-environmental background, might not accept a particular disposal method as the optimal choice. Selection of suitable disposal method in MSWM, under vague and imprecise information can be considered as multi criteria decision making problem (MCDM). In the present paper, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methodology is extended based on credibility theory for evaluating the performances of MSW disposal methods under some criteria fixed by experts. The proposed model helps decision makers to choose a preferable alternative for their municipal area. A sensitivity analysis by our proposed model confirms this fact.",
