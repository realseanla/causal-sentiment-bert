      "text" : "Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents aim to maximise collected rewards by interacting over a certain period of time in initially unknown environments. Actions that yield the highest performance according to the current knowledge of the environment and those that maximise the gathering of new knowledge on the environment may not be the same. This is the dilemma known as Exploration/Exploitation (E/E). In such a context, using prior knowledge of the environment is extremely valuable, since it can help guide the decision-\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n04 06\n4v 1\n[ cs\nmaking process in order to reduce the time spent on exploration. Model-based Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) (Dearden et al. (1999); Strens (2000)) specifically targets RL problems for which such a prior knowledge is encoded in the form of a probability distribution (the “prior”) over possible models of the environment. As the agent interacts with the actual model, this probability distribution is updated according to the Bayes rule into what is known as “posterior distribution”. The BRL process may be divided into two learning phases: the offline learning phase refers to the phase when the prior knowledge is used to warm-up the agent for its future interactions with the real model. The online learning phase, on the other hand, refers to the actual interactions between the agent and the model. In many applications, interacting with the actual environment may be very costly (e.g. medical experiments). In such cases, the experiments made during the online learning phase are likely to be much more expensive than those performed during the offline learning phase.\nIn this paper, we investigate how the way BRL algorithms use the offline learning phase may impact online performances. To properly compare Bayesian algorithms, the first comprehensive BRL benchmarking protocol is designed, following the foundations of Castronovo et al. (2014). “Comprehensive BRL benchmark” refers to a tool which assesses the performance of BRL algorithms over a large set of problems that are actually drawn according to a prior distribution. In previous papers addressing BRL, authors usually validate their algorithm by testing it on a few test problems, defined by a small set of predefined MDPs. For instance, BAMCP (Guez et al. (2012)), SBOSS (Castro and Precup (2010)), and BFS3 (Asmuth and Littman (2011)) are all validated on a fixed number of MDPs. In their validation process, the authors select a few BRL tasks, for which they choose one arbitrary transition function, which defines the corresponding MDP. Then, they define one prior distribution compliant with the transition function. This type of benchmarking is problematic in the sense that the authors actually know the hidden transition function of each test case. It also creates an implicit incentive to over-fit their approach to a few specific transition functions, which should be completely unknown before interacting with the model. In this paper, we compare BRL algorithms in several different tasks. In each task, the real transition function is defined using a random distribution, instead of being arbitrarily fixed. Each algorithm is thus tested on an infinitely large number of MDPs, for each test case. To perform our experiments, we developed the BBRL library, whose objective is to also provide other researchers with our benchmarking tool.\nThis paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the problem statement. Section 3 formally defines the experimental protocol designed for this paper. Section 4 briefly presents the library. Section 5 shows a detailed application of our protocol, comparing several wellknow BRL algorithms on three different benchmarks. Section 6 concludes the study."

      "text" : "Most BRL algorithms rely on some properties which, given sufficient computation time, ensure that their agents will converge to an optimal behaviour. However, it is not clear to know beforehand whether an algorithm will satisfy fixed computation time constraints while providing good performances.\nThe parameterisation of the algorithms makes the selection even more complex. Most BRL algorithms depend on parameters (number of transitions simulated at each iteration, etc.) which, in some way, can affect the computation time. In addition, for one given algorithm and fixed parameters, the computation time often varies from one simulation to another. These features make it nearly impossible to compare BRL algorithms under strict computation time constraints. In this paper, to address this problem, algorithms are run with multiple choices of parameters, and we analyse their time performance a posteriori.\nFurthermore, a distinction between the offline and online computation time is made. Offline computation time corresponds to the moment when the agent is able to exploit its prior knowledge, but cannot interact with the MDP yet. One can see it as the time given to take the first decision. In most algorithms concerned in this paper, this phase is generally used to initialise some data structure. On the other hand, online computation time corresponds to the time consumed by an algorithm for taking each decision.\nThere are many ways to characterise algorithms based on their computation time. One can compare them based on the average time needed per step or on the offline computation time alone. To remain flexible, for each run of each algorithm, we store its computation times (Bi)−1≤i, with i indexing the time step, and B−1 the offline learning time. Then a feature function φ((Bi)−1≤i) is extracted from this data. This function is used as a metric to characterise and discriminate algorithms based on their time requirements.\nIn our protocol, which is detailed in the next section, two types of characterisation are used. For a set of experiments, algorithms are classified based on their offline computation time only, i.e. we use φ((Bi)−1≤i) = B−1. Afterwards, the constraint is defined as φ((Bi)−1≤i) ≤ K, K > 0 in case it is required to only compare the algorithms that have an offline computation time lower than K.\nFor another set of experiments, algorithms are separated according to their empirical average online computation time. In this case, φ((Bi)−1≤i) = 1 n ∑ 0≤i<nBi. Algorithms can then be classified based on whether or not they respect the constraint φ((Bi)−1≤i) ≤ K, K > 0.\nThis formalisation could be used for any other computation time characterisation. For example, one could want to analyse algorithms based on the longest computation time of a trajectory, and define φ((Bi)−1≤i) = max−1≤iBi."

      "text" : "In this paper, a real Bayesian evaluation is proposed, in the sense that the different algorithms are compared on a large set of problems drawn according to a test probability distribution. This is in contrast with the Bayesian literature (Guez et al. (2012); Castro and Precup (2010); Asmuth and Littman (2011)), where authors pick a fixed number of MDPs on which they evaluate their algorithm.\nOur criterion to compare algorithms is to measure their average rewards against a given random distribution of MDPs, using another distribution of MDPs as a prior knowledge. In our experimental protocol, an experiment is defined by a prior distribution p0M(·) and a test distribution pM(·). Both are random distributions over the set of possible MDPs, not stochastic transition functions. To illustrate the difference, let us take an example. Let\n(x, u, x′) be a transition. Given a transition function f : X × U ×X → [0; 1], f(x, u, x′) is the probability of observing x′ if we chose u in x. In this paper, this function f is assumed to be the only unknown part of the MDP that the agent faces. Given a certain test case, f corresponds to a unique MDP M ∈ M. A Bayesian learning problem is then defined by a probability distribution over a set M of possible MDPs. We call it a test distribution, and denote it pM(·). Prior knowledge can then be encoded as another distribution overM, and denoted p0M(·). We call “accurate” a prior which is identical to the test distribution (p0M(·) = pM(·)), and we call “inaccurate” a prior which is different (p0M(·) 6= pM(·)).\nIn previous Bayesian literature, authors select a fixed number of MDPs M1, ...,Mn, train and test their algorithm on them. Doing so does not guarantee any generalisation capabilities. To solve this problem, a protocol that allows rigorous comparison of BRL algorithms is designed. Training and test data are separated, and can even be generated from different distributions (in what we call the inaccurate case).\nMore precisely, our protocol can be described as follows: Each algorithm is first trained on the prior distribution. Then, their performances are evaluated by estimating the expectation of the discounted sum of rewards, when they are facing MDPs drawn from the test distribution. Let J π(p0M) pM be this value:\nJ π(p0M) pM = E\nM∼pM\n[ J π(p0M) M ] ,\nwhere π(p0M) is the algorithm π trained offline on p 0 M. In our Bayesian RL setting, we want to find the algorithm π∗ which maximises J π(p0M) pM for the 〈p0M, pM〉 experiment:\nπ∗ ∈ arg max π J π(p0M) pM .\nIn addition to the performance criterion, we also measure the empirical computation time. In practice, all problems are subject to time constraints. Hence, it is important to take this parameter into account when comparing different algorithms."

      "heading" : "3.2 The experimental protocol",
      "text" : "In practice, we can only sample a finite number of trajectories, and must rely on estimators to compare algorithms. In this section our experimental protocol is described, which is based on our comparison criterion for BRL and provides a detailed computation time analysis.\nAn experiment is defined by (i) a prior distribution p0M and (ii) a test distribution pM. Given these, an agent is evaluated π as follows:\n1. Train π offline on p0M.\n2. Sample N MDPs from the test distribution pM.\n3. For each sampled MDP M , compute estimate J̄ π(p0M) M of J π(p0M) M .\n4. Use these values to compute an estimate J̄ π(p0M) pM .\nTo estimate J π(p0M) M , the expected return of agent π trained offline on p 0 M, one trajectory\nis sampled on the MDP M , and the cumulated return is computed J̄ π(p0M) Mi = Rπ(p 0 M)\nM (x0). To estimate this return, each trajectory is truncated after T steps. Therefore, given an\nMDP M and its initial state x0, we observe R̄ π(p0M) M (x0), an approximation of R π(p0M) M (x0):\nR̄π(p 0 M) M (x0) = T∑ t=0 γtrt.\nIf Rmax denotes the maximal instantaneous reward an agent can receive when interacting with an MDP drawn from pM, then choosing T as guarantees the approximation error is bounded by > 0:\nT =\n⌊ log( × (1−γ)Rmax )\nlog γ\n⌋ .\n= 0.01 is set for all experiments, as a compromise between measurement accuracy and computation time.\nFinally, to estimate our comparison criterion J π(p0M) pM , the empirical average of the algo-\nrithm performance is computed over N different MDPs, sampled from pM :\nJ̄ π(p0M) pM = 1\nN ∑ 0≤i<N J̄ π(p0M) Mi = 1 N ∑ 0≤i<N R̄π(p 0 M) Mi (x0) (1)\nFor each agent π, we retrieve µπ = J̄ π M and σπ, the empirical mean and standard deviation of the results observed respectively. This gives us the following statistical confidence interval at 95% for JπM :\nJπM ∈ [ J̄πM −\n2σπ N ; J̄πM + 2σπ N\n] .\nThe values reported in the following figures and tables are estimations of the interval within which JπM is, with probability 0.95.\nAs introduced in Section 2.3, in our methodology, a function φ of computation times is used to classify algorithms based on their time performance. The choice of φ depends on the type of time constraints that are the most important to the user. In this paper, we reflect this by showing three different ways to choose φ. These three choices lead to three different ways to look at the results and compare algorithms. The first one is to classify algorithms based on their offline computation time, the second one is to classify them based on the algorithms average online computation time. The third is a combination of the first two choices of φ, that we denote φoff ((Bi)−1≤i) = B−1 and φon((Bi)−1≤i) = 1 n ∑ 0≤i<nBi. The objective is that for each pair of constraints φoff ((Bi)−1≤i) < K1 and φon((Bi)−1≤i) < K2, K1,K2 > 0, we want to identify the best algorithms that respect these constraints. In order to achieve this: (i) All agents that do not satisfy the constraints are discarded; (ii) for each algorithm, the agent leading to the best performance in average is selected; (iii) we build the list of agents whose performances are not significantly different1.\n1. A paired sampled Z-test with a confidence level of 95% has been used to determine when two agents are statistically equivalent (more details in Appendix C).\nThe results will help us to identify, for each experiment, the most suitable algorithm(s) depending on the constraints the agents must satisfy. This protocol is an extension of the one presented in Castronovo et al. (2014)."

A point of the space corresponds to set of bounds. An algorithm is associated to a point of the space if its best agent, satisfying the constraints, is among the best ones when compared to the others;\n• A table reporting the results of each agent.\nBBRL will also produce a report file in LATEX gathering the 3 graphs and the table for each experiment.\nMore than 2.000 commands have to be entered in order to reproduce the results of this paper. We decided to provide several Lua script in order to simplify the process. By completing some configuration files, the user can define the agents, the possible values of their parameters and the experiments to conduct.\nThose configuration files are then used by a script called make_scripts.sh, included within the library, whose purpose is to generate four other scripts:\n• 0-init.sh Create the experiment files, and create the formulas sets required by OPPS agents.\n• 1-ol.sh Create the agents and train them on the prior distribution(s).\n• 2-re.sh Run all the experiments.\n• 3-export.sh Generate the LATEX reports.\nDue to the high computation power required, we made those scripts compatible with workload managers such as SLURM. In this case, each cluster should provide the same amount of CPU power in order to get consistent time measurements. To sum up, when the configuration files are completed correctly, one can start the whole process by executing the four scripts, and retrieve the results in nice LATEX reports.\nIt is worth noting that there is no computation budget given to the agents. This is due to the diversity of the algorithms implemented. No algorithm is “anytime” natively, in the sense that we cannot stop the computation at any time and receive an answer from the agent instantly. Strictly speaking, it is possible to develop an anytime version of some of the algorithms considered in BBRL. However, we made the choice to stay as close as possible to the original algorithms proposed in their respective papers for reasons of fairness. In consequence, although computation time is a central parameter in our problem statement, it is never explicitly given to the agents. We instead let each agent run as long as necessary and analyse the time elapsed afterwards.\nAnother point which needs to be discussed is the impact of the implementation of an algorithm on the comparison results. For each algorithm, many implementations are possible, some being better than others. Even though we did our best to provide the best possible implementations, BBRL does not compare algorithms but rather the implementations of each algorithms. Note that this issue mainly concerns small problems, since the complexity of the algorithms is preserved."

This, in turn, impacts the computation time requirement at each step. Hence, for some algorithms, no choice of parameters can bring the computation time below or over certain values. In other words, each algorithm has its own range of computation time. Note that, for some methods, the computation time is influenced concurrently by several parameters. We present a qualitative description of how computation time varies as a function of parameters in Table 1.\n4. If a random decision is chosen, the model is not solved. 5.

For each < state, action > pair < x, u >, we define a Dirichlet distribution, which represents the uncertainty about the transitions occurring from < x, u >. A Dirichlet distribution is parameterised by a set of concentration parameters α (1) <x,u>, · · · , α (nX) <x,u>.\nWe gathered all concentration parameters in a single vector θ. Consequently, our MDP distributions are parameterised by ρM (the reward function) and several Dirichlet distributions, parameterised by θ. Such a distribution is denoted by pρM ,θ(·). In the Bayesian Reinforcement Learning community, these distributions are referred to as Flat Dirichlet Multinomial distributions (FDMs).\nWe chose to study two different cases:\n• Accurate case: the test distribution is fully known (p0M(.) = pM(.)),\n• Inaccurate case: the test distribution is unknown (p0M(.) 6= pM(.)).\nIn the inaccurate case, we have no assumption on the transition matrix. We represented this lack of knowledge by a uniform FDM distribution, where each transition has been observed one single time (θ = [1, · · · , 1]).\nSections 5.2.1, 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 describes the three distributions considered for this study."

      "text" : "5.3.1 Accurate case\nAs it can be seen in Figure 6, OPPS is the only algorithm whose offline time cost varies. In the three different settings, OPPS can be launched after a few seconds, but behaves very poorly. However, its performances increased very quickly when given at least one minute of computation time. Algorithms that do not use offline computation time have a wide range of different scores. This variance represents the different possible configurations for these algorithms, which only lead to different online computation time.\nOn Figure 7, BAMCP, BFS3 and SBOSS have variable online time costs. BAMCP behaved poorly on the first experiment, but obtained the best score on the second one and was pretty efficient on the last one. BFS3 was good only on the second experiment. SBOSS was never able to get a good score in any cases. Note that OPPS online time cost varies slightly depending on the formula’s complexity.\nIf we take a look at the top-right point in Figure 8, which defines the less restrictive bounds, we notice that OPPS-DS and BEB were always the best algorithms in every experiment. -Greedy was a good candidate in the two first experiments. BAMCP was also a very good choice except for the first experiment. On the contrary, BFS3 and SBOSS were only good choices in the first experiment.\nIf we look closely, we can notice that OPPS-DS was always one of the best algorithm since we have met its minimal offline computation time requirements.\nMoreover, when we place our offline-time bound right under OPPS-DS minimal offline time cost, we can see how the top is affected from left to right:\nGC: (Random), (SBOSS), (BEB, -Greedy), (BEB, BFS3, -Greedy),\nGDL: (Random), (Random, SBOSS), ( -Greedy), (BEB, -Greedy),\n(BAMCP, BEB, -Greedy),\nGrid: (Random), (SBOSS), ( -Greedy), (BEB, -Greedy).\nWe can clearly see that SBOSS was the first algorithm to appear on the top, with a very small online computation cost, followed by -Greedy and BEB. Beyond a certain online time bound, BFS3 emerged in the first experiment while BAMCP emerged in the second experiment. Neither of them was able to compete with BEB or -Greedy in the last experiment.\nSoft-max was never able to reach the top regardless the configuration. Figure 9 reports the best score observed for each algorithm, disassociated from any time measure. Note that the variance is very similar for all algorithms in GDL and Grid experiments. On the contrary, the variance oscillates between 1.0 and 2.0. However, OPPS seems to be the less stable algorithm in the three cases.\n5.3.2 Inaccurate case\nAs seen in the accurate case, Figure 10 also shows impressive performances for OPPSDS, which has beaten all other algorithms in every experiment. We can also notice that, as observed in the accurate case, in the Grid experiment, the OPPS-DS agents scores are very close. However, only a few were able to significantly surpass the others, contrary to the accurate case where most OPPS-DS agents were very good candidates.\nSurprisingly, SBOSS was a very good alternative to BAMCP and BFS3 in the two first experiments as shown in Figure 11. It was able to surpass both algorithms on the first one while being very close to BAMCP performances in the second. Relative performances of BAMCP and BFS3 remained the same in the inaccurate case, even if the BAMCP advantage is less visible in the second experiment. BEB was no longer able to compete with OPPS-DS and was even beaten by BAMCP and BFS3 in the last experiment. -Greedy was still a decent choice except in the first experiment. As observed in the accurate case, Soft-max was very bad in every case.\nIn Figure 12, if we take a look at the top-right point, we can see OPPS-DS is the best choice in the second and third experiment. BEB, SBOSS and -Greedy share the first place with OPPS-DS in the first one.\nIf we place our offline-time bound right under OPPS-DS minimal offline time cost, we can see how the top is affected from left to right:\nGC: (Random), (Random, SBOSS), (SBOSS), (BEB, SBOSS, -Greedy),\n(BEB, BFS3, SBOSS, -Greedy),\nGDL: (Random), (Random, SBOSS), (BAMCP, Random, SBOSS),\n(BEB, SBOSS, -Greedy), (BEB, BFS3, SBOSS, -Greedy),\n(BAMCP, BEB, BFS3, SBOSS, -Greedy),\nGrid: (Random), (Random, SBOSS), (BAMCP, BEB, BFS3, Random, SBOSS),\n( -Greedy).\nSBOSS is again the first algorithm to appear in the rankings. -Greedy is the only one which could reach the top in every case, even when facing BAMCP and BFS3 fed with high online computation cost. BEB no longer appears to be undeniably better than the others. Besides, the two first experiments show that most algorithms obtained similar results, except for BAMCP which does not appear on the top in the first experiment. In the last experiment, -Greedy succeeded to beat all other algorithms.\nFigure 13 does not bring us more information than those we observed in the accurate case."

When the offline time budget was too constrained for OPPS-DS, different algorithms were suitable depending on the online time budget:\n• Low online time budget: SBOSS was the fastest algorithm to make better decisions than a random policy.\n• Medium online time budget8: BEB reached performances similar to OPPS-DS on each experiment.\n• High online time budget9: In the first experiment, BFS3 managed to catch up BEB and OPPS-DS when given sufficient time. In the second experiment, it was BAMCP which has achieved this result. Neither BFS3 nor BAMCP was able to compete with BEB and OPPS-DS in the last experiment.\nThe results obtained in the inaccurate case were very interesting. BEB was not as good as it seemed to be in the accurate case, while SBOSS improved significantly compared to the others. For its part, OPPS-DS obtained the best overall results in the inaccurate case by outperforming all the other algorithms in two out of three experiments while remaining among the best ones in the last experiment."

In particular, our benchmarking protocol shows that no single algorithm dominates all other algorithms on all scenarios. The protocol we introduced can compare any time algorithm to non-anytime algorithms while measuring the impact of inaccurate offline training. By comparing algorithms on large sets of problems, we avoid over fitting to a single problem. Our methodology is associated with an open-source library, BBRL, and we hope that it will help other researchers to design algorithms whose performances are put into perspective with computation times, that may be critical in many applications. This library is specifically designed to handle new algorithms easily, and is provided with a complete and comprehensive documentation website."

In consequence, State (5, 5) is not reachable.\nTo move inside the Grid, the agent can perform four actions: U = {up, down, left, right}. Those actions only move the agent to one adjacent cell. However, each action has a certain probability to fail (depending on the cell on which the agent is). In case of failure, the agent does not move at all. Besides, if the agent tries to move out of the grid, it will not move either. Discovering a reliable (and short) path to reach the G cell will determine the success of the agent.\nB.3.1 Formal description\nX = {1, 2, · · · , 25}, U = {up, down, left, right}\n∀(i, j) ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} × {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ∀(k, l) ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} × {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} :\nθGridn(i,j),u (n(i, j)) = 1, ∀u ∈ U\nθGridn(i,j),up (n(i− 1, j)) = 1, (i− 1) ≥ 1 θGridn(i,j),down (n(i+ 1, j)) = 1, (i+ 1) ≤ 5, (i, j) 6= (4, 5) θGridn(i,j),left (n(i, j − 1)) = 1, (j − 1) ≥ 1 θGridn(i,j),right (n(i, j + 1)) = 1, (j + 1) ≤ 5, (i, j) 6= (5, 4)\nθGridn(4,5),down(n(1, 1)) = 1 θGridn(5,4),right(n(1, 1)) = 1\nθGridn(i,j),u (n(k, l)) = 0, else\nρGrid((4, 5),down,(1, 1)) = 10.0\nρGrid((5, 4),right,(1, 1)) = 10.0\nρGrid((i, j), u, (k, l)) = 0.0, ∀u ∈ U\nAppendix C. Paired sampled Z-test\nLet πA and πB be the two agents we want to compare. We played the two agents on the same N MDPs, denoted by M1, · · · ,MN . Let RπAMi and R πB Mi\nbe the scores we observed for the two agents on Mi.\nStep 1 - Hypothesis\nWe compute the mean and the standard deviation of the differences between the two sample sets, denoted by x̄d and s̄d, respectively.\nx̄d = 1\nN N∑ i=1 RπAMi −R πB Mi\ns̄d = 1\nN N∑ i=1 (x̄d − (RπAMi −R πB Mi ))2\nIf N ≥ 30, s̄d is a good estimation of σd, the standard deviation of the differences between the two populations (s̄d ≈ σd). In order words, σd is the standard deviation we should observe when testing the two algorithms on a number of MDPs tending towards infinity. This was always the case in our experiments.\nWe now set Hypothesis H0 and Hypothesis Hα:\nH0 : µd = 0\nHα : µd > 0\nOur goal is to determine if µd, the mean of the differences between the two populations, is equal or greater than 0. More expressly, we want to know if the differences between the two agents’ performances is significant (Hα is correct) or not (H0 correct). Only one of those hypotheses can be true.\nStep 2 - Test statistic\nThe test statistic consists to compute a certain value Z:\nZ = x̄d\nσd\n/√ N\nThis value will help us to determine if we should accept (or reject) hypothesis Hα.\nStep 3 - Rejection region\nAssuming we want our decision to be correct with a probability of failure of α, we will have to compare Z with Zα, a value of a Gaussian curve. If Z > Zα, it means we are in the rejection region (R.R.) with a probability equal to 1− α. For a confidence of 95%, Zα should be equal to 1.645.\nBeing in the R.R. means we have to reject Hypothesis H0 (and accept Hypothesis Hα). In the order case, we have to accept Hypothesis H0 (and reject Hypothesis Hα).\nStep 4 - Decision\nAt this point, we have either accepted Hypothesis H0 or Hypothesis Hα.\n• Accepting Hypothesis H0 (Z < Zα): The two algorithms πA and πB are not significantly different.\n• Accepting Hypothesis Hα (Z ≥ Zα): The two algorithms πA and πB are significantly different. Therefore, the algorithm with the greatest mean is definitely better with 95% confidence."

The paper addresses this problem, and provides a new BRL comparison methodology along with the corresponding open source library. In this methodology, a comparison criterion that measures the performance of algorithms on large sets of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) drawn from some probability distributions is defined. In order to enable the comparison of non-anytime algorithms, our methodology also includes a detailed analysis of the computation time requirement of each algorithm. Our library is released with all source code and documentation: it includes three test problems, each of which has two different prior distributions, and seven state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Finally, our library is illustrated by comparing all the available algorithms and the results are discussed.",
