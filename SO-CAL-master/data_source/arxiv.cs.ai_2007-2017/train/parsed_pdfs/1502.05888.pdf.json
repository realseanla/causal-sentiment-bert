      "text" : "Judgment aggregation studies the problems related to aggregating a finite set of individual judgments, cast on a collection of logically interrelated issues called an agenda. Judgment aggregation can be seen as a generalisation of preference aggregation and voting. The formal connection between judgment aggregation and preference aggregation makes use of the preference agenda [5]: given a set of alternatives C, this agenda is composed of propositions of the form “x is preferred to y”, where x and y are alternatives in C; a profile corresponds to a set of individual judgments, whose consistency condition corresponds to the transitivity of the individual votes. This connection raises several natural questions:\n1. when can we say that a judgment aggregation rule is a generalisation of a voting rule?\n⋆ Gabriella Pigozzi and Srdjan Vesic benefited from the support of the project AMANDE ANR-13-BS02-0004 of the French National Research Agency (ANR).\n2. how can we lift properties from voting rules to judgment aggregation rules?\n3. how can we classify judgment aggregation rules with respect to the properties they satisfy?\nBefore considering these questions, certain observations regarding the judgment aggregation literature have to be made. This literature has focused considerably more on studying impossibility theorems, rather than on developing and studying specific aggregation rules, a field development approach that departs from the, admittedly much older, field of voting theory. Nevertheless, several recent, independent, works have started to explore the zoo of interesting, concrete judgment aggregation rules, beyond the well known premise-based and conclusion-based rules. Recall that the premise- and conclusion-based rules can only be applied if there exists a prior labelling of the agenda issues as premises and conclusions. The following rules are defined for any agenda: quota-based rules [6], distance-based rules [17,10,8], or rules that are based on the maximisation of some scoring function [19,18,13,4,25].\nSome of the newly proposed rules are defined by an obvious analogy with well-known voting rules. E.g., the so-called Young rule [13], that looks for a minimum number of agents to remove so that the resulting profile becomes majority-consistent, is the obvious counterpart of the Young voting rule. For a few other rules, the analogy remains clear, but the formal connection is less trivial to establish. The generalisation of scoring rules to judgment aggregation [4] falls in that category. For a few other rules, the analogy itself is not obvious.\nQuestions 1 and 2 are highly related and nontrivial. The answer primarily depends on whether the collective judgment set should be consistent with the transitivity constraint, or only with the constraint expressing the existence of a non-dominated alternative. Question 3 can be answered in a similar way as in voting theory. That is, voting rules can be classified according to the property they satisfy (such as Condorcet-consistency) or to their informational needs: for instance, so-called “C1” rules are voting rules for which knowing the pairwise majority relation between alternatives is enough to determine the winner(s); for “C2” rules, the information needed to determine the winner(s) is the number of voters who rank x ahead of y, for all pairs of alternatives x and y; for scoring rules, the information needed is the number of voters who rank alternative x in position k for all x and k; and so on. From the questions we outlined, the first and third question are evidently not such that can be fully addressed in a single paper.\nWe focus here on proposing the necessary formalisms for addressing these questions and we focus our efforts on one property, majority-preservation.Majoritypreservation is the natural generalisation to judgment aggregation of the arguably most important property in voting, Condorcet-consistency. While a voting rule is Condorcet-consistent if it outputs the Condorcet winner (and no other alternative) whenever there exists one, a judgment aggregation rule is majority-preserving if it outputs the majoritarian judgment set (determined by issue-wise majority) whenever it is consistent. In addition, we also generalise two\nalso important properties from voting to judgment aggregation: unanimity and monotonicity.\nWe follow earlier work in judgment aggregation [15] in using a constraintbased version of judgment aggregation to represent properties like transitivity of preferences. As it is common in voting theory, we use irresolute rules (also called ‘correspondences’) rather than functions, that is, a rule outputs a non-empty set of collective judgments. This represents, as common in voting, that there may be a tie between the collective judgments: an irresolute judgment aggregation rule is a function that given an agenda, a constraint, a number of voters, and for each voter an individual judgment (a subset of the agenda consistent with the constraint), gives a set of collective judgments (subsets of the agenda consistent with the constraint). We address the question of relations between voting and judgment aggregation rules in full detail: we define a formal way of mapping a judgment aggregation rule to two voting rules, obtained by requiring the collective judgment to be consistent with the transitivity constraint, or with the (weaker) existence of a non-dominated alternative. It is rather intriguing to see which pairs of well-known voting rules correspond to the same judgment aggregation rule. For instance, as we show, the Copeland rule comes together with the Slater rule, whereas the maximin rule comes together with the “ranked pairs” rule.\nThe last objective of the paper is to compare the majority-preserving judgment aggregation rules along several dimensions and criteria. As it is common in voting theory, we first compare the rules according to their discriminative power: for each pair of rules F and F ′, we identify whether the set of judgment sets resulting from the application of F is contained in the set of judgment sets resulting from the application of F ′, or vice versa, or if they are incomparable. We later consider whether they satisfy the rest of the unanimity and monotonicity properties.\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. The general definitions are given in Section 2. In Section 3 we review the rules we study in the paper and show that they are majority-preserving; we then address inclusion and non inclusion relationships between these rules and relate them to the existing literature; we also mention a few other rules which are not majority-preserving (and are thus excluded from our study). In Section 4 we formally relate judgment aggregation rules to voting rules, and identify the voting rules corresponding to each of the judgment rules studied. In Section 5 we study the rules from the point of view of two key properties (unanimity and monotonicity). We discuss further research in Section 6. Related work is discussed throughout the sections, where it best applies."

      "text" : "This section introduces the framework we use for judgement aggregation. Let L be a set of well formed propositional logic formulas, including ⊤ and ⊥, built from a set of propositional variables Lp using the standard connectives\n¬, ∧, ∨, → and ↔. A pre-agenda [A] ⊆ L is a set of formulas {ϕ1, . . . , ϕm} such that no ϕi ∈ [A] has the form ¬ψ for some ψ ∈ L (that is, no formula in [A] is a negation of a formula from L). The agenda A ⊆ L based on a pre-agenda [A] ⊆ L is defined as A = [A] ∪ {¬ϕ | ϕ ∈ [A]}. For ϕ ∈ A, we define ϕ = ¬ϕ if ϕ ∈ [A] and ϕ = ψ if there exists ψ ∈ [A] such that ϕ = ¬ψ.\nA constraint Γ ∈ L is a formula of L. We say that a set S is Γ -consistent if and only if S ∪ {Γ} is consistent. A set J ⊆ A is said to be complete if and only if for every ϕ ∈ [A] we have ϕ ∈ J or ¬ϕ ∈ J . J ⊆ A is incomplete if and only if it is not complete. J ⊆ A is a judgment set based on A and Γ , for short a (A, Γ )-judgment set, if and only if it is Γ -consistent and complete. We denote by D(A, Γ ) the set of all (A, Γ )-judgment sets.\nAn n-voter profile based on A and Γ is a collection of n (A, Γ )-judgment sets P = 〈J1, . . . , Jn〉, that is, Ji ∈ Dn(A, Γ ). Q is a sub-profile of P = 〈J1, . . . , Jn〉 if Q = 〈Ji | i ∈ I〉 for some nonempty subset I of {1, . . . , n}.\nFor two complete judgment sets A and B over the same agenda, the Hamming distance between A and B is defined as dH(A,B) = |A \\B| (= |B \\A|).\nFor I ⊆ A, we define CompA,Γ (I) as the set of all (A, Γ )-judgment sets containing I, i.e. CompA,Γ (I) = {J ∈ D(A, Γ ) | I ⊆ J}. For S = {I1, . . . , Ik} with I1 ⊆ A, . . . , Ik ⊆ A, we define CompA,Γ (S) = ∪I∈SCompA,Γ (I).\nN(P, ϕ) is the number of agents in P with judgment sets that contain ϕ, i.e. N(P, ϕ) = |{i | Ji ∈ P, ϕ ∈ Ji}|.\nExample 1. Consider the preagenda [A] = {p ∧ r, q, p ∧ q}. The corresponding agenda is A = {p ∧ r,¬(p ∧ r), q,¬q, p ∧ q,¬(p ∧ q)}. Let Γ = {q → r} be a constraint for A. The set D(A, Γ ) is\nD(A, Γ ) =\n{\n{¬(p ∧ r),¬q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {¬(p ∧ r), q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {(p ∧ r),¬q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {p ∧ r, q, p ∧ q}\n}\nAn example of P ∈ Dn(A, Γ ), where n = 3 is P = 〈{¬(p∧r), q,¬(p∧q)}, {¬(p∧ r), q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {(p ∧ r),¬q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {p ∧ r, q, p ∧ q}〉. Q = 〈{(p ∧ r),¬q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {p∧ r, q, p ∧ q}〉 is a subprofile of P . If S = {{¬(p∧ r),¬(p ∧ q)}, {p∧ r, q}} then CompA,Γ (S) = {{¬(p∧r), q,¬(p∧q)}, {¬(p∧r),¬q,¬(p∧q)}, {p∧r, q, p∧q}}. Finally, N(P, p ∧ q) = 1 and N(P,¬(p ∧ q)) = 3.\nMost often we will write profiles in a table, as the one given in Table 1, equivalent to the P we just stated, with the preagenda elements given in the topmost row and the name of the judgment sets in the leftmost column. If a judgment set contains a ϕ ∈ [A], then we mark this with a “+” in the table, while if a judgment set contains a ¬ϕ for a ϕ ∈ [A], we mark this with a “-” in the table. The constraint, unless ⊤, will be the denoted in the table caption.\nWe now define what we consider to be a judgment aggregation rule. We give the definition for a variable agenda and constraint, noting that judgement aggregation rules can also be defined for a specific agenda, constraint, but also number of voters.\nDefinition 1 (Judgment aggregation rule). An (irresolute) judgment aggregation rule, denoted by F , is a is a function that given a number of voters n\nand a n-voter judgment aggregation profile P = 〈J1, . . . , Jn〉, outputs a nonempty set of judgment sets based on A and Γ .\nLike in voting theory, resolute rules can be defined from irresolute ones by composing them with a tie-breaking mechanism. We do not pursue this direction here and consider irresolute rules throughout the paper.\nWe classify the judgment aggregation procedures by distinguishing between rules based on the majoritarian judgment set, rules based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set, and rules based on the removal or change of individual judgments. We give the necessary definitions for such classification.\nDefinition 2. The majoritarian judgment set associated with profile P = 〈J1, . . . , Jn〉 contains all elements of the agenda that are supported by a strict majority of judgment sets in P , i.e.,\nm(P ) = { ϕ ∈ A | N(P, ϕ) > n\n2\n}\nwhere N(P, ϕ) is the number of agents in P with judgment sets that contain ϕ, i.e. N(P, ϕ) = |{i | Ji ∈ P, ϕ ∈ Ji}|. A profile P based on A and Γ is majorityconsistent iff m(P ) is Γ -consistent5.\nRoughly, a judgment aggregation rule F is majority-preserving iff F returns only the majoritarian judgment set whenever it is consistent. However, there is one subtlety in the case of ties. For example, when we have agenda A = {p,¬p, q,¬q} and individual judgments J1 = {p, q} and J2 = {p,¬q}, then m(〈J1, J2〉) = {p}, which is shorthand for two collective judgments, namely {p,¬q} and {p, q}.\nExample 2. Consider again the profile from Example 1. We represent this profile in Table 1. m(P ) = {q,¬(p ∧ q)} is an incomplete subset of A, and we have CompA,Γ (m(P )) = {{p ∧ r, q,¬(p ∧ q)}, {¬(p ∧ r), q,¬(p ∧ q)}}.\nDefinition 3 (Majority-preserving). A judgment aggregation rule F is majoritypreserving iff for every agenda A, for every Γ ∈ L, for every majority-consistent profile P based on A and Γ , we have F (P ) = CompA,Γ (m(P ))."

Being based on the majoritarian judgment set means that for any P and Q such that m(P ) = m(Q) we have F (P ) = F (Q). Now we define several rules based on the majoritarian judgment set.\nDefinition 4. Given a set of formulae Σ ⊆ L and formula Γ ∈ L, S ⊆ Σ is a maximal Γ -consistent subset of Σ iff S is Γ -consistent and there exists no Γ -consistent set S′ such that S ⊂ S′ ⊆ Σ.\nA set S ⊆ Σ is a maxcard (for “maximal cardinality”) Γ -consistent subset of Σ iff S is Γ -consistent and there exists no Γ -consistent set S′ ⊆ Σ such that |S| < |S′|.\nmax(S, Γ,⊆) denotes the set of all maximal Γ -consistent subsets of S.max(S, Γ, |.|) denotes the set of all maxcard Γ -consistent subsets of S.\nDefinition 5 (Maximal and maxcard sub-agenda rules).

Note that for each ϕ ∈ m(P ), there exists at least one J ∈ msa(P ) such that ϕ ∈ J .\nExample 4. Consider the same agenda A and profile P as in Example 3. The maximal Γ -consistent subsets of m(P ) are {p ∧ r, p ∧ s, q, t}, {p ∧ r,¬(p ∧ q), t} and {q,¬(p ∧ q), t}; therefore\nmsaA,⊤(P ) =\n\n\n\n{p ∧ r, p ∧ s, q, p ∧ q, t}, {p ∧ r, p ∧ s, ¬q ¬(p ∧ q), t}, {¬(p ∧ r), ¬(p ∧ s), q, ¬(p ∧ q), t}\n\n\n\n.\nIntuitively, the mcsa rule operates by removing a minimal number of judgments (with respect to cardinality) from m(P ) so that a consistent set is obtained.

The rule mcsa coincides with the “Slater rule” [19], and with the EndpointdH rule [17].

      "heading" : "3.2 Rules based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set",
      "text" : "This family can be viewed as the judgment aggregation counterpart of voting rules that are based on the weighted pairwise majority graph, also known as C2 rules in Fishburn’s classification [1]. Rules of this family are sensitive to the number of agents who support a proposition, whereas rules based on the majoritarian judgment set did not distinguish between close and strong majorities. Formally, R is based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set if for any two profiles P and Q such that N(P, ϕ) = N(Q,ϕ) for all ϕ ∈ A, we have R(P ) = R(Q). Since m(P ) can be recovered from N(P, .), any rule based on the majoritarian judgment set is also based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set.\nThe first rule of this class we consider is the maxweight sub-agenda rule.\n6 There it is defined in a different way, using quantitative intuitions: given two (A, Γ )- judgment sets J and J ′ and a profile P , and letting J ∩ {ϕ,¬ϕ} = {ϕJ} and J\n′ ∩ {ϕ,¬ϕ} = {ϕJ′}, they say that J is more representative than judgment set J\n′ of P (denoted J P J\n′) if for any ϕ ∈ [A], it holds that N(ϕJ , P ) ≥ N(ϕJ′,P ) — in other terms, J receives at least as much support as J ′ on every issue. Then they define the Condorcet admissible set of profile P as the set of all (A, Γ )-judgment sets that are maximal with respect to P . 7 The original definition of Endpointd [17] was more general: it was introduced for an arbitrary distance d between judgment sets.\nDefinition 6 (Maxweight sub-agenda rule). The maxweight sub-agenda rule (mwa) is defined as follows: for every agenda A, for every Γ ∈ L, for every (A, Γ )-profile P ,\nmwaA,Γ (P ) = argmax J∈D(A,Γ )\nWP (J) where WP (J) = ∑\nϕ∈J\nN(P, ϕ).\nThe mwa rule appears in many places under different names: “Prototype” [17], “median rule” [19] and “simple scoring rule” [4]. It also appears under a different, but equivalent formulation, under the name “distance-based procedure” [10,17]. Variants of this rule were defined by Pigozzi [21] and before that by Konieczny and Pino-Pérez [12]. For completeness we give here this equivalent distance-based formulation. Given the Hamming distance dH between two judgment sets, the distance-based rule F dH ,Σ is defined as follows: for every agenda A, for every Γ ∈ L, for every (A, Γ )-profile P ,\nF dH ,ΣA,Γ (P ) = argmin J∈D(A,Γ )\n∑\nJi∈P\ndH(Ji, J).\nWe show that F dH ,Σ coincides with mwa. An independent proof that these two rules are equal can be found in the paper by Dietrich [4, Proposition 1].\nProposition 1. F dH ,Σ ≡ mwa.\nProof. Let A be an agenda, Γ ∈ L, J, J ′ ∈ D(A, Γ ) and ϕ ∈ A. Define h(ϕ, J, J ′) = 0 iff ϕ ∈ J ∩ J ′, and h(ϕ, J, J ′) = 1 otherwise.\nFor every n-voter (A, Γ )-profile, for every J ∈ D(A, Γ ), we have\n∑\nJi∈P\ndH(J, Ji) = ∑\nJi∈P\n∑\nϕ∈J\nh(ϕ, J, Ji) = ∑\nϕ∈J\n∑\nJi∈P\nh(ϕ, J, Ji) = ∑\nϕ∈J\n(n−N(P, ϕ))\n= |J | · n− ∑\nϕ∈J\nN(P, ϕ) = |J | · n−WP (J).\nFor every J ∈ D(A, Γ ), it holds that:\n1. J ∈ F dH ,ΣA,Γ (P ) if and only if J minimises ∑ Ji∈P dH(J, Ji) 2. J ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ) if and only if J maximises WP (J); i.e. if and only if J minimises |J | · n−WP (J)\nSince ∑\nJi∈P dH(J, Ji) = |J | · n−WP (J), we conclude that J ∈ F dH ,Σ A,Γ (P ) if\nand only if J ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ).\nExample 6. Consider the agenda and profile of Example 3. We obtain:\nN(P, p ∧ r) = 10, N(P,¬(p ∧ r)) = 7 N(P, p ∧ s) = 10, N(P,¬(p ∧ s)) = 7 N(P, q) = 13, N(P,¬q) = 4 N(P, p ∧ q) = 6, N(P,¬(p ∧ q)) = 11 N(P, t) = 10, N(P,¬t) = 7\nmwaA,⊤(P ) = {{p∧ r, p ∧ s, q, p ∧ q, t}}, due to the fact that WP ({p ∧ r, p ∧ s, q, p ∧ q, t}) = 49 is maximal with respect to all J ∈ D(A, Γ ).\nProposition 2. mwa is majority-preserving.\nProof. Let A be an agenda, Γ ∈ L and P an n-voter majority-consistent (A, Γ )- profile, We claim thatmwaA,Γ (P ) = CompA,Γ (m(P )). Note that J ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ) if and only if J is a judgment set maximising ∑\nϕ∈J N(P, ϕ). Let B = {ϕ ∈ [A] | ϕ /∈ m(P ) and ¬ϕ /∈ m(P )} and B′ = B ∪ {¬ϕ | ϕ ∈ B}. For every ϕ ∈ B′, we have N(P, ϕ) = n2 . Thus, whether ϕ or ϕ is in J is irrelevant for the score ∑\nϕ∈J N(P, ϕ). On the contrary, for every ϕ ∈ A \\ B ′, in order to\nmaximise ∑\nϕ∈J N(P, ϕ), J must contain ϕ if and only if ϕ ∈ m(P ). Hence, J ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ) if and only if J ∈ CompA,Γ (m(P )).\nThe following rule is inspired from the ranked pairs rules in voting theory [23]. It consists in first fixing the truth value for the elements of the agenda with the largest majority. It proceeds by considering the elements ϕ of the agenda in non-increasing order of N(P, ϕ) and fixing each agenda issue value to the majoritarian value if it does not lead to an inconsistency.\nDefinition 7 (Ranked agenda). Let A = {ψ, . . . , ψ2m} be an agenda, Γ ∈ L and let P be a (A, Γ )-profile. Let %P be the weak order on A defined by: for all ψ, ψ′ ∈ A, ψ %P ψ′ iff N(P, ψ) ≥ N(P, ψ′). For a permutation σ of {1, . . . , 2m}, let >σ be the linear order on A defined by ψσ(1) >σ . . . >σ ψσ(2m). We say that >σ is compatible with %P if ψσ(1) %P · · · %P ψσ(2m). The ranked agenda rule is defined as follows: J ∈ raA,Γ (P ) if and only if there exists a permutation σ such that >σ is compatible with %P and such that J = Jσ is obtained by the following procedure:\nS := ∅; for j = 1, . . . , 2m do if S ∪ {ψσ(j)} is Γ -consistent, then S := S ∪ {ψσ(j)} end for; Jσ := S.\nNote that ra is based on the weighted majoritarian judgment set.\nExample 7. Consider the profile of Example 3. We have q ≻P ¬(p ∧ q) ≻P p ∧ r ∼P p ∧ s ∼P t ≻P ¬(p ∧ r) ∼P ¬(p ∧ s) ∼P ¬t ≻P p∧ q ≻P ¬q (where ∼P and ≻P are respectively the indifference and the strict preference relations induced from %P ). We obtain\nraA,⊤(P ) = {{q,¬(p ∧ q), t,¬(p ∧ r),¬(p ∧ s)}}.\nNote that ra is well-defined in the sense that it outputs a set of (complete) judgment sets.\nProposition 3. ra is majority-preserving.\nProof. Let P be a majority-consistent profile based on A and Γ . We first show that raA,Γ (P ) ⊆ CompA,Γ (P ). Let >σ be a linear order on A induced by permutation σ and compatible with %P . Observe that in >σ, the elements of m(P ) are considered before the elements of A \\ m(P ). Therefore, when an element ϕ of m(P ) is considered, the current judgment set S is a subset of m(P ) and S ∪ {ϕ} ⊆ m(P ), therefore S ∪ {ϕ} is consistent, which implies that ϕ is incorporated into S. Since this is true for every ϕ ∈ A, we get that every element of raA,Γ (P ) contains m(P ).\nLet us now show that CompA,Γ (P ) ⊆ raA,Γ (P ). Let J ∈ CompA,Γ (m(P )). Take >σ such that all elements of m(P ) are considered first, then all elements of J \\m(P ), and then all elements of A \\ J . This order is compatible with %P , because if ϕ ∈ m(P ) then N(P, ϕ) > n2 , if ϕ ∈ J \\m(P ) then N(P, ϕ) = n 2 and if ϕ ∈ A \\ J then N(P, ϕ) ≤ n2 . Lastly, Jσ = J , which proves that J ∈ raA,Γ (P ).\nThe ra rule is new, but presents some similarity of the leximax rule in [18], which is in fact is a refinement of ra8 and which has been studied independently in [11]."

The difference between the original and changed profile is expressed in terms of some distance. Different rules will be obtained with different distance functions. This family of judgment aggregation rules can be viewed as the judgment aggregation counterpart of voting rules that are based on performing minimal operations on profiles with the purpose of obtaining a profile for which a Condorcet winner exists. In [9] these rules are said to be rationalizable by some distance with respect to the Condorcet consensus class.)\nThe first rule we consider is called the Young rule for judgment aggregation, by analogy with the Young rule in voting, which outputs the candidate x minimising the number of voters to remove from the profile so that x becomes a Condorcet winner.\nDefinition 8 (Young rule).

Or, equivalently, we maximize the number of voters we keep of a given profile. If the profile P is majority-consistent, then no voter needs to be removed and yA,Γ (P ) = CompA,Γ (m(P )), hence y is majority-preserving.\nExample 8. Once again we considerA and P from Example 3. We obtain yA,⊤(P ) = CompA,Γ ({q,¬(p ∧ q)}) =\n{\n{¬(p ∧ r), ¬(p ∧ s), q, ¬(p ∧ q), t}, {¬(p ∧ r), ¬(p ∧ s), q, ¬(p ∧ q), ¬t}\n}\n.\nThis result is obtained by removing 3 copies of J1 or (2 copies of J1 and one copy of J2) or (one copy of J1 and 2 copies of J2) or 3 copies of J2. Removing less judgment sets, or other 3 judgment sets, does not lead to a majority-consistent profile.\nThe last rule we define does not remove agenda elements and/or voters, but looks for a minimal number of atomic changes in the profile so that P becomes majority-consistent. We consider an atomic change to be the change of truth value of one element of the agenda in an individual judgment set. For instance, if J1 = {p, q, p ∧ q, r, p ∧ r}, then J ′1 = {¬p, q, ¬(p ∧ q), r,¬(p ∧ r)} is obtained from J1 by a series of three atomic changes (change in the truth value of p, of p ∧ q and of p ∧ r).\nReplacing having a Condorcet winner by being majority-consistent and adapting the notion of elementary change, we get our judgment aggregation rule that corresponds to the fulld rule by Miller and Osherson [17] for the choice of the Hamming distance.\nDefinition 9 (Minimal atomic change rule). Let A be an agenda, Γ ∈ L and let P = {J1, ..., Jn} and Q = {J ′1, ..., J ′ n} be two n-voter (A, Γ )-profiles. We define:\nDH(P,Q) =\nn ∑\ni=1\ndH(Ji, J ′ i).\nThe minimal atomic change rule is defined as:\nmnacA,Γ (P ) = CompA,Γ ({m(Q) | Q ∈ argmin Q′∈Dn(A,Γ )\nDH(P,Q ′)}).\nExample 9. Consider the same agenda A and profile P from Example 3 and let Γ = ⊤. Profile Q given in Table 3 is the closest majority-consistent profile to P with DH(P,Q) = 3. We obtain mnacA,ΓA,⊤(P ) = {{p ∧ r, p ∧ s, q, p ∧ q, t}}.\nIf P is majority-consistent then no elementary change is needed, therefore mnac is majority-preserving.\nWe now establish the (non)inclusion relationships between the rules.\nProposition 4. The inclusion and incomparability relations among the rules we introduced are as in Table 4: if F is the column rule and F ′ is the row rule, then\n– F ⊆ F ′ means that for every agenda A, for every Γ ∈ L, for every (A, Γ )- profile P , we have FA,Γ (P ) ⊆ FA,Γ (P ). – F inc F ′ means that neither F ⊆ F ′ nor F ′ ⊆ F – F ⊂ F ′ means that F ⊆ F ′ and F 6= F ′\nThe proof of this proposition can be found in Appendix."

      "text" : "The Duddy-Piggins judgment aggregation rule [8] is defined as follows: the geodesic graph GA associated with agenda A is the graph whose vertices are the consistent judgment sets over A, and containing edge (J, J ′) for all consistent J, J ′ such that there is no J” such that J∆J” ⊆ J∆J ′ (where ∆ denotes symmetric difference). The geodesic distance dg between consistent judgment\nsets is defined as the length of the shortest path in GA. The distance D(J, P ∗) between a consistent judgment set J∗ and a profile P is ΣJ∈Pdg(J ∗, J). Finally, FDP (P ) = argminJ∈D(A,Γ )D(J, P ). Note that the distance proposed by Duddy and Piggins [8] is also known as the geodesic metric [3, p.104].\nProposition 5. FDP is not majority-consistent.\nProof. Let P be the profile on Table 5.\nThere are eight judgment sets over A. Denote D(A,⊤) = {J1, . . . , J8}. We can verify that for every Ji, Jj ∈ D(A,⊤), if Ji 6= Jj then the geodesic distance between Ji and Jj is 1. Therefore, dg(J2, P ) = 8. Note that for all Ji ∈ {J1, J3, J4, J5}, dg(Ji, P ) = 9. Also, for all Ji ∈ {J6, J7, J8}, dg(Ji, P ) = 11. Therefore, FDP (P ) = {J2} whereas P is majority-consistent and m(P ) = {J1}.\nDietrich [4] defines a general class of scoring rules for judgment aggregation. Given a function s : A×D(A,⊤) → R, the rule SRs is defined as\nSRs(P ) = argmax J∈D(A,⊤)\n∑\nϕ∈J\nn ∑\ni=1\ns(Ji, ϕ)\nFive scoring functions are defined by Dietrich [4]: reversal scoring, entailment scoring, disjoint entailment scoring, minimal entailment scoring and irreducible entailment scoring. Each scoring function gives rise to a judgment aggregation rule and we can show, using counter examples, that none of these rules is majority-preserving.\nReversal scoring rev is defined as rev(J, ϕ) = minJ′∈D(A,⊤), ϕ/∈J′ dH(J, J ′).\nProposition 6. The rule SRrev is not majority-preserving.\nProof. Consider the preagenda [A] = {p, α, q}, where α ≡ (p∨r)∧(r∨q)∧(p∨q) and Γ = ⊤. The scores according to each of the judgment sets in D(A,⊤) are given in Table 6\nThe profile P given in Table 7 is majority-consistent, with m(P ) = {p, α, q}. However, SRrev(P ) = {{¬p, α, q}}.\nEntailment scoring ent, is defined as ent(J, ϕ) = |{S ⊆ J | S entails ϕ}|.\nProposition 7. SRent is not majority-preserving.\nProof. We consider again the same agenda as in the proof of Proposition 6. Table 8 gives the entailment scores for each judgment according to each of the judgment sets in D(A,⊤).\nThe entailment scoring rule is not majority-preserving. Consider the profile in Table 9. The profile is majority-consistent and m(P ) = {p, α, q}, however the entailment scoring rule selects the judgment set {¬p, α, q}.\nThe disjoint entailment scoring dis, minimal entailment scoring mie and irreducible entailment scoring irr9 are defined as follows.The function dis(J, ϕ) is the number of pairwise disjoint judgment subsets of J entailing ϕ. The function mie(J, ϕ) is defined as the number of judgment subsets of J which minimally entail ϕ. Lastly, irr(J, ϕ) is defined as the number of judgment subsets of J which irreducibly entail ϕ. More detailed explanations for each of these functions can be found in the original paper [4, p.15-17].\nProposition 8. SRdis, SRmie and SRirr are not majority-preserving.\nProof. The same counter example suffices for all three rules. Consider the same agenda and profile as in the proof of Proposition 7. The scores according to dis, mie and irr are the same and given below.\n9 all three our notation\np ¬p α ¬α q ¬q\n{p, α, q} 1 0 2 0 1 0 {p, α,¬q} 2 0 1 0 0 1 {p,¬α,¬q} 1 0 0 1 0 2\n{¬p, α, q} 0 1 1 0 2 0 {¬p,¬α, q} 0 2 0 1 1 0 {¬p,¬α,¬q} 0 1 0 2 0 1\nWe consider the same profile as in Figure 9. The disjoint entailment, minimal entailment and irreducible entailment scoring rules all select as collective the judgment set {¬p, α, q}."

      "heading" : "4 From Judgment Aggregation to Voting Rules",
      "text" : "Since preference aggregation can be recast as a specific case of judgment aggregation using the preference agenda [5], it is natural to expect that judgment aggregation rules can generalise voting rules. In this section we first define what it means for a judgment aggregation rule to generalise a voting rule and then we show that several well-known voting rules are recovered as particular cases of our judgment aggregation rules.\nIn this section, we assume that judgment profiles contain an odd number of individual judgments. The reason for this assumption is that this assumption makes the connections to voting rules more natural and easier to state.\nLet C = {x1, . . . , xq} be a set of alternatives. L(C) is the set of all strict linear orders (that is, transitive, asymmetric and connected relations) on C. For ≻∈ L(C) we denote the (singleton) set containing the best element with respect to ≻ as top( ) = {c ∈ C | ∀c′ ∈ C, c ≻ c′}.\nAn n-voter profile over C is a collection V = 〈≻1, . . . ,≻n〉 of strict linear orders over C. An irresolute voting rule (or voting correspondence) is a function R mapping every n-voter profile for arbitrary large n into a nonempty set of alternatives R(V ) ∈ 2C \\ {∅}. For every pair of alternatives (x, y) ∈ C and profile V , let nV (x, y) be the number of votes in V ranking x above y, and let M(V ) be the majority graph associated with V , whose vertices are C and containing edge (x, y) iff nV (x, y) > n 2 . x ∈ C is a weak Condorcet winner for V if there is no ingoing edge to x in M(V ) . The Top-cycle (TC) rule maps every profile V to the set of alternatives x ∈ C such that for all y ∈ C \\ {x}, there exists a path in M(V ) that goes from x to y. Equivalently, TC(P ) is the smallest set S such that for every x ∈ S and y ∈ C \\ S, we have (x, y) ∈M(V ).\nA Slater order for V is a strict linear order ≻ over C maximising the number of (x, y) such that x ≻ y iff (x, y)∈M(V ). The Slater rule maps a profile V to the set of all alternatives that are dominating in some Slater order for M(V ).\nThe Copeland rule maps V to the set of alternatives maximising the number nc(x) of outgoing edges from x in M(V ).\nThe ranked pairs rule [24] is defined as follows. We define first its non-neutral version: given a tie-breaking priority, that is, a strict linear order ρ over {(x, y) ∈ C2, x 6= y}, the strict linear order >ρ on {(x, y) ∈ C\n2, x 6= y} is constructed as follows: (x, y) >ρ (x ′, y′) iff either (a) nV (x, y) > nV (x ′, y′) or (b) if nV (x, y) = nV (x ′, y′) and ρ gives priority to (x, y) over (x′, y′). Then all pairs (x, y) are considered in sequence according to >ρ, and we build a strict linear order ≻ρ over C starting with the pair on top of >ρ, and iteratively adding the current pair to ≻ρ if it does not make it cyclic. The ranked pairs winner for V according to ρ is the unique undominated element in ≻ρ. Now, x is a winner of the neutral ranked pairs rule for V iff it is a winner of the non-neutral ranked pairs rule for some ρ. (See the recent work by Brill and Fischer [2] for a discussion on neutral and non-neutral variants of ranked pairs.)\nThe maximin rule maps V to the set of alternatives that maximise mm(x, V ) = miny∈C\\{x} nV (x, y).\nLet SY (x, V ) be the minimal number of votes whose removal from V makes x a weak Condorcet winner. If it is not possible to make x a weak Condorcet winner by removing elements of V , we define SY (x, V ) = +∞. The Young (voting) rule maps V to the set of alternatives that minimise SY (x, V ).\nThe Kemeny distance δK between ≻i∈ L(C) and ≻j∈ L(C) is the number of pairs x, y ∈ C such that x ≻i y and y ≻j x. The Kemeny rule is defined as\nKemeny(V ) =\n{\ntop(≻)| ≻∈ argmin≻∈L(C)\nn ∑\ni=1\nδK(≻,≻i)\n}\nA specific type of agenda is the preference agenda associated with a set of alternatives C. The propositions of preference agenda are of the form xPy (“x preferred to y”) [6].\nDefinition 10. The preference pre-agenda associated with C = {x1, . . . , xq} is [A]C = {xiPxj | 1 ≤ i < j ≤ q}. The corresponding agenda is the set AC = [A]C ∪ {¬ϕ | ϕ ∈ [A]C}.\nWhen j > i, xjPxi is not a proposition of AC , but we will write xjPxi as a shorthand for ¬(xiPxj).\nDefinition 11. Let C be a set of alternatives and ≻⊆ C×C. To ≻ we associate the set J(≻), defined as follows:\nJ(≻) = {xPy | x ≻ y, for x, y ∈ C}.\nLet V = 〈≻1, ...,≻n〉 be an n-voter profile over C. The judgment aggregation profile associated with V is\nP (V ) = 〈J(≻1), . . . , J(≻n)〉.\nConversely, given a set J ⊆ AC , the binary relation ≻J over C is defined by: for all xi, xj ∈ C, xi ≻J xj if and only if xiPxj ∈ J .\nNow we define two preference constraints: the transitivity constraint Tr and the dominating alternative, or “winner”, constraint W . Note that they both depend on C. However, we do not write Tr(C) nor W (C) when there is no danger of confusion.\nDefinition 12. Let C be a set of alternatives and AC the associated preference agenda, with |AC | = m = q(q+1)\n2 . We define the transitivity Tr and dominating alternative W constraints:\n– Tr = ∧\ni,j,k∈{1,...,m}\n( (xiPxj) ∧ (xjPxk) → (xiPxk) )\n– W = ∨\ni∈{1,...,m}\n∧\nj 6=i(xiPxj)\nNote that any complete Tr-consistent judgment set is alsoW -consistent, that is, Tr is stronger than W when applied to complete judgment sets.\nLemma 1. Let ≻ be a binary relation over AC .\n– J(≻) is Tr-consistent if and only if ≻ is acyclic; – J(≻) is W -consistent if and only if ≻ has at least one undominated element.\nProof. J is Tr-consistent iff ≻J can be completed into a transitive order, i.e., iff ≻J is acyclic; J is W -consistent iff some x can be made a winner by adding the missing propositions xPy, which is possible iff some x is undominated in ≻J .\nAs a consequence of Lemma 1, any Tr-consistent subset of AC is also W - consistent. Note also that ≻J is a strict linear order on C if and only if J is a judgment set based on AC and Tr.\nFor instance, let J = {aPb, aPc, bPc, dPb, cPe, ePb}; then\n≻J= {(a, b), (a, c), (b, c), (d, b), (c, e), (e, b)}\nJ is not Tr-consistent because ≻J contains the cycle b ≻J c ≻J e ≻J b. However, it is W -consistent: a and d are both undominated in ≻J .\nFor each x ∈ C we defineW (x) = ∧\ny∈C,y 6=x(xPy). Note thatW is equivalent to ∨\nx∈C W (x) and that J is W (x)-consistent iff x is undominated in ≻J . Since each vote ≻i is a strict linear order, the judgment aggregation profile associated with V is well-defined, i.e. every J(≻i) is complete and Tr-consistent. The collective judgment will sometimes be required to be consistent with respect to Tr and sometimes only to be consistent with respect to W . Lemma 2 is straightforward from Definition 11.\nLemma 2. Given a voting profile V , for all x, y ∈ C, xPy is in m(P (V )) iff (x, y) ∈M(V ).\nProposition 9. A voting profile V has a Condorcet winner iff m(P (V )) is W - consistent.\nProof. From Lemma 2, xPy is in m(P (V )) iff M(V ) contains (x, y). Since n is odd, m(P (V )) contains either xiPxj or xjPxi for all i 6= j, therefore m(P (V ))∪ {W} 2 ⊥ iff there exists x ∈ C such that m(P (V )) contains {xPy | y 6= x}, that is, by Lemma 2 again, iff V has a Condorcet winner10.\nDefinition 13. Let C be a set of alternatives, AC the associated preference agenda and let Γ ∈ {Tr(C),W (C)}. For judgment set J ∈ D(AC , Γ ), let\nWin(J) = {x ∈ C | for every y ∈ C, xPy ∈ J}.\nLet Γ ∈ {Tr,W} and F be a judgment aggregation rule. The voting rule FF,Γ induced from F and Γ is defined as x ∈ FF,Γ (P (V )) if there is a J ∈ FF,Γ (P (V )) such that x ∈ Win(J), or equivalently:\nRF,Γ (P ) = ⋃\nJ∈FΓ (P (V ))\nWin(J).\nNote that for any W -consistent, and a fortiori for any Tr-consistent J we have Win(J) 6= ∅, therefore Definition 13 is well-founded.\nThus, for every judgment aggregation rule F we have two voting rules, obtained by requiring the collective judgment set to be acyclic, i.e., consistent with Tr, or to have a undominated element, i.e., consistent with W .\nExample 10. Let\nV = 〈a ≻1 b ≻1 c ≻1 d, b ≻2 c ≻2 a ≻1 d, d ≻3 c ≻3 a ≻3 b〉\nWe have P (V ) = 〈J1, J2, J3〉 with J1 = {aPb, aPc, aPd, bPc, bPd, cPd}, J2 = {bPa, bPc, bPd, cPa, cPd, aPd} and J3 = {dPa, dPb, dPc, cPa, cPb, aPb}; and we have m(P (V )) = {aPb, bPc, cPa, aPd, bPd, cPd}.\nLet us choose F = MSA and Γ = Tr. We have FTr(P (V )) = {J, J ′, J ′′}, where J = {aPb, aPc, aPd, bPc, bPd, cPd}, J ′ = {aPb, cPa, aPd, cPb, bPd, cPd} and J ′′ = {bPa, cPa, aPd, bPc, bPd, cPd}. Now, Win(J) = {a}, Win(J ′) = {c} and Win(J ′′) = {b}. Therefore, FMSA,Tr(P (V )) = {a, b, c}.\nProposition 10.\n1. RMSA,Tr = TopCycle 11\n2. RMSA,W =\n{\n{c} if V has a Condorcet winner c C otherwise\n10 Note that for an even n, W -consistency would be equivalent to the existence of a weak Condorcet winner. 11 This result has been independently proven – although stated in a very different way – in [19]: point (a) of their Proposition 3.1 states that J ∈ MSA(P (V )) if ≻J is a directed Hamiltonian chain; this implies RMSA,Tr = TopCycle.\nProof. We prove the first correspondence. From Lemmas 1 and 2, J is a maximal Tr-consistent subset of m(P ) iff ≻J is a maximal acyclic sub-graph of M(V ). Let x ∈ TC(V ); then there exists an acyclic subrelation G of M(V ) containing, for all y 6= x, a path from x to y. G can be completed into a maximal acyclic subrelation G′ of M(V ), and x is undominated in G′ (because adding an edge to any y 6= x would create a cycle), therefore G′ corresponds to a maximal Tr-consistent subset J of m(P (V )), consistent with W (x), which means that x ∈ FRMSA,Tr(V ). Conversely, if there is a J ∈ msaAC ,Tr(V ) such that x ∈ Win(J), then there exists a maximal Tr-consistent subset J ′ of AC such that J is a completion of J ′ and ≻J′ is a maximal acyclic subrelation of M(V ) in which x does not have any incoming edge. Assume x /∈ TC(V ); then there is an y such that there is no path from x to y in M(V ). Obviously, (x, y) 6∈ M(V ), therefore, sinceM(V ) is complete, (y, x) ∈M(V ). Adding (y, x) to ≻J results in an acyclic subrelation ofM(V ) that contains ≻J , therefore ≻J is not a maximal acyclic subset of M(V ), contradiction.\nNow we prove the second correspondence. Assume there is no Condorcet winner. Let x ∈ C. Let S(x) be the subset of m(P (V )) defined by {yPz|z 6= x, yPz ∈ m(P (V ))}. S(x) is W -consistent, because it is consistent with W (x). Let us now prove that S(x) is a maximal W -consistent subset of m(P (V )). By means of contradiction, assume that S(x) is not a maximal subset of m(P (V )): then there is some element of m(P (V )) \\ S(x) that can be added to S(x) without violating W -consistency; now, every element of m(P (V ))\\S(x) is of the form yPx. Let S′ = S(x) ∪ {yPx}. S′ is not consistent with W (x). Therefore, since it is W -consistent, it must be consistent with W (z) for some z 6= x. This implies that there is no tPz ∈ S′, therefore, no tPz ∈ S(x). Now, by construction of S(x), this means that there is no tPz ∈ m(P (V )), which implies that z is a Condorcet winner: contradiction. Thus, it must be that S(x) is a maximal W -consistent subset of m(P (V )). Note also that there is a unique W -consistent completion J of S(x). Furthermore, Win(J) = {x}.\nProposition 11.\n1. RMCSA,Tr = Slater 2. RMCSA,W = Copeland\nProof. For point 1, let J ∈MCSATr(P (V )), hence J ∈ max(m(P ), T r, |.|) and ≻J is an acyclic subrelation of M(V ). Let > be a linear order extending ≻J . The number of edge reversals needed to obtain > from ≻J is |m(P (V )) \\ J |. This number is minimal iff J has a maximal cardinality. Consequently, > is a Slater order for V . Conversely, let > be a Slater order for V and let J = {xPy | x > y and xPy ∈ m(P (V ))}. Because > is a linear order, J is Tr-consistent. Moreover, |m(P (V )) \\ J | is the number of edge reversals needed to obtain > from M(V ). Since |m(P (V )) \\ J | is minimal, |J | is maximal and therefore J ∈ MCSATr(P (V )). This one-to-one correspondence between Slater orders for V and maxcard acyclic subgraphs of P (V ) allows us to conclude.\nFor point 2, let J ∈ max(m(P ),W, |.|). From J ∪ {W} 2 ⊥ it follows that there exists a x ∈ C such that for every y ∈ C, yPx 6∈ J . For every y ∈ C,\nconsider z ∈ C, z 6= x, such that yPz ∈ m(P (V )). Adding yPz to J results in a judgment set which is still W -consistent, therefore the maximum W -consistent subsets ofm(P (V )) are of the form Jx = m(P (V ))\\{yPx, y 6= x} for some x ∈ C, and such a judgment set Jx is a maxcard W -consistent subset of m(P (V )) iff |{y | xPy ∈ m(P (V ))}| is maximal, i.e., using Lemma 2, iff x ∈ Copeland(V ).\nExample 11. Let V be such that M(V ) = {(a,b),(a,c),(b,c),(b,d),(c,d),(d,a)}, i.e., m(P (V )) = {aPb, aPc, bPc, bPd, cPd, dPa}. The only maxcard Tr-consistent subset of m(P (V )) is J = {aPb, aPc, bPc, bPd, cPd}, and Win(J) = {a}; a is also the only Slater winner for P . Now, m(P (V )) has two maxcardW -consistent subsets: J and J ′ = {aPc, bPc, bPd, cPd, dPa};Win(J ′) = {b}; a and b are also the Copeland winners for V .\nProposition 12.\n1. RRA,Tr = ranked pairs. 2. RRA,W = maximin.\nProof. The proof of point (1) is simple, due to the ty of the definitions of ranked pairs and ra, and observing that adding xPy to a current Tr-consistent judgment set without violating Tr corresponds to adding (x, y) to a current acyclic graph without creating a cycle. The proof of point (2) is more interesting. The candidate x is a maximin winner if it maximizes mm(x, V ), or equivalently, if it minimises maxy nV (y, x). Let β = minx maxy nV (y, x). (Note that we have β > n2 when there is no Condorcet winner.) Assume that x is a Maximin winner for V . In order to show that x ∈ raAC ,W (P (V )), we have to construct a strict linear order ≻=≻σ on {xPy | (x, y) ∈ C2, x 6= y}, compatible with %P (V ), such that the judgment set Jσ obtained by following ≻σ is such that x ∈ Win(Jσ). Let ≻σ be as follows:\n1. the first propositions of ≻σ are all uPv such that nV (u, v) > β, with ties broken in an arbitrary manner; 2. the propositions that follow in ≻σ are all yPz such that nV (y, z) = β and z 6= x; 3. the following propositions are all yPx such that nV (y, x) = β; 4. the rest of ≻σ does not matter.\nWe now follow step by step the construction of Jσ. During step (1) – corresponding to considering one by one the propositions in (1) above – we consider all the propositions uPv such that nV (u, v) > β, and all are added to S, because the resulting judgment set is consistent with W (x), and a fortiori with W (otherwise it would be the case that for all y, nV (y, x) > β, contradicting minx maxy nV (y, x) = β). During step (2) all propositions yPz such that nV (y, z) = β and z 6= x are considered one by one, and they are all added to S, because the resulting judgment set is, each time, consistent with W (x) and a fortiori with W . After steps (1) and (2), due to the fact that\nβ = minx maxy nV (y, x), S contains some yPz for all z 6= x. Step (3) considers all yPx such that nV (y, x) = β, and does not add them to S, because this would make it inconsistent with W . Finally, the propositions considered in Step (4) are not of the form yPx. Therefore, x ∈ Win(Jσ) and x ∈ raAC ,W (P (V )).\nConversely, let x ∈ raAC ,W (P (V )). Let > be the order refining %P (V ) such that the judgment set obtained is J , with x ∈ Win(J). First, all formulas uPv such thatN(P, uPv) > β are added to S without creating any inconsistency with W . Then, > must consider all propositions zPy such that N(P (V ), zPy) = β and y 6= x, and add them all to S; at this point, for any y 6= x, a proposition zPy has been considered and added to S, otherwise there would be an y such that for no z it holds that nV (z, y) ≥ β, which would contradict β = minx maxy nV (y, x). Therefore, no propositions zPx will be added to S (or elseW would be violated). Therefore, x is such that minx maxy nV (y, x) ≤ β, hence minx maxy nV (y, x) = β: x is a maximin winner.\nExample 12. Let n = 9 and V such that nV is as follows:\nnV a b c d a − 6 2 4 b 3 − 5 6 c 7 4 − 2 d 5 3 7 −\n(3)\nThe weak order %P (V ) starts with cPa and dPc (tied), then aPb and bPd, then bPc and dPa, etc. Applying raAC ,W starts by adding cPa and dPc, whatever the choice of the strict linear order ≻σ refining %P . Next, there is a choice between aPb or bPd. If aPb is considered first (that is, if aPb ≻σ bPd), then it is added to S, bPd is not (because it would violate W -consistency), and then all other propositions except aPd, bPd and cPd are added. The other choice is similar, replacing d by b. Therefore, raAC ,W (P (V )) contains the two judgment sets\nJ1 = {dPc, dPa, dPb, cPa, bPc, aPb}\nand\nJ2 = {bPa, bPc, bPd, dPa, dPc, cPa}\nwith Win(J1) = {d} and Win(J2) = {b}. We check that b and d are also the maximin winners for V .\nFor mwa, the similarity between the distance-based procedure (equivalent to the mwa rule, as shown in Section 3) and the Kemeny rule has been exploited [10] to obtain a characterisation of the complexity of the winner determination problem in judgment aggregation under the distance-based procedure.\nProposition 13. RMWA,Tr = Kemeny.\nProof. Let V = 〈≻1, . . . ,≻n〉 be an n-voter profile over C and J a judgment set based on AC and Tr. Since J is complete and Tr-consistent, there is a ranking\n≻ over C such that J = J(≻).

Then J is complete and Tr-consistent, therefore\nJ = J(≻) for some ≻, and WP (V )(J) = n·q(q−1) 2 − ∑n\ni=1 δK(≻,≻i). By means of contradiction, assume ≻ is not a Kemeny consensus for V ; then there is a ≻′ such that\n∑n i=1 δK(≻ ′,≻i) < ∑n i=1 δK(≻,≻i) therefore a complete, Tr-consistent J ′\nsuch that WP (V )(J ′) > WP (V )(J), which contradicts the assumption that J ∈ mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )). Conversely, if ≻ is a Kemeny consensus, then J(≻) is a Tr-consistent judgment set. By means of contradiction, assume J(≻) /∈ mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )); then there exists a complete, Tr-consistent J ′ such that WP (V )(J\n′) > WP (V )(J); because J ′ is complete and Tr-consistent, J ′ = J(≻′) for some≻′, andWP (V )(J\n′) = n·q(q−1)\n2 − ∑n i=1 δK(≻ ′,≻i). Therefore, we obtain that ∑n i=1 δK(≻ ′,≻i) < ∑n\ni=1 δK(≻ ,≻i), which contradicts the assumption that ≻ is a Kemeny consensus.\nWe have shown that J ∈ mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )) if and only if J = J(≻) for some Kemeny consensus ≻. Therefore, there exists J ∈ mwaAC ,Tr(P (V )) such that Win(J) = {x} if and only if x ∈ Kemeny(P ).\nThe choice of the W constraint leads to an unknown voting rule, for which, interestingly, the winners maximizes the sum of the Borda score and a second term.

Things are similar in judgment aggregation: weak properties such as anonymity are clearly satisfied by all our rules, while strong properties such as systematicity and independence are clearly violated by all our rules. We focus here on two properties of the third class: unanimity and monotonicity."

Let P ′ be an α-improvement of P . Let for every J ∈ mcsaA,Γ (P ), α ∈ J . The case m(P ) = m(P ′) is trivial; in the rest of the proof, we study the case m(P ) 6= m(P ′). (a) Let us first show that for every S ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|) we have that:\nS ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|) or S ∪ {α} ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|). Note first that for every S ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|) we have S ⊢ α (since for every J ∈ mcsaA,Γ (P ), α ∈ J). We consider all the possible cases. i. Case α ∈ m(P ) and α /∈ m(P ′) and α /∈ m(P ′). Since S ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|)\nand α /∈ S then S ∈ max(m(P ) \\ {α}, Γ, |.|). Since m(P ′) = m(P ) \\ {α} this means that S ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|). ii. Case α ∈ m(P ) and α ∈ m(P ). Let |S| = k. Note that S ⊢ α, thus α /∈ S. Let S′ = S ∪ {α}. S′ is Γ -consistent. Let us prove that S′ ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|). By means of contradiction, suppose that there exists S′′ ⊆ m(P ′) such that |S′′| > k + 1. A. Case α ∈ S′′. Let S′′′ = S′′ \\ {α}. We have |S′′′| > |S| hence\nS /∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|). Contradiction. B. Case α /∈ S′′. Since S′′ ⊆ m(P ) and |S′′| > |S| we obtain that\nS /∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|). Contradiction. iii. Case α /∈ m(P ) and α /∈ m(P ) and α ∈ m(P ).

We conclude that for every S ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|) it holds that: S ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|) or S ∪ {α} ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|).\n(b) Let us now show that mcsaA,Γ (P ) ⊆ mcsaA,Γ (P ′). If J ∈ mcsaA,Γ (P ) then there exists S ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|) such that J ∈ CompA,Γ (S). From (a), there exists S′ ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|) such that S′ = S or S′ = S∪{α}.

Let S′ ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|). From (a), we conclude that |S′| = k+1 (since for every S ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|), |S| = k and S∪{α} ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|) ). Let S′′ = S′\\{α}. S′′ is Γ - consistent, S′′ ⊆ m(P ) and |S′′| = k. Thus, S′′ ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|).\niii. Case α /∈ m(P ) and α /∈ m(P ) and α ∈ m(P ′). Let us suppose that S′ ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|).

S′′ ⊆ m(P ), S′′ is Γ -consistent and |S′′| = k, thus S′′ ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|).\n(d) Let us show that mcsaA,Γ (P ′) ⊆ mcsaA,Γ (P ). Let J ′ ∈ mcsaA,Γ (P ′)\nand let S′ ∈ max(m(P ′), Γ, |.|) be a set such that J ′ ∈ mcsaA,Γ (P ′). Let S′′ = S′ \\ {α}. Then S′′ ∈ max(m(P ), Γ, |.|) and S′′ ⊢ α, thus CompA,Γ (S ′) = CompA,Γ (S ′′). This means that J ′ ∈ mcsaA,Γ (P ).\n3. ra Let α ∈ A and suppose that for every J ∈ raA,Γ (P ), α ∈ J . Let P ′ be an αimprovement of P . Then N(P ′, α) > N(P, α), N(P ′, α) < N(P, α), whereas for all ϕ 6= α, α, N(P ′, ϕ) = N(P, ϕ). Hence, in %P ′ , α appears either at an earlier position or in the same position as in %P .

Let J ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ). Then α ∈ J . Observe that D(J, P ′) = D(J, P )− 1 for every J such that α ∈ J . Thus, for every J∗ ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ), we have D(J∗, P ′) = c − 1. Hence, J ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ′). (b) Let us now prove thatmwaA,Γ (P ′) ⊆ mwaA,Γ (P ). Suppose J ′ ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ′).\ni. Case α ∈ J ′. Then D(J ′, P ) = D(J ′, P ′)+1. Since J ′ ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ′) thenD(J ′, P ′) = c−1. Thus,D(J ′, P ) = c. Therefore, J ′ ∈ mwaA,Γ (P ).\nii. Case α /∈ J ′. By means of contradiction, suppose J ′ /∈ mwaA,Γ (P ). Thus D(J ′, P ) > c. Since α /∈ J ′, then D(J ′, P ) < D(J ′, P ′).

Table 17 summarises the compliance of the judgment aggregation rules we considered with these two properties.\nThe definition and study of judgment aggregation rules is only starting, and knowing that a judgment aggregation rule specializes to a well-known voting rules (sometimes, to two well-known voting rules), as our results of Section 4 tell, is a hint that the judgment aggregation rule is a natural generalization of interesting voting rules, which is a first justification for studying it; second, it gives insights about the properties it may satisfy. In particular, a challenging question is the axiomatization of judgment aggregation rules, and for this, a good start could be to start with the axiomatization (when it exists) of the voting rule(s) into which the judgment aggregation rule degenerates.\nAlso, a similar study for some other judgment aggregation rules would be in order; among other specific rules studied in the literature, we left out the rule RdH ,max studied in [13] as well as the rules studied in [4,8], none of which is majority-preserving."

Observe that mwaA,⊤(P ) = {{p, q, p∧q,¬(p∧¬q),¬α1,¬α2,¬(q∧¬p),¬α3,¬α4}} since for this judgment set the weight is 17, and for the remaining three other possible judgment sets the weights are: 14 for the set of the judgment sets of the second, and third agent and 16 for the judgment set {¬p,¬q,¬(p ∧ q),¬(p ∧ ¬q),¬α1,¬α2,¬(q∧ ¬p),¬α3,¬α4}. Thus mnac inc mwa."

Here we focus on a family of rules that is the natural counterpart of the family of Condorcetconsistent voting rules: majority-preserving judgment aggregation rules. A judgment aggregation rule is majority-preserving if whenever issuewise majority is consistent, the rule should output the majoritarian opinion on each issue. We provide a formal setting for relating judgment aggregation rules to voting rules and propose some basic properties for judgment aggregation rules. We consider six such rules some of which have already appeared in the literature, some others are new. For these rules we consider their relation to known voting rules, to each other, with respect to their discriminating power, and analyse them with respect to the considered properties.",
