      "text" : "An agent a comes to a fork in a road. There is a sign that says that one of the two roads leads to prosperity, another to death. The agent must take the fork, but she does not know which road leads where. Does the agent have a strategy to get to prosperity? On one hand, since one of the roads leads to prosperity, such a strategy clearly exists. We denote this fact by modal formula Sap, where statement p is a claim of future prosperity. Furthermore, agent a knows that such a strategy exists. We write this as KaSap. Yet, the agent does not know what the strategy is and, thus, does not know how to use the strategy. We denote this by ¬Hap, where know-how modality Ha expresses the fact that agent a knows how to achieve the goal based on the information available to her. In this article we study the interplay between modality K, representing knowledge, modality S, representing the existence of a strategy, and modality H, representing the existence of a know-how strategy. Our main result is a complete trimodal axiomatic system capturing properties of this interplay."

      "text" : "In this article we use epistemic transition systems to capture knowledge and strategic behavior. Informally, epistemic transition system is a directed labeled graph supplemented by an indistinguishability relation on vertices. For instance, our motivational example above can be captured by epistemic transition system T1 depicted in Figure 1. In this system state w represents the prosperity and\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n09 34\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 5\nJu n\nstate w′ represents death. The original state is u, but it is indistinguishable by the agent a from state v. Arrows on the diagram represent possible transitions between the states. Labels on the arrows represent the choices that the agents make during the transition. For example, if in state u agent chooses left (L) road, she will transition to the prosperity state w and if she chooses right (R) road, she will transition to the death state w′. In another epistemic state v, these roads lead the other way around. States u and v are not distinguishable by agent a, which is shown by the dashed line between these two states. In state u as well as state v the agent has a strategy to transition to the state of prosperity: u Sap and v Sap. In the case of state u this strategy is L, in the case of state v the strategy is R. Since the agent cannot distinguish states u and v, in both of these states she does not have a know-how strategy to reach prosperity: u 1 Hap and v 1 Hap. At the same time, since formula Sap is satisfied in all states indistinguishable to agent a from state u, we can claim that u KaSap and, similarly, v KaSap.\nAs our second example, let us consider the epistemic transition system T2 obtained from T1 by swapping labels on transitions from v to w and from v to w′, see Figure 2. Although in system T2 agent a still cannot distinguish states u and v, she has a know-how strategy from either of these states to reach state w. We write this as u Hap and v Hap. The strategy is to choose L. This strategy is know-how because it does not require to make different choices in the states that the agent cannot distinguish."

      "text" : "For the next example, we consider a transition system T3 obtained from system T1 by adding a new epistemic state s. From state s, agent a can choose label L to reach state u or choose label R to reach state v. Since proposition q is satisfied in state u, agent a has a know-how strategy to transition from state s to a state (namely, state u) where q is satisfied. Therefore, s Haq.\nA more interesting question is whether s HaHap is true. In other words, does agent a know how to transition from state s to a state in which she knows how to transition to another state in which p is satisfied? One might think that such a strategy indeed exists: in state s agent a chooses label L to transition to state u. Since there is no transition labeled by L that leads from state s to state v, upon ending the first transition the agent would know that she is in state u, where she needs to choose label L to transition to state w. This argument, however, is based on the assumption that agent a has a perfect recall. Namely, agent a in state u remembers the choice that she made in the previous state. We assume that the agents do not have a perfect recall and that an epistemic state description captures whatever memories the agent has in this state. In other words, in this article we assume that the only knowledge that an agent possesses is the knowledge captured by the indistinguishability relation on the epistemic states. Given this assumption, upon reaching the state u (indistinguishable from state v) agent a knows that there exists a choice that she can make to transition to state in which p is satisfied: s HaSap. However, she does not know which choice (L or R) it is: s 1 HaHap.\n1.3 Multiagent Setting\nSo far, we have assumed that only agent a has an influence on which transi-\ntion the system takes. In transition system T4 depicted in Figure 4, we introduce another agent b and assume both agents a and b have influence on the transitions. In each state, the system takes the transition labeled D by default unless there is a consensus of agents a and b to take the transition labeled C. In such a setting, each agent has a strategy to transition system from state u into state w by voting D, but neither of them alone has a strategy to transition from state u to state w′ because such a transition requires the consensus of both agents. Thus, u Sap∧Sbp∧¬Saq∧¬Sbq. Additionally, both agents know how to transition the system from state u into state w, they just need to vote D. Therefore, u Hap ∧ Hbp.\nIn Figure 5, we show a more complicated transition system obtained from T1 by renaming label L to D and renaming label R to C. Same as in transition system T4, we assume that there are two agents a and b voting on the system transition. We also assume that agent a cannot distinguish states u and v while agent b can. By default, the system takes the transition labeled D unless there is a consensus to take transition labeled C. As a result, agent a has a strategy (namely, vote D) in state u to transition system to state w, but because agent a cannot distinguish state u from state v, not only does she not know how to do this, but she is not aware that such a strategy exists: u Sap∧¬Hap∧¬KaSap. Agent b, however, not only has a strategy to transition the system from state u to state w, but also knows how to achieve this: u Hbp."

      "heading" : "1.4 Coalitions",
      "text" : "We have talked about strategies, know-hows, and knowledge of individual agents. In this article we consider knowledge, strategies, and know-how strategies of coalitions. There are several forms of group knowledge that have been studied before. The two most popular of them are common knowledge and distributed knowledge [8]. Different contexts call for different forms of group knowledge.\nAs illustrated in the famous Two Generals’ Problem [4, 11] where communication channels between the agents are unreliable, establishing a common knowledge between agents might be essential for having a strategy.\nIn some settings, the distinction between common and distributed knowledge is insignificant. For example, if members of a political fraction get to-\ngether to share all their information and to develop a common strategy, then the distributed knowledge of the members becomes the common knowledge of the fraction during the in-person meeting.\nFinally, in some other situations the distributed knowledge makes more sense than the common knowledge. For example, if a panel of experts is formed to develop a strategy, then this panel achieves the best result if it relies on the combined knowledge of its members rather than on their common knowledge.\nIn this article we focus on distributed coalition knowledge and distributedknow-how strategies. We leave the common knowledge for the future research.\nTo illustrate how distributed knowledge of coalitions interacts with strategies and know-hows, consider epistemic transition system T6 depicted in Figure 6. In this system, agents a and b cannot distinguish states u and v while agents b and c cannot distinguish states v and u′. In every state, each of agents a, b and c votes either L or R, and the system transitions according to the majority vote. In such a setting, any coalition of two agents can fully control the transitions of the system.\nFor example, by both voting L, agents a and b form a coalition {a, b} that forces the system to transition from state u to state w no matter how agent c votes. Since proposition p is satisfied in state w, we write u S{a,b}p, or simply u Sa,bp. Similarly, coalition {a, b} can vote R to force the system to transition from state v to state w. Therefore, coalition {a, b} has strategies to achieve p in states u and v, but the strategies are different. Since they cannot distinguish states u and v, agents a and b know that they have a strategy to achieve p, but they do not know how to achieve p. In our notations, v Sa,bp ∧ Ka,bSa,bp ∧ ¬Ha,bp.\nOn the other hand, although agents b and c cannot distinguish states v and u′, by both voting R in either of states v and u′, they form a coalition {b, c} that forces the system to transition to state w where p is satisfied. Therefore, in any of states v and u′, they not only have a strategy to achieve p, but also know that they have such a strategy, and more importantly, they know how to achieve p, that is, v Hb,cp."

      "text" : "In all the examples that we have discussed so far, given any state in a system, agents’ votes uniquely determine the transition of the system. Our framework also allows nondeterministic transitions. Consider transition system T7 depicted in Figure 7. In this system, there are two agents a and b who can vote either C or D. If both agents vote C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions labeled with C. Otherwise, the system takes the transition labeled with D. Note that there are two consensus transitions starting from state u. Therefore, even if both agents vote C, they do not have a strategy to achieve p, i.e., u 1 Sa,bp. However, they can achieve p ∨ q. Moreover, since all agents can distinguish all states, we have u Ha,b(p ∨ q)."

      "text" : "In the examples above we focused on specific properties that were either satisfied or not satisfied in particular states of epistemic transition systems T1 through T7. In this article, we study properties that are satisfied in all states of all epistemic transition systems. Our main result is a sound and complete axiomatization of all such properties. We finish the introduction with an informal discussion of these properties.\nProperties of Single Modalities Knowledge modality KC satisfies the axioms of epistemic logic S5 with distributed knowledge. Both strategic modality SC and know-how modality HC satisfy cooperation properties [17, 18]:\nSC(ϕ→ ψ)→ (SDϕ→ SC∪Dψ), where C ∩D = ∅, (1) HC(ϕ→ ψ)→ (HDϕ→ HC∪Dψ), where C ∩D = ∅. (2)\nThey also satisfy monotonicity properties\nSCϕ→ SDϕ, where C ⊆ D, HCϕ→ HDϕ, where C ⊆ D.\nThe two monotonicity properties are not among the axioms of our logical system because, as we show in Lemma 5 and Lemma 3, they are derivable.\nProperties of Interplay Note that w HCϕ means that coalition C has the same strategy to achieve ϕ in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Hence, the following principle is universally true:\nHCϕ→ KCHCϕ. (3)\nSimilarly, w ¬HCϕ means that coalition C does not have the same strategy to achieve ϕ in all epistemic states indistinguishable by the coalition from state w. Thus,\n¬HCϕ→ KC¬HCϕ. (4)\nWe call properties (3) and (4) strategic positive introspection and strategic negative introspection, respectively. The strategic negative introspection is one of our axioms. Just as how the positive introspection principle follows from the rest of the axioms in S5 (see Lemma 14), the strategic positive introspection principle is also derivable (see Lemma 1).\nWhenever a coalition knows how to achieve something, there should exist a strategy for the coalition to achieve. In our notation,\nHCϕ→ SCϕ. (5)\nWe call this formula strategic truth property and it is one of the axioms of our logical system.\nThe last two axioms of our logical system deal with empty coalitions. First of all, if formula K∅ϕ is satisfied in an epistemic state of our transition system, then formula ϕ must be satisfied in every state of this system. Thus, even empty coalition has a trivial strategy to achieve ϕ:\nK∅ϕ→ H∅ϕ. (6)\nWe call this property empty coalition principle. In this article we assume that an epistemic transition system never halts. That is, in every state of the system no matter what the outcome of the vote is, there is always a next state for this vote. This restriction on the transition systems yields property\n¬SC⊥. (7)\nthat we call nontermination principle. Let us now turn to the most interesting and perhaps most unexpected property of interplay. Note that S∅ϕ means that an empty coalition has a strategy to achieve ϕ. Since the empty coalition has no members, nobody has to vote in a particular way. Statement ϕ is guaranteed to happen anyway. Thus, statement S∅ϕ simply means that statement ϕ is unavoidably satisfied after any single transition.\nFor example, consider an epistemic transition system depicted in Figure 8. As in some of our earlier examples, this system has agents a and b who vote either C or D. If both agents vote C, then the system takes one of the consensus transitions labeled with C. Otherwise, the system takes the default transition\nlabeled with D. Note that in state v it is guaranteed that statement p will happen after a single transition. Thus, v S∅p. At the same time, neither agent a nor agent b knows about this because they cannot distinguish state v from states u and u′ respectively. Thus, v ¬KaS∅p ∧ ¬KbS∅p.\nIn the same transition system T8, agents a and b together can distinguish state v from states u and u′. Thus, v Ka,bS∅p. In general, statement KCS∅ϕ means that not only ϕ is unavoidable, but coalition C knows about it. Thus, coalition C has a know-how strategy to achieve ϕ:\nKCS∅ϕ→ HCϕ.\nIn fact, the coalition would achieve the result no matter which strategy it uses. Coalition C can even use a strategy that simultaneously achieves another result in addition to ϕ:\nKCS∅ϕ ∧ HCψ → HC(ϕ ∧ ψ).\nIn our logical system we use an equivalent form of the above principle that is stated using only implication:\nHC(ϕ→ ψ)→ (KCS∅ϕ→ HCψ). (8)\nWe call this property epistemic determinicity principle. Properties (1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), and (8), together with axioms of epistemic logic S5 with distributed knowledge and propositional tautologies constitute the axioms of our sound and complete logical system."

      "text" : "Logics of coalition power were developed by Marc Pauly [17, 18], who also proved the completeness of the basic logic of coalition power. Pauly’s approach has been widely studied in the literature [10, 23, 7, 20, 2, 3, 6]. An alternative logical system was proposed by More and Naumov [14].\nAlur, Henzinger, and Kupferman introduced Alternating-Time Temporal Logic (ATL) that combines temporal and coalition modalities [5]. Van der Hoek and Wooldridge proposed to combine ATL with epistemic modality to form Alternating-Time Temporal Epistemic Logic [22]. They did not prove the completeness theorem for the proposed logical system.\nÅgotnes and Alechina proposed a complete logical system that combines the coalition power and epistemic modalities [1]. Since this system does not have\nepistemic requirements on strategies, it does not contain any axioms describing the interplay of these modalities.\nKnow-how strategies were studied before under different names. While Jamroga and Ågotnes talked about “knowledge to identify and execute a strategy” [12], Jamroga and van der Hoek discussed “difference between an agent knowing that he has a suitable strategy and knowing the strategy itself” [13]. Van Benthem called such strategies “uniform” [21]. Wang gave a complete axiomatization of “knowing how” as a binary modality [25, 24], but his logical system does not include the knowledge modality.\nIn our AAMAS paper, we investigated coalition strategies to enforce a condition indefinitely [15]. Such strategies are similar to “goal maintenance” strategies in Pauly’s “extended coalition logic” [17, p. 80]. We focused on “executable” and “verifiable” strategies. Using the language of the current article, executability means that a coalition remains “in the know-how” throughout the execution of the strategy. Verifiability means that the coalition can verify that the enforced condition remains true. In the notations of the current article, the existence of a verifiable strategy could be expressed as SCKCϕ. In [15], we provided a complete logical system that describes the interplay between the modality representing the existence of an “executable” and “verifiable” coalition strategy to enforce and the modality representing knowledge. This system can prove principles similar to the strategic positive introspection (3) and the strategic negative introspection (4) mentioned above. A similar complete logical system in a single-agent setting for strategies to achieve a goal in multiple steps rather than to maintain a goal is developed by Fervari, Herzig, Li, and Wang [9].\nIn the current article, we combine know-how modality H with strategic modality S and epistemic modality K. The proof of the completeness theorem is significantly more challenging than in [15, 9]. It employs new techniques that construct pairs of maximal consistent sets in “harmony” and in “complete harmony”. See Section 6.3 and Section 6.4 for details. An extended abstract of this article, without proofs, appeared as [16]."

      "text" : "In this section we present the formal syntax and semantics of our logical system given a fixed finite set of agentsA. Epistemic transition system could be thought of as a Kripke model of modal logic S5 with distributed knowledge to which we add transitions controlled by a vote aggregation mechanism. Examples of vote aggregation mechanisms that we have considered in the introduction are the consensus/default mechanism and the majority vote mechanism. Unlike the introductory examples, in the general definition below we assume that at different states the mechanism might use different rules for vote aggregation. The only restriction on the mechanism that we introduce is that there should be at least one possible transition that the system can take no matter what the votes are. In other words, we assume that the system can never halt.\nFor any set of votes V , by V A we mean the set of all functions from set A to set V . Alternatively, the set V A could be thought of as a set of tuples of elements of V indexed by elements of A.\nDefinition 1 A tuple (W, {∼a}a∈A, V,M, π) is called an epistemic transition system, where\n1. W is a set of epistemic states,\n2. ∼a is an indistinguishability equivalence relation on W for each a ∈ A,\n3. V is a nonempty set called “domain of choices”,\n4. M ⊆ W × V A ×W is an aggregation mechanism where for each w ∈ W and each s ∈ V A, there is w′ ∈W such that (w, s, w′) ∈M ,\n5. π is a function that maps propositional variables into subsets of W .\nDefinition 2 A coalition is a subset of A.\nNote that a coalition is always finite due to our assumption that the set of all agents A is finite. Informally, we say that two epistemic states are indistinguishable by a coalition C if they are indistinguishable by every member of the coalition. Formally, coalition indistinguishability is defined as follows:\nDefinition 3 For any epistemic states w1, w2 ∈ W and any coalition C, let w1 ∼C w2 if w1 ∼a w2 for each agent a ∈ C.\nCorollary 1 Relation ∼C is an equivalence relation on the set of states W for each coalition C.\nBy a strategy profile {sa}a∈C of a coalition C we mean a tuple that specifies vote sa ∈ V of each member a ∈ C. Since such a tuple can also be viewed as a function from set C to set V , we denote the set of all strategy profiles of a coalition C by V C :\nDefinition 4 Any tuple {sa}a∈C ∈ V C is called a strategy profile of coalition C.\nIn addition to a fixed finite set of agents A we also assume a fixed countable set of propositional variables. We use the assumption that this set is countable in the proof of Lemma 21. The language Φ of our formal logical system is specified in the next definition.\nDefinition 5 Let Φ be the minimal set of formulae such that\n1. p ∈ Φ for each propositional variable p,\n2. ¬ϕ,ϕ→ ψ ∈ Φ for all formulae ϕ,ψ ∈ Φ,\n3. KCϕ,SCϕ,HCϕ ∈ Φ for each coalition C and each ϕ ∈ Φ.\nIn other words, language Φ is defined by the following grammar:\nϕ := p | ¬ϕ | ϕ→ ϕ | KCϕ | SCϕ | HCϕ.\nBy ⊥ we denote the negation of a tautology. For example, we can assume that ⊥ is ¬(p→ p) for some fixed propositional variable p.\nAccording to Definition 1, a mechanism specifies the transition that a system might take for any strategy profile of the set of all agents A. It is sometimes convenient to consider transitions that are consistent with a given strategy profile s of a give coalition C ⊆ A. We write w →s u if a transition from state w to state u is consistent with strategy profile s. The formal definition is below.\nDefinition 6 For any epistemic states w, u ∈ W , any coalition C, and any strategy profile s = {sa}a∈C ∈ V C , we write w →s u if (w, s′, u) ∈ M for some strategy profile s′ = {s′a}a∈A ∈ V A such that s′a = sa for each a ∈ C.\nCorollary 2 For any strategy profile s of the empty coalition ∅, if there are a coalition C and a strategy profile s′ of coalition C such that w →s′ u, then w →s u.\nThe next definition is the key definition of this article. It formally specifies the meaning of the three modalities in our logical system.\nDefinition 7 For any epistemic state w ∈ W of a transition system (W, {∼a }a∈A, V,M, π) and any formula ϕ ∈ Φ, let relation w ϕ be defined as follows\n1. w p if w ∈ π(p) where p is a propositional variable,\n2. w ¬ϕ if w 1 ϕ,\n3. w ϕ→ ψ if w 1 ϕ or w ψ,\n4. w KCϕ if w′ ϕ for each w′ ∈W such that w ∼C w′,\n5. w SCϕ if there is a strategy profile s ∈ V C such that w →s w′ implies w′ ϕ for every w′ ∈W ,\n6. w HCϕ if there is a strategy profile s ∈ V C such that w ∼C w′ and w′ →s w′′ imply w′′ ϕ for all w′, w′′ ∈W ."

Indeed, by Definition 3 assumption w ∼C∪D w′ implies that w ∼C w′ and w ∼D w′. At the same time, by Definition 6, assumption w′ →s w′′ implies that w′ →s1 w′′ and w′ →s2 w′′. Thus, w′′ ϕ → ψ and w′′ ϕ by the choice of strategies s1 and s2. Therefore, w′′ ψ by Definition 7.\nLemma 9 If w HCϕ, then w SCϕ.\nProof. Suppose that w HCϕ. Thus, by Definition 7, there is a strategy profile s ∈ V C such that w′′ ϕ for all epistemic states w′, w′′ ∈ W , where w ∼C w′ and w′ →s w′′. By Corollary 1, w ∼C w. Hence, w′′ ϕ for each epistemic state w′′ ∈W , where w →s w′′. Therefore, w SCϕ by Definition 7.\nLemma 10 If w HC(ϕ→ ψ) and w KCS∅ϕ, then w HCψ.\nProof. Suppose that w HC(ϕ→ ψ). Thus, by Definition 7, there is a strategy profile s ∈ V C such that w′′ ϕ→ ψ for all epistemic states w′, w′′ ∈W where w ∼C w′ and w′ →s w′′.\nConsider any epistemic states w′0, w ′′ 0 ∈ W such that w ∼C w′0 and w′0 →s\nw′′0 . By Definition 7, it suffices to show that w ′′ 0 ψ.\nIndeed, by Definition 7, the assumption w KCS∅ϕ together with w ∼C w′0 imply that w′0 S∅ϕ. Hence, by Definition 7, there is a strategy profile s\n′ of empty coalition ∅ such that w′′ ϕ for each w′′ where w′0 →s′ w′′. Thus, w′′0 ϕ due to Corollary 2 and w ′ 0 →s w′′0 . By the choice of strategy profile s, statements w ∼C w′0 and w′0 →s w′′0 imply w′′0 ϕ → ψ. Finally, by Definition 7, statements w′′0 ϕ→ ψ and w′′0 ϕ imply that w′′0 ψ.\nLemma 11 If w K∅ϕ, then w H∅ϕ.\nProof. Let s = {sa}a∈∅ be the empty strategy profile. Consider any epistemic states w′, w′′ ∈W such that w ∼∅ w′ and w′ →s w′′. By Definition 7, it suffices\nto show that w′′ ϕ. Indeed w ∼∅ w′′ by Definition 3. Therefore, w′′ ϕ by assumption w K∅ϕ and Definition 7.\nLemma 12 w 1 SC⊥.\nProof. Suppose that w SC⊥. Thus, by Definition 7, there is a strategy profile s = {sa}a∈A ∈ V C such that u ⊥ for each u ∈W where w →s u.\nNote that by Definition 1, the domain of choices V is not empty. Thus, strategy profile s can be extended to a strategy profile s′ = {s′a}a∈A ∈ V A such that s′a = sa for each a ∈ C.\nBy Definition 1, there must exist a state w′ ∈ W such that (w, s′, w′) ∈ M . Hence, w →s w′ by Definition 6. Therefore, w′ ⊥ by the choice of strategy s, which contradicts Definition 7.\nLemma 13 If w ϕ for any epistemic state w ∈W of an epistemic transition system (W, {∼a}a∈A, V,M, π), then w SCϕ for every epistemic state w ∈W .\nProof. By Definition 1, set V is not empty. Let v ∈ V . Consider strategy profile s = {sa}a∈C of coalition C such that sa = v for each s ∈ C. Note that w′ ϕ for each w′ ∈ W due to the assumption of the lemma. Therefore, w SCϕ by Definition 7.\nTaken together, the lemmas above imply the soundness theorem for our logical system stated below.\nTheorem 1 If ` ϕ, then w ϕ for each epistemic state w ∈ W of each epistemic transition system (W, {∼a}a∈A, V,M, π)."

Namely, as it follows from Definition 7, assumption ¬HCψ ∈ w requires us to create not a single child of parent w, but two different children referred in Definition 7 as states w′ and w′′, see Figure 9. Child w′ is a state of the system indistinguishable from state w by coalition C. Child w′′ is a state such that ¬ψ ∈ w′′ and coalition C cannot prevent the system to transition from w′ to w′′.\nOne might think that states w′ and w′′ could be constructed in order: first state w′ and then state w′′. It appears, however, that such an approach does not work because it does not guarantee that ¬ψ ∈ w′′. To solve the issue, we construct states w′ and w′′ simultaneously. While constructing states w′ and w′′ as maximal consistent sets of formulae, it is important to maintain two relations between sets w′ and w′′ that we call “to be in harmony” and “to be in complete harmony”. In this section we define harmony relation and prove its basic properties. The next section is dedicated to the complete harmony relation.\nEven though according to Definition 5 the language of our logical system only includes propositional connectives ¬ and →, other connectives, including conjunction ∧, can be defined in the standard way.

Recall that the set of agent A is finite and the set of propositional variables is countable. Thus, the set of all formulae Φ is also countable.

Informally, epistemic states in this system are nodes in a tree. In this tree, each node is labeled with a maximal consistent set of formulae and each edge is labeled with a coalition. Formally, epistemic states are defined as sequences representing paths in such a tree. In the rest of this section we fix a maximal consistent set of formulae X0 and define a canonical epistemic transition system ETS(X0) = (W, {∼a}a∈A, V,M, π).\nDefinition 10 The set of epistemic states W consists of all finite sequences X0, C1, X1, C2, . . . , Cn, Xn, such that\n1. n ≥ 0,\n2. Xi is a maximal consistent subset of Φ for each i ≥ 1,\n3. Ci is a coalition for each i ≥ 1,\n4. {ϕ | KCiϕ ∈ Xi−1} ⊆ Xi for each i ≥ 1.\nWe say that two nodes of the tree are indistinguishable to an agent a if every edge along the unique path connecting these two nodes is labeled with a coalition containing agent a.\nDefinition 11 For any state w = X0, C1, X1, C2, . . . , Cn, Xn and any state w′ = X0, C ′ 1, X ′ 1, C ′ 2, . . . , C ′ m, X ′ m, let w ∼a w′ if there is an integer k such that\n1. 0 ≤ k ≤ min{n,m},\n2.

The abbreviation hd stands for “head”.\nLemma 22 For any w = X0, C1, X1, C2, . . . , Cn, Xn ∈W and any integer k ≤ n, if KCϕ ∈ Xn and C ⊆ Ci for each integer i such that k < i ≤ n, then KCϕ ∈ Xk.\nProof. Suppose that there is k ≤ n such that KCϕ /∈ Xk. Let m be the maximal such k. Note that m < n due to the assumption KCϕ ∈ Xn of the lemma. Thus, m < m+ 1 ≤ n.\nAssumption KCϕ /∈ Xm implies ¬KCϕ ∈ Xm due to the maximality of the set Xm. Hence, Xm ` KC¬KCϕ by Negative Introspection axiom. Thus, Xm ` KCm+1¬KCϕ by Monotonicity axiom and the assumption C ⊆ Cm+1 of the lemma (recall that m + 1 ≤ n). Then, KCm+1¬KCϕ ∈ Xm due to the maximality of the set Xm. Hence, ¬KCϕ ∈ Xm+1 by Definition 10. Thus, KCϕ /∈ Xm+1 due to the consistency of the set Xm+1, which is a contradiction with the choice of integer m.\nLemma 23 For any w = X0, C1, X1, C2, . . . , Cn, Xn ∈W and any integer k ≤ n, if KCϕ ∈ Xk and C ⊆ Ci for each integer i such that k < i ≤ n, then ϕ ∈ Xn.\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on the distance between n and k. In the base case n = k. Then the assumption KCϕ ∈ Xn implies Xn ` ϕ by Truth axiom. Therefore, ϕ ∈ Xn due to the maximality of set Xn.\nSuppose that k < n. Assumption KCϕ ∈ Xk implies Xk ` KCKCϕ by Lemma 14. Thus, Xk ` KCk+1KCϕ by Monotonicity axiom, the condition k < n of the inductive step, and the assumption C ⊆ Ck+1 of the lemma. Then, KCk+1KCϕ ∈ Xk by the maximality of set Xk. Hence, KCϕ ∈ Xk+1 by Definition 10. Therefore, ϕ ∈ Xn by the induction hypothesis.\nLemma 24 If KCϕ ∈ hd(w) and w ∼C w′, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′).\nProof. The statement follows from Lemma 22, Lemma 23, and Definition 11 because there is a unique path between any two nodes in a tree.\nAt the beginning of Section 6.2, we discussed that if a parent node contains a modal formula ¬2ψ, then it must have a child node containing formula ¬ψ.\nLemma 15 in Section 6.2 provides a foundation for constructing such a child node for modality KC . The proof of the next lemma describes the construction of the child node for this modality.\nLemma 25 If KCϕ /∈ hd(w), then there is an epistemic state w′ ∈W such that w ∼C w′ and ϕ /∈ hd(w′).\nProof. Assumption KCϕ /∈ hd(w) implies that ¬KCϕ ∈ hd(w) due to the maximality of the set hd(w). Thus, by Lemma 15, set Y0 = {¬ϕ} ∪ {ψ | KCψ ∈ hd(w)} is consistent. Let Y be a maximal consistent extension of set Y0 and w′ be sequence w,C, Y . In other words, sequence w′ is an extension of sequence w by two additional elements: C and Y . Note that w′ ∈ W due to Definition 10 and the choice of set Y0. Furthermore, w ∼C w′ by Definition 11. To finish the proof, we need to show that ϕ /∈ hd(w′). Indeed, ¬ϕ ∈ Y0 ⊆ Y = hd(w′) by the choice of Y0. Therefore, ϕ /∈ hd(w′) due to the consistency of the set hd(w′).\nIn the next two definitions we specify the domain of votes and the vote aggregation mechanism of the canonical transition system. Informally, a vote (ϕ,w) of each agent consists of two components: the actual vote ϕ and a key w. The actual vote ϕ is a formula from Φ in support of what the agent votes. Recall that the agent does not know in which exact state the system is, she only knows the equivalence class of this state with respect to the indistinguishability relation. The key w is the agent’s guess of the epistemic state where the system is. Informally, agent’s vote has more power to force the formula to be satisfied in the next state if she guesses the current state correctly.\nAlthough each agent is free to vote for any formula she likes, the vote aggregation mechanism would grant agent’s wish only under certain circumstances. Namely, if the system is in state w and set hd(w) contains formula SCϕ, then the mechanism guarantees that formula ϕ is satisfied in the next state as long as each member of coalition C votes for formula ϕ and correctly guesses the current epistemic state. In other words, in order for formula ϕ to be guaranteed in the next state all members of the coalition C must cast vote (ϕ,w). This means that if SCϕ ∈ hd(w), then coalition C has a strategy to force ϕ in the next state. Since the strategy requires each member of the coalition to guess correctly the current state, such a strategy is not a know-how strategy.\nThe vote aggregation mechanism is more forgiving if the epistemic state w contains formula HCϕ. In this case the mechanism guarantees that formula ϕ is satisfied in the next state if all members of the coalition vote for formula ϕ; it does not matter if they guess the current state correctly or not. This means that if HCϕ ∈ hd(w), then coalition C has a know-how strategy to force ϕ in the next state. The strategy consists in each member of the coalition voting for formula ϕ and specifying an arbitrary epistemic state as the key.\nFormal definitions of the domain of choices and of the vote aggregation mechanism in the canonical epistemic transition system are given below.\nDefinition 12 The domain of choices V is Φ×W .\nFor any pair u = (x, y), let pr1(u) = x and pr2(u) = y.\nDefinition 13 The mechanism M of the canonical model is the set of all tuples (w, {sa}a∈A, w′) such that for each formula ϕ ∈ Φ and each coalition C,\n1. if SCϕ ∈ hd(w) and sa = (ϕ,w) for each a ∈ C, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′), and\n2. if HCϕ ∈ hd(w) and pr1(sa) = ϕ for each a ∈ C, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′).\nThe next two lemmas prove that the vote aggregation mechanism specified in Definition 13 acts as discussed in the informal description given earlier.\nLemma 26 Let w,w′ ∈W be epistemic states, SCϕ ∈ hd(w) be a formula, and s = {sa}a∈C be a strategy profile of coalition C. If w →s w′ and sa = (ϕ,w) for each a ∈ C, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′).\nProof. Suppose that w →s w′. Thus, by Definition 6, there is a strategy profile s′ = {s′a}a∈A ∈ V A such that s′a = sa for each a ∈ C and (w, s′, w′) ∈ M . Therefore, ϕ ∈ hd(w′) by Definition 13 and the assumption sa = (ϕ,w) for each a ∈ C.\nLemma 27 Let w,w′, w′′ ∈W be epistemic states, HCϕ ∈ hd(w) be a formula, and s = {sa}a∈C be a strategy profile of coalition C. If w ∼C w′, w′ →s w′′, and pr1(sa) = ϕ for each a ∈ C, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′′).\nProof. Suppose that HCϕ ∈ hd(w). Thus, hd(w) ` KCHCϕ by Lemma 1. Hence, KCHCϕ ∈ hd(w) due to the maximality of the set hd(w). Thus, HCϕ ∈ hd(w′) by Lemma 24 and the assumption w ∼C w′. By Definition 6, assumption w′ →s w′′ implies that there is a strategy profile s′ = {s′a}a∈A such that s′a = sa for each a ∈ C and (w′, s′, w′′) ∈ M . Since HCϕ ∈ hd(w′), pr1(s′a) = pr1(sa) = ϕ for each a ∈ C, and (w′, s′, w′′) ∈M , we have ϕ ∈ hd(w′′) by Definition 13.\nThe lemma below provides a construction of a child node for modality SC . Although the proof follows the outline of the proof of Lemma 25 for modality KC , it is significantly more involved because of the need to show that a transition from a parent node to a child node satisfies the constraints of the vote aggregation mechanism from Definition 13.\nLemma 28 For any epistemic state w ∈ W , any formula ¬SCψ ∈ hd(w), and any strategy profile s = {sa}a∈C ∈ V C , there is a state w′ ∈ W such that w →s w′ and ψ /∈ hd(w′).\nProof. Let Y0 be the following set of formulae\n{¬ψ} ∪ {ϕ | ∃D ⊆ C(SDϕ ∈ hd(w) ∧ ∀a ∈ D(pr1(sa) = ϕ))}.\nWe first show that set Y0 is consistent. Suppose the opposite. Thus, there must exist formulae ϕ1, . . . , ϕn ∈ Y0 and subsets D1, . . . , Dn ⊆ C such that (i) SDiϕi ∈ hd(w) for each integer i ≤ n, (ii) pr1(sa) = ϕi for each i ≤ n and each a ∈ Di, and (iii) set {¬ψ,ϕ1, . . . , ϕn} is inconsistent. Without loss of generality we can assume that formulae ϕ1, . . . , ϕn are pairwise distinct.\nClaim 2 Sets Di and Dj are disjoint for each i 6= j.\nProof of Claim. Assume that d ∈ Di ∩Dj , then pr1(sd) = ϕi and pr1(sd) = ϕj . Hence, ϕi = ϕj , which contradicts the assumption that formulae ϕ1, . . . , ϕn are pairwise distinct. Therefore, sets Di and Dj are disjoint for each i 6= j.\nBy Lemma 16, it follows from Claim 2 that set Y0 is consistent. Let Y be any maximal consistent extension of Y0 and w\n′ be the sequence w,∅, Y . In other words, w′ is an extension of sequence w by two additional elements: ∅ and Y .\nClaim 3 w′ ∈W .\nProof of Claim. By Definition 10, it suffices to show that, for each formula ϕ ∈ Φ, if K∅ϕ ∈ hd(w), then ϕ ∈ Y . Indeed, suppose that K∅ϕ ∈ hd(w). Thus, hd(w) ` H∅ϕ by Empty Coalition axiom. Hence, hd(w) ` S∅ϕ by Strategic Truth axiom. Then, S∅ϕ ∈ hd(w) due to the maximality of set hd(w). Therefore, ϕ ∈ Y0 ⊆ Y by the choice of sets Y0 and Y .\nLet > be any propositional tautology. For example, > could be formula ψ → ψ. Define strategy profile s′ = {s′a}a∈A as follows\ns′a = { sa, if a ∈ C, (>, w), otherwise.\n(18)\nClaim 4 For any formula ϕ ∈ Φ and any D ⊆ A, if SDϕ ∈ hd(w) and s′a = (ϕ,w) for each a ∈ D, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′).\nProof of Claim. Consider any formula ϕ ∈ Φ and any set D ⊆ A such that SDϕ ∈ hd(w) and s′a = (ϕ,w) for each agent a ∈ D. We need to show that ϕ ∈ hd(w′). Case 1: D ⊆ C. In this case, sa = s′a = (ϕ,w) for each a ∈ D by definition (18). Thus, ϕ ∈ Y0 ⊆ Y = hd(w′) by the choice of set Y0. Case 2: There is a0 ∈ D such that a0 /∈ C. Then, s′a0 = (>, w) by definition (18). Note that s′a0 = (ϕ,w) by the choice of the set D. Thus, (>, w) = (ϕ,w). Hence, formula ϕ is the tautology >. Therefore, ϕ ∈ hd(w′) because set hd(w′) is maximal.\nClaim 5 For any formula ϕ ∈ Φ and any D ⊆ A, if HDϕ ∈ hd(w) and pr1(s ′ a) = ϕ for each a ∈ D, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′).\nProof of Claim. Consider any formula ϕ ∈ Φ and any set D ⊆ A such that HDϕ ∈ hd(w) and pr1(s′a) = ϕ for each agent a ∈ D. We need to show that ϕ ∈ hd(w′). Case 1: D ⊆ C. In this case, pr1(sa) = pr1(s′a) = ϕ for each agent a ∈ D by definition (18) and the choice of set D. Thus, ϕ ∈ Y0 ⊆ Y = hd(w′) by the choice of set Y0. Case 2: There is agent a0 ∈ D such that a0 /∈ C. Then, s′a0 = (>, w) by definition (18). Note that pr1(s ′ a0) = ϕ by the choice of set D. Thus, > = ϕ.\nHence, formula ϕ is the tautology >. Therefore, ϕ ∈ hd(w′) because set hd(w′) is maximal.\nBy Definition 13, Claim 4 and Claim 5 together imply that (w, s′, w′) ∈M . Hence, w →s w′ by Definition 6 and definition (18). To finish the proof of the lemma, note that ψ /∈ hd(w′) because set hd(w′) is consistent and ¬ψ ∈ Y0 ⊆ Y = hd(w′).\nThe next lemma shows the construction of a child node for modality HC . The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 28 except that, instead of constructing a single child node, we construct two sibling nodes that are in complete harmony. The intuition was discussed at the beginning of Section 6.3.\nLemma 29 For any state w ∈W , any formula ¬HCψ ∈ hd(w), and any strategy profile s = {sa}a∈C ∈ V C , there are epistemic states w′, w′′ ∈ W such that ψ /∈ hd(w′′), w ∼C w′, and w′ →s w′′.\nProof. By Definition 12, for each a ∈ C, vote sa is a pair. Let\nY = {ϕ | KCϕ ∈ hd(w)}, and Z = {¬ψ} ∪ {ϕ | ∃D ⊆ C (HDϕ ∈ hd(w) ∧ ∀a ∈ D (pr1(sa) = ϕ))}.\nBy Lemma 20 where f(x) = pr1(sx), pair (Y,Z) is in harmony. By Lemma 21, there is a pair (Y ′, Z ′) in complete harmony such that Y ⊆ Y ′ and Z ⊆ Z ′. By Lemma 17 and Lemma 18, sets Y ′ and Z ′ are consistent. Let Y ′′ and Z ′′ be maximal consistent extensions of sets Y ′ and Z ′, respectively.\nRecall that set A is finite. Thus, set C ⊆ A is also finite. Let integer n be the cardinality of set C. Consider (n + 1) sequences w1, w2, . . . , wn+1, where sequence wk is an extension of sequence w that adds 2k additional elements:\nw1 = w,C, Y ′′ w2 = w,C, Y ′′, C, Y ′′ w3 = w,C, Y ′′, C, Y ′′, C, Y ′′\n. . . wn+1 = w,C, Y ′′, . . . , C, Y ′′︸ ︷︷ ︸\n2(n+1) elements\n.\nClaim 6 wk ∈W for each k ≤ n+ 1.\nProof of Claim. We prove the claim by induction on integer k. Base Case: By Definition 10, it suffices to show that if KCϕ ∈ hd(w), then ϕ ∈ hd(w1). Indeed, if KCϕ ∈ hd(w), then ϕ ∈ Y by the choice of set Y . Therefore, ϕ ∈ Y ⊆ Y ′ ⊆ Y ′′ = hd(w1). Induction Step: By Definition 10, it suffices to show that if KCϕ ∈ hd(wk), then ϕ ∈ hd(wk+1) for each k ≥ 1. In other words, we need to prove that if\nKCϕ ∈ Y ′′, then ϕ ∈ Y ′′, which follows from Truth axiom and the maximality of set Y ′′.\nBy the pigeonhole principle, there is i0 ≤ n such that pr2(sa) 6= wi0 for all a ∈ C. Let w′ be epistemic state wi0 . Thus,\npr2(sa) 6= w′ for each a ∈ C. (19)\nLet w′′ be the sequence w,∅, Z ′′. In other words, sequence w′′ is an extension of sequence w by two additional elements: ∅ and Z ′′. Finally, let strategy profile s′ = {s′a}a∈A be defined as follows\ns′a = { sa, if a ∈ C, (>, w′), otherwise.\n(20)\nClaim 7 w′′ ∈W .\nProof of Claim. By Definition 10, it suffices to show that if K∅ϕ ∈ hd(w), then ϕ ∈ hd(w′′) for each formula ϕ ∈ Φ. Indeed, by Empty Coalition axiom, assumption K∅ϕ ∈ hd(w) implies that hd(w) ` H∅ϕ. Hence, H∅ϕ ∈ hd(w) by the maximality of the set hd(w). Thus, ϕ ∈ Z by the choice of set Z. Therefore, ϕ ∈ Z ⊆ Z ′ ⊆ Z ′′ = hd(w′′).\nClaim 8 w ∼C w′.\nProof of Claim. By Definition 11, w ∼C wi for each integer i ≤ n + 1. In particular, w ∼C wi0 = w′.\nClaim 9 ψ /∈ hd(w′′).\nProof of Claim. Note that ¬ψ ∈ Z by the choice of set Z. Thus, ¬ψ ∈ Z ⊆ Z ′ ⊆ Z ′′ = hd(w′′). Therefore, ψ /∈ hd(w′′) due to the consistency of the set hd(w′′).\nClaim 10 Let ϕ be a formula in Φ and D be a subset of A. If SDϕ ∈ hd(w′) and s′a = (ϕ,w ′) for each a ∈ D, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′′).\nProof of Claim. Note that either set D is empty or it contains an element a0. In the latter case, element a0 either belongs or does not belong to set C. Case I: D = ∅. Recall that pair (Y ′, Z ′) is in complete harmony. Thus, by Definition 9, either ¬S∅ϕ ∈ Y ′ ⊆ Y ′′ = hd(w′) or ϕ ∈ Z ′ ⊆ Z ′′ = hd(w′′). Assumption SDϕ ∈ hd(w′) implies that ¬S∅ϕ /∈ hd(w′) due to the consistency of the set hd(w′) and the assumption D = ∅ of the case. Therefore, ϕ ∈ hd(w′′). Case II: there is an element a0 ∈ C ∩D. Thus, a0 ∈ C. Hence, pr2(sa0) 6= w′ by inequality (19). Then, sa0 6= (ϕ,w′). Thus, s′a0 6= (ϕ,w\n′) by definition (20). Recall that a0 ∈ C ∩D ⊆ D. This contradicts the assumption that s′a = (ϕ,w′) for each a ∈ D. Case III: there is an element a0 ∈ D \\C. Thus, s′a0 = (>, w\n′) by definition (20). At the same time, s′a0 = (ϕ,w\n′) by the second assumption of the claim. Hence, formula ϕ is the propositional tautology >. Therefore, ϕ ∈ hd(w′′) due to the maximality of the set hd(w′′).\nClaim 11 Let ϕ be a formula in Φ and D be a subset of A. If HDϕ ∈ hd(w′) and pr1(s ′ a) = ϕ for each a ∈ D, then ϕ ∈ hd(w′′).\nProof of Claim. Case I: D ⊆ C. Suppose that pr1(s′a) = ϕ for each a ∈ D and HDϕ ∈ hd(w′). Thus, ϕ ∈ Z by the choice of set Z. Therefore, ϕ ∈ Z ⊆ Z ′ ⊆ Z ′′ = hd(w′′). Case II: D * C. Consider any a0 ∈ D \\ C. Note that s′a0 = (>, w\n′) by definition (20). At the same time, pr1(s ′ aa) = ϕ by the second assumption of the claim. Hence, formula ϕ is the propositional tautology >. Therefore, ϕ ∈ hd(w′′) due to the maximality of the set hd(w′′).\nClaim 10 and Claim 11, by Definition 13, imply that (w′, {s′a}a∈A, w′′) ∈M . Thus, w′ →s w′′ by Definition 6 and definition (20). This together with Claim 6, Claim 7, Claim 8, and Claim 9 completes the proof of the lemma.\nDefinition 14 π(p) = {w ∈W | p ∈ hd(w)}.\nThis concludes the definition of tuple (W, {∼a}a∈A, V,M, π).\nLemma 30 Tuple (W, {∼a}a∈A, V,M, π) is an epistemic transition system.\nProof. By Definition 1, it suffices to show that for each w ∈W and each s ∈ V A there is w′ ∈W such that (w, s, w′) ∈M .\nRecall that set A is finite. Thus, ` ¬SA⊥ by Nontermination axiom. Hence, ¬SA⊥ ∈ hd(w). By Lemma 28, there is w′ ∈W such that w →s w′. Therefore, (w, s, w′) ∈M by Definition 6.\nLemma 31 w ϕ iff ϕ ∈ hd(w) for each epistemic state w ∈ W and each formula ϕ ∈ Φ.\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction on the structural complexity of formula ϕ. If formula ϕ is a propositional variable, then the required follows from Definition 7 and Definition 14. The cases of formula ϕ being a negation or an implication follow from Definition 7, and the maximality and the consistency of the set hd(w) in the standard way.\nLet formula ϕ have the form KCψ. (⇒) Suppose that KCψ /∈ hd(w). Then, by Lemma 25, there is w′ ∈ W such that w ∼C w′ and ψ /∈ hd(w′). Hence, w′ 1 ψ by the induction hypothesis. Therefore, w 1 KCψ by Definition 7. (⇐) Assume that KCψ ∈ hd(w). Consider any w′ ∈W such that w ∼C w′. By Definition 7, it suffices to show that w′ ψ. Indeed, ψ ∈ hd(w′) by Lemma 24. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, w′ ψ.\nLet formula ϕ have the form SCψ. (⇒) Suppose that SCψ /∈ hd(w). Then, ¬SCψ ∈ hd(w) due to the maximality of the set hd(w). Hence, by Lemma 28, for any strategy profile s ∈ V C , there is an epistemic state w′ ∈W such that w →s w′ and ψ /∈ hd(w′). Thus, by the\ninduction hypothesis, for any strategy profile s ∈ V C , there is a state w′ ∈ W such that w →s w′ and w′ 1 ψ. Then, w 1 SCψ by Definition 7. (⇐) Assume that SCψ ∈ hd(w). Consider strategy profile s = {sa}a∈C ∈ V C such that sa = (ψ,w) for each a ∈ C. By Lemma 26, for any epistemic state w′ ∈ W , if w →s w′, then ψ ∈ hd(w′). Hence, by the induction hypothesis, for any epistemic state w′ ∈ W , if w →s w′, then w′ ψ. Therefore, w SCψ by Definition 7.\nFinally, let formula ϕ have the form HCψ. (⇒) Suppose that HCψ /∈ hd(w). Then, ¬HCψ ∈ hd(w) due to the maximality of the set hd(w). Hence, by Lemma 29, for any strategy profile s ∈ V C , there are epistemic states w′, w′′ ∈W such that w ∼C w′, w′ →s w′′, and ψ /∈ hd(w′′). Thus, w′′ 1 ψ by the induction hypothesis. Therefore, w 1 HCψ by Definition 7. (⇐) Assume that HCψ ∈ hd(w). Consider a strategy profile s = {sa}a∈C ∈ V C such that sa = (ψ,w) for each a ∈ C. By Lemma 27, for all epistemic states w′, w′′ ∈ W , if w ∼C w′, and w′ →s w′′, then ψ ∈ hd(w′′). Hence, by the induction hypothesis, w′′ ψ. Therefore, w HCψ by Definition 7."
