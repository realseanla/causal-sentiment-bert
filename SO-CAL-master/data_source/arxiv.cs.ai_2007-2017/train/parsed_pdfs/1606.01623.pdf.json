MANLOVE, University of Glasgow BENJAMIN PLAUT, Carnegie Mellon University TUOMAS SANDHOLM, Carnegie Mellon University JAMES TRIMBLE, University of Glasgow\nA kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges—while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.\nIn this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our new models are competitive with all existing solvers—in many cases outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude.\nFinally, we note that our position-indexed chain-edge formulation can be modified in a straightforward way to take post-match edge failure into account, under the restriction that edges have equal probabilities of failure. Post-match edge failure is a primary source of inefficiency in presently-fielded kidney exchanges. We show how to implement such failure-aware matching in our model, and also extend the state-of-the-art general branch-and-price-based non-compact formulation for the failure-aware problem to run its pricing problem in polynomial time.\nAdditional Key Words and Phrases: Kidney exchange; matching markets; stochastic matching; integer programming; branch and price"

In the United States alone, the kidney transplant waiting list grew from 58,000 people in 2004 to 99,000 people in 2014 [Hart et al. 2016]. In order to increase the supply of kidneys for transplant, kidney exchange schemes now operate in several countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and South Korea.\nA kidney exchange [Rapaport 1986; Roth et al. 2004] is a centrally-administered barter exchange market for kidneys.

      "text" : "friend or family member who is willing to donate a kidney to him, but unable to do so due to blood- or tissue-type incompatibility, the patient may enter the exchange in the hope of exchanging his donor with the donor of another participating patient. Threeway exchanges are also possible, but most schemes do not carry out four-way or longer exchanges due to the requirement that transplants be carried out simultaneously, and the risk that one of the participants may need to withdraw, in which case the cycle does not go to execution and the pairs go back into the kidney exchange pool.\nThe scheme administrator carries out periodic “match runs” in which exchanges are selected in order to maximize the number of planned transplants, or a similar goal— perhaps prioritizing pediatric patients, or to those who have been waiting the longest.\nA more recent development has been the introduction of non-directed donors (NDDs) to kidney exchange schemes [Montgomery et al. 2006; Roth et al. 2006]. An NDD enters the scheme with the intention of donating a kidney, but without a paired recipient. Such a donor initiates a chain, in which the paired donor of each patient who receives a kidney donates a kidney to the next patient. In contrast to cyclic exchanges, chains can be carried out non-simultaneously, since patients later in the chain are not waiting to be “repaid” for a donation that has already been made. In practice, it is desirable to impose a cap on chain length, since there is an increasing chance that the final exchanges planned for a chain will not proceed as the chain length is increased (due to various reasons such as pre-transplant crossmatch incompatibility, death of a recipient before transplant, the recipient receiving a deceased-donor kidney, and so on).\nIn many fielded kidney exchanges, an optimal solution is found by using an integer programming (IP) solver to find a set of disjoint cyclic exchanges and chains that maximizes some scoring function. This approach has been tractable so far; Manlove and O’Malley [2015] report that each instance up to October 2014 in the United Kingdom’s National Living Donor Kidney Sharing Schemes (NLDKSS)—one of the largest kidney exchange schemes—could be solved in under a second, with similar results using stateof-the-art solvers at other large exchanges in the US [Anderson et al. 2015; Plaut et al. 2016a] and the Netherlands [Glorie et al. 2014]. However, there is an urgent need for faster kidney exchange algorithms, for three reasons: — Schemes have recently increased chain-length caps, and we expect further increases\nas more schemes evolve towards using nonsimultaneous extended altruistic donor (NEAD) chains [Rees et al. 2009], which can extend across dozens of transplants. — Opportunities exist for cross-border schemes, which will greatly increase the size of the problem to be solved; indeed, collaborations have already occurred between, for example, the USA and Greece, and between Portugal and Spain. — The run time for kidney exchange algorithms depends on the problem instance, and is difficult to predict. It is desirable to have improved algorithms to insure against the possibility that future instances will be intractable for current solvers. With that motivation, this paper presents new scalable integer-programming-based\napproaches to optimally clearing large kidney exchange schemes, including two models which can comfortably handle chain caps greater than 10."

      "text" : "in those theoretical models that appeared as kidney exchange became reality. Gametheoretic models of kidney exchange, where transplant centers are viewed as agents with a private type consisting of their internal pools, were presented and explored by Ashlagi and Roth [2014], Toulis and Parkes [2015], and Ashlagi et al. [2015]. Various forms of dynamism, like uncertainty over the possible future vertices in the pool [Ünver 2010; Ashlagi et al. 2013; Akbarpour et al. 2014] or uncertainty over the existence of particular edges [Blum et al. 2013; Dickerson et al. 2013; Blum et al. 2015] have been explored from both an economic and algorithmic efficiency point of view.\nPractical approaches to the kidney exchange clearing problem. The two fundamental IP models for kidney exchange are the cycle formulation, which includes one binary decision variable for each feasible cycle or chain, and the edge formulation, which includes one decision variable for each compatible pair of agents [Abraham et al. 2007; Roth et al. 2007]. In the cycle formulation, the number of constraints is sublinear in the input size, but the number of variables is exponential. In the edge formulation, the number of variables is linear but the number of constraints is exponential. Optimally solving these models has been an ongoing challenge for the past decade.\nConstantino et al. [2013] introduced the first two compact IP formulations for kidney exchange, where compact means that the counts of variables and constraints are polynomial in the size of the input. Their extended edge formulation was shown empirically to be effective in finding the optimal solution where the cycle-length cap is greater than 3, particularly on dense graphs. However, each of the compact formulations introduced by Constantino et al. has a weaker linear program (LP) relaxation than the cycle formulation, even in the absence of NDDs.\nThe EE-MTZ model [Mak-Hau 2015], another compact formulation, uses the variables and constraints of the extended edge formulation to model cycles and a variant of the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin model for the traveling salesman problem to model chains. The same paper introduces the exponentially-sized SPLIT-MTZ model, which adds redundant constraints to the edge formulation in order to tighten the LP relaxation.\nA number of kidney exchange algorithms use the cycle formulation with branch and price [Barnhart et al. 1998] to avoid the need to hold an exponential number of variables in memory [Abraham et al. 2007; Dickerson et al. 2013; Glorie et al. 2014; Klimentova et al. 2014; Plaut et al. 2016a]. These have been the fastest algorithms to date for the kidney exchange problem.\nAn alternative approach to avoiding the cost of keeping the entire model in memory has been constraint generation, using variants of the edge formulation [Abraham et al. 2007]. Anderson et al. [2015] describe an approach based on an algorithm for the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. This algorithm is particularly effective for solving instances where the cycle-length cap is 3 and there is no cap on the length of chains, but it is outperformed by branch-and-price-based approaches if a finite chain-length cap is used [Plaut et al. 2016a].\nAlternative objectives for the kidney exchange problem include maximizing the expected number of transplants subject to post-match arc and vertex failures [Dickerson et al. 2013; Pedroso 2014; Alvelos et al. 2015]. Some fielded exchanges use lexicographic optimisation of a hierarchy of objectives [Glorie et al. 2014; Manlove and O’Malley 2015]; we note that our models can be augmented to support this class of objective function."

Section 3 presents the positionindexed chain-edge formulation (PICEF) which compactly brings chains into the model via a polynomial number of decision variables; the number of cycle decision variables is exponential in just the maximum cycle length (which is typically only 3 or 4 in fielded exchanges). To address that latter exponential reliance on the cycle length, we also present a branch-and-price-based implementation of PICEF. Finally, in Appendix C we present the hybrid position-indexed edge formulation (HPIEF), which combines PIEF and PICEF to yield a compact formulation.\nThroughout, we prove new results regarding the tightness of the LPRs of our models relative to the current state of the art. The tightness of these relaxations hints that our formulations will be competitive in practice; toward that end, we provide extensive experimental evidence that they are. In particular, we show that at least one of PICEF and HPIEF is faster than the best solver from all those provably-optimal solvers contributed in earlier papers that we evaluated in 96.41% of instances considered, with the speed-ups being most evident for larger instance sizes and larger chain caps. In Section 6, we use real and generated data from two nationwide kidney exchange programs—one in the UK, and one in the US—to compare our formulations against other competitive solvers [Abraham et al. 2007; Klimentova et al. 2014; Anderson et al. 2015; Plaut et al. 2016a]. Our new formulations are on par or faster than all other solvers, outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude on many problem instances.\nFinally, we demonstrate that our PICEF formulation can be adapted straightforwardly to the so-called failure-aware model where arcs probabilistically fail after algorithmic match but before transplantation, and we show how to adapt a recent (noncompact) branch-and-price-based formulation due to Dickerson et al. [2013] to perform pricing in polynomial time (Section 6)."

The set of vertices V = {1, . . . , |V |} is partitioned into N = {1, . . . , |N |} representing the NDDs and P = {|N |+ 1, . . . , |N |+ |P |} representing the patient-donor pairs.\nFor each i ∈ N and each j ∈ P , A contains the arc (i, j) if and only if NDD i is compatible with patient j. For each i ∈ P and each j ∈ P \\{i}, A contains the arc (i, j) if and only if the paired donor1 of patient i is compatible with patient j. Each arc (i, j) ∈ A has a weight wij ∈ R+ representing the priority that the scheme administrator gives to that transplant. If the objective is to maximize the number of transplants, each arc has unit weight; most fielded exchanges use weights to encode various prioritization schemes and other value judgments about potential transplants.\nSince NDDs do not have paired patients, each vertex representing an NDD has no incoming arcs. Moreover, we assume that no patient is compatible with her own paired donor, and therefore that the digraph has no loops. (The IP models introduced in this\n1In this paper, we assume that each patient has a single paired donor. In practice, a patient may have multiple donors; this can be modeled by regarding such a patient i’s vertex in D as representing i and all of her paired donors; an arc (i, j) in D then represents compatibility between at least one of i’s donors and patient j. Our model can also handle patients with no paired donor by drawing a vertex with no out edges.\nPosition-Indexed Formulations for Kidney Exchange A:5\npaper can trivially be adapted to the case where loops exist by adding a binary variable for each loop and modifying the objective and capacity constraints accordingly.)\nWe use the term chain to refer to a path in the digraph initiated by an NDD vertex, and cycle to refer to a cycle in the directed graph (which must involve only vertices in P , since vertices in N have no incoming arcs). The weight wc of each cycle or chain c is defined as the sum of its arc weights.\nGiven a maximum cycle size K and a maximum chain length L, the kidney exchange problem is an optimization problem where the objective is to select a vertex-disjoint packing in D of cycles of size up to K and chains of length up to L that has maximum weight. The problem is NP-hard for realistic parameterizations of K and L [Abraham et al. 2007; Biró et al. 2009]. In practice, K is kept low due to the logistical constraint of scheduling all transplants simultaneously. At both the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) US-wide exchange and the UK’s NLDKSS, K = 3. The chain cap L is typically longer due to chains being executed non-simultaneously; yet, typically L 6= ∞ due to potential matches failing before transplantation. This paper addresses the realistic setting of small cycle cap K and large—but finite—chain cap L.\nFigure 1 shows a problem instance with |N | = 2 and |P | = 5. If each arc has unit weight and K = L = 3, then the bold arcs show an optimal solution: cycle ((3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 3)) and chain ((1, 7), (7, 6)), with a total weight of 5."

Basic reduced PIEF. In typical problem instances, there are many (i, j, k, l) tuples such that xlijk takes the value zero in any assignment that satisfies constraints (1b)(1d). For example, suppose that K = 4 and that Figure 3 is graph copy D1. Arc (6, 7) cannot be chosen at position 3 of a cycle, since the arc only appears in one cycle and it is at position 2 of that cycle. Hence, if we could eliminate variable x1673 from the integer program it would not change the optimal solution. Similarly, all variables for the arc (3, 4) within this graph copy could be eliminated, since this arc does not appear in any cycle of length less than 5.\nFollowing the approach used by Constantino et al. [2013] for the extended edge formulation, we eliminate variables as follows. For i, j ∈ V l, let dlij be the length of the shortest path in terms of arcs from i to j in Dl. For (i, j) ∈ Al, let\nKred(i, j, l) = {k : 1 ≤ k ≤ K ∧ dlli < k ∧ dljl ≤ (K − k)}.\nFor any k /∈ Kred(i, j, l), no cycle in graph copy Dl of length less than or equal to K contains (i, j) at position k, since either there is no sufficiently short path from l to i or there is no sufficiently short path from j to l. Note that Kred(i, j, l) ⊆ K(i, j, l). We can substitute Kred(i, j, l) for K(i, j, l) in (1a)-(1d), yielding a smaller integer program— PIEF-reduced (PIEFR)—with the same optimal solution.\n3.2.2. Elimination of variables at position 1 andK: the PIEFR2 formulation. In the PIEFR model with K ≥ 3, variables at position 1 are redundant, since xllj1 = 1 if and only if xlji2 = 1 for some i.

The final term on the left-hand side of constraint (2b) serves the same function for selected arcs at position K − 1, since an arc at position K is implicitly chosen.

We can reduce the number of variables in the reduced PIEF model by carefully choosing the order of vertex labels in the digraph D. We have found that relabelling the vertices in descending order of total degree is an effective heuristic to this end. To estimate the effect of this ordering heuristic on model size, we generated the PIEFR2 model for each of the ten PrefLib instances [Mattei and Walsh 2013] with 256 vertices and no NDDs. The heuristic reduced the variable count by a mean of 38 percent, and reduced the constraint count by a mean of 60 percent."

      "text" : "Our second new IP formulation, PICEF, uses a variant of PIEF for chains, and—like the cycle formulation—uses one binary variable for each cycle. The idea of using variables for arcs in chains and a variable for each cycle was introduced in the PC-TSPbased algorithm of Anderson et al. [2015]. The innovation in our IP model is the use of position indices on arc variables, which results in polynomial counts of constraints and arc-variables; this is in contrast to the exponential number of constraints in the PC-TSP-based model.\nUnlike PIEF, PICEF does not require copies of D. Intuitively, this is because a chain is a simpler structure than a cycle, with no requirement for a final arc back to the initial vertex.\nWe define K′(i, j), the set of possible positions at which arc (i, j) may occur in a chain in the digraph D. For i, j ∈ V such that (i, j) ∈ A,\nK′(i, j) = {{1} i ∈ N {2, . . . , L} i ∈ P .\nThus, any arc leaving an NDD can only be in position 1 of a chain, and any arc leaving a patient vertex may be in any position up to the cycle-length cap L, except 1.\nFor each (i, j) ∈ A and each k ∈ K′(i, j), create variable yijk, which takes value 1 if and only if arc (i, j) is selected at position k of some chain. For each cycle c in D of length up to K, define a binary variable zc to indicate whether c is used in a packing.\nFor example, consider the instance in Figure 4, in which |N | = 2 and |P | = 4. Suppose that K = 3 and L = 4, and suppose further that each arc has unit weight. The IP model includes variables y131, y141, and y241, corresponding to arcs leaving NDDs. For each k ∈ 2, 3, 4, the model includes variables y34k, y45k, y56k, y64k, and y65k, corresponding to arcs between donor-patient pairs at position k of a chain. Finally, the model includes zc variables for the cycles ((4, 5), (5, 6), (6, 4)) and ((5, 6), (6, 5)).\nA:10 J.P. Dickerson, D.F. Manlove, B. Plaut, T. Sandholm and J. Trimble\n1\n2\n3 4\n5\n6\nInequality (4b) is the capacity constraint for patients: each patient vertex is involved in at most one chosen cycle or incoming arc of a chain. Inequality (4c) is the capacity constraint for NDDs: each NDD vertex is involved in at most one chosen outgoing arc. The flow inequality (4d) ensures that patient-donor pair vertex i has an outgoing arc at position k + 1 of a selected chain only if i has an incoming arc at position k; we use an inequality rather than an equality since the final vertex of a chain will have an incoming arc but no outgoing arc. Theorem B.4 in Section B.1 establishes the correctness of the PICEF model.\nWe now give an example of each of the inequalities (4b–4d) for the instance in Figure 4. For i = 4, the capacity constraint (4b) ensures that y141 + y241 + y342 + y343 + y344 + z((4,5),(5,6),(6,4)) ≤ 1. For i = 1, the NDD capacity constraint (4c) ensures that y131 + y141 ≤ 1. For i = 5 and k = 2, the chain flow constraint (4d) ensures that z452 + z652 ≥ z563; that is, the outgoing arc (5, 6) can only be selected at position 3 of a chain if an incoming arc to vertex 5 is selected at position 2 of a chain.\nIn our example in Figure 4, the optimal objective value is 4. One satisfying assignment that gives this objective value is y131 = y342 = z((5,6),(6,5)) = 1, with all other variables equal to zero."

We now discuss a method for scaling PICEF to graphs with high cycle caps, or large graphs with many cycles; this method maintains the full set of arc decision variables, but only incrementally considers those corresponding to cycles.\nFormally, for V = P ∪N , the number of cycles of length at most K is O(|P |K), making explicit representation and enumeration of all cycles infeasible for large enough instances. With one decision variable per cycle, Abraham et al. [2007] could not even write the full integer program in memory for instances as small as 1000 pairs.\nBranch and price is a method where only a subset of the decision variables are kept in memory, and columns (in the case of PICEF, only those corresponding to cycle variables) are slowly added until correctness is proven at each node in a branch-and-bound search tree. If necessary, superfluous columns can also be removed from the model, in order to prevent its size from exceeding memory.\nThe following process occurs at each node in the search tree: first, the LP relaxation of the current model (which may contain only a small number of cycles) is solved. The next step is to generate positive price cycles: cycles that have the potential to improve the objective value if included in the model.\nThe price of a cycle c is given by ∑\n(i,j)∈c(wij−δi), where δi is the dual value of vertex i. While there exist any positive price cycles at a node in the search tree, optimality of the reduced LP has not yet been proved at that node. The pricing problem is to bring at least one new positive price cycle into the model, or prove that none exist. Multiple methods exist for solving the pricing problem in kidney exchange [Abraham et al. 2007; Glorie et al. 2014; Mak-Hau 2015; Plaut et al. 2016a]; in our experimental section, we use the cycle pricer of Glorie et al. [2014] with the bugfix of Plaut et al. [2016a].\nOnce no more positive price cycles exist, the reduced LP at a specific node is guaranteed to be optimal. However, it may not be integral: in this case, branching occurs, as in standard brand-and-bound tree search. In our experiments, we explore branches in depth-first-order unless optimality is proven at all nodes in the search tree."

Interestingly, BNP-PICEF tends to perform worse than the base PICEF and HPIEF; we hypothesize that this is because branch-and-price-based methods are necessarily more “heavyweight” than standard IP techniques, and the small size of presently-fielded kidney exchange pools may not yet warrant this more advanced technique. Perhaps most critically, both PICEF and HPIEF clear real match runs in both exchanges within seconds.\nIn the NLDKSS results, the wide fluctuation in mean run time as the chain cap is varied can be explained by the small sample size of available NLDKSS instances, and the fact that the algorithms other than HPIEF and PICEF occasionally timed out at one hour. By contrast, each of the HPIEF and PICEF runs on NLDKSS instances took less than five seconds to complete. We also note that the LP relaxation of PICEF and HPIEF are very tight in practice; the LPR bound equaled the IP optimum for 614 of the 663 runs carried out on NLDKSS data.\nWe remark that the BNP-DCD model due to Klimentova et al. [2014] was run on all NLDKSS instances where the chain cap L was equal to 0. Larger values of L could not be tested since the current implementation of the model in our possession does not accept NDDs in the input. However for the case that L = 0 the BNP-DCD model was the fastest for all NLDKSS instances.\nFinally we note that the solver of Glorie et al.

It was found that on average the execution time was 8.9 times slower than the fastest solver from among all the others executed on these instances as detailed at the beginning of Section 5.

This can occur for a variety of reasons, including more extensive medical testing performed before a surgery, a patient or donor becoming too sick to participate, or a patient receiving an organ from another exchange or from the deceased donor waiting list.\nTo address these post-match arc failures, Dickerson et al. [2013] augments the standard model of kidney exchange to include a success probability p for each arc in the graph. They show how to solve this model using branch and price, where the pricing problem is solved in time exponential in the chain and cycle cap. Prior compact formulations—and, indeed, prior “edge formulations” like those due to Abraham et al. [2007], Constantino et al. [2013], and Anderson et al. [2015]—are not expressive enough to allow for generalization to this model. Intuitively, while a single arc failure prevents an entire cycle from executing, chains are capable of incremental execution, yielding utility from the NDD to the first arc failure. Thus, the expected utility gained from an arc in a chain is dependent on where in the chain that arc is located, which is not expressed in those models."

[2014] show how the arc weights and dual values can be collapsed into just arc weights, and reduce the deterministic pricing problem to finding negative-weight cycles of length at most K in a directed graph. In this section, we use “length” to denote the number of vertices in a cycle, not its weight.\nThe discounted price of a cycle is p|c| ∑ (i,j)∈c wij − ∑ j∈c δj . Since the utility of an arc now depends on what cycle it ends up in, we cannot collapse arc weights and dual values without knowing the length of the cycle containing it.\nWith this motivation, we augment the algorithm to run O(K) iterations for each source vertex: one for each possible final cycle length. On each iteration, we know exactly how much arc weights will be worth in the final cycle, so we can reduce the discounted pricing problem to the deterministic pricing problem.\nPseudocode for the failure-aware cycle pricing algorithm is given by GETDISCOUNTEDPOSITIVEPRICECYCLES. Let w and δ be the arc weights and dual values respectively in the original graph. The function GETNEGATIVECYCLES is the deterministic pricing algorithm due to Plaut et al.

Validity of the PIEF model LEMMA A.1. Any assignment of values to the xlijk that respects the PIEF constraints yields a vertex-disjoint set of cycles of length no greater than K.\nPROOF. We show this by demonstrating that in each graph copy, the set of selected edges is either empty, or composes a single cycle of length no greater than K.\nLet l ∈ P be given such that at least one edge is selected in graph copy Dl, and let kmax be the highest position k such that xlijk = 1 for some i, j. Any selected edge (i, j) at position kmax in graph copy Dl must point to l, as otherwise the flow conservation constraint (1c) would be violated at vertex j. Furthermore, there must be no more than one edge selected at position kmax in graph copy Dl, as otherwise the capacity constraint (1c) for vertex l would be violated.\nThe flow conservation constraints (1b) ensure that we can follow a path backwards from the selected edge at position kmax to a selected edge at position 1, and also that at most one edge is selected at each position. Since the edge at position 1 must start at vertex l by the construction of K(i, j, l), we have shown that graph copy Dl contains a selected cycle beginning and ending at l, and that this graph copy does not contain any other selected edges.\nConstraint (1b) ensures that the vertex-disjointness condition is satisfied.\nLEMMA A.2.

Our strategy is to begin by assigning zero to each cycle formulation variable zc(c ∈ C), and to make a series of decreases in PIEF variables and corresponding increases in cycle formulation variables, ending when all of the PIEF variables are set to zero. We maintain three invariants after each such step. First, the sum of the PIEF and cycle formulation objective values remains ZPIEF . Second, the constraints of the relaxed PIEF are satisfied. Third, the following vertex capacity constraint—which combines the capacity constraints from the PIEF and the cycle formulation—is satisfied for each vertex.∑\nl∈V ∑ i:(i,j)∈Al ∑ k∈K(i,j,l) xlijk + ∑ c:j∈c zc ≤ 1 j ∈ P\nIf any of the PIEF variables takes a non-zero value, then we can select i1, i2, l such that i1 = l and xli1i21 > 0.

Validity of the PICEF model LEMMA B.1. Any assignment of values to the yijk that respects constraints (4c) and (4d) and such that ∑ j:(j,i)∈A ∑ k∈K(j,i) yjik ≤ 1 (6)\nfor all i ∈ P , yields a vertex-disjoint set chains of length no greater than L. PROOF. We say that arc (i, j) is selected at position k if and only if zijk = 1. Our proof has three parts. We first give a procedure to construct a set S of chains of length no greater than L, where each chain in S consists only of selected edges. We then show that these chains are vertex-disjoint, and that any selected edge appears in some chain in S.\nBy constraint (4c), each i ∈ N has at most one selected outgoing arc. For each i ∈ N that has an outgoing arc (i, j1), we begin to construct chain c by letting c = ((i, j1))— a sequence containing one edge. Vertex j1 has at most one selected outgoing arc at position 2, by constraint (4d). If such an arc (j1, j2) exists, we add it to our chain. We continue to add edges (j2, j3), (j3, j4), . . . , until we reach k such that a selected edge from jk at position k + 1 does not exist. The chain c will therefore be a path of selected edges at positions 1, . . . , |c|, where the length of c can be no greater than L since no variable in the model has position greater than L. Add the chain c to S.\nBy constraint (4c), no vertex in N can appear in two chains in S. By constraint (4b), the same is true for vertices in P . Hence, the chains in S are vertex disjoint.\nTo complete the proof, we show that any selected edge must be part of one of these chains in S. Let a variable zijk taking the value 1 be given. By applying constraint (4d) repeatedly, we can see that there must exist be a path of length k from an NDD h to j, containing only selected edges. Let c ∈ S be the chain starting at h. Since no vertex in c has two selected outgoing arcs, there must must exist a unique path of length k from h, and (i, j) must therefore be the kth edge of c.\nLEMMA B.2. Any assignment of values to the yijk and zc that respects the PICEF constraints yields a vertex-disjoint set cycles of length no greater than K and chains no greater than L.\nPROOF. We call a cycle c such that zc = 1 a selected cycle, and an arc (i, j) such that zijk = 1 for some k a selected arc.\nBy (4b), the selected cycles are vertex disjoint. By Lemma B.1 the selected arcs compose a set of vertex-disjoint chains, each of which has length bounded by L (The conditions of the lemma are satisfied since constraint (4b) implies (6)).\nIt remains to show that no selected cycle shares a vertex with a selected arc. Suppose, to the contrary, that some selected cycle c shares vertex i ∈ P with a selected arc a. Vertex i cannot be the target of a, since constraint (4b) would be violated if i appears both in selected cycle c and as the target of selected arc a. Hence a = (i, j) for some"

In the cycle formulation, this instance has no admissible cycles, and the only admissible chains are 1 → 2 → 3 → 4, 1 → 5 → 6 → 7, and their prefixes. Since the longest chain has length 3 and any the sum of chain-variables containing vertex 1 may not exceed 1, we can see that the optimal objective value to the LPR of the cycle formulation is 3.\nWe can achieve an objective value of 7/2 to the LPR of PICEF, by letting y121 = y232 = y343 = y151 = y562 = y673 = y754 = 1/2.\nTHEOREM 4.2. Let z ∈ R+ be given. There exists a problem instance for which ZPICEF/ZCF > z, where ZPICEF is the objective value of the LPR of PICEF and ZCF is the objective value of the LPR of the cycle formulation.\nPROOF. We give a family of graphs, parameterised by K and L, for which ZPICEF is strictly greater than ZCF . Given a constant cycle cap of K and a chain cap of L (which can effectively be infinite, if L = |V |), the graphs are constructed as follows. For i ∈ [L−K−1], create a cycle 〈vi1, vi2, . . . , viK+1〉 such that vi+11 = vi2 for each i ∈ [1, L−K−2]; the cycle is otherwise disjoint from the rest of the graph. Connect a single altruist a to v11 ; the altruist is otherwise disjoint from the rest of the graph. Figure 8 visualizes the constructed graph.\nThe maximum cardinality disjoint packing of cycles of length at mostK and chains of length at most L is the unique chain (a, v11 , v21 , . . . , v L−K−1 1 , v L−K−1 2 , . . . , v L−K−1 K+1 ). Thus,\nPosition-Indexed Formulations for Kidney Exchange App–5\nOPT = L, where OPT is the optimal objective value to the integer program. Indeed, there are no legal cycles of length at most K in the graph, and at most one chain can be in any feasible solution due to the shared altruist a, so the (unique, by construction) longest chain is optimal.\nThe LPR of the PICEF representation of this instance will assign weight of 1/2 to each edge in the graph, for a total objective of ZPICEF = 1/2 + (L+K − 1)(K+12 ).\nThe LPR of the cycle formulation representation will create variables for each feasible cycle and chain in the graph. There are no feasible cycles in the graph. All chains in the graph share the edge (a, v11); thus all chains intersect and all chains contain a. Thus, the sole binding constraint in the LPR of the cycle formulation is that the altruist node a appears in at most one chain. For chain decision variables xc ∈ [0, 1], this problem can be rewritten as\nmax ∑ c |c|xc subject to ∑ c xc ≤ 1\nThis constraint matrix is totally unimodular, and thus the LP optimum is integral (and is the IP optimum, or ZCF = OPT = L).\nThe ratio of ZPICEF to ZCF is thus\n1\n2L +\n( 1 +\nK − 1 L\n)( K + 1\n2\n)\nwhich can be made arbitrarily large by increasing K."

Therefore Algorithm 1 returns at least one discounted positive price cycle.\nD.2. Insufficiency of previous algorithms for the failure-aware pricing problem The pricing problem in the deterministic context, where post-match failures are not considered, is known to be solvable in polynomial time for cycles [Glorie et al. 2014; Plaut et al. 2016a] but not chains [Plaut et al. 2016b]. In Section 6.2, we presented Algorithm 1, a polynomial-time algorithm for the pricing problem for cycles in the failure-aware context, for uniform success probability. In this section, we show how the basic algorithm for the deterministic pricing problem is not sufficient for the failureaware context.\nThe algorithm for the deterministic setting initiates a Bellman-Ford style search to find negative cycles. Bellman-Ford is run P times: on each iteration a different vertex representing a donor-patient pair is the source. After Bellman-Ford has been run from the source s for K − 1 steps, suppose there is a path ρ from s to some vertex v with weight w(ρ), and there is an arc from v back to s with weight wvs. If w(ρ) + wvs < 0, then ρ ∪ (v, s) is a negative cycle [Glorie et al. 2014; Plaut et al. 2016a].\nFor consistency, in this section we discuss finding discounted negative price cycles, which is trivially equivalent to finding discounted positive price cycles by reversing the signs on all arc weights and dual values. Therefore, we are looking for cycles c satisfying ∑ j∈c δj − pn ∑ (i,j)∈c wij < 0.\nConsider a straightforward modification to the algorithm from the deterministic setting, where each path now separately remembers its accumulated sum of dual values, sum of arc weights, and length. All of these can be easily recorded during the BellmanFord update step without altering the algorithm’s complexity.\nThe issue arises when comparing paths. Figure 9 gives an example of this. Consider running Bellman-Ford with s as the source and K = 3. The path (s, v2, v3) is preferable to (s, v1, v3), since we will end with the 3-cycle 〈s, v2, v3〉 which has weight p3(−ηp3 ) + η − 1 = −1. However, suppose K = 4, and we removed the arc (v3, s). Then 〈s, v2, v3〉 is no longer a cycle, and the path (s, v1, v3, v4) will have weight p4( ηp3 − 1) + η − 1 = η − pη − p4 − 1 > 0, assuming η is large and p is not close to 1. However, the path (s, v1, v3, v4) would lead to a discounted negative cycle with weight −p4. The algorithm from the deterministic setting cannot compare two paths without knowing the final cycle length.\nApp–8 J.P. Dickerson, D.F. Manlove, B. Plaut, T. Sandholm and J. Trimble"

Constantino et al.

Their extended edge formulation was shown empirically to be effective in finding the optimal solution where the cycle-length cap is greater than 3, particularly on dense graphs. However, each of the compact formulations introduced by Constantino et al. has a weaker linear program (LP) relaxation than the cycle formulation, even in the absence of NDDs. The EE-MTZ model [Mak-Hau 2015], another compact formulation, uses the variables and constraints of the extended edge formulation to model cycles and a variant of the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin model for the traveling salesman problem to model chains. The same paper introduces the exponentially-sized SPLIT-MTZ model, which adds redundant constraints to the edge formulation in order to tighten the LP relaxation. A number of kidney exchange algorithms use the cycle formulation with branch and price [Barnhart et al. 1998] to avoid the need to hold an exponential number of variables in memory [Abraham et al. 2007; Dickerson et al. 2013; Glorie et al. 2014; Klimentova et al. 2014; Plaut et al. 2016a].

Section 3 presents the positionindexed chain-edge formulation (PICEF) which compactly brings chains into the model via a polynomial number of decision variables; the number of cycle decision variables is exponential in just the maximum cycle length (which is typically only 3 or 4 in fielded exchanges). To address that latter exponential reliance on the cycle length, we also present a branch-and-price-based implementation of PICEF. Finally, in Appendix C we present the hybrid position-indexed edge formulation (HPIEF), which combines PIEF and PICEF to yield a compact formulation. Throughout, we prove new results regarding the tightness of the LPRs of our models relative to the current state of the art. The tightness of these relaxations hints that our formulations will be competitive in practice; toward that end, we provide extensive experimental evidence that they are. In particular, we show that at least one of PICEF and HPIEF is faster than the best solver from all those provably-optimal solvers contributed in earlier papers that we evaluated in 96.41% of instances considered, with the speed-ups being most evident for larger instance sizes and larger chain caps.

Our new formulations are on par or faster than all other solvers, outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude on many problem instances. Finally, we demonstrate that our PICEF formulation can be adapted straightforwardly to the so-called failure-aware model where arcs probabilistically fail after algorithmic match but before transplantation, and we show how to adapt a recent (noncompact) branch-and-price-based formulation due to Dickerson et al.

    "abstractText" : "A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a kidney swap willing but incompatible donors. Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard. Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney. The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges—while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice. While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice. In this paper, we address the tractable clearing of kidney exchanges with short cycles and chains that are long but bounded. This corresponds to the practice at most modern fielded kidney exchanges. We introduce three new integer programming formulations, two of which are compact. Furthermore, one of these models has a linear programming relaxation that is exactly as tight as the previous tightest formulation (which was not compact) for instances in which each donor has a paired patient. On real data from the UNOS nationwide exchange in the United States and the NLDKSS nationwide exchange in the United Kingdom, as well as on generated realistic large-scale data, we show that our new models are competitive with all existing solvers—in many cases outperforming all other solvers by orders of magnitude. Finally, we note that our position-indexed chain-edge formulation can be modified in a straightforward way to take post-match edge failure into account, under the restriction that edges have equal probabilities of failure. Post-match edge failure is a primary source of inefficiency in presently-fielded kidney exchanges. We show how to implement such failure-aware matching in our model, and also extend the state-of-the-art general branch-and-price-based non-compact formulation for the failure-aware problem to run its pricing problem in polynomial time.",
