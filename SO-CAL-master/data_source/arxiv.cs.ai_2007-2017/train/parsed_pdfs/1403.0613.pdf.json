      "text" : "Qualitative spatial reasoning is a common subfield of artificial intelligence and geographical information science, and has applications ranging from natural language understanding [13], robot navigation [47, 19], geographic information systems (GISs) [17], sea navigation [55], to high level interpretation of video data [48, 11].\nTypically, the qualitative approach represents spatial information by introducing a relation model on a domain of spatial entities, which could be points, line segments, rectangles, or arbitrary regions. In the literature, such a relation model is often called a qualitative calculus [34]. In the past three decades, dozens of spatial (as well as temporal) qualitative calculi have been proposed in the literature (cf. [10, 44]). Among these, Interval Algebra (IA) [1] and the RCC8 algebra [41] are widely known as the most influential qualitative calculi for representing qualitative temporal and, respectively, spatial information. Other well-known qualitative calculi include Point Algebra (PA) [52], Cardinal Relation Algebra (CRA) [33], Rectangle Algebra (RA) [24], the RCC5 algebra [41], etc.\nUsing a qualitative calculusM, we represent spatial or temporal information in terms of basic or non-basic relations in M, and formulate a spatial or temporal problem as a set of qualitative constraints (called a qualitative constraint network). A qualitative constraint has the form (xRy), which specifies that the two variables x, y are related by the relation R. The consistency problem is to decide whether a set of qualitative constraints can be satisfied simultaneously. The consistency problem has been investigated in depth for many qualitative calculi in the literature, e.g., [52, 51, 33, 40, 39, 43, 42, 14, 56, 37, 28, 35, 46, 30].\nIn this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant qualitative constraints. Given a set Γ of qualitative constraints, we say a constraint (xRy) in Γ is redundant if it is entailed by the rest of Γ, i.e., removing (xRy) from Γ will not change the solution set of Γ. It is natural to ask when a network contains redundant constraints and how to get a non-redundant subset without changing the solution set. We call a subset of Γ a prime subnetwork of Γ if it contains no redundant constraints and has the same solution set as Γ.\nThe redundancy problem (i.e., the problem of determining if a constraint is redundant in a network) was first considered by Egenhofer and Sharma [18] for topological constraints. They observed that a minimal set (i.e., a prime subnetwork) contains somewhere between (n − 1) and (n2 − n)/2 nontrivial relations, but did not provide efficient algorithms for deriving such a minimal set even for basic topological constraints. In a recent paper, Wallgrün [53] proposed two algorithms to approximately find the prime subnetwork. As observed in [53], and explored in more detail in Section 6, neither of these two algorithms is guaranteed to provide the optimal simplification.\nThe redundancy problem is also related to the minimal label problem (cf. [38, 7, 20, 36]). A qualitative constraint network Γ is called minimal if for each constraint (xRy) in Γ, R is the minimal (i.e., the strongest) relation between x, y that is entailed by Γ. Roughly speaking, the minimal network removes ‘redundant’ or ‘unnecessary’ relations from each constraint, while the redundancy problem removes ‘redundant’ or ‘unnecessary’ constraints from the constraint network.\nWe show in this paper that it is in general co-NP hard to determine if a constraint is redundant in a qualitative constraint network. But if all constraints in Γ are taken from a tractable subclass1 S then a prime subnetwork can be found in polynomial time. For example, if S is a tractable subclass of RCC5 or RCC8 that contains all basic relations, then we can find a prime subnetwork in O(n5) time. Furthermore, if S is a subalgebra of RCC5 or RCC8 in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections, then Γ has a unique prime subnetwork, which is obtained by removing all redundant constraints from Γ. We also devise a cubic time algorithm for computing this unique prime subnetwork, which has the same time complexity as the two approximate algorithms of Wallgrün [53].\nAs a byproduct, we identify an important class of subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which, called distributive subalgebras, are subalgebras of qualitative calculi in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections. We show that any path-consistent network over such a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal, where weakly global consistency is a notion similar to but weaker than the well-known notion of global consistency (cf. Definition 5). For RCC8, we identify two maximal distributive subalgebras which are not contained in any other distributive subalgebras, one contains 41 relations and the other contains 64. The 41 relations contained in the first subalgebra are exactly\n1Here a subclass S is tractable if the consistency of any constraint network defined over S can be determined in polynomial time.\nthe convex RCC8 relations identified in [7]. In this paper, we are mainly interested in topological constraints, as these are the most important kind of qualitative spatial information. A large part of our results can easily be transplanted to other qualitative calculi like PA, IA, CRA and RA. In particular, letM be one of PA, IA, CRA and RA and S a distributive subalgebra ofM over which path-consistency implies consistency. Then we can show that any path-consistent network overM is globally consistent and minimal. For ease of presentation, we state and prove these results only for RCC5 and RCC8, but indicate in Table 5 which result is applicable to which calculus."

      "heading" : "1.1. Motivation",
      "text" : "As in the case of propositional logic formulas [32], redundancy of qualitative constraints “often leads to unnecessary computation, wasted storage, and may obscure the structure of the problem” [4].2 Finding a prime subnetwork can be useful in at least the following aspects: a) computing and storing the relationships between spatial objects and hence saving space for storage and communication; b) facilitating comparison (or measure the distance) between different constraint networks; c) unveiling the essential network structure of a network (e.g., being a tree or a graph with a bounded tree-width); and d) adjusting geometrical objects to meet topological constraints [53].\nTo further motivate our discussion, we focus on one specific application to illustrate the application area a. and briefly explain how redundancy checking or finding a prime subnetwork helps to solve the application areas b–d.\nFigure 1 gives a small example of a set of spatial regions formed by the geographic “footprints” associated with placenames in the Southampton area of the UK. The footprints are derived from crowd-sourced data, formed from the convex hull of the sets of coordinate locations at which individuals used the placenames on social media (cf. [50, 25]). Communicating and reasoning with the qualitative aspects of such data may require the storage and manipulation of large numbers of complex geometries with millions of vertices or large constraint networks with millions of relations.\nEven for the small example in Figure 1, the 84 footprints then require 84 ∗ 83/2 = 3486 stored relations. The moderate-sized footprint data set from which Figure 1 is adapted contains a total of 3443 footprints which leads to a constraint network with 5, 925, 403 relations. Similarly, a moderate-sized geographic data\n2It is worth noting that redundancy can also enhance propagation during computation (cf. [9]).\nset of only 1559 statistical areas in Tasmania, explored further in later sections, contains in total 3, 093, 551 vertices. In the case of both footprints and statistical areas, many of the relationships can be inferred, and computing the prime subnetwork can potentially reduce the number of stored relationships to be approximately linear in the number of regions (i.e., average-case space complexity of O(n)), as opposed to linear in the number of relations (i.e., space complexity Θ(n2)) (see Section 6). In the case of the Southampton constraint network, 1324 redundant relations lead to a prime subnetwork with only 2162 relations needing to be stored. For the full data set, 5, 604, 200 redundant relations lead to a prime subnetwork of just 321, 203 relations (in contrast to the full constraint network of almost 6 million relations).\nAs for application area b., suppose Γ,Γ′ are two constraint networks over the\nsame set of n variables. The similarity of Γ and Γ′ can be measured by computing the distance of each constraint (xRy) in Γ with the corresponding constraint (xR′y) in Γ′ and sum them up (see e.g., [12, 54, 29]), i.e.,\ndist(Γ,Γ′) = ∑ {dist(R,R′) : (xRy) ∈ Γ and (xR′y) ∈ Γ′}.\nClearly, if Γ and Γ′ are complete networks, we need O(n2) additions. This number, however, can be significantly reduced if we use prime subnetworks. Let Γpr and Γ′pr be, respectively, prime subnetworks of Γ and Γ ′. We define\ndistpr(Γ,Γ′) = ∑ {dist(R,R′) : (xRy) ∈ Γpr or (xR′y) ∈ Γ′pr}.\nThat is, the distance of Γ and Γ′ is approximated by distpr(Γ,Γ′), which only involves constraints in either Γpr or Γ′pr. If Γpr and Γ ′ pr are sparse enough, i.e., they contain a small number of (non-redundant) constraints, this will significantly simplify the comparison of two constraint networks.\nIn the case of application area c., a prime subnetwork unveils the essential network structure, or the skeleton, of a network, and the relation between a prime subnetwork and a constraint network is analogous to the relation between a spanning tree/forest [6] and a graph. Moreover, by the results of [5] and [26], we know it is tractable to determine the consistency of a constraint network with a bounded tree-width. Therefore, in general, checking the consistency of a prime subnetwork will be easier than checking the consistency of the network itself.\nAs for application area d., Wallgrün [53] proposed a method for exploiting qualitative spatial reasoning for topological adjustment of spatial data. To simplify the complexity of topological adjustment, he suggested replacing the original constraint network (say Γ) by an equivalent one (say Γ′) which has fewer redundant constraints. It is clear that the fewer constraints contained in Γ′ the better it is. A prime subnetwork is, roughly speaking, an optimal solution and contains fewest constraints. Therefore, replacing Γ with a prime subnetwork will significantly simplify the complexity of topological adjustment.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We first recall the RCC5 and RCC8 constraint languages and introduce the notion of distributive subalgebras in Section 2, and then define the key notions of redundant constraint and prime subnetwork in Section 3. In Section 4 we show that consistent RCC5 or RCC8 networks over distributive subalgebras have unique prime subnetworks. In Section 5 we compare our results with related works. In Section 6 we present a\ndetailed evaluation of a practical implementation of our algorithm, in comparison with the approximations proposed by Wallgrün [53]. Section 7 concludes the paper and outlines future research.\nAn extended abstract of this paper was presented in KR-2014 as a short paper."

For example, the composition of DR and itself is not an RCC5 relation. This is because, for example, PO intersects with, but is not contained in, DR ◦DR, where ◦ denotes the relational composition operator. In fact, there are three regions a, b, c such that aPOc and aDR b, bDR c. This shows that PO ∩ DR ◦ DR is nonempty. Let d, e be two regions such that dPO e and d∪e = R2. Clearly, there\nis no region f such that dDR f and f DR e hold simultaneously. Therefore PO is not contained in DR ◦DR.\nFor two RCC5/8 relations R and S, we call the smallest relation in RCC5/8 that contains R ◦ S the weak composition of R and S, written R S [16, 31].\nThe weak compositions of RCC5 and RCC8 basic relations are summarised in, respectively, Table 1 and Table 2 (from [41]). For each pair of RCC5/8 basic relations (α, β), the table cell corresponding to (α, β) contains all basic relations that are contained in α β.

      "text" : "LetM be a qualitative calculus with domain U . A qualitative constraint over M has the form (xRy), where x, y are variables taking values from U and R is a relation (not necessarily basic) in M. Given a set Γ of qualitative constraints over variables V = {v1, v2, ..., vn} and an assignment σ : V → U , we say σ is a solution of Γ if (σ(vi), σ(vj)) satisfies the constraints in Γ that relate vi to vj for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. We say Γ is consistent or satisfiable if it has a solution.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume\n• for each pair of variables vi, vj , there is at most one constraint in Γ that relates vi to vj;\n• for each pair of variables vi, vj , if there is no constraint in Γ that relates vi to vj , we say vi is related to vj by ?, the universal relation inM;\n• for each pair of variables vi, vj , the constraint in Γ that relates vi to vj is the converse of the constraint that relates vj to vi;\n• for each variable vi, the constraint in Γ that relates vi to itself is the identity relation (e.g., EQ in RCC5/8).\nIn this sense, we call Γ a network of constraints, and denote by for example Rij the constraint that relates vi to vj . Let Γ = {viRijvj: 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} and Γ′ = {viR′ijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} be two constraint networks overM. We say Γ and Γ′ are equivalent if they have the same set of solutions; and say Γ refines Γ′ if Rij ⊆ R′ij for all (i, j). We say a constraint network Γ is a basic network if each constraint is either a basic relation or the universe relation; and say a basic network is complete if there are no universal relations. In this paper, we also call every complete basic network that refines Γ a scenario of Γ.\nSuppose S is a subclass ofM. We say a constraint network Γ = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is over S if Rij ∈ S for every pair of variables vi, vj . The consistency problem over S, written as CSP(S), is the decision problem of the consistency of an arbitrary constraint network over S. The consistency problem over PA (i.e., CSP(PA)) is in P [52, 51] and the consistency problems over IA, CRA, RA and RCC5/8 are NP-complete [40, 33, 3, 43]. We say S is a tractable subclass of M if CSP(S) is tractable. It is well-known that these calculi all have large tractable subclasses, in particular, RCC8 has three maximal tractable subclasses that contain all basic relations [43, 42] and RCC5 has only one [27].\nThe consistency of a qualitative constraint network can be approximately determined by a local consistency algorithm. We say a network Γ = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is path-consistent3 if for every 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n, we have4\n∅ 6=Rij ⊆ Rik Rkj.\nIn general, path-consistency can be enforced by calling the following rule until an\n3For PA, IA, CRA and RA, since weak composition is composition, this definition of pathconsistency is equivalent to that for finite constraint satisfaction problems [38]; for RCC5/8, the two definitions are different mainly in the use of weak composition instead of composition.\n4Recall we have assumed that Rji is the converse of Rij for each pair of variables vi, vj .\nempty constraint occurs (then Γ is inconsistent) or the network becomes stable5\nRij ← (Rik Rkj) ∩Rij,\nwhere 1 ≤ i, j, k ≤ n are arbitrary. A cubic time algorithm, henceforth called the path-consistency algorithm or PCA, has been devised to enforce path-consistency. For any qualitative constraint network Γ, the PCA either detects inconsistency of Γ or returns a path-consistent network, written Γp, which is equivalent to Γ and also known as the algebraic closure or a-closure of Γ [34]. It is easy to see that in this case Γp refines Γ, i.e., we have Sij ⊆ Rij for each constraint (viSijvj) in Γp.\nFor RCC5/8 constraint networks, we have\nProposition 3 (from [42]). Let S be a tractable subclass of RCC5/8 which contains all basic relations. An RCC5/8 network Γ over S is consistent if applying PCA to Γ does not detect inconsistency.\nIn particular, we have\nProposition 4 (from [39]). A basic RCC5/8 network Γ is consistent if it is pathconsistent.\nConsistency is closely related to the notions of minimal network (cf. [7, 20, 36]) and global consistency.\nDefinition 5. Let M be a qualitative calculus with domain U . Suppose Γ = {viTijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a qualitative constraint network overM and V = {v1, ..., vn}. For a pair of variables vi, vj ∈ V (i 6= j) and a basic relation α in Tij , we say α is feasible if there exists a solution (a1, a2, . . . , an) in U of Γ such that (ai, aj) is an instance of α. We say Γ is minimal if α is feasible for every pair of variables vi, vj (i 6= j) and every basic relation α in Tij .\nWe say Γ is weakly globally consistent (globally consistent, respectively) if any consistent scenario (solution, respectively) of Γ↓V ′ can be extended to a consistent scenario (solution, respectively) of Γ, where V ′ is any nonempty subset of V and Γ↓V ′ is the restriction of Γ to V ′.\n5Under the assumption that initially we have Rji = R−1ij for every i 6= j, we do not need to call updating rules like Rji ← R−1ij , as this can be achieved by calling Rji ← (Rjk Rki) ∩ Rji after Rij ← (Rik Rkj) ∩ Rij is called. This will simplify the discussion in, for example, the proof of Lemma 20.\nThe notion of weakly global consistency is weaker than the notion of global consistency. The latter requires that every partial solution can be extended to obtain a global solution, which is too strong for even complete basic RCC5/8 networks. But the two notions are equivalent for PA, IA, CRA and RA as consistent basic networks over these calculi are all globally consistent.\nWhile every consistent RCC5/8 constraint network has a unique minimal network, it is in general NP-hard to compute it [36]. The following result shows that every weakly globally consistent network is also minimal.\nProposition 6. Let M be a qualitative calculus with domain U . Suppose Γ = {viTijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a qualitative constraint network overM. If Γ is weakly globally consistent, then it is minimal.\nProof. For every pair of variables vi, vj (i 6= j) and every basic relation α in Tij , it is clear that {viαvj} is a consistent scenario of Γ↓{vi,vj}. Because Γ is weakly globally consistent, we can extend this to a consistent scenario of Γ. In other words, there exists a solution (a1, a2, . . . , an) of Γ in U such that (ai, aj) is an instance of α. This shows that Γ is minimal.\nIn what follows, we write Γm for the minimal network of Γ, and Γp for the a-closure of Γ."

A subclass S of M is called a distributive subalgebra if\n• S contains all basic relations; and\n• S is closed under converse, weak composition, and intersection; and\n• weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections of relations in S.\nWrite B̂l for the closure of Bl in RCCl (l = 5, 8) under converse, weak composition, and intersection. It is straightforward to check that both B̂5 and B̂8 are distributive subalgebras. This shows that the above definition is well-defined and every distributive subalgebra of RCCl contains B̂l as a subclass.\nWe say a distributive subalgebra S is maximal if there is no other distributive subalgebra that properly contains S. To find all maximal distributive subalgebras of RCC5 and RCC8, we start with B̂l and then try to add other relations to this subalgebra to get larger distributive subalgebras. It turns out that both RCC5 and RCC8 have only two maximal distributive subalgebras. In Appendix A we list all relations contained in these subalgebras, and explain how we find these subalgebras and why there are no other maximal distributive subalgebras.\nThe next lemma summarises one useful property of distributive subalgebras.\nLemma 9. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose R, S, T are three relations in S. Then R ∩ S ∩ T = ∅ iff R ∩ S = ∅, or R ∩ T = ∅, or S ∩ T = ∅.\nProof. We only need to show the “only if” part. For two RCC5/8 relations P,Q, we first note that P∩Q 6= ∅ iff EQ ∈ Q−1 P . In fact, from P ∩ Q 6= ∅, we know there exist two regions a, b such that (a, b) ∈ P ∩ Q. This implies that (b, b) ∈ Q−1 ◦ P as (b, a) ∈ Q−1 and (a, b) ∈ P .\nHence EQ∩Q−1 ◦P is nonempty and, by the definition of weak composition and (3), EQ ∈ Q−1 P . On the other hand, if EQ ∈ Q−1 P , then EQ ∩ Q−1 ◦ P is nonempty. This implies that there exist two regions a, b such that (b, a) ∈ Q−1 and (a, b) ∈ P . Thus (a, b) ∈ P ∩Q and, hence, P ∩Q 6= ∅.\nSuppose R∩S ∩T is empty but R∩S,R∩T and S ∩T are all nonempty. By the above property, we have EQ ∈ T−1 R and EQ ∈ T−1 S. Because R, S, T are relations in the distributive subalgebra S and R ∩ S 6= ∅, we know\nEQ ∈ (T−1 R) ∩ (T−1 S) = T−1 (R ∩ S).\nThus T−1 (R ∩ S) 6= ∅ and, hence, R ∩ S ∩ T 6= ∅ . A contradiction.\nThe above result does not hold in general. For example, consider the RCC5 relations R = {PO,PP}, S = {DR,PP}, T = {DR,PO,PP−1}. R, S, T are all in H5 but S is not in any distributive subalgebra of RCC5. We have R∩S ∩ T = ∅ but R∩S = {PP}, R∩ T = {PO}, and S ∩ T = {DR} are all nonempty.\nIt is worth noting that each distributive subalgebra of RCC5 is contained inH5, the maximal tractable subclass of RCC5 identified in [43, 27], and each distributive subalgebra of RCC8 is contained in Ĥ8, one of the three maximal subclasses of RCC8 identified in [42]. In particular, by Proposition 3, we have\nCorollary 10. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Then every pathconsistent network over S is consistent."

      "text" : "In this section we first give definitions of redundant constraints and prime subnetworks and then discuss how to find a prime subnetwork in general.\nDefinition 11. Let M be a qualitative calculus with domain U . Suppose Γ is a qualitative constraint network over variables V = {v1, ..., vn}. We say Γ entails a constraint (viRvj), written Γ |= (viRvj), if for every solution {a1, ..., an} of Γ in U we have (ai, aj) ∈ R. A constraint (viRvj) in Γ is redundant if Γ \\ {(viRvj)} entails (viRvj). We say Γ is reducible if it has a redundant constraint, and say Γ is irreducible or prime if otherwise. We say a subset Γ′ of Γ is a prime subnetwork of Γ if Γ′ is irreducible and equivalent to Γ.\nNote that each universal constraint (vi ? vj) in Γ is, by definition, always a redundant constraint in Γ. We call this a trivial redundant constraint. In the following, we give an example of non-trivial redundant RCC5 constraints.\nExample 12. Suppose\nΓ = {v1PP v2, v1PP v5, v3PP v1, v4PP v2, v5{DR,PP}v2, v3POv4}.\nThen (v1PP v2) is redundant. This is because, after enforcing path-consistency to Γ \\ {(v1PP v2)}, we have (v5PP v2) and hence (v1PP v2). This shows that Γ \\ {(v1PP v2)} entails (v1PP v2). Moreover, (v1PP v2) is the only non-trivial redundant constraint in Γ and Γ\\{(v1PP v2)} is the unique prime subnetwork of Γ.\nGiven a qualitative constraint network Γ, a very interesting question is, how to find a prime subnetwork of Γ? This problem is clearly at least as hard as determining if Γ is reducible. Similar to the case of propositional logic formulae [32], we have the following result for RCC5/8.\nProposition 13. Let Γ be an RCC5/8 network and suppose (xRy) is a constraint in Γ. It is co-NP-complete to decide if (xRy) is redundant in Γ.\nProof. First of all, we note that (xRy) is redundant in Γ iff (Γ\\{(xRy)})∪{xRcy} is inconsistent, where Rc is the complement of R. Since it is NP-complete to decide if an RCC5/8 network is consistent, we know this redundancy problem (i.e., the problem of determining if a constraint is redundant in a network) is in co-NP. On the other hand, it is easy to construct a polynomial many-one reduction from the inconsistency problem of RCC5/8 to the redundancy problem. Fix two variables x, y. Suppose Γ is an arbitrary RCC5/8 network over V and x, y are two variables in V . Then Γ is inconsistent iff Γ \\ {(xRy)} |= (xRcy) iff (xRcy) is redundant in (Γ \\ {(xRy)}) ∪ {xRcy}. This shows that the redundancy problem is co-NP complete.\nSimilarly, we can show that the redundancy problems for IA, CRA, and RA are also co-NP-complete and, because the consistency problem of PA is in P, the redundancy problem for PA is in P.\nTo determine if a network Γ is reducible, we need in the worst case check for O(n2) constraints in Γ whether they are redundant in Γ. By the above proposition, this is a decision problem in ∆P2 , the class of problems solvable in polynomial time with an oracle for some NP-complete problem. Finding a prime subnetwork of Γ is more complicated. A naive method is to remove redundant constraints iteratively from Γ until we get an irreducible network. Let c1, c2, . . . , ck be the sequence of all non-trivial constraints in Γ. Write Γ0 = Γ, and define\nΓi+1 = { Γi \\ {ci+1} if ci+1 is redundant in Γi; Γi if otherwise. (5)\nfor 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1. Then it is easy to show that Γk is a prime subnetwork of Γ. Suppose we have an oracle which can tell if a constraint is redundant in a network. Then Γk can be constructed in O(n2) time. We note that the construction of the prime subnetwork Γk depends on the order of the constraints c1, c2, . . . , ck.\nDespite that it is in general co-NP-complete to determine if a constraint is redundant, we have a polynomial time procedure if the constraints are all taken from a tractable subclass of RCC5/8.\nProposition 14. Let S be a tractable subclass of RCC5/8 that contains all basic relations. Suppose Γ is a network over S. Then in O(n3) time we can determine whether a constraint is redundant in Γ and in O(n5) time find all redundant constraints of Γ. In addition, a prime subnetwork for Γ can be found in O(n5) time.\nProof. Suppose (xRy) is a constraint in Γ and let Γ′ ≡ Γ\\{(xRy)}. To determine if (xRy) is redundant in Γ, we check for each basic RCC5/8 relation γ that is not in R, whether Γ′ ∪ {(xγy)} is consistent. If the answer is confirmative for one γ (note that RCC5 has five and RCC8 has eight basic relations), then (xRy) is not redundant in Γ. By Proposition 3, the consistency of Γ′ ∪ {(xγy)} can be determined by enforcing path-consistency and hence can be determined in cubic time. Since there are O(n2) constraints in Γ, in O(n5) time we can find all redundant constraints of Γ.\nSuppose c1, c2, . . . , ck are all non-trivial constraints of Γ. We define Γ0 = Γ, and set Γi+1 as in (5). Note that if a constraint is non-redundant in Φ then it is also non-redundant in any subset of Φ. It is straightforward to show that Γk is a prime\nsubnetwork of Γ. Since we can determine in cubic time whether a constraint is redundant in a network over S , Γk can be computed in k × O(n3) time, which is bounded by O(n5).\nSimilar conclusions apply to other calculi. For example, since the consistency problem of PA can be solved in O(n2) time, the redundancy problem of PA can be solved in O(n2) time and we can find a prime subnetwork for any consistent PA network in O(n4) time.\nIt is often interesting to know when a constraint is contained in some or all prime subnetworks. The following notion will be helpful in partially answering questions like this.\nDefinition 15. Let M be a qualitative calculus and suppose Γ is a qualitative constraint network overM. Write Γc for the set of non-redundant constraints in Γ. We call Γc the core of Γ.\nIt is easy to see that the core of Γ is contained in every prime subnetwork of Γ. Are prime subnetworks unique? And, is the core itself always a prime subnetwork? The following example shows that in general this is not the case.\nExample 16. Suppose Γ is the RCC5 network specified as below\n{v1P v2, v2P v3, v3P v1, v1PO v4, v2PO v4},\nwhere P = {PP,EQ}. Then both PO constraints in Γ are redundant. This is because, enforcing path-consistency to {v1P v2, v2P v3, v3P v1}we have v1EQ v2, v1EQ v3, v2EQ v3. Therefore, knowing one PO constraint will infer the other. Moreover, Γ has no other redundant constraints and {v1P v2, v2P v3, v3P v2} is the core of Γ but not equivalent to Γ. It is easy to see that Γc ∪ {v1PO v4} and Γc ∪ {v2PO v4} are two prime subnetworks of Γ.\nNote that this occurs since there is a cycle of P constraints in Γ, i.e., Γ is P-cyclic. In the following we often assume that Γ has the following property:\n(∀i, j)[(i 6= j)→ (Γ 6|= (viEQ vj))].(6)\nThis implies that no two variables are forced to be identical. We call a network which satisfies (6) an all-different constraint network. Note that an all-different network is always consistent, as an inconsistent network entails everything.\nThe following proposition shows that the all-different requirement is not restrictive at all for constraint networks over a tractable subalgebra.\nProposition 17. Let S be a tractable subclass of RCC5/8 that contains all basic relations. Suppose Γ = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a consistent network over S and Γp its a-closure. Then, for any i 6= j, Γ |= (vi EQ vj) iff (vi EQ vj) is in Γp.\nProof. The sufficiency part is clear. We only need to show the necessity part. Suppose Γ |= (vi EQ vj). We show (vi EQ vj) is in Γp. Suppose Γp = {viSijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}. Because Γ is consistent, Γp is path-consistent and each Sij is nonempty. By Theorem 21 of [42], Γp has a consistent scenario Γ∗ = {viαijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n}, where αij = EQ iff Sij = EQ. In other words, if Sij 6= EQ, i.e., (vi EQ vj) is not in Γp, then αij cannot be EQ and hence Γ does not entail (vi EQ vj). This is a contradiction and hence (vi EQ vj) is in Γp.\nThe above proposition shows that whether a constraint network is all-different can be answered by enforcing path-consistency. When a constraint network is not all-different, we can amalgamate those identical variables and thus obtain an equivalent but simplified all-different network.\nIn the next section we will show that, if Γ is an all-different constraint network over a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8, then Γc is the unique prime subnetwork of Γ. This is quite surprising, as, in general, knowing that (xRy) and (uSv) are both redundant in Γ does not imply that (uSv) is also redundant in Γ \\ {(xRy)}."

Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose Γ = {viRijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} is a path-consistent network over S. Then Γ is weakly globally consistent.\nProof. Write Vk = {v1, v2, . . . , vk} for 1 ≤ k < n. Without loss of generality, we only show that every consistent scenario of Γ↓Vk can be extended to a consistent scenario of Γ↓Vk+1 . Suppose ∆ = {viδijvj : 1 ≤ i, j ≤ k} is a consistent scenario of Γ↓Vk . Then each δij is a basic relation in Rij . For each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, write Ti for Rk+1,i (see Figure 4 for illustration). Let T̂i = ⋂k j=1 Tj δji.\nWe assert that each T̂i is nonempty. By Lemma 9, it is easy to show by induction on k that, for any set {W1,W2, . . . ,Wk} of k ≥ 3 nonempty relations in S, ⋂k\ni=1Wi 6= ∅ iff Wi ∩Wj 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ n. Therefore, to show T̂i 6= ∅, we only need to show Tj δji ∩ Tj′ δj′i 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n and any 1 ≤ j 6= j′ ≤ n. Applying the cycle law as stated in Proposition 2 twice, we have\nTj δji ∩ (Tj′ δj′i) 6= ∅ iff (Tj′ δj′i) (δji)−1 ∩ Tj 6= ∅ iff Tj′ (δj′i δij) ∩ Tj 6= ∅ iff T−1j′ Tj ∩ (δj′i δij) 6= ∅ iff (Rj′,k+1 Rk+1,j) ∩ (δj′i δij) 6= ∅.\nNote here (δji)−1 = δij and T−1j′ = (Rk+1,j′) −1 = Rj′,k+1. Because δj′j ⊆ Rj′j , we know δj′j ∩ Rj′j 6= ∅. Since both ∆ and Γ are path-consistent, we also have\nδj′j ⊆ δj′i δij andRj′j ⊆ Rj′,k+1 Rk+1,j . Therefore, we have (Rj′,k+1 Rk+1,j)∩ (δj′i δij) ⊇ Rj′j ∩ δj′j 6= ∅ and hence Tj δji ∩ Tj′ δj′i 6= ∅. This shows that T̂i 6= ∅ for any 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\nTo show that Γ↓Vk∪{vk+1T̂ivi : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} is path-consistent, we only need to show for 1 ≤ i 6= i′ ≤ k that T̂i δii′ ⊇ T̂i′ . By the distributivity and δji δii′ ⊇ δji′ we have\nT̂i δii′ = ( k⋂\nj=1\nTj δji) δii′ = k⋂\nj=1\nTj (δji δii′) ⊇ k⋂\nj=1\nTj δji′ = T̂i′ .\nThis shows that Γ↓Vk ∪ {vk+1T̂ivi : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} is path-consistent and hence, by Corollary 10, has a consistent scenario ∆′. It is clear that ∆′ extends ∆ from Vk to Vk+1. Because Γ↓Vk ∪ {vk+1T̂ivi : 1 ≤ i ≤ k} refines Γ↓Vk+1 , we know Γ↓Vk+1 has a consistent scenario which extends ∆.\nTogether with Proposition 6, the above result immediately implies that the a-closure of a consistent network Γ over a distributive subalgebra is minimal.\nTheorem 19. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose Γ is a consistent network over S and Γp its a-closure. Then Γp is identical to the minimal network of Γ.\nThe above results can also be extended to distributive subalgebras of PA, IA and CRA, but do not hold in general. Consider the network Γ over H5 shown in Figure 5, which is inspired by a network over PA in [51]. The network is pathconsistent but not minimal. In fact, the relation EQ in the constraint (v1{PP, EQ}v2) is not feasible, i.e., there exists no solution of Γ in which (v1EQv2) is satisfied. By Proposition 6, we know Γ is not weakly globally consistent.\nIn the next subsection, we characterise relations in such a minimal network in terms of the weak compositions of paths from x to y in Γ."

A qualitative constraint network Γ is in essence a labelled directed graph consisting of the variables in Γ as vertices and qualitative relations inM between the variables as labels. A path π from a variable x to another variable y is a sequence of constraints c1, c2, ..., cs such that ci = (ui−1Riui) and u0 = x, us = y. The weak composition of path π is the qualitative relation inM defined as\nCT(π) ≡ R1 R2 ... Rs.\nSince the weak composition operation is associative, the relation CT(π) defined above is unambiguous. We say a path π is non-trivial if CT(π) is not the universal relation. Note that (xCT(π)y) is entailed by those constraints in π.\nSuppose Γ is a constraint network over a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8, (xRy) and (xSy) are respectively the constraints in Γ and Γp that relate x to y. We next show that S is the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ. Note that such a path may contain (xRy) as an (or the unique) edge.\nLemma 20. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose Γ is a consistent network over S and Γp its a-closure. Assume furthermore that (xSy) is a constraint in Γp. Then S is the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ.\nProof. Suppose the network becomes stable in k steps when enforcing PCA. For l ≤ k, we write Rlij for the constraint between vi and vj in the l-th step. We prove by using induction on l that every Rlij is the intersection of the weak compositions of several paths from vi to vj in Γ.\nWhen l = 0, this is clearly true. Suppose this is true for l ≤ s. We show it also holds for l = s+ 1. Suppose in this step the following updating rule is called\nRl+1ij = (R l ik Rlkj) ∩Rlij.\nBy induction hypothesis, we know Rlij is the intersection of the weak compositions of several paths from vi to vj in Γ. Similar for Rlik and R l kj . Note that when joining a path from vi to vk and a path from vk to vj , we obtain a path from vi to vj . Because every constraint in Γ is taken from S, in which weak composition\ndistributes over nonempty intersections, it follows that Rlik Rlkj is identical to the intersection of the weak compositions of all these paths from vi to vj via vk. It is now clear that Rl+1ij also satisfies the property.\nSo far, we have shown for every constraint (xSy) in Γp that S is the intersection of the weak compositions of several paths from x to y in Γ. Because Γp is path-consistent, the weak composition of every path from x to y in Γp contains S. Therefore, S is also contained in the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ. This shows that S is exactly the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ.\nThe distributive property is necessary in the above lemma. Consider the consistent RCC5 network Γ overH5 shown in Figure 6. The intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from v1 to v2 in Γ is {DR,PP}, while the relation that relates v1 to v2 in Γp is {DR}, which is strictly contained in {DR,PP}.\nThe following lemma shows that the weak composition of a cycle contains EQ and PO. This result holds for arbitrary RCC5/8 networks which are all-different.\nLemma 21. Suppose Γ is an all-different RCC5/8 network and π = (c1, c2, ..., cs) (s ≥ 2) a path from x to itself in Γ such that ci = (ui−1Riui), u0 = us = x. Then CT(π) contains O5 ≡ {PO,PP,PP−1,EQ} if Γ is an RCC5 network, and contains O8 ≡ {PO,TPP,TPP−1,EQ} if Γ is an RCC8 network.\nProof. Write y for u1. Let R = R1 and T = CT(π>1) = R2 R3 . . . Rs. Note that y 6= x and π>1 is a path from y to x. Suppose S is the relation from x to y in the a-closure of Γ. Because Γ is consistent, we know S is nonempty and S ⊆ R, S ⊆ T−1. Furthermore, since Γ is all-different and hence satisfies (6), we know S 6= {EQ}. As a consequence, we know there is a basic RCC5/8 relation\nα 6= EQ which is contained inR∩T−1. Therefore, CT(π) = R T ⊇ α α−1. By checking the composition tables of RCC5 and RCC8, we have that α α−1 (hence CT(π)) contains O5 (O8, respectively) for any RCC5 (RCC8, respectively) basic relation α 6= EQ.\nThe following lemma provides a finer characterisation of the constraint (xSy) in Γp in terms of paths in Γ that do not contain the constraint (xRy).\nLemma 22. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose Γ is an alldifferent network over S and Γp its a-closure. Assume that (xRy) and (xSy) are the constraints from x to y in Γ and Γp respectively. Then S = R∩W , whereW is the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ \\ {(xRy)}.\nProof. Because (xRy) is the only path with length 1 from x to y in Γ, Lemma 20 in fact asserts that S is the intersection of R and the weak compositions of all paths in Γ with length ≥ 2. Note that each path from x to y in Γ \\ {(xRy)} has length ≥ 2. We know S ⊆ R ∩W .\nTo show S ⊇ R ∩W , we only need to show CT(π) ⊇ R ∩W for every path from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2. Suppose π = (c1, c2, ..., cs) (s ≥ 2) is such a path and ci = (ui−1Riui), u0 = x, us = y.\nThere are three types of paths (see Figure 7 for illustration). Case 1. π contains neither (xRy) nor (yR−1x). Clearly π is a path from x to\ny in Γ \\ {(xRy)}. By definition we have CT(π) ⊇ W . Case 2. If ci = (xRy) for some 1 ≤ i ≤ s, then CT(π) = CT(π<i) R CT(π>i). Note that either π<i or π>i is a nonempty cycle. By Lemma 21 we know the weak composition of each cycle contains EQ. Therefore, we know CT(π) ⊇ R.\nCase 3. If ci = (yR−1x) for some 1 ≤ i ≤ s, then CT(π) = CT(π<i) CT(π≥i). Without loss of generality, we assume ci is the first constraint in π such that ci = (yR−1x). It is clear that π<i is a path of Case 1 and henceW ⊆ CT(π<i). Note that π≥i is a path from y to itself. By Lemma 21 we know EQ ∈ CT(π≥i) hence CT(π) = CT(π<i) CT(π≥i) ⊇ W EQ = W .\nThis shows that R ∩ W is contained in the weak composition of every path from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2. Since S is the intersection of R and all paths from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2, this shows that S ⊇ R ∩W . Therefore we have S = R ∩W .\nAs Lemma 20, the above result does not hold in general. Consider the network shown in Figure 6 and the constraint from v1 to v2. We have R = {DR,PP}, S = {DR}, but R ∩W = {DR,PP} 6= S."

We have Rij ⊇ Wij . By Lemma 23, this immediately implies that (viRijvj) is redundant in Γ. On the other hand, suppose (viRijvj) is redundant in Γ. We show Rij = ⋂ {Rik Rkj : k 6= i, j}. By Lemma 24 we know Rij ⊇ Wij . Let π = (c1, c2, ..., cs) (s ≥ 2) be an arbitrary path from vi to vj in Γ\\{(viRijvj)} such that ck = (uk−1Rkuk), u0 = vi, us = vj . Then CT(π) = R1 CT(π>1).

For each constraint (uiSijuj) in any such a path, Lemma 20 shows that Sij is the\nintersection of the weak compositions of all paths from ui to uj in Γ. Replace each (uiSijuj) with several paths such that Sij is the intersection of their weak compositions. We get several paths from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2 such that S is the intersection of the weak compositions of these paths. By Lemma 20 again we know S is contained in the weak composition of every path from x to y in Γ. This shows that S is exactly the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2.6\nAs we have seen in the proof of Lemma 22, there are three types of paths. For every path π of Case 1 or 3 (defined in Lemma 22), we know CT(π) contains W . Suppose π is a path of Case 2 and ci = (xRy) for some 1 ≤ i ≤ s. Then CT(π) = CT(π<i) R CT(π>i). Note that if π<i (π>i, respectively) is nonempty, then CT(π<i) (CT(π>i), respectively) contains Ol by Lemma 21. Either π<i or π>i is a cycle. Therefore, CT(π) contains Ol R ∩ R Ol ∩ Ol R Ol. In summary, for each path π from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2, we have CT(π) ⊇ W ∩Ol R∩R Ol ∩Ol R Ol. Because Ol R Ol is always the universal relation (as PO R PO = PO PO = ?l by Lemma 1), we know S, as the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ with length ≥ 2, contains W ∩Ol R∩R Ol. Since S = R∩W , we have (7) immediately.\nWe next show R ⊇ W . Because Γ is consistent and satisfies (6), we know S = R ∩W is neither empty nor {EQ}, i.e.,\n∅ 6= R ∩W 6= {EQ}.\nIf PO ∈ R, then Ol R ∩R Ol ⊇ PO PO is the universal relation. That R ⊇ W follows directly from R ∩W ⊇ W ∩ ?l = W .\nIf PO 6∈ R, then PO 6∈ W because PO ∈ Ol R∩R Ol and (7) holds. We show R ⊇ W . We only consider RCC8 relations. The case for RCC5 relations is similar. Suppose R is a relation in a distributive subalgebra of RCC8 such that PO 6∈ R and R 6= EQ. Checking the lists of relations in the two maximal distributive subalgebras given in Appendix A, R is either a basic relation other\n6While we can further show that S is the intersection of the weak compositions of all paths from x to y in Γ that have no cycles and are with length ≥ 2, it is not guaranteed that such a path is in Γ \\ {(xRy)}. That is, we cannot directly show S = W .\nthan PO and EQ, or one of the following relations\n{TPP,NTPP}, {TPP−1,NTPP−1},(8) {DC,EC}, {TPP,EQ}, {TPP−1,EQ}, {TPP,NTPP,EQ}, {TPP−1,NTPP−1,EQ}.\nThere are several subcases. Suppose R is a basic relation α other than PO and EQ. We write αd for the other basic relation such that {α, αd} is a relation in (8). For example, DCd = EC, TPPd = NTPP, and TPP−1d = NTPP−1. From the RCC8 composition table we can see\n{α, αd,PO} ⊆ PO α ∩ α PO ⊆ O8 α ∩ α O8 holds for every basic relation α other than PO and EQ. We assert that αd 6∈ W if R = {α}. This is because, otherwise, we have αd ∈ W ∩O8 R ∩R O8 and hence by (7) αd ∈ R ∩W ⊆ R. A contradiction. In particular, if α is DC, EC, NTPP, or NTPP−1, then W = R. If α is either TPP or TPP−1, then we can further show that EQ ∈ O8 α ∩ α O8 and hence EQ 6∈ W . This implies that W = R.\nSuppose R is {DC,EC}, {TPP,NTPP,EQ}, or {TPP−1,NTPP−1, EQ}. Note that PO 6∈ W , and ∅ 6= R ∩ W 6= {EQ}. This shows that W is contained in R.\nSuppose R is {TPP,NTPP} or {TPP−1,NTPP−1}. By (7) and EQ ∈ O8 R ∩ R O8 we know that W does not contain EQ. Hence W is contained in R.\nSuppose R is {TPP,EQ}. By (7) and NTPP ∈ O8 R ∩ R O8, W cannot contain NTPP. This implies that W is contained in R. The case for R = {TPP−1,EQ} is similar.\nIn summary, we haveR ⊇ W in all cases. In other words,R can be obtained as the intersection of all paths from x to y in Γ\\{(xRy)}. Hence (xRy) is redundant in Γ by Lemma 23.\nThe result does not hold in general. Consider the constraint network Γ overH5 shown in Figure 9 and the constraint from v3 to v2. It is clear that the constraint (v3PPv2) is redundant in Γp. However, (v3PPv2) is not redundant in Γ. This is because (v3DR v2) is consistent with Γ \\ {(v3PPv2)} (shown in Figure 9(c)). Actually, it is easy to construct a solution {a1, a2, a3, a4} of Γ \\ {(v3PPv2)} in which (a3PP a1), (a1PP a4) and (a2DR aj) for j = 1, 3, 4.\nRecall that Theorem 19 asserts that Γp is minimal. Proposition 27 can be rephrased as follows:\nProposition 28. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose Γ is an all-different network over S and Γm the minimal network of Γ. Assume that (xRy) and (xSy) are the constraints from x to y in Γ and Γm respectively. Then (xRy) is redundant in Γ iff (xSy) is redundant in Γm.\nAs a consequence, we have our main result.\nTheorem 29. Let S be a distributive subalgebra of RCC5/8. Suppose Γ is an all-different network over S and Γc the core of Γ. Then Γc is equivalent to Γ and hence the unique prime subnetwork of Γ.\nProof. Suppose c1, c2, . . . , ck are the redundant constraints of Γ. Let Γ0 = Γ and Γi+1 = Γi \\ {ci+1} for 0 ≤ i ≤ k. Note that Γk is precisely Γc, the core of Γ. Suppose 0 ≤ i < k is the largest integer such that Γi is equivalent to Γ.\nSuppose ci+1 = (xRy) and (xSy) is the corresponding constraint in Γm, the minimal network of Γ. Note that ci+1 is also in Γi. By Proposition 28 we know (xSy) is redundant in Γm since (xRy) is redundant in Γ. Because Γm is also the minimal network of Γi, by Proposition 28 again we know (xRy) is redundant in Γi. This means that Γi+1 is equivalent to Γi, hence Γ. This contradicts our assumption that i < k is the largest integer such that Γi is equivalent to Γ. Therefore, i = k and Γc is equivalent to Γ.\nThe above result does not hold in general. For example, consider the RCC5 network Γ over H5 shown in Figure 10(a). The core Γc (shown in Figure 10(b)) is not equivalent to and hence not a prime subnetwork of Γ. This is because (v3DR v2) is feasible in Γc but not in Γ.\nSimilar to Proposition 14, we can show that the core of an RCC5/8 network over a tractable subclass can be found in O(n5) time. In the next subsection we show this can be improved if the network is over a distributive subalgebra."

While most of this research concerns redundant modelling (e.g., [9]), Chmeiss et al. [8] studied redundancy modulo a given local consistency. Their paper is close in spirit to ours. Let Γ be a CSP and φ a local consistency. Chmeiss et al. call a constraint c in Γ φ-redundant iff (Γ\\{c})∪{¬c} is φ-inconsistent. Because path-consistency implies consistency for RCC5/8 constraint networks over their maximal tractable subclasses, our notion of redundancy (when restricted to networks over these tractable subclasses) is equivalent to redundancy modulo path-consistency in the sense of [8].\nIn qualitative spatial reasoning, there are also two works that are close to our research. Egenhofer and Sharma noticed in [18] that “For any scene description, the set of n2 binary topological relations between the n objects is redundant since some of these topological relations are always implied by others.” They did not provide an efficient algorithm for deriving such a minimal set even for basic topological constraints. Recently, Wallgrün [53] proposed two algorithms to approximately find the prime subnetwork. The essence of these algorithms is to replace Rij with the universal constraint if there exists k such that Rik Rkj is contained in Rij . As was noted in [53], neither of these two algorithms is guaranteed to provide the optimal simplification. But it is worth noting that these two approximate algorithms are applicable to general constraint networks which are not necessarily over a distributive subalgebra. In Section 6, we will empirically compare our method with the methods of Wallgrün.\nThe property of distributivity was first used by van Beek [51] for IA, but the notion of distributive subalgebra is new. It is not difficult to show that PA, IA, RCC5 and RCC8 all have two maximal distributive subalgebras (see Appendix A for maximal distributive subalgebras of RCC5/8). Very interestingly, the two maximal distributive subalgebras of IA are exactly the subalgebras CIA and SIA discussed in [2], where Amaneddine and Condotta proved that CIA and SIA are the only maximal subalgebras of IA over which path-consistent networks are globally consistent. For RCC8, the maximal distributive subalgebraD841 we identify in Appendix A turns out to be the class of convex RCC8 relations found in [7], where Chandra and Pujari proved that path-consistent networks over D841 are minimal. In Appendix A we find another maximal distributive subalgebra for RCC8, which contains 64 relations. Furthermore, we also show that every path-consistent constraint network Γ over a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal. This has not been studied for RCC5/8 before."

In [53], Wallgrün proposes two greedy algorithms for removing redundant constraints in the constraint network: the basic and extended simplification algorithms (hereafter Simple and SimpleExt). The Simple algorithm loops through all triples of regions i, j, and k and identifies as redundant any constraints Rik such that Rij Rjk ⊆ Rik. A drawback of the Simple algorithm is that redundant relations removed may affect subsequent iterations of the algorithm. Hence, the order in which triples are visited by the Simple algorithm can alter the resulting subnetwork. The SimpleExt solves this issue by first marking potentially redundant relations for removal, subject to a consistency check, before removing all marked relations in a final loop. The Simple and SimpleExt algorithms are not guaranteed to provide an optimal solution. Thus, the prime subnetwork is necessarily a (possibly improper) subnetwork of that generated by the SimpleExt algorithm, which is in turn a (possibly improper) subnetwork of that generated by the Simple algorithm.\nFigure 11 shows an example with just five regions, highlighting the constraints identified as redundant in the prime subnetwork and by the Simple and SimpleExt algorithms. Assuming the Simple algorithm visits regions in numerical order, the relations between regions 2 and 5 and between 3 and 4 will be identified as redundant. Additionally, the SimpleExt algorithm is able to identify the relation\nbetween 4 and 5 as redundant. However, only in the prime subnetwork is the redundant relation between 1 and 3 identified."

Derived from social media, the footprint data set contains a variety of regions of differing sizes and shapes, but relatively unstructured sharing almost no adjacent boundaries. In stark contrast the Tasmanian statistical areas are highly structured, made up of four levels of spatially contiguous and nested but non-overlapping regions. To aid in our analysis, five subsets of each of the two datasets were generated in addition to the full datasets. The subsets were generated from selecting those regions that intersect an arbitrarily selected spatial region of increasing size. In this way, subsets of data of varying sizes were generated, with 108, 217, 433, 862 and 1725 regions in subsets of the footprint data set, and 49, 98, 193, 374 and 658 regions from the statistical areas set.\nSubsets of spatially related regions were explicitly used, as opposed to entirely random selection of regions, to ensure that the range of RCC8 base relations in each subset were representative of the RCC8 relations in close spatial proximity. The resulting distribution of RCC8 base relations in the full constraint network for these 10 region subsets along with their complete dataset is shown in Table 3. By design, the relations exhibit systematic variations in the distribution of relations, for example with the statistical areas data set exhibiting consistently higher levels of DC and lower levels of PO relations (due to the non-overlapping nature of statistical areas); and smaller subsets exhibiting lower levels of DC relations (as a result of the smaller spatial area in which regions must fit for the smaller subsets of data)."

In this section, we compare the three types of subnetwork (prime, SimpleExt, and Simple) in practice and in the context of these conjectures. Figure 12 shows the growth in size of the three types of subnetwork across the six subsets of each of the two data sets. Several features are worth noting in Figure 12:\n• All three subnetworks grow in size approximately linearly with the number of regions (coefficient of determination R2 > 0.97 in all cases, indicating a high level of fit between the data and the linear regression). Linear O(n) growth is a lower bound on the space complexity of these subnetworks, since they must remain connected (and so must have at least n − 1 edges). Thus, this result indicates all three algorithms are approaching optimal scalability in terms of space complexity. The only exception occurs with the Simple subnetwork and in the case of the statistical areas data set, which grows in size quadratically with the number of regions.\n• The prime subnetwork is consistently smaller than the subnetwork generated by the Simple algorithm at all network sizes and is significantly smaller for larger networks.\n• The SimpleExt subnetwork is significantly larger than the prime subnetwork and of similar size to the Simple subnetwork in the case of the footprint data set, while it is of similar size to the prime subnetwork and significantly smaller than the Simple subnetwork in the case of the statistical areas data set.\nIn summary, neither the Simple nor SimpleExt algorithm can be relied upon to identify as many redundant constraints as the prime subnetwork, although the\nSimpleExt algorithm may in some cases identify many more redundant constraints than the Simple algorithm (such as the statistical areas data set).\nFurther examination reveals that one feature that explains many of the observed differences in results is the differing proportions of PO relations in the data sets (see Table 3). Larger proportions of PO relations are strongly related to fewer redundant relations being identified across all types of subnetwork, since PO relations typically provide limited reasoning power. Figure 13 demonstrates this relationship empirically for the footprint data set. However, the prime subnetwork is consistently better at identifying many more redundant relations than the Simple or SimpleExt algorithms when the full constraint network contains many PO relations."

However, in most cases for the less structured footprint data set, the prime subnetwork contains substantially fewer constraints than could be achieved by simply omitting DC relations (those below the diagonal in Figure 15). Besides, while simply dropping the DC relation is competitive space-saver in some cases, it is undesirable when for example the information is incomplete and/or we cannot tell if the relation between two objects is (i) DC and dropped or (ii) missing or (iii) removed due to redundancy."

However, one final question we address empirically is the efficiency of reconstructing the full constraint network from the prime subnetwork, when compared with doing so geometrically if the geometric information is complete and available.\nThe full constraint network can be reconstructed from the prime subnetwork in O(n3) time by computing the a-closure of the prime subnetwork. Computing the constraint network directly from the geometry requires in the worst case O(n2) iterations of an O(m2) algorithm for computing the intersection between two polygons (where m is the number of vertices in the polygon). In cases where m ≈ n this can lead to a worst case complexity of the geometric algorithm of O(n4). We note that, in our statistical areas data set, the largest polygon contains more than 248,000 vertices, and so m is indeed comparable to n.\nHowever, in practice, by making use of the spatial structure of the data through algorithms (e.g., by checking for non-overlapping minimum bounding boxes for polygons before computing the polygon intersection) and spatial indexes, the geometric algorithm is expected to be on average significantly more efficient. Figure 16 compares the scalability of the two approaches, a-closure and efficient geometric computation in an indexed spatial database. At least for the smaller data sets tested, computing the a-closure is significantly more efficient. For example, in the case of the smallest statistical areas data subset, computing the a-closure requires less than 1000th of the time of the geometric computation. However, the figure shows that using the spatial database is significantly more scalable (average-\ncase O(n) time complexity) when compared with the a-closure (average case approaching O(n3) complexity).\nFigure 16 also shows the results of a hybrid reconstitution algorithm, that uses both the geometry and the a-closure. The hybrid algorithm first adds any DC relations to the prime network that can be inferred simply through comparison of the minimum bounding box of the polygon geometry (since non-intersecting minimum bounding boxes for two polygons imply a DC relations). Then the a-closure is computed with this partially reconstituted subnetwork. The results show a significant improvement in scalability using this approach, reducing the average case time complexity to below O(n2) in the case of the footprint dataset. Ongoing work is currently investigating further mechanisms for combining both these geometric and the qualitative aspects of regions in efficient database storage and queries."

If the constraints are taken from a distributive subalgebra, we proved that the constraint network has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be found in cubic time. As a byproduct, we also proved that any path-consistent network over a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal.\nOur empirical analysis showed that for real geographic data sets the prime subnetwork can lead to significant increases in the number of redundant relations identified when compared with the approximations proposed by [53]. In practice, the algorithm was efficient, exhibiting average case O(n2) scalability. The redundant relations identified by the prime subnetwork can also significantly outnumber DC relations, especially in less structured geographic data sets that may contain a significant minority of PO relations.\nIt is worth noting that a large part of our results can be applied to several other qualitative calculi (like PA, IA, CRA, and RA) immediately, but Propositions 27 and 28 and Theorem 29 do use the particular algebraic properties of RCC5/8 (see Table 5 for a summary). For example, we have an all-different and path-consistent basic IA network which is not equivalent to its core. Future work will consider how to extend our results to IA, RA and other calculi.\nWe are also developing further the practical applications of prime subnetworks. In addition to pursuing a more systematic exploration of the applications to saving storage than the one given in Section 1.1, current work is investigating other aspects of prime subnetworks, in particular the structure and comparison of different prime subnetworks of sets of footprints."

The second maximal distributive subalgebra, denoted\nby D864, contains in addition the following 27 relations\n{PO,EQ}, {PO,TPP,EQ}, {PO,TPP−1,EQ}, {PO,TPP,TPP−1}, {PO,TPP,NTPP,EQ}, {PO,TPP−1,NTPP−1,EQ}, {PO,TPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1}, {PO,TPP,NTPP,TPP−1}, {PO,TPP,NTPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1}, {EC,PO,EQ}, {EC,PO,TPP,EQ}, {EC,PO,TPP−1,EQ}, {EC,PO,TPP−1,NTPP−1,EQ}, {EC,PO,TPP,NTPP,EQ}, {EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1}, {EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1}, {EC,PO,TPP,NTPP,TPP−1}, {EC,PO,TPP,NTPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1}, {DC,EC,PO,EQ}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP,EQ}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP−1,EQ}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP−1,NTPP−1,EQ}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP,NTPP,EQ}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP,NTPP,TPP−1}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1}, {DC,EC,PO,TPP,NTPP,TPP−1,NTPP−1}.\nIt is easy to check that both D841 and D864 are contained in Ĥ8, one of the three maximal subclasses of RCC8 identified in [42]."

    "abstractText" : "The Region Connection Calculus (RCC) [41] is a well-known calculus for representing part-whole and topological relations. It plays an important role in qualitative spatial reasoning, geographical information science, and ontology. The computational complexity of reasoning with RCC5 and RCC8 (two fragments of RCC) as well as other qualitative spatial/temporal calculi has been investigated in depth in the literature. Most of these works focus on the consistency of qualitative constraint networks. In this paper, we consider the important problem of redundant qualitative constraints. For a set Γ of qualitative constraints, we say a constraint (xRy) in Γ is redundant if it is entailed by the rest of Γ. A prime subnetwork of Γ is a subset of Γ which contains no redundant constraints and has the same solution set as Γ. It is natural to ask how to compute such a prime subnetwork, and when it is unique. In this paper, we show that this problem is in general intractable, but becomes tractable if Γ is over a tractable subalgebra S of a qualitative calculus. Furthermore, if S is a subalgebra of RCC5 or RCC8 in which weak composition distributes over nonempty intersections, then Γ has a unique prime subnetwork, which can be obtained in cubic time by removing all redundant constraints simultaneously from Γ. As a byproduct, we show that any path-consistent network over such a distributive subalgebra is weakly globally consistent and minimal. A thorough empirical analysis of the prime subnetwork upon real geographical data sets demonstrates the approach is able to identify significantly more redundant con∗Corresponding Author Email addresses: sanjiang.li@uts.edu.au (Sanjiang Li), zhiguo.long@student.uts.edu.au (Zhiguo Long), liuweiming@baidu.com (Weiming Liu), matt@duckham.org (Matt Duckham), aboth@student.unimelb.edu.au (Alan Both) Preprint submitted to Elsevier February 16, 2015 ar X iv :1 40 3. 06 13 v2 [ cs .A I] 1 3 Fe b 20 15 straints than previously proposed algorithms, especially in constraint networks with larger proportions of partial overlap relations.",
