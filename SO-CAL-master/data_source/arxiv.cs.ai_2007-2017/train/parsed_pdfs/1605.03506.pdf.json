Nevertheless, some problems remain when we face the decision of selecting the most convenient model for a specific application. In the literature, several desirable adequacy properties have been proposed, but theoretical limits impede quantification models from simultaneously fulfilling every adequacy property that has been defined. Besides, the complexity of model definitions and adequacy properties makes very difficult for real users to understand the particularities of the different models that have been presented. In this work we will present several criteria conceived to help in the process of selecting the most adequate Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanisms for specific practical applications. In addition, some of the best known well-behaved models will be compared against this list of criteria. Based on this analysis, some guidance to choose fuzzy quantification models for practical applications will be provided.\nKeywords: fuzzy quantification, determiner fuzzification schemes, theory of generalized quantifiers, quantifier fuzzification mechanism, applications of fuzzy quantification"

      "text" : "The evaluation of fuzzy quantified expressions is a topic that has been widely dealt with in literature [2, 7, 8, 27, 10, 11, 14, 12, 15, 17, 18, 21, 33, 24, 29, 31, 35]. The range of applications of fuzzy quantification includes fuzzy control [30], temporal reasoning in robotics [23], fuzzy databases [5], information retrieval [4, 22, 13], data fusion [31, 19] and more recently data-totext applications [26, 25].\nMoreover, the definition of adequate models to evaluate quantified expressions is fundamental to perform ‘computing with words’, topic that was suggested by Zadeh [36] to express the ability of programming systems in a linguistic way.\nIn general, most approaches to fuzzy quantification use the concept of fuzzy linguistic quantifier to represent absolute or proportional fuzzy quantities.

However, most of the approaches fail to exhibit a plausible behavior as has been proved through the different reviews that have been published [2, 7, 8, 18, 9] and only a few [7, 11, 17, 18] seem to exhibit an adequate behavior in the general case.\nIn this work, we will follow Glöckner’s approximation to fuzzy quantification [18]. In his approach, the author generalizes the concept of generalized classic quantifier [3] (second order predicates or set relationships) to the fuzzy case; that is, a fuzzy quantifier is a fuzzy relationship between fuzzy sets. And then he rewrites the fuzzy quantification problem as the problem of looking for a mechanism to transform semi-fuzzy quantifiers (quantifiers in a middle point between generalized classic quantifiers and fuzzy quantifiers, used to specify the meaning of quantified expressions) into fuzzy quantifiers. The author calls these transformation mechanisms Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanism (QFMs). Being based in the linguistic Theory of Generalized Quantifiers (TGQ) [3], this approach is capable of handling most of the quantification phenomena of natural language. In addition, including quantification into a common theoretical framework following TGQ, it also allows the translation of most of the analysis that has been made from a linguistic perspective to the fuzzy case, and facilitates the definition and the test of adequacy properties.\nGlöckner has also defined a rigorous axiomatic framework to ensure the good behavior of QFMs. Models fulfilling this framework are called Determiner fuzzification schemes (DFSs) and they comply with a broad set of properties that guarantee a good behavior from a linguistic and fuzzy point of view. See the recent [27] or [18] for a comparison between Zadeh’s and Glöckner’s approaches.\nThe DFS framework has supposed a notable advance and several well behaved QFMs have been identified [18], [9]. However, important problems still remain when we must face the decision of selecting an specific QFM for a practical application. First, it has been proved that no model can fulfill every desirable adequacy property that has been proposed [18], and as a consequence, a ‘perfect model’ cannot exist. Besides, the complexity of the definition of the models and adequacy properties makes really difficult for a user to decide which one is the most convenient for a certain application. In addition, as we will show along the exposition, there are some criteria that have not been previously taken into account for analyzing the plausible models and, even for the cases in which some of these criteria had been previously considered, a complete comparison among the behavior of at least the best-behaved models has not been done.\nIn this work we will focus on, to the best of our knowledge, the best-behaved QFMs: models F MD, F I , F A [9] and models M, MCX and Fowa [18] with the objective of establishing a set of criteria that facilitates the understanding of the behavioral differences among them and helping with the process of selecting the more convenient model for applications. All the selected models, being QFMs, present a more general definition than models following Zadeh’s framework [35]. Furthermore, some of them generalize other known approaches, as the ones based on the Sugeno or Choquet integrals. Thus, selected models comprise a really good representation of the ‘state of the art’ of fuzzy quantification. We refer the reader to the exhaustive and recent revision in [8] for a thoroughly comparative analysis of fuzzy quantification proposals. Previous state of the art revisions about the fuzzy quantification field can be found in [2, 7, 18, 9].\nBefore continuing, we would remark that only the models F A, M, MCX and Fowa fulfill the\nstrict DFS framework, being alpha-cut based models like F MD and F I , previously considered as non plausible from the point of view of the DFS framework [18, section 7.2]. In order to understand the differences between these models and DFSs, we will first compare the selected models against the main properties considered into the QFM framework. Once the main differences derived from the properties described in [18] have been presented, we will introduce the new set of criteria that will allow us to improve the comparison between the different models and to prove that, for some problems, alpha-cut based models F MD and F I can be superior to known DFSs.\nMoreover, as we will argue when we analyze the different models against the set of criteria introduced in this paper, a ‘clear winner’ cannot be identified, being the general situation that some models are more appropriate for some applications than others.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will summarize Glöckner’s approach to fuzzy quantification, based on quantifier fuzzification mechanisms. In section 3, we will present the definition of the models F MD, F I , F A, M, MCX and Fowa. Section 4 will present the main properties considered in the QFM framework [18] and a brief comparison of the models F MD, F I , F A, M, MCX and Fowa, with the objective of clearly identifying the behavioral differences of these models with respect to these properties. Section 5 will be devoted to establish the set of criteria that will allow us to improve the comparison of the considered models, and to analyze the different models against this new set of criteria. Section 6 summarizes the results and establishes some criteria to guide in the model selection for applications. The paper is closed with some conclusions."

      "text" : "To overcome Zadeh’s framework to fuzzy quantification Glöckner, [18] rewrote the problem of fuzzy quantification as the problem of looking for adequate ways to convert specification means (semi-fuzzy quantifiers) into operational means (fuzzy quantifiers).\nFuzzy quantifiers are just a fuzzy generalization of crisp or classic quantifiers. Before giving the definition of fuzzy quantifiers, we will show the definition of classic quantifiers according to TGQ.\nDefinition 1. A two valued (generalized) quantifier on a base set E , ∅ is a mapping Q : P (E)n −→ 2, where n ∈ N is the arity (number of arguments) of Q, 2 = {0, 1} denotes the set of crisp truth values, and P (E) is the powerset of E.\nExamples of some definitions of classic quantifiers are:\nall (Y1, Y2) = Y1 ⊆ Y2\nat least80% (Y1, Y2) = { |Y1∩Y2 | |Y1 |\n≥ 0.80 Y1 , ∅ 1 Y1 = ∅\nIn a fuzzy quantifier, arguments and results can be fuzzy. A fuzzy quantifier assigns a gradual result to each choice of X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E), where by P̃ (E) we denote the fuzzy powerset of E.\nDefinition 2. [18, definition 2.6] An n-ary fuzzy quantifier Q̃ on a base set E , ∅ is a mapping Q̃ : P̃ (E)n −→ I = [0, 1].\nFor example, the fuzzy quantifier ãll : P̃ (E)2 −→ I could be defined as:\nãll (X1, X2) = inf { max ( 1 − µX1 (e) , µX2 (e) ) : e ∈ E }\nwhere by µX (e) we denote the membership function of X ∈ P̃ (E). Although a certain consensus may be achieved to accept previous expression as a suitable definition for ãll this is not the unique possible one. The problem of establishing consistent fuzzy definitions for quantifiers (e.g., ‘at least eighty percent’) is faced in [18] by introducing the concept of semi-fuzzy quantifiers. A semi-fuzzy quantifier represents a medium point between classic quantifiers and fuzzy quantifiers. Semi-fuzzy quantifiers are similar but far more general than Zadeh’s linguistic quantifiers [35]. A semi-fuzzy quantifier only accepts crisp arguments, as classic quantifiers, but let the result range over the truth grade scale I, as for fuzzy quantifiers.\nDefinition 3. [18, definition 2.8] An n-ary semi-fuzzy quantifier Q on a base set E , ∅ is a mapping Q : P (E)n −→ I.\nQ assigns a gradual result to each pair of crisp sets (Y1, . . . , Yn). Examples of semi-fuzzy quantifiers are:\nabout 5 (Y1, Y2) = T2,4,6,8 (|Y1 ∩ Y2|) (1)\nat least about80% (Y1, Y2) = { S 0.5,0.8 ( |Y1∩Y2 | |Y1 | ) X1 , ∅\n1 X1 = ∅\nwhere T2,4,6,8 (x) and S 0.5,0.8 (x) represent the common trapezoidal and S fuzzy numbers1. Semi-fuzzy quantifiers are much more intuitive and easier to define than fuzzy quantifiers, but they do not solve the problem of evaluating fuzzy quantified sentences. In fact, additional mechanisms are needed to transform semi-fuzzy quantifiers into fuzzy quantifiers, i.e., mappings with domain in the universe of semi-fuzzy quantifiers and range in the universe of fuzzy quantifiers:\nDefinition 4. [18, definition 2.10]A quantifier fuzzification mechanism (QFM) F assigns to each semi-fuzzy quantifier Q : P (E)n → I a corresponding fuzzy quantifier F (Q) : P̃ (E)n → I of the same arity n ∈ N and on the same base set E."

      "text" : "3.1. Standard DFSs based on trivalued cuts\nIn this section we will present the three main Glöckner’s approaches [18]. All the models that have been proposed by Glöckner are standard Determiner Fuzzification Schemes, and as\n1Functions Ta,b,c,d and S α,γ are defined as\nTa,b,c,d (x) =  0 x ≤ a x−a b−a a < x ≤ b 1 b < x ≤ c\n1 − x−cd−c c < x ≤ d 0 d < x\n, S α,γ (x) =  0 x < α 2 ( (x−α) (γ−α) )2 α < x ≤ α+γ2 1 − 2 ( (x−γ) (γ−α) )2 α+γ 2 < x ≤ γ\n1 γ < x\na consequence they show an excellent theoretical behavior. These models are called standard because they induce the standard tnorm min and the standard tconorm max.2\nBefore presenting models M [18, definition 7.22], MCX [18, definition 7.56] and Fowa [18, definition 8.13] we need to introduce some additional definitions.\nDefinition 5. [18, definition 7.15]Let E be a referential set, X ∈ P̃ (E) a fuzzy set, and γ ∈ I. Xminγ , X max γ ∈ P (E) are defined as:\nXminγ = { X> 12 : γ = 0 X≥ 12 + 12 γ : γ > 0\nXmaxγ = { X≥ 12 : γ = 0 X> 12 − 12 γ : γ > 0\nwhere X≥α = {e ∈ E : µX (e) ≥ α} is the alpha-cut of level α of X and X>α = {e ∈ E : µX (e) > α} is the strict alpha-cut of level α.\nIn previous expression, Xminγ represents the elements that without doubt, belong to the fuzzy set X for the ‘cautiousness’ level γ whilst Xmaxγ includes also the elements whose belongingness to the cautiousness level γ is undefined. Elements that are not in Xmaxγ do not belong to the cautiousness level γ. The cautiousness cut can be interpreted as a ‘trivalued set’ in which elements in Xminγ have membership function of 1, whilst for elements in X max γ /X min γ belongingness is undefined (membership degree of 12 ). Membership function for elements that are not in X max γ is 0. For the definition of M,MCX and Fowa we also need the fuzzy median operator:\nDefinition 6. Fuzzy median med 1 2 : I × I −→ I is defined as:\nmed 1 2 (u1, u2) =  min (u1, u2) : min (u1, u2) > 12 max (u1, u2) : max (u1, u2) < 12 1 2 : otherwise\nThe following definitions extends the fuzzy median to fuzzy sets:\nDefinition 7. Operator m 1 2 : P (I) → I is defined as\nm 1 2 X = med 1 2\n( inf X, sup X )\nfor all X ∈ P (I).\nThe set that contains all the possible images of a quantifier over the range defined by a three valued cut of level γ is defined as [17, page 100]:\nDefinition 8. Let Q : P (E) → I be a semi-fuzzy quantifier, X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E) fuzzy sets and γ ∈ [0, 1] a cautiousness level. S Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) : [0, 1] → I is defined as:\nS Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) (X1, . . . , Xn) = { Q (Y1, . . . , Yn) : (Xi)minγ ⊆ Yi ⊆ (Xi) max γ }\n2In [18, section 3.4] it is explained how semi-fuzzy quantifiers can be used ‘to embed’ the classical logical functions. By means of the application of a QFM F , we can study if F transforms the classical logical functions into approppriate fuzzy logical functions.\nSupremum and infimum of S Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) are represented by means of the following notation:\nDefinition 9. Let Q : P̃ (E) → I be a semi-fuzzy quantifier, X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E) fuzzy sets and γ ∈ [0, 1] a cautiousness level. ⊤Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) : [0, 1] → I is defined as:\n⊤Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) = sup S Q,X1,...,Xn (γ)\nDefinition 10. Let Q : P̃ (E) → I be a semi-fuzzy quantifier, X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E) fuzzy sets and γ ∈ [0, 1] a cautiousness level. ⊥Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) : [0, 1] → I is defined as:\n⊥Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) = inf S Q,X1,...,Xn (γ)\nUsing previous definitions we present the three paradigmatic DFSs :\nDefinition 11. [18, definition 7.22] Standard DFS M : (Q : P (E) → I) → (Q̃ : P̃ (E) → I) is defined as\nM (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) = ∫ 1\n0 med 1 2\n( ⊤Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) ,⊥Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) ) dγ\nDefinition 12. [18, definition 7.56, theorem 7.87] Standard DFS MCX : (Q : P (E) → I) →( Q̃ : P̃ (E) → I ) is defined as\nMCX (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) = sup { QLV,W (X1, . . . , Xn) : V1 ⊆ W1, . . . ,Vn ⊆ Wn }\nwhere\nQLV,W (X1, . . . , Xn) = min ( ΞV,W (X1, . . . , Xn) , inf {Q (Y1, . . . , Yn) : Vi ⊆ Yi ⊆ Wi} ) ΞV,W (X1, . . . , Xn) = n\nmin i=1\nmin ( inf { µXi (e) : e ∈ Vi } , inf { 1 − µXi (e) : e < Wi })\nDefinition 13. [18, definition 8.13] Standard DFS Fowa : (Q : P (E) → I) → ( Q̃ : P̃ (E) → I ) is defined as\nFowa (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) = 1 2\n∫ 1\n0 ⊤Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) dγ + 1 2\n∫ 1\n0 ⊥Q,X1,...,Xn (γ) dγ\n3.2. Alpha-cut based QFMs F I and F MD\nNow, we will present the two QFMs based on alpha-cuts F I and F MD.\nDefinition 14. [11, section 2.1], [9, chapter 3]Let Q : P (E)n → I be a semi-fuzzy quantifier over a base set E. The QFM F MD is defined as:\nF MD (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) = ∫ 1\n0 Q ( (X1)≥α , . . . , (Xn)≥α ) dα\nfor every X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E).\nWhen fuzzy sets X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E) are normalized and we limit ourselves to the unary and binary quantifiers considered in the Zadeh’s framework, F MD coincides with the quantification model GD defined in [6, page 281], [28, section 3.3.2. and section 3.4.1.], [7, page 37]. In this way, F MD generalizes the GD model to the Glöckner’s framework.\nLet us now present the definition of the F I model.\nDefinition 15. [10], [11, section 2.2],[9, chapter 3] Let Q : P (E)n → I be a semi-fuzzy quantifier over a base set E. The QFM F I is defined as:\nF I (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) = ∫ 1\n0 . . .\n∫ 1\n0 Q ( (X1)≥α1 , . . . , (Xn)≥αn ) dα1 . . .dαn\nfor every X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E).\n3.3. Non standard DFS F A\nThe definition of the QFM F A is based on a probabilistic interpretation of fuzzy sets in which we interpret membership degrees as probabilities [9],[12]. However, the F A model can also be defined by means of fuzzy operators without any reference to probability theory.\nThe QFM F A fulfills the axioms of the DFS framework but it is not a standard DFS, as the logic operators induced by the F A model are the product tnorm and the probabilistic sum tconorm.\nDefinition 16. Let X ∈ P̃ (E) be a fuzzy set, E finite. The probability of the crisp set Y ∈ P (E) of being a representative of the fuzzy set X ∈ P̃ (E) is defined as\nmX (Y) = ∏\ne∈Y\nµX (e) ∏\ne∈E\\Y\n(1 − µX (e))\nAs we have stated above, it is possible to make a similar definition without making any reference to probability theory. If we consider the product tnorm (∧ (x1, x2) = x1 · x2) and the Lukasiewicz implication then mX (Y) is the equipotence between Y and X [1]:\nEq (Y, X) = ∧e∈E (µX (e) → µY (e)) ∧ (µY (e) → µX (e))\nUsing the previous definition we define the F A DFS as:\nDefinition 17. [14, pag. 1359]Let Q : P (E)n → I be a semi-fuzzy quantifier, E finite. The DFS F A is defined as\nF A (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) = ∑\nY1∈P(E)\n. . . ∑\nYn∈P(E)\nmX1 (Y1) . . .mXn (Yn) Q (Y1, . . . , Yn) (2)\nfor all X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E).\nThe next expression is an alternative definition of the model F A:\nF A (X1, . . . , Xn) = ∨\nY1∈P(E)\n. . . ∨\nYn∈P(E)\nEq (Y1, X1) ∧ . . . ∧ Eq (Yn, Xn) ∧ Q (Y1, . . . , Yn)\nwhere∨ the Lukasiewicz tconorm (∨ (x1, x2) = min (x1 + x2, 1)), ∧ is the product tnorm (∧ (x1, x2) = x1 · x2) and Eq (Y, X) is the equipotence between the crisp set Y and the fuzzy set X. In this way, definition of F A can be done by means of common fuzzy operators."

      "heading" : "4. The DFS axiomatic framework",
      "text" : "In this section we will present the DFS axiomatic framework [18]. In the previous reference, the author has dedicated the whole third and fourth chapters to describe the framework and the properties that are consequence of it. For the sake of brevity, we will only give a general overview of the framework and some intuitions about the set of properties derived from it. We refer the reader to the previous publication for full detail.\nDefinition 18. A QFM F is called a determiner fuzzification scheme (DFS) if the following conditions are satisfied for all semi-fuzzy quantifiers Q : P (E)n → I:\nCorrect generalization U (F (Q)) = Q if n ≤ 1 (Z-1) Projection quantifiers F (Q) = π̃e if Q = πe for some e ∈ E (Z-2) Dualisation F ( Q̃ ) = F (Q) ̃ n > 0 (Z-3)\nInternal joins F (Q∪) = F (Q) ∪̃ n > 0 (Z-4) Preservation of monotonicity If Q is nonincreasing in the n-th arg, then (Z-5)\nF (Q) is nonincreasing in n-th arg, n > 0\nFunctional application F ( Q ◦ n × i=1 f̂i ) = F (Q) ◦ n × i=1 F̂ ( fi) (Z-6)\nwhere f1, . . . , fn : E′ → E, E′ , ∅\n4.1. Main properties derived from the DFS framework\nWe will only make a brief exposition of the main properties derived from the DFS framework. Full detail can be found in the aforementioned reference [18, chapters three and four.].\n• Correct generalization (P1): perhaps, the most important property derived from the DFS framework is the correct generalization property. Correct generalization requires that the behavior of a fuzzy quantifier F (Q) over crisp arguments is the expected; that is, results obtained with a fuzzy quantifier F (Q) and with the corresponding semi-fuzzy quantifier Q must coincide over crisp arguments. It is included in the DFS axiomatic for semi-fuzzy quantifiers of arities 0 and 1 (Z-1).\n• Quantitativity (P2): quantitative quantifiers do not depend on any particular characteristic of the elements of the base set. In the finite case, quantitative quantifiers can always be defined as a function of the cardinality of the boolean combinations of the argument sets. A QFM F preserves quantitativity if quantitative semi-fuzzy quantifiers are translated into quantitative fuzzy quantifiers by F .\n• Projection quantifier (P3): Axiom Z-2 guarantees that the projection crisp quantifier πe (Y) (that returns 1 if e ∈ Y and 0 in other case) is generalized to the fuzzy projection quantifier π̃e (X) (that returns µX (e)).\n• Induced propositional logic (P4): we will say that a QFM comply with the induced propositional logic if crisp logical functions (¬ (x), ∧ (x1, x2), ∨ (x1, x2), → (x1, x2)), that can be embedded into the definition of semi-fuzzy quantifiers, are generalized to acceptable fuzzy logical functions; that is, a negation operator, a tnorm, a tconorm and a fuzzy implication function.\n• External negation (P5): in the common case, external negation of a semi-fuzzy quantifier is computed by the application of the standard negation ¬̃ (x) = 1 − x. A QFM fulfilling the external negation property guarantees that F (¬̃Q) is equivalent to ¬̃F (Q). Thanks to the external negation property, equivalence of expressions “it is false that at least 80% of the hard workers are well paid” and “less than 80% of the hard workers are well paid” is assured.\n• Internal negation (P6): the internal negation (antonym) of a semi-fuzzy quantifier is defined as Q¬ (Y1, . . . , Yn) = Q (Y1, . . . ,¬Yn). For example, ‘no’ is the antonym of ‘all’ because all (Y1, Y2)¬ = all (Y1,¬Y2) = no (Y1, Y2). Fulfillment of the internal negation property assures that internal negation transformation are translated to the fuzzy case.\n• Dualisation (P7): the dualisation property coincides with the Z-3 axiom of the DFS framework, being a consequence of the simultaneous fulfillment of the external negation and internal negation properties. In conjunction with previous properties, equivalences in the ‘Aristotelian square’ are maintained in the fuzzy case. As an example, equivalence of F (all) (hard workers,well paid) and F (no) (hard workers, ¬̃well paid) is assured, or in words, “all hard workers are well paid” is equivalent to “no hard worker is not well paid”.\n• Union/intersection of arguments (P8): this property guarantees the compliance with some transformations that allow to construct new quantifiers by means of unions (and intersections) of arguments. As a particular case, the equivalence between absolute unary and binary quantifiers is a consequence of this axiom. As an example, the equivalence between “about 5 hard workers are well paid” and “about 5 people are hard workers and well paid” is assured. For QFMs fulfilling the DFS framework, the fulfillment of this property, in combination with internal and external negation properties, allow the preservation of the boolean argument structure that can be expressed in natural language when none of the boolean variables Xi occurs more than once [18, section 3.6].\n• Coherence with standard quantifiers (P9): by standard quantifiers we refer to the classical quantifiers ∃,∀ and their binary versions some and all. We will say that a QFM maintains coherence with standard quantifiers if the fuzzy versions of the classical quantifiers are the expected. For example, a QFM fulfilling this property complies (where ∨̃, ∧̃, →̃ are the logical operators induced by the QFM):\nF (∃) (X) = sup { m ∨̃ i=1 µX (ai) : A = {a1, . . . , am} ∈ P (E) , ai , a j if i , j }\nF (all) (X1, X2) = inf { m ∧̃ i=1 µX1 (ai) →̃µX2 (ai) : A = {a1, . . . , am} ∈ P (E) , ai , a j if i , j }\n• Monotonicity in arguments (P10): this property assures the translation of monotonicity in arguments relations from the semi-fuzzy to the fuzzy case. As an example, the binary semi-fuzzy quantifier ‘most’ is increasing in its second argument (e.g. “most students are poor”). This property assures that the fuzzy version of ‘most’ is also increasing in its second argument.\n• Monotonicity in quantifiers (P11): this property assures the preservation of monotonicity relations in quantifiers. For example, ‘between 4 and 6’ is more specific than ‘between 2\nand 8’. Fulfilment of this property assures that in the fuzzy case, the specificity relations between quantifiers are preserved.\n• Crisp argument insertion (P12): For a semi-fuzzy quantifier Q : P (E)n → I, crisp argument insertion allow to construct a new quantifier Q : P (E)n−1 → I by means of the restriction of Q by a crisp set A; that is, the crisp argument insertion Q ⊳ A is defined as Q ⊳ A (Y1, . . . , Yn−1) = Q (Y1, . . . , Yn−1, A). A QFM preserving the property of crisp argument insertion assures that F (Q ⊳ A) = F (Q) ⊳ A; that is, it is equivalent to first restrict the semi-fuzzy quantifier Q by A and then applying the fuzzification scheme F or to first applying the fuzzification mechanism and then restricting the corresponding fuzzy quantifier by A. Crisp argument insertion allow to model the ‘adjectival restriction’ of natural language in the crisp case.\n4.2. Some relevant properties non included in the DFS framework\nIn [18, chapter six] some additional adequacy properties for characterizing DFSs were described. These additional properties were not included in the DFS framework in some cases, for being incompatible with it, and in other cases, in order to not excessively restrict the set of theoretical models fulfilling the framework, which was important for the author for studying the full set of classes of standard models and their theoretical limits. We will present now the more relevant:\n• Continuity in arguments (P13): this property assures the continuity of the models with respect to the argument sets. It is fundamental to guarantee that small modifications in arguments do not provoke high variations in the results of evaluating quantified expressions.\n• Continuity in quantifiers (P14): this property assures the continuity of the models with respect to variations in the quantifiers.\n• Propagation of fuzziness (P15): this property assures that fuzzier inputs (understood as fuzzier input sets) and fuzzier quantifiers produce fuzzier outputs. We will discuss this property in more detail when we introduce the set of criteria we will use to improve the characterization of the behavior of the QFMs (see section 5.3).\n• Fuzzy argument insertion (P16): this property is the fuzzy counterpart of the crisp argument insertion. It is a very restrictive property, that will impose great limitations into the set of models fulfilling the DFS axiomatic framework .\n4.3. Comparison of the models against the QFM properties\nIn this section we will make a brief summary of the theoretical analysis of the QFMs F MD, F I , the non-standard DFS F A and the standard DFSs M, MCX and Fowa with respect to the set of previous properties. Table 1 summarizes the fulfillment of the properties for the different models. A detailed analysis of these models can be found in [18] and [9].\nThis analysis will allow us to understand the main differences between the models we are considering. As we will argue in the following section, although the set of properties previously presented allow for a deep analysis of the models, we consider that they are not enough to understand the behavioral differences between them and to decide which ones can be more appropriate for specific applications. The introduction of these new criteria and the analysis of the behavior of the modes with respect to it will be the objective of the last two sections of this paper.\nBefore summarizing the behavior of these models against these properties, we would like to emphasize that our point of view is that although models F MD and F I are not DFSs, they are really competitive with respect to models fulfilling the DFS framework. The main differences between the F MD and F I models when we compare them with DFSs is that they fail to fulfill some of the linguistic properties derived from the DFS framework. In addition, these models also fail to fulfill some of the QFM properties in the infinite case, which do not affect to most of the practical applications of fuzzy quantification3. Finally F MD and F I only fulfill the coherence with the standard quantifiers property in the unary case, although in the specific case of the F I model fulfillment of the property depends on the mechanism we will use to compute the induced operators of the model [9, chapter 3].\nThe competitiveness of F MD and F I models with respect to DFSs will become more clear when we present the analysis of the models against the new set of criteria, which from our point of view will prove that in some cases models F MD and F I present some advantages against models fulfilling the DFS framework.\n4.3.1. M model M model is one of the first models formulated by Glöckner [16] and it is also one of the three models for which the author has provided computational algorithms in [18, chapter 11]. Being an standard DFS M model fulfills the properties derived from the DFS framework. Additionally, the\n3We have the hypothesis that for ‘practical quantifiers’ (i.e., defined by means of continuous fuzzy numbers) models F MD and F I fulfill the continuous in arguments property. We also have the hypothesis that model F I fulfill the internal negation property for infinite domains in the same cases. The fulfillment of these properties will guarantee the convenience of these models for infinite domains in the practical cases.\nM model is continuous in arguments and in quantifiers and fulfills the properties of propagation of fuzziness in arguments and in quantifiers.\n4.3.2. MCX model MCX model is also a standard DFS and another model for which the author has provided a computational implementation in [18, chapter 11]. MCX is continuous in arguments and in quantifiers and fulfills both fuzziness propagation properties. MCX is considered by Glöckner as a model of unique properties: it fulfills the property of fuzzy argument insertion [18, definition 7.82], it is specially robust against modification of membership degrees and generalizes the Sugeno integral (see [18, section 7.13] for more details).\n4.3.3. Fowa model Fowa model is the paradigmatic example of an standard DFS that does not propagate fuzziness in arguments or in quantifiers. Fowa model is also continuous in arguments and in quantifiers. As it fails to fulfill propagation of fuzziness properties, it is considered as the ideal model for applications in which an improved discriminative power is necessary [18, section 8.1]. Fowa model generalizes Choquet integral. It is the third model for which a computational implementation has been provided in [18, definition 7.82].\n4.3.4. F MD model F MD is the generalization to QFMs of the GD model proposed by Delgado et al. in [6], [28], [7]. F MD model is not a DFS, failing to fulfill the internal negation property, and as a consequence, the dualisation axiom of DFSs (Z3). F MD model is continuous in the arguments in the finite case and also continuous in the quantifiers. F MD fulfills the properties of probabilistic interpretation of quantifiers and of averaging for the identity quantifier [9, chapter 3], that will be reintroduced as one of the criteria for comparing the behavior of selected QFMs in the following section. F MD does not fulfill any of the propagation of fuzziness properties.\n4.3.5. F I model F I model is the second alpha-cut based model analyzed in [9]. F I model does not fulfill the internal joins property (axiom Z4), and then fails to be a DFS. F I is continuous in the arguments in finite domains and also continuous in the quantifiers. F I model fulfills the dualisation property in the finite case. F I model also fulfills the properties of probabilistic interpretation of quantifiers and averaging for the identity quantifier [9, chapter 3]. F I does not fulfill propagation of fuzziness properties.\n4.3.6. F A model F A model is, to our knowledge, the unique known non-standard DFS. The fuzzy operators induced by the model are the product tnorm and the probabilistic sum tconorm, making this model essentially different of the standard DFSs presented in [18]. By definition F A is a finite model. Moreover, F A is continuous in arguments and in quantifiers, it does not fulfill fuzziness propagation properties, but it fulfills probabilistic interpretation of quantifiers and averaging for the identity quantifier properties."

      "heading" : "5. Some additional criteria to characterize the behavioral differences of the QFMs",
      "text" : "We have seen that models F MD, F I , F A, M, MCX and Fowa fulfill most of the adequacy properties that has been presented in [18]. If we only took into account properties included in the QFM framework when selecting a model for an application, we would just choose one of the best-behaved models (e.g., F A or MCX ) and we will use them in every possible application of fuzzy quantification.\nHowever, as we will see through this section, properties included in the QFM framework are not enough for fully understanding the behavioral differences between the selected models. We will present an analysis that proves that models here discussed have some strong differences in their behavior. In addition, an aspect we consider specially relevant is that, from an user viewpoint, the complexity of the definition of the models and adequacy properties makes very difficult for a non-specialist in fuzzy quantification to determine which model should be chosen for a specific application.\nThus, it is essential to establish a set of criteria that help us understand the behavioral differences between the different models and facilitate the selection of the more convenient ones for applications. In general, the set of criteria that we will take into account would not allow us to select ‘a perfect model’, or even ‘a preferred one’ for every possible application. But we are convinced they are important to (1) clarify the differences between the behavior of the QFMs (2) to select or discard QFMs for specific applications with respect to the behavior we consider more important and (3) to understand the problems that the selection of a specific model could have for a particular application.\nThe following is a summary of the criteria we will consider:\n• Linguistic compatibility. By linguistic compatibility we mean the fulfillment of the most relevant linguistic properties derived from the DFS framework. In the summary of the behavior of the main QFMs we have seen that between the selected models, only DFSs fulfill the main set of properties that have been established to guarantee an adequate behavior with respect to the main linguistic expectations.\n• Aggregative behavior for low degrees of membership: aggregative behavior makes reference to the tendency of a model to confuse one ‘high degree’ membership element with a large quantity of ‘low degree’ membership elements. It has been one of the main critiques made to the ∑ count model [35], [34].\n• Propagation of fuzziness: Propagation of fuzziness is the main property used in [18, section 5.2 and 6.3] to group the different classes of standard DFSs [18, chapters 7 and 8]. Basically, models fulfilling the propagation of fuzziness properties ‘transfer’ fuzziness in inputs to the outputs; that is, they guarantee that fuzzier inputs and/or fuzzier quantifiers produce fuzzier outputs.\n• Identity quantifier: the ‘identity semi-fuzzy quantifier’ is defined by means of the identity function f (x) = xN , x ∈ 1, . . . , N in the absolute case or by means of f (x) = x, x ∈ [0, 1] in the proportional case. For this semi-fuzzy quantifier, a linear increase in the number of elements that belong to the input, produce a linear increase in the output. We could expect that a reasonable fuzzy counterpart of the identity quantifier should also produce a linear increase in the output for a linear increase in the input.\n• Evaluating quantifiers over ‘quantified partitions’. With this criterion we refer to the behavior of the models when we apply, simultaneously, a set of quantifiers dividing the quantification universe (e.g., ‘nearly none’, ‘a few’, ‘several’, ‘many’, ‘nearly all’) to a fuzzy set. That is, how the degrees of fulfillment of the evaluation of the quantified expressions are distributed between the labels.\n• Fine distinction between objects. In applications of fuzzy quantification for ranking generation is generally needed that fuzzy quantifiers are able to clearly distinguish between objects fulfilling a set of criteria with different degrees. Criteria to distinguish the QFMs with respect to their discriminative power are necessary for these applications.\n5.1. Linguistic compatibility With linguistic compatibility we make reference to the main linguistic properties presented in [18, chapter 4 and 6]. The DFS framework guarantees that the main linguistic transformations, including argument permutations, negation of quantifiers, antonym of quantifiers, dual of quantifiers, argument insertion, internal meets, etc. are transferred from the semi-fuzzy to the fuzzy case.\n5.1.1. Analysis of the models Models MCX and F A. Being DFSs, both models fulfill all the semantic linguistic properties derived from the DFS framework. Moreover, these models fulfill the fuzzy argument insertion property [18, section 6.8], as it can be seen in [18, section 7.13] and in [9, chapter 3].\nModels M and Fowa. M and Fowa models fulfill semantic linguistic properties derived from the DFS framework, but not fuzzy argument insertion.\nModel F MD. The main difference of F MD model with respect to DFSs is the non-fulfillment of the internal negation property. This fact impedes the F MD model to correctly translate antonym relationships to the fuzzy case and, as a consequence, duality transformations (see [9, chapter 3]). As an example, failing to fulfill the internal negation property the model cannot guarantee the equivalence ofF MD (all) (hard workers,well paid) andF MD (no) (hard workers, ¬̃well paid). In words, results of evaluating “all hard workers are well paid” and “no hard worker is not well paid” are different.\nF MD fulfills the strong conservativity property [18, section 6.7] that guarantees that conservative semi-fuzzy quantifiers (i.e., quantifiers fulfilling Q (Y1, Y2) = Q (Y1, Y1 ∩ Y2) are correctly translated to the fuzzy case [9, chapter 3]. This property is not fulfilled by any DFS. However, loosing the internal negation property and as a consequence, the maintenance of the relationships of the ‘Aristotelian square’ seems more relevant than the fulfillment of the conservativity property.\nModel F I . Model F I looses the internal meets property. Moreover, the internal negation property is only fulfilled in the finite case (see [9, chapter 3]).\nLoosing the internal meets property F I model does not guarantee absolute unary/binary transformations. For example,F I (about 10) (hard workers,well paid) andF I (about 10) (hard workers∩̃well paid) are not equivalent, and then “about 10 hard workers are well paid” (evaluated by means of the binary absolute quantifier “about 10”) and “about 10 employees are hard workers and are well paid” (evaluated by means of the unary version of the absolute quantifier ‘about 10’ and the induced tnorm of the model used to compute the intersection of ‘hard workers’ and ‘well paid’) will not produce the same results.\n5.2. Aggregative behavior for low degrees of membership\nAggregative behavior for low degrees of membership is one of the main critiques that has been made to the Zadeh’s ∑ count model [32],[18, section A.3], [2]. The intuition around aggregative behavior is that in evaluating quantified expressions, a large amount of elements fulfilling a property with ‘low degree’ of membership should not be confused with a small amount of elements fulfilling a property with ‘high degree’ of membership. In the case of the Zadeh’s model is easy to understand the meaning of aggregative behavior as:\n∑ count (∃) ({0.01/e1, . . . , 0.01/e100}) = ∑ count (∃) ({1/e1, 0/e2, . . . , 0/e100}) = 1\nin words, ‘exist one tall person’ can be fulfilled if there exists exactly ‘one tall person’, or if there exist 100 people being ‘0.01 tall’.\nAlthough intuitions against aggregative behavior seem clear, giving up models presenting aggregative behavior will force us to discard non-standard DFS F associated to archimedean tconorms4. Being F (∃) equal to ([18, Theorem 4.61]):\nF (∃) (X) = sup { ∨̃\nm i=1 (ai) : A = {a1, . . . , am} ∈ P (E) f inite, ai , a j i f i , j\n}\nfor all X ∈ P̃ (E), then F (∃) (X) will always present aggregative behavior for every non-standard DFS associated to an archimedean tconorm ∨. Archimedean tconorms are a very relevant class of tconorm operators, including most of the common examples of tconorm operators.\nTo the best of our knowledge, a clear definition of aggregative behavior has not been presented in the literature, that has limited itself to present examples with existential quantifiers and/or with proportional quantifiers representing small proportions (e.g., ‘about 10%’). In this discussion, we will limit us to consider aggregative behavior for existential quantifiers, as it is enough to characterize the models we are considering.\n5.2.1. Analysis of the models Model F A. F A model presents aggregative behavior as a consequence of inducing the nonstandard probabilistic sum tconorm ∨̃ (a, b) = a + b − ab. For the F A model:\nF (∃) (X) = ∨̃e∈EµX (e)\nMoreover,F A model tends to the Zadeh’s Sigma-count model when the size of the referential E tends to infinite [12]; that is:\nlim |E|→∞\nF A (Q) (X) = µQ (∑ e∈E µX (e) |E| )\nIn this way, F A shares the critiques of aggregative behavior that has been made to the Zadeh’s model for large referential sets.\n4For an archimedean tconorm, limn−→∞ ∨ (c/e1 , . . . , c/en) = 1. Every continuous tconorm such that ∨ (x, x) > x, x ∈ (0, 1) is archimedean.\nModels M, MCX , Fowa, F MD andF I . None of the rest of the models show aggregative behavior. For all of them, F (∃) (X) = sup {µX (e) : e ∈ E}, E finite. We will give some intuitions about the reasons for which these models do not present aggregative behavior.\nModel MCX has been proved to be extremely stable. In [18, section 7.12] it is proved that a change in the arguments that does not exceed a given∆ will not change the result of the quantifier by more than ∆. Then, F (Q) (∅) and F (Q) ({c/e1, c/e2, . . . , c/eN}), with c ‘small’, will produce approximately the same results.\nWith respect to models M, Fowa, F MD and F I we should take into account that all of their definitions are made by using an integration process over the alpha-cuts or the three-valued cuts of the argument sets.\nIn the case of alpha cuts, only alpha cuts in the integration interval (0, c] could be altered by modifications in degrees of membership of elements with membership degree µX (e) ≤ c that are maintained in (0, c]. In the case of three-valued cuts, only the integration interval [1 − 2c, 1] could be altered by modifications in degrees of membership in the same interval. As the results of the integral do not change out of the integration range, effects of modifications lower or equal than c will be limited to c (in the case of alpha-cuts) or 2c in the case of three-valued cuts5.\n5.3. Propagation of fuzziness\nPropagation of fuzziness is related with the transmission of imprecision from the inputs (arguments and quantifiers) to the outputs (results of evaluating quantified expressions). We will reproduce the main definitions in [18, section 5.2 and 6.3].\nLet be c a partial order in I × I defined as\nx c y ⇔ y ≤ x ≤ 1 2 or 1 2 ≤ x ≤ y\nfor x, y ∈ I. c can be extended to fuzzy sets, semi-fuzzy quantifiers and fuzzy quantifiers in the following way:\nX c X ′ ⇔ µX (e) c µX′ (e) , for all e ∈ E Q c Q ′ ⇔ Q (Y1, . . . , Yn) c Q′ (Y1, . . . , Yn) , for all Y1, . . . , Yn ∈ P (E)\nQ̃ c Q̃′ ⇔ Q̃ (X1, . . . , Xn) c Q̃′ (X1, . . . , Xn) , for all X1, . . . , Xn ∈ P̃ (E)\nDefinition 19. [18, section 6.3]. Let a QFM F be given.\na. We say that F propagates fuzziness in arguments if the following property Q c Q′is satisfied for all Q : P (E)n → I and X1, . . . , Xn, X′1, . . . , X ′ n ∈ P̃ (E). If Xi c X ′ i for all i = 1, . . . , n\nthen F (Q) (X1, . . . , Xn) c F (Q) ( X′1, . . . , X ′ n ) .\nb. We say that F propagates fuzziness in quantifiers if F (Q) c F (Q′) whenever Q c Q′.\nPropagation of fuzziness in arguments and in quantifiers is considered as optional but really convenient in [18, section 6.3]. Intuitively, from an user point of view, fuzzier inputs or fuzzier quantifiers should not produce more specific outputs.\n5It can be proved that differences in the integration process for M and FCh are also limited to c, but we are only interested in giving an intuitive explanation of the reasons for which these models do not present aggregative behaviour.\nAlthough both propagation of fuzziness properties seem natural, we should note that most basic tnorms and tconorms do not fulfill propagation of fuzziness properties (e.g. product tnorm and probabilistic sum tconorm). This fact is relevant, as every DFS embeds basic logic operators [18, section 3.4]. Moreover, fulfillment of propagation of fuzziness properties have strong negative consequences for the ranking of objects (see section 5.6).\n5.3.1. Analysis of the models Models M, MCX . Models M and MCX are the paradigmatic examples of standard DFSs fulfilling propagation of fuzziness properties (see [18, chapter 7]. Using M and MCX assure that when presented with fuzzier inputs or quantifiers, we will always obtain fuzzier outputs.\nModels Fowa,F A,F MD and F I . Model Fowa is the paradigmatic example of an standard DFSs that does not fulfill both propagation of fuzziness properties.\nF A model does not fulfill propagation of fuzziness in arguments, as it is not fulfilled by the induced product tnorm and the induced probabilistic sum tconorm of the model (see [9, chapter 3]) and it is easy to find counterexamples for propagation of fuzziness in quantifiers. F MD and F I do not fulfill the property of propagation of fuzziness in arguments (see [9, chapter 3]) and it is also trivial to find counterexamples for the property of propagation of fuzziness in quantifiers.\n5.4. Identity quantifier: as many as possible\nFirst, we will define the identity semi-fuzzy quantifier. We will limit us to the proportional case:\nDefinition 20. The unary semi-fuzzy quantifier identity: P (E) → I is defined as\nidentity (Y) = |Y | |E| , Y ∈ P (E)\nFor the identity semi-fuzzy quantifier, adding one element increments the result in 1m . Thus, the increase in the output obtained with the addition of elements to the argument set is linear, making possible to interpret identity (Y) as ‘as many as possible’ or ‘the more the better’. In other way, the identity semi-fuzzy quantifier measures the relative weight of the input set Y with respect to the referential set E. That is, identity (Y) = |Y | / |E|.\nA plausible fuzzy counterpart of the identity quantifier should also produce a linear increase in the output for a linear increase in the input.\nDefinition 21. [9, chapter 3] We will say that a QFM F fulfills the average property for the identity quantifier if:\nF (identity) (X) = 1 m\nm∑\nj=1\nµX ( e j )\nAs a result of the fulfillment of the average property for the identity quantifier, the improvement obtained in F (identity) (X) is linear with respect to the increase of the membership grades of the argument fuzzy set. This property allows us to enquire if this intuition is translated to the fuzzy case, assuring that in the fuzzy case we will obtain a measure of the relative weight of X ∈ P̃ (E) with respect to E.\n5.4.1. Analysis of the models Models Fowa, F MD, F I and F A. Model Fowa [18, chapter 8], and models F MD, F I [9] generalize the OWA approach, and then they trivially fulfill the property of averaging for the identity quantifier. Model F A also fulfills this property [9],[12].\nModels M andMCX . Models M and MCX do not fulfill this property, as a direct consequence of fulfilling the propagation of fuzziness in the arguments. For M and MCX models, if M (X) = a or MCX (X) = a, a ≥ 0.5, then M (X′) ,MCX (X′) ∈ [0.5, a] for X′ c X (X′ fuzzier than X). More clearly:\nM (identity) (({1/e1, 1/e2, 0/e3, 0/e4})) = MCX (identity) (({1/e1, 1/e2, 0/e3, 0/e4}))\n= MCX (identity) (({0.5/e1, 0.5/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4}))\n= MCX (identity) (({1/e1, 1/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4}))\n= MCX (identity) (({0.5/e1, 0.5/e2, 0/e3, 0/e4}))\n= 0.5\nthat is, as M (identity) (({1/e1, 1/e2, 0/e3, 0/e4})) = 0.5 then for every possible X′ such that X′ c X the result will be at least as fuzzier as 0.5, but as 0.5 is the fuzzier possible output, M (identity) (X′) = 0.5.\nIn figure 1 we show a graphic representation of this behavior. Although we would expect a high degree of fulfillment for the identity quantifier in case 1 and a low degree in case 2, results of applying M or MCX to the identity quantifier for both inputs is 0.5 for every intermediate case between case 1) and case 2).\n5.5. Evaluating quantifiers over ‘quantified partitions’\nIn this section we will analyze the behavior of the models when we simultaneously evaluate a set of fuzzy quantifiers associated to a ‘quantified partition’ of the quantification universe. Let us consider the set of quantification labels presented in figure 2.\nFor reasons we will see later on, we will restrict us to a set of labels such that µQi (x) + µQi+1 (x) = 1 for some i. In any case, this is a very common way of dividing the reference universe in practical applications. We will refer to quantified partitions fulfilling this property as ‘Ruspini quantified partitions’.\nWhen we consider the simultaneous evaluation of a set of quantifiers defined by means of a quantified partition, behavior of standard DFSs (M, MCX Fowa) and QFMs (F A, F I and F MD) present strong differences. For some situations, models M, MCX and Fowa tend to produce the 0.5 output for every quantifier in the partition. Contrasting with these behavior, models F A, F I\nand F MD guarantee that the sum of the evaluation results equals 1, producing ‘a distribution’ of the truth between the set of quantified labels.\n5.5.1. Analysis of the models Models M, MCX and Fowa. As a consequence of being based in trivalued cuts models M, MCX and Fowa present a tendency to produce 0.5 evaluation results for some situations. Let us consider a fuzzy set X such that\nX = {0.5/e1, 0.5/e2, . . . , 0.5/em}\nthen, if for a semi-fuzzy quantifier Qi is fulfilled that there exist r, j such that qi (r) = 1 and qi ( j) = 0 (note that every quantifier in figure 2 fulfill this property) then\nM (X) = MCX (X) = Fowa (X) = 0.5\nas it can be easily checked. This behavior is independent of the granularity of the partition. That is, finer partitions will continue to produce a 0.5 output in each situation in which we could find some i, j such that qi (i) = 1 and qi ( j) = 0.\nModel F A. Before presenting the behavior of the F A model, we need to introduce some definitions to precise the meaning of a ‘Ruspini quantified partition’.\nDefinition 22. We will say that a set of semi-fuzzy quantifiers Q1, . . . , Qr : Pn (E) → I forms a Ruspini partition of the quantification universe if for all Y1, . . . , Yn ∈ P (E) it holds that\nQ1 (Y1, . . . , Yn) + . . . + Qr (Y1, . . . , Yn) = 1\nExample 23. The next set of quantifiers form a Ruspini partition of the quantification universe:\nQi (Y1, Y2) =\n{ labeli ( |Y1∩Y2 | |Y1 | ) Y1 , ∅\n1 5 Y1 = ∅\nwhere the ‘i-th’ fuzzy number in the partition is represented by labeli represents. This set of fuzzy numbers form a Ruspini partition of the quantification universe as ∑ i Qi (Y1, Y2) = 1 for all Y1, Y2 ∈ P (E).\nDefinition 24. [9, chapter 3]We will say that a QFM F fulfills the property of probabilistic interpretation of quantifiers if for all the Ruspini partitions of the quantification universe Q1, . . . , Qr : P (E)n → I it holds that\nF (Q1) (X1, . . . , Xn) + . . . + F (Qr) (X1, . . . , Xn) = 1\nThis property is very interesting because it allow us to interpret the result of evaluating fuzzy quantified expressions as probabilities over the labels related to the quantifiers6. F A,F MD and F I models fulfill this property [9, chapter three], [12]. Thus, we can interpret that these models tend to distribute the truth between the set of labels of the partition, assuring that the sum of the evaluation results associated to each label adds to 1.\nIn addition, in [12] it has been proved that for unary quantifiers the F A model tends to the Zadeh’s Sigma-count model when the size of the referential E tends to infinite; that is:\nlim |E|→∞\nF A (Q) (X) = µQ (∑ e∈E µX (e) |E| )\nIn this way, for a big |E| we have F A (Q) (X) ≈ µQ (∑ e∈E µX(e) |E| ) . As ∑ e∈E µX(e) |E| is a punctual value, when we apply this result to a Ruspini quantified partition like the one presented in figure 2, the weights of the evaluation of the quantified expressions tend to concentrate themselves in one quantified label qi (being F A (Qi) (X) ≈ 1) or two contiguous ones qi, qi+1 (being F A (Qi) + F A (Qi+1) ≈ 1).\nModels F MD and F I . Models F MD and F I also fulfill the property of probabilistic interpretation of quantifiers. Hence, the result of evaluating a set of quantifiers Q1, . . . , Qr forming a Ruspini quantified partition can be interpreted as a probability defined over the quantified labels of the quantifiers. Thus, we can interpret that these models tend to distribute the weight of evaluating quantified sentences over the set of labels used to define the fuzzy quantifiers.\nMoreover, the following result proves that in the unary case, for a ‘perfectly’ distributed fuzzy set, models F MD and F I tend to assign to each quantifier a probability weight proportional to its area. Let us define an equispaced fuzzy set over [0, 1] as:\nµX (a0) = 0 < µX (a1) = h < µX (a2) = 2h, . . . , µX (am) = 1\nThen, if we restrict ourselves to piecewise continuous functions, it is fulfilled that:\nlim m→∞\n∫ 1\n0 Q (X≥α) dα = lim m→∞ µQ ( 1 m ) h + µQ ( 2 m ) h + . . . + µQ ( m − 1 m ) h = ∫ 1 0 µQ (x) dx\n6In [20] a probabilistic interpretation of quantifiers is also used under the label semantics interpretation of fuzzy sets.\n, as we are simply computing the area of the quantifier. As a consequence, when we evaluate a set of unary quantifiers Q1, . . . , Qr : P (E) → I over a fuzzy set following an identity function (µX (ei) = im ) we obtain:\nF MD (Qi) (X) = F I (Qi) (X) ≈ area ( µQi )\nThis property is related to the probabilistic alpha-cut interpretation of models F MD and F I . In this interpretation, if membership values of X are perfectly distributed, then ‘weights’ of the alpha cuts are perfectly distributed over the quantification universe. In this way, quantifiers of greater areas tend to ‘collect’ more weight than quantifiers with smaller areas. This also means that, for ‘finer’ quantifier partitions, weights tend to be more distributed between the quantifiers of the partition.\n5.6. Fine distinction between objects\nIn applications of fuzzy quantifiers for ranking generation, we generally have a set of objects o1, . . . , oN for which the fuzzy fulfillment of a set of criteria p1, . . . , pm is known Xoi = {µX i (p1) /p1, . . . , µX i (pm) /pm}, where µX i ( p j ) /p j represents the fulfillment of the criteria p j by the object oi. Additionally, we generally have a set of weights W = {µW (p1) /p1, . . . , µW (pm) /pm} indicating the relative importance of the criteria p1, . . . , pm.\nFuzzy quantification can be used to generate a ranking by means of the assignment of a weight to each object, computed using an unary proportional quantified expression, roi = Q̃ (Xoi ) when a vector of weights is not involved, or computed using a binary proportional quantified expression roi = Q̃ (W, Xoi) when there exists a vector of weights W to indicate the relative importance of each criteria. Hence, when we compute roi for each i = 1, . . . , N, we can rank each object with respect to ‘how Q̃’ criteria it fulfills (e.g., for Q̃ = many, ‘how many’).\nFuzzy quantifiers seem specially convenient for ranking applications. As roi indicates ‘how good’ is the object i in fulfilling ‘Q̃ criteria’. We can easily adjust the quantifiers to prioritize objects fulfilling ‘most of the criteria’, ‘some of them’, ‘a least 10’, etc.\nRanking applications usually demand a great discriminative power between objects. In general, we should expect that even small variations in the inputs would produce some effect in the outputs. In order to analyze the discriminative power of QFMs, we will need some definitions:\nDefinition 25. Let h (x) : [0, 1] → I an strictly increasing continuous mapping; i.e., h (x) > h (y) for every x > y. We define the unary and binary semi-fuzzy quantifiers Qh : P (E) → I and Qh : P (E)2 → I as\nQh (Y) = h (|Y |) , Y ∈ P (E)\nQh (Y1, Y2) =\n{ h ( |Y1∩Y2 | |Y1 | ) X1 , ∅\n1 X1 = ∅\nFor assuring the discriminative power of QFMs, we will require that in the case of unary quantifiers, any increase in the fulfillment of a criteria will increase F (Qh). In the binary case, we will require that any increase in the fulfillment of a criteria associated with a strictly positive weight will also increase F (Qh). That is, as h is strictly increasing, we expect that an increase in the values of the inputs is translated into an increase in the result of the evaluation.\nDefinition 26. Let us consider X1, X2 such that µX1 (ei) = µX2 (ei) , i , j, µX1 (ei) < µX2 (ei) , i = j. We say that a QFM F fulfills the property of discriminative ranking generation for unary quantifiers if:\nF (Qh) (X2) > F (Qh) (X1)\nfor h (x) strictly increasing.\nDefinition 27. Let us consider W, X1, X2 such that µX1 (ei) = µX2 (ei) , i , j, µX1 (ei) < µX2 (ei) , µW (i) > 0, i = j. We say that a QFM F fulfills the property of discriminative ranking generation for binary quantifiers if it fulfills:\nF (Qh) (W, X2) > F (Qh) (W, X1)\nfor h (x) strictly increasing.\n5.6.1. Analysis of the models Models M and MCX . Fulfillment of propagation of fuzziness properties makes M and MCX very inconvenient for ranking applications. Examples presented in section 5.4 have shown that these models are piecewise constant, and that they are not able of differentiating between really large regions of the input space. As a consequence, these models are incapable of making fine distinction between objects.\nModel Fowa. ModelFowa have been presented in [18, chapter 8] as the paradigmatic example of a standard DFS non-fulfilling the properties of propagation of fuzziness. Thus, the author consider the Fowa model convenient for applications needing an ‘enhanced discriminatory force’.\nAs Fowa model generalizes OWA, it adequately deals with the fine distinction between objects in the unary case. But in the binary case, Fowa is piecewise constant, as it proves the following example:\nFowa (Qid) ({1/e1, 1/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4} , {1/e1, 1/e2, 0/e3, 0/e4})\n= 0.75\n= Fowa (Qid) ({1/e1, 1/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4} , {1/e11/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4})\nIn previous example, for 0.5 weights of e3, e4, we can modify object fulfillment in the [0, 0.5] range without obtaining any difference in the output.\nModel F MD. A similar problem happens with the F MD model. As the F MD fulfills the strong conservativity property (see [9, chapter 3]) we have\nF MD (Qid) (W, Xoi ) = F MD (Qid) ( W,W∩̃Xoi )\nand then,\nF MD (Qid) ({1/e1, 1/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4} , {1/e1, 1/e2, 1/e3, 1/e4})\n= F MD (Qid) ({1/e1, 1/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4} , {1/e1, 1/e2, 0.5/e3, 0.5/e4})\n= 1\nModel F I . Model F I fulfills the property of discriminative ranking generation. The proof is shown in the Apendix.\nModel F A. The F A model also fulfills the property of discriminative ranking generation. The proof is shown in the Apendix."

      "heading" : "6. Some recommendations for selecting QFMs for applications",
      "text" : "In table 2 we synthesize the behavior of the QFMs F MD, F I , F A, M, MCX and Fowa with respect to the set of additional criteria we have presented. This allow to establish some recommendations for the selection of convenient models for applications:\n1. In applications that require a fine distinction between objects (e.g., ranking applications) only models F I and F A should be used for non unary quantifiers. In the unary case F MD\nand Fowa coincide with the F I model for increasing quantifiers, and are also acceptable. 2. In applications in which aggregative behavior is not acceptable, F A should be avoided. 3. For maximal coherence with linguistic criteria, models MCX and F A are the preferred\nones. Models M and Fowa show a good behavior as well. Model F I , being inferior to DFSs with respect to linguistic coherence, conserves linguistic transformations of the ‘Aristotelian square’ in the finite case.\n4. If propagation of fuzziness is required, the only viable options are M and MCX . 5. In order to preserve the intuitions underneath of the identity quantifier, guaranteeing that\na linear increase in the inputs produces a linear increase in the outputs, models F A,F MD, F I or Fowa should be selected. 6. When taken into account the behavior of QFMs over quantified partitions, if we expect more undefined results for fuzzier fuzzy sets, standard DFSs should be used. In the case of prefering that QFMs could be interpreted as probabilities over quantified labels, distributing the ‘degree of fulfilment’ between the different labels, the convenient models are F MD, F I and F A.\nSumming up, the model F A is a really convenient model for all the applications in which aggregative behavior is not an impediment. MCX is the perfect model for applications in which preservation of fuzziness properties is required, but presents the handicap that is very inadequate for ranking applications and it does not maintain the linguistic intuitions under the ‘identity quantifier’. Additionally, it has been proved that the MCX models presents a very stable behavior [18, section 7.12], which assures a certain insensitivity against modifications in the memberships degrees.\nIf we need a model guaranteeing a fine distinction between objects but avoiding aggregative behavior, the best option is the F I model. F I also guarantees linguistic intuitions associated to the identity quantifier, allows to interpret quantified partitions as probabilities, and for fuzzy sets whose membership degrees are maximally distributed over the referential set, evaluation results provided by F I tend to the area of the quantifier. Moreover, F I preserves internal an external negation properties (this last property in the finite case), assuring the conservation of the linguistic relations of the ‘Aristotelian square’. Although F I is not a DFS, it is a remarkable model that presents a great equilibrium between the fulfillment of the different criteria.\nF MD, sharing some of the behavior of the F I model, is not adequate for fine differentiation of objects in the binary case. We consider linguistic behavior of F I model superior to the linguistic behavior of F MD, as this last model does not preserve linguistic transformations of the Aristotelian square.\nM model shares most of the behavior of the MCX model, presenting the same problems but loosing some properties, as Fuzzy Argument Insertion.\nFowa model has been presented as the paradigmatic example of standard DFS convenient for ranking applications, but we have seen that this model is not adequate for achieving a fine differentiation between objects with binary quantifiers. However, if we were interested in preserving all the properties of standard DFS guaranteeing some discriminative power, then the Fowa model is the convenient option.\nFinally, the way in which QFMs behave over quantified partitions can guide us in our decision between standard DFSs and the remaining models. Standard DFS will tend to produce more undefined results (in the sense of closeness to 12 ) for fuzzier fuzzy sets (in the sense of closeness to 12 of their membership degrees). F\nA, F MD and F I generate results that can be interpreted as probabilities, dividing the ‘evaluation weight’ between the different quantifiers in the partition. F MD and F I also preserve the intuition of ‘weight of the quantifier’ (in the sense of the coverage of the quantification universe by the labels) for a perfect distribution of membership degrees. That is, F MD and F I tend to produce a result proportional to the area of the quantifier for fuzzy sets whose membership degrees tend to be equally distributed over [0, 1]."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this work we have advanced in the definition of some criteria to provide a better understanding of the behavior of the most significative QFMs. First, we have compared the selected QFMs against the main set of properties presented in [18], with the objective of clarifying the differences that these models present with respect to the properties proposed in the QFM framework.\nAfter that, we argued that previous considered properties, while being really convenient to separate ‘good quantification models’ from ‘bad ones’, are not sufficient to clearly distinguish between the set of analyzed QFMs, and specially, to help potential users in the process of selecting the most convenient model for a specific application.\nIn order to advance in this problem, we have introduced a new set of criteria, specially designed to differentiate the behavior of the analyzed models. An in-depth comparative analysis of\nthe main models has been performed with respect to this new set of criteria. Based on this analysis we have established some recommendations to guide in the selection of the more adequate model for specific practical applications.\nAs future work, we consider relevant the possibility of defining new oriented criteria, focused on specific applications."

Nevertheless, some problems remain when we face the decision of selecting the most convenient model for a specific application. In the literature, several desirable adequacy properties have been proposed, but theoretical limits impede quantification models from simultaneously fulfilling every adequacy property that has been defined. Besides, the complexity of model definitions and adequacy properties makes very difficult for real users to understand the particularities of the different models that have been presented. In this work we will present several criteria conceived to help in the process of selecting the most adequate Quantifier Fuzzification Mechanisms for specific practical applications. In addition, some of the best known well-behaved models will be compared against this list of criteria. Based on this analysis, some guidance to choose fuzzy quantification models for practical applications will be provided.",
