      "text" : "Semantic similarity measure serves as the foundation of knowledge discovery and management processes such as ontology matching, ontology alignment & mapping, ontology merging, etc [Shvaiko and Euzenat, 2013]. Ontological concept similarity can be based on different approaches: (i) string matching of concept labels (i.e. lexical similarity) [Stoilos et al., 2005], (ii) external lexical resource/ontology based matching (i.e. lexico-semantic similarity) [Rada et al., 1989a], (iii) graph-based matching using lexicons such as WordNet [Stuckenschmidt, 2007] (i.e. structural similarity), (iv) property analysis (as in FCA-based similarity [Cimiano et al., 2005]) or instance analysis (as in Jaccard similarity [Jaccard, 1998]) based matching over a large sample of concept instance occurrences (i.e. instance-driven similarity), (v) matching based on statistical analysis of attribute-value or distribution analysis within fixed context-windows of concepts over large corpora (i.e. statistical similarity) [Li and Clifton, 1994], and (vi) model-theoretic matching of formal concept descriptions (i.e. formal semantic similarity) [Alsubait et al., 2014].\nIt can be argued that, in comparison to other approaches, formal semantic similarity measure modeling has not received equal research attention. Nevertheless, existing literature is significant, and can be broadly classified into two approaches: (i) Propositional Logics based [Nienhuys-Cheng, 1998; Ramon and Bruynooghe, 1998], and (ii) Description Logics (DL) based [Alsubait et al., 2014; Lehmann and Turhan, 2012; Stuckenschmidt, 2007; Fanizzi and dAmato,\n2006; Borgida et al., 2005]. The former requires: (a) representation of ontologies (mostly in RDFS/OWL format) in First Order Predicate Logic, (b) a set of axioms (or domain knowledge, mostly as upper ontologies/thesaurus), and (c) a SAT solver that checks satisfiability (and hence, satisfiability) of disjointness of concept pairs. The latter approach, on the other hand, does not necessarily require any formal language transformation or satisfiability checker. In this paper we propose an algebraic similarity measure, called BitSim (σBS), that can compute semantic similarity of pair of concepts defined in ALCH+1. The motivation behind σBS is to formulate a formal semantic similarity measure that provides: (i) a platform for fast, scalable, and accurate semantic similarity computation of DL concepts, and (ii) a sound and complete correspondence with conventional semantic interpretation of DL. σBS is algebraic, in the sense that it maps a given pair of concept codes (called bit-code), instead of concept DL definitions/axioms, to a positive real space. For this we define a novel algebraic interpretation function, called IB, that maps an ALCH+ definition to a unique string, called bit-code, (ωB) belonging to the language LB defined over a novel algebraic alphabet ∑ B. We prove that IB has complete correspondence with IALCH+. We also show that σBS is highly adaptive to any kind of similarity measure that relies on set operation. As an example, we have shown how σBS can be plugged into Jaccard similarity index. The contribution of the paper is as follows: • IB : A novel algebraic semantic interpretation function\nforALCH+ . • Proof of mathematical correspondence of IB with se-\nmantic interpretation ofALCH+ . • σBS : A novel semantic similarity measure based on IB • Comparative analysis of properties of σBS with contem-\nporary DL based similarity measures."

The most common approach for DL based similarity measure modeling adopts taxonomic analysis as proposed in [Rada et al., 1989b; Resnik and others, 1999; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Wu and Palmer, 1994; Lin, 1998]. These techniques can be further sub-divided, as mentioned in introduction, into graph-traversal approaches [Rada et al., 1989b] and Information-Content approaches [Resnik and others, 1999]. However, these methods can work on a generalized ontology and hence, are not sensitive to DL definitions.\nIn structural analysis based approaches, a similarity measure is designed to capture the semantic equivalence of description trees of definitions of DL concept pairs. One way of achieving this is to calculate the degree of homomorphism between such trees, as proposed in [Tongphu and Suntisrivaraporn, 2014]. A refinement graph based anti-unification approach has been proposed in [Ontañón and Plaza, 2012] for computing instance similarity. Approximation based techniques aim at converting given DL expression to another lower expressive DL language on approximation. In [Stuckenschmidt, 2007] an upper and lower approximation interpretation for SHIQ have been defined over a sub-vocabulary of SHIQ. The sub-vocabulary can be formed by either removing concepts atoms in a given definition or by replacing them with structurally simpler concepts [Groot et al., 2005]. Another technique, as proposed in [Noia et al., 2004], is based on converting user query into a DL expression and try to classify the match to be either an exact match, or a potential match (i.e., match might happen if some concept atom and operators are added) or a partial match (where the user query and answer/description found in the knowledge base are in conflict).\nOne of the pioneer work on model-theoretic interpretation based similarity approach can be found in [Borgida et al., 2005]. The work shows the inherent difficulty in measuring similarity of DL concepts using conventional taxonomic analysis based techniques. It then uses an InformationContent based approach to evaluate the similarity of two concept definitions. A work has been proposed by [Lehmann and Turhan, 2012] for similarity computation of concepts defined in ELH . In this work, a Jaccard Index [Jaccard, 1998] based approach has been followed that compares common parents of a concept pair using a fuzzy connector (i.e. a similarity score aggregation function). A similar Jaccard Index based approach has been recently proposed in [Alsubait et al., 2014]. Another recent approach has been proposed in [Distel et al., 2014]. The work emphasizes the necessity of triangle inequality property of formal semantic similarity measure. It defines two versions of a relaxation function for computing dissimilarity of concepts defined in EL. However, it can be proved that triangle inequality is not always valid and hence, is not a necessary condition."

We first define bit (ΣB), the alphabet of LB , as follows:\nDefinition 2: A base alphabet (ΣBbase ) is an alphabet defined as: ΣBbase = {0, 1} where • 0 is the empty symbol. It is also called potential bit since\nit generates all other symbols (i.e. bits) • 1 is base bit, called property bit, signifying the presence\nof a property at the string position that it holds. Definition 3: An bit operator (⊕B) is a set of operators on the base bits defined as: ⊕B = {tB,uB,¬B}. We now define a very important semantics for potential bit (i.e. 0) as follows:\n¬B0 = 0 (1) Definition 4: An derived alphabet (ΣBderived ) is an alphabet\ndefined as: ΣBderived = {X, X′′, X′,Y,Y ′,>′,⊥′,>,⊥} where\n• X′′ = ¬B1 • X = 1 tB 0 • X′ = X′′ tB 0 • >′ = Y tB Y ′ • Y ′ = 1 uB 0 • Y = X′′ uB 0 • ⊥′ = X uB X′ Based on the above definition the following observations\ncan be made (using de Morgan’s law): • X = ¬BY • X′ = ¬BY ′\n• >′ = ¬B⊥′\n• > = ¬B⊥ A further analysis shows that ΣBhas a partial ordering 4B (as shown in figure 1). It is interesting to note that bi uB ¬bi , ⊥;∀bi ∈ ΣB. Definition 5.1: An bit-alphabet (ΣB) is defined as ΣB: ΣBbase ∪ ΣBderived .\nIt is to be noted that ⊕B satisfies commutativity and double negation over ΣB.\nDefinition 5.2: A quantifier-alphabet (ΣBQ ) is defined as ΣBQ = {1, 0, X,Y ′}. The algebraic space of ΣBQ is defined as below: • X = 1 tB 0 • Y ′ = 1 uB 0 • ¬B1 = 0 • ¬BY ′ = X\nDefinition 5.3: A role-alphabet (ΣBR ) is defined as ΣBR = {1, 0, X,Y ′}. The algebraic space of ΣBR is defined as below: • X = 1 tB 0 • Y ′ = 1 uB 0\nDefinition 6.1: A base bit-code (ωBbase ) is defined as ωBbase= 0∗ ◦B b∗i ◦B (◦||〈◦Bb∀ ◦ ||〉||〈◦B(bRi )+◦〉|| ◦B b+i )∗ ◦B (◦||〈◦Bb∃ ◦ ||(◦〉||〈◦BbRi )+◦〉|| ◦B b+i )∗ where ◦B is bit concatenation operator; b∀, b∃ ∈ ΣBQ ; b∀ = 1, b∃ = 0; bi ∈ ΣB; bRi ∈ ΣBR .

Unlike other DL based similarity measures, σBS was designed to satisfy all the necessary properties defined in section 3.2 with special emphasis on structural dependency and strict monotonicity.\nAt the same time, σBS computation is over LB , rather than ALCH+ . This significantly improves the computational speed since σBS essentially becomes a function over ωB pairs (such bit-codes can be computed and stored off-line in the knowledge base). Since, σBS computation is performed on pairs of bits holding the same position in ωB , therefore we can chunk bit-codes in constant sizes and perform similarity over concept pairs on parallel computational platforms. This gives massive scalability to σBS . Efficient optimization can be performed by caching similarity results of bit-code chunks that are frequently visited.\nWe will also show that, at a bit level, σBS has a partial ordering 4σBS . This allows application-oriented assignment of similarity scores to bit pairs at the lowest granularity. Also, σBS is highly adaptive to all types of similarity measures that have set theoretic operations on DL concepts."

This is because, for a bounded number of atomic concepts (say, n) we need a mechanism to encode 22 n distinct and disjoint concepts, in the worst case. However, with only 11 bits in ΣB, we can only encode 11n distinct concepts. It is because of this reason that we need to use ωBderived . The method is to have nested encoding for bit operations over certain special bit pairs. These operations do not have direct mapping to the algebraic lattice shown in figure 1. Instead they map to intermediate and discrete compound bits (bω). which can be represented in terms of ΣB.
