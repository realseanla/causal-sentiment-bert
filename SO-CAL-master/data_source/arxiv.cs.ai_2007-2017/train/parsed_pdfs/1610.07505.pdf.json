      "text" : "The problem of timely risk assessment and decision-making based on a sequentially observed time series is ubiquitous, with applications in finance, medicine, cognitive science and signal processing [1-7]. A common setting that arises in all these domains is that a decision-maker, provided with sequential observations of a time series, needs to decide whether or not an adverse event (e.g. financial crisis, clinical acuity for ward patients, etc) will take place in the future. The decision-maker’s recognition of a forthcoming adverse event needs to be timely, for that a delayed decision may hinder effective intervention (e.g. delayed admission of clinically acute patients to intensive care units can lead to mortality [5]). In the context of cognitive science, this decision-making task is known as the two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task [15]. Insightful structural solutions for the optimal Bayesian 2AFC decision-making policies have been derived in [9-16], most of which are inspired by the classical work of Wald on sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) [8].\nIn this paper, we present a Bayesian decision-making model in which a decision-maker adaptively decides when to gather (costly) information from an underlying time series in order to accumulate evidence on the occurrence/non-occurrence of an adverse event. The decision-maker operates under time pressure: occurrence of the adverse event terminates the decision-making process. Our abstract model is motivated and inspired by many practical decision-making tasks such as: constructing temporal patterns for gathering sensory information in perceptual decision-making [1], scheduling lab\n29th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\ntests for ward patients in order to predict clinical deterioration in a timely manner [3, 5], designing breast cancer screening programs for early tumor detection [7], etc.\nWe characterize the structure of the optimal decision-making policy that prescribes when should the decision-maker acquire new information, and when should she stop acquiring information and issue a final prediction. We show that the decision-maker’s posterior belief process, based on which policies are prescribed, is a supermartingale that reflects the decision-maker’s tendency to deny the occurrence of an adverse event in the future as she observes the survival of the time series for longer time periods. Moreover, the information acquisition policy has a ”rendezvous” structure; the optimal ”date” for acquiring the next information sample can be computed given the current sample. The optimal schedule for gathering information over time balances the information gain (surprise) obtained from acquiring new samples, and the probability of survival for the underlying stochastic process (suspense). Finally, we characterize the continuation and stopping regions in the decision-maker’s state-space and show that, unlike previous models, they depend on the time series ”context” and not just the decision-maker’s beliefs.\nRelated Works Mathematical models and analyses for perceptual decision-making based on sequential hypothesis testing have been developed in [9-17]. Most of these models use tools from sequential analysis developed by Wald [8] and Shiryaev [21, 22]. In [9,13,14], optimal decision-making policies for the 2AFC task were computed by modelling the decision-maker’s sensory evidence using diffusion processes [20]. These models assume an infinite time horizon for the decision-making policy, and an exogenous supply of sensory information.\nThe assumption of an infinite time horizon was relaxed in [10] and [15], where decision-making is assumed to be performed under the pressure of a stochastic deadline; however, these deadlines were considered to be drawn from known distributions that are independent of the hypothesis and the realized sensory evidence, and the assumption of an exogenous information supply was maintained. In practical settings, the deadlines would naturally be dependent on the realized sensory information (e.g. patients’ acuity events are correlated with their physiological information [5]), which induces more complex dynamics in the decision-making process. Context-based decision-making models were introduced in [17], but assuming an exogenous information supply and an infinite time horizon.\nThe notions of “suspense” and “surprise” in Bayesian decision-making have also been recently introduced in the economics literature (see [18] and the references therein). These models use measures for Bayesian surprise, originally introduced in the context of sensory neuroscience [19], in order to model the explicit preference of a decision-maker to non-instrumental information. The goal there is to design information disclosure policies that are suspense-optimal or surprise-optimal. Unlike our model, such models impose suspense (and/or surprise) as a (behavioral) preference of the decision-maker, and hence they do not emerge endogenously by virtue of rational decision making."

      "text" : "Time Series Model The decision-maker has access to a time-series X(t) modeled as a continuoustime stochastic process that takes values in R, and is defined over the time domain t ∈ R+, with an underlying filtered probability space (Ω,F , {Ft}t∈R+ ,P). The process X(t) is naturally adapted to {Ft}t∈R+ , and hence the filtration Ft abstracts the information conveyed in the time series realization up to time t. The decision-maker extracts information from X(t) to guide her actions over time.\nWe assume that X(t) is a stationary Markov process1, with a stationary transition kernel Pθ (X(t) ∈ A|Fs) = Pθ (X(t) ∈ A|X(s)) , ∀A ⊂ R, ∀s < t ∈ R+, where θ is a realization of a latent Bernoulli random variable Θ ∈ {0, 1} (unobservable by the decision-maker), with P(Θ = 1) = p. The distributional properties of the paths of X(t) are determined by θ, since the realization of θ decides which Markov kernel (Po or P1) generates X(t). If the realization θ is equal to 1, then an adverse event occurs almost surely at a (finite) random time τ , the distribution of which is dependent on the realization of the path (X(t))0≤t≤τ .\n1Most of the insights distilled from our results would hold for more general dependency structures. However, we keep this assumption to simplify the exposition and maintain the tractability and interpretability of the results.\nThe decision-maker’s ultimate goal is to sequentially observe X(t), and infer θ before the adverse event happens; inference is obsolete if it is declared after τ . Since Θ is latent, the decision-maker is unaware whether the adverse event will occur or not, i.e. whether her access to X(t) is temporary (τ < ∞ for θ = 1) or permanent (τ = ∞ for θ = 0). In order to model the occurrence of the adverse event; we define τ as an F -stopping time for the process X(t), for which we assume the following:\n• The stopping time τ |Θ = 1 is finite almost surely, whereas τ |Θ = 0 is infinite almost surely, i.e. P (τ < ∞|Θ = 1) = 1, and P (τ = ∞|Θ = 0) = 1.\n• The stopping time τ |Θ = 1 is accessible2, with a Markovian dependency on history, i.e. P (τ < t| Fs) = P (τ < t|X(s)) , ∀s < t, where P (τ < t|X(s)) is an injective map from R to [0, 1] and P (τ < t|X(s)) is non-decreasing in X(s).\nThus, unlike the stochastic deadline models in [10] and [15], the decision deadline in our model (i.e. occurrence of the adverse event) is context-dependent as it depends on the time series realization (i.e. P (τ < t|X(s)) is not independent of X(t) as in [15]). We use the notation Xτ (t) = X(t∧τ), where t ∧ τ = min{t, τ} to denote the stopped process to which the decision-maker has access. Throughout the paper, the measures Po and P1 assign probability measures to the paths Xτ (t)|Θ = 0 and Xτ(t)|Θ = 1 respectively, and we assume that Po << P13.\nInformation The decision-maker can only observe a set of (costly) samples of Xτ (t) rather than the full continuous path. The samples observed by the decision-maker are captured by partitioning X(t) over specific time intervals: we define Pt = {to, t1, . . ., tN(Pt)−1}, with 0 ≤ to < t1 < . . . < tN(Pt)−1 ≤ t, as a size-N(Pt) partition of X\nτ (t) over the interval [0, t], where N(Pt) is the total number of samples in the partition Pt. The decision-maker observes the values that Xτ (t) takes at the time instances in Pt; thus the sequence of observations is given by the process X(Pt) = ∑N(Pt)−1 i=0 X(ti)δti , where δti is the Dirac measure. The space of all partitions over the interval [0, t] is denoted by Pt = [0, t]N. We denote the probability measures for partitioned paths generated under Θ = 0 and 1 with a partition Pt as P̃o(Pt) and P̃1(Pt) respectively.\nSince the decision-maker observes Xτ (t) through the partition Pt, her information at time t is conveyed in the σ-algebra σ(Xτ (Pt)) ⊂ Ft. The stopping event is observable by the decisionmaker even if τ /∈ Pτ . We denote the σ-algebra generated by the stopping event as St = σ ( 1{t≥τ} ) .\nThus, the information that the decision-maker has at time t is expressed by the filtration F̃t = σ(Xτ (Pt)) ∨ St, and it follows that any decision-making policy needs to be F̃t-measurable.\nFigure 1 depicts a Brownian path (a sample path of a Wiener process, which satisfies all the assumptions of our model)4, with an exemplary partition Pt over the time interval [0, 1]. The decision-maker observes the samples in X(Pt) sequentially, and reasons about the realization of the latent variable Θ based on these samples and the process survival, i.e. at t = 0.2, the decision-\n2Our analyses hold if the stopping time is totally inaccessible. 3The absolute continuity of Po with respect to P1 means that no sample path of Xτ (t)|Θ = 0 should be\nfully revealing of the realization of Θ. 4In Figure 1, the stopping event was simulated as a totally inaccessible first jump of a Poisson process.\nmaker’s information resides in the σ-algebra σ(X(0), X(0.1), X(0.15)) generated by the samples in P0.2 = {0, 0.1, 0.15}, and the σ-algebra generated by the process’ survival S0.2 = σ(1{τ>0.2}).\nPolicies and Risks The decision-maker’s goal is to come up with a (timely) decision θ̂ ∈ {0, 1}, that reflects her prediction for whether the actual realization θ is 0 or 1, before the process Xτ(t) potentially stops at the unknown time τ . The decision-maker follows a policy: a (continuous-time) mapping from the observations gathered up to every time instance t to two types of actions:\n• A sensing action δt ∈ {0, 1}: if δt = 1, then the decision-maker decides to observe a new sample from the running process Xτ (t) at time t.\n• A continuation/stopping action θ̂t ∈ {∅, 0, 1}: if θ̂t ∈ {0, 1}, then the decision-maker decides to stop gathering samples from Xτ (t), and declares a final decision (estimate) for θ. Whenever θ̂t = ∅, the decision-maker continues observing Xτ (t) and postpones her declaration for the estimate of θ.\nA policy π = (πt)t∈R+ is a (F̃t-measurable) mapping rule that maps the information in F̃t to an action tuple πt = (δt, θ̂t) at every time instance t. We assume that every single observation that the decision-maker draws from Xτ(t) entails a fixed cost, hence the process (δt)t∈R+ has to be a point process under any optimal policy5. We denote the space of all such policies by Π.\nA policy π generates the following random quantities as a function of the paths Xτ(t) on the probability space (Ω,F , {Ft}t∈R+ ,P):\n1- A stopping time Tπ: The first time at which the decision-maker declares its estimate for θ, i.e. Tπ = inf{t ∈ R+ : θ̂t ∈ {0, 1}}. 2- A decision (estimate of θ) θ̂π: Given by θ̂π = θ̂Tπ∧τ . 3- A random partition P πTπ : A realization of the point process (δt)t∈R+ , comprising a finite set of strictly increasing F -stopping times at which the decision-maker decides to sample the path Xτ (t).\nA loss function is associated with every realization of the policy π, representing the overall cost incurred when following that policy for a specific path Xτ(t).

Using a further application of Bayes’ rule we have that\n(\ndP̃o(P π t ) dP̃1(P πt )\n)−1\n= dP(σ(X(P πt )), t < τ |Θ = 1)\ndP(σ(X(P πt )), t < τ |Θ = 0)\n= P(t < τ |X(P πt ),Θ = 1) · dP(X(P π t )|Θ = 1)\nP(t < τ |X(P πt ),Θ = 0) · dP(X(P π t )|Θ = 0)\n= dP(X(P πt )|Θ = 1)\ndP(X(P πt )|Θ = 0) · P(t < τ |X(P πt ),Θ = 1), (5)\nwhere we have used the fact that P(t < τ |X(P πt ),Θ = 0) = 1. For any partition P π t , the likelihood ratio dP(X(P π t )|Θ=1)\ndP(X(Pπ t )|Θ=0) is an elementary predictable process that takes an initial value that is equal to\nthe prior p (when no samples are initially observed), and then takes constant values of dP(X(P π t )|Θ=1)\ndP(X(Pπ t )|Θ=0)\nin the interval between any two samples in the partition (only when a new sample is observed, the likelihood is updated). Hence, we have that\ndP(X(P πt )|Θ = 1) dP(X(P πt )|Θ = 0) = p1{t=0} +\nN(Pπ t )−1\n∑\nk=1\nP(X(P πt )|Θ = 1) P(X(P πt )|Θ = 0) 1{Pπ t (k−1)≤t≤Pπ t (k)}.\nThe process is predictable since the likelihood remains constant as long as no new samples are observed. Modulated by the survival probability, ( dP̃o(P π t )\ndP̃1(Pπt )\n)−1\ncan be written as\npP(τ > t|Θ = 1)1{t<Pπ t (k)}+\nN(Pπ t )−1\n∑\nk=1\nP(X(P πt )|Θ = 1) P(X(P πt )|Θ = 0) P(τ > t|σ(X(P πt ),Θ = 1) 1{Pπt (k)≤t≤Pπt (k+1)}.\nUnder usual regularity conditions on P(τ > t|σ(X(P πt ),Θ = 1) it is easy to see that ( dP̃o(P π t )\ndP̃1(Pπt )\n)−1\nwill have jumps only at the time instances in the partition P πt and at the stopping time τ , i.e. a total of N(P πTπ∧τ ) + 1{τ<∞} jumps at the time indexes in P π t∧τ ∪ {τ}.\nTheorem 1 says that every belief path is right-continuous with left limits, and has jumps at the time indexes in the partition P πt , whereas between each two jumps, the paths (µt)t∈[t1,t2), t1, t2 ∈ P π t are predictable (i.e. they are known ahead of time once we know the magnitudes of the jumps preceding them). This means that the decision-maker obtains ”active” information by probing the time series to observe new samples (i.e. the information in σ(Xτ (Pt))), inducing jumps that revive her beliefs, whereas the progression of time without witnessing a stopping event offers the decision-maker ”passive information” that is distilled just from the costless observation of the process’ survival. Both sources of information manifest themselves in terms of the likelihood ratio, and the survival probability in the expression of dP̃o(P π t )\ndP̃1(Pπt ) above.\nIn Figure 2, we plot the càdlàg belief paths for policies π1 and π2, where P π1 ⊂ P π2 (i.e. policy π1 observe a subset of the samples observed by π2). We also plot the (predictable) belief path of a wait-and-watch policy that observes no samples. We can see that π2, which has more jumps of ”active information”, copes faster with the truthful belief over time. Between each two jumps, the belief process exhibits a non-increasing predictable path until fed with a new piece of information. The wait-and-watch policy has its belief drifting away from the prior p = 0.5 towards the wrong belief µt = 0 since it only distills information from the process survival, which favors the hypothesis Θ = 0. This discussion motivates the introduction of the following key quantities.\nInformation gain (surprise) It(∆t): The amount of drift in the decision-maker’s belief at time t + ∆t with respect to her belief at time t, given the information available up to time t, i.e. It(∆t) = (µt+∆t − µt) |F̃t.\nPosterior survival function (suspense) St(∆t): The probability that a process generated with Θ = 1 survives up to time t + ∆t given the information observed up to time t, i.e. St(∆t) = P(τ > t + ∆t|F̃t,Θ = 1). The function St(∆t) is a non-increasing function in ∆t, i.e. ∂St(∆t)\n∂∆t ≤ 0.\nThat is, the information gain is the amount of “surprise” that the decision-maker experiences in response to a new information sample expressed in terms of the change in here belief, i.e. the jumps in µt, whereas the survival probability (suspense) is her assessment for the risk of having the adverse event taking places in the next ∆t time interval. As we will see in the next subsection, the optimal policy would balance the two quantities when scheduling the times to sense Xτ (t).\nWe conclude our analysis for the process µt by noting that the lack of information samples creates bias towards the belief that Θ = 0 (e.g. see the belief path of the wait-and-watch policy in Figure 2). We formally express this behavior in the following Corollary.\nCorollary 1 (Leaning towards denial). For every policy π ∈ Π, the posterior belief process µt is a supermartingale with respect to F̃t, where\nE[µt+∆t|F̃t] = µt − µ 2 tSt(∆t)(1 − St(∆t)) ≤ µt, ∀∆t ∈ R+.\nProof: Recall that from Theorem 1, we know that the posterior belief process can be written as\nµt = 1{t≥τ} + 1{t<τ}P(Θ = 1|F̃t).\nHence, the expected posterior belief at time t+∆t given the information in the filtration F̃t can be written as\nE\n[\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] = E [ 1{t+∆t≥τ} + 1{t+∆t<τ}P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ]\n= E [\n1{t+∆t≥τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] + E [ 1{t+∆t<τ}P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ]\n= P(Θ = 1, t+∆t ≥ τ |F̃t) + P(t+∆t < τ |F̃t) · E [ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ] ,\n(6)\nand hence E [\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] can be written as\nP(t+∆t ≥ τ |F̃t,Θ = 1)·P(Θ = 1|F̃t)+P(t+∆t < τ |F̃t)·E [ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ] ,\nwhich is equivalent to\nE\n[\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] = (1− St(∆t)) · µt + P(t+∆t < τ |F̃t) · E [ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ] .\n(7)\nFurthermore, the term P(t+∆t < τ |F̃t) in the expression above can be expressed as\nP(t+∆t < τ |F̃t) = P(t+∆t < τ |F̃t,Θ = 1) · P(Θ = 1|F̃t) + P(t+∆t < τ |F̃t,Θ = 0) · P(Θ = 0|F̃t) (8)\n= St(∆t) · µt + (1− µt).\nTherefore, E [\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] can be written as\nE\n[\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] = (1− St(∆t)) · µt + (1− µt + St(∆t) · µt) · E [ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ] .\n(9)\nNow it remains to evaluate the term E [ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ] in order to find\nE\n[\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] . We first note that\nE\n[ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ] = E [ P(Θ = 1|σ(Xτ (P πt+∆t)), t+∆t < τ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] .\nWe start evaluating the above by first looking at the term P(Θ = 1|σ(Xτ (P πt+∆t)), t + ∆t < τ). Using Bayes’ rule, we have that\nP(Θ = 1|Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) = P(Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ)\nP(Xτ (P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) , (10)\nwhere P(Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) can be expanded using successive applications of Bayes’ rule as\nP(Θ = 1|Xτ(P πt ), t < τ) · P(X τ (P πt ), t < τ) · P(t+∆t < τ |Θ = 1, X τ(P πt ), t < τ)\n·dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ),\nwhich is equivalent to\nP(Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) = µt · St(∆t) · P(X τ (P πt ), t < τ) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ) (11)\nSimilarly, it is easy to see that\nP(Θ = 0, Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) = (1− µt) · P(X τ (P πt ), t < τ) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 0, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ), (12)\nwhere again, we have used the fact that P(t + ∆t < τ |Θ = 0, Xτ(P πt ), t < τ) = 1. Now we re-formulate (10) using Bayes rule to arrive at the following\nP(Θ = 1|Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) = P(Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) ∑\nθ∈{0,1} P(Θ = θ,X τ (P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ)\n, (13)\nthen using (11) and (12), (13) can be further reduced to P(Θ = 1|Xτ(P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) =\nµt · St(∆t) · dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ)\nµt · St(∆t) · dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ) + (1− µt) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 0, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ)\n.\n(14)\nFinally, we use the expression in (14) to evaluate the term\nE\n[ P(Θ = 1|σ(Xτ (P πt+∆t)), t+∆t < τ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] as follows\nE\n[ P(Θ = 1|σ(Xτ (P πt+∆t)), t+∆t < τ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] =\n∑ θ∈{0,1}\n∫\nP(Θ = 1|Xτ (P πt+∆t), t+∆t < τ) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = θ,Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ),\nwhich, using (14), can be written as ∑\nθ∈{0,1}\n∫ µt · St(∆t) · dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = θ,Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ)\nµt · St(∆t) · dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ) + (1− µt) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 0, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t\nSince ∑\nθ∈{0,1}\ndP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = θ,Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ) =\nµt ·St(∆t) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ)+(1−µt)·dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 0, Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ),\nthen the integral above reduces to ∫\nµt ·St(∆t) ·dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = θ,Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ) = µt ·St(∆t)·\n∫\ndP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = θ,Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ),\nand since the conditional density integrates to 1, i.e. ∫ dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = θ,Xτ (P πt ), t+∆t < τ) = 1, then we have that\nE\n[ P(Θ = 1|σ(Xτ (P πt+∆t)), t+∆t < τ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] = µt · St(∆t).\nBy substituting the above in (9), we arrive at\nE\n[\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] = (1− St(∆t)) · µt + (1− µt + St(∆t) · µt) · E [ P(Θ = 1|F̃t+∆t) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ∨ {t+∆t < τ} ]\n= (1− St(∆t)) · µt + (1− µt + St(∆t) · µt) · µt · St(∆t)\n= µt − µ 2 tSt(∆t)(1 − St(∆t)). (15)\nSince St(∆t) ≥ 0, ∀t,∆t ∈ R+, then the term µ2tSt(∆t)(1 − St(∆t)) ≥ 0, and it follows that\nE\n[\nµt+∆t ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] ≤ µt, ∀t,∆t ∈ R+,\nand hence the posterior belief process (µt)t∈R+ is a supermartingale with respect to the filtration F̃t.\nThus, unlike classical Bayesian learning models with a belief martingale [18, 21-23], the belief process in our model is a supermartingale that leans toward decreasing over time. The reason for this is that in our model, time conveys information. That is, unlike [10] and [15] where the decision deadline is hypothesis-independent and is almost surely occurring in finite time for any path, in our model the occurrence of the adverse event is itself a hypothesis, hence observing the survival of the process is informative and contributes to the evolution of the belief. The informativeness of both the acquired information samples and process survival can be disentangled using Doob decomposition, by writing µt as µt = µ̃t +A(µt, St(∆t)), where µ̃t is a martingale, capturing the information gain from the acquired samples, and A(µt, St(∆t)) is a predictable compensator process [23], capturing information extracted from the process survival."

      "text" : "The optimal policy π∗ minimizes the expected risk as defined in (1) and (2) by generating the tuple of random processes (Tπ, θ̂π, P πt ) in response to the paths of X\nτ (t) on (Ω,F , {Ft}t∈R+ ,P) in a way that ”shapes” a belief process µt that maximizes informativeness, maintains timeliness and controls cost. In the following, we introduce the notion of a ”rendezvous policy”, then in Theorem 2, we show that the optimal policy π∗ complies with this definition.\nRendezvous policies We say that a policy π is a rendezvous policy, if the random partition P πTπ constructed by the sequence of sensing actions (δπt )t∈[0,Tπ], is a point process with predictable jumps, where for every two consecutive jumps at times t and t ′ , with t ′ > t and t, t ′\n∈ P πTπ , we\nhave that t ′\nis F̃t-measurable.\nThat is, a rendezvous policy is a policy that constructs a sensing schedule (δπt )t∈[0,Tπ ], such that every time t ′\nat which the decision-maker acquires information is actually computable using the information available up to time t, the previous time instance at which information was gathered. Hence, the decision-maker can decide the next ”date” in which she will gather information directly after she senses a new information sample. This structure is a natural consequence of the information structure in Theorem 1, since the belief paths between every two jumps are predictable, then they convey no ”actionable” information, i.e. if the decision-maker was to respond to a predictable belief path, say by sensing or making a stopping decision, then she should have taken that decision right before the predictable path starts, which leads her to better off by saving the delay cost Cd. We denote the space of all rendezvous policies by Πr. In the following Theorem, we establish that the rendezvous structure is optimal.\nTheorem 2 (Rendezvous). The optimal policy π∗ is a rendezvous policy (π∗ ∈ Πr).\nProof: Assume a discrete-time version of the problem, where the decision (θ̂πt , δ π t ) are made in time steps {0,∆t, 2∆t, . . .}. Define a value function V : N × [0, 1] → R+ as a map from the current history to the risk of the best policy given the history F̃t as follows:\nV (F̃t) , inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t,PπTπ⊃P π t )E\n[ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] ,\nand define the action-value function as the value function achieved by taking actions (θ̂t, δt), andthen following the best policy thereafter. That is, when the decision is to continue (i.e. θ̂t = ∅), we have that\nQ(F̃t; (θ̂t = ∅, δt = 1)) , inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t,PπTπ⊃P π t ,t∈Pπ Tπ )E\n[ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] ,\nand Q(F̃t; (θ̂t = ∅, δt = 0)) , inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t,PπTπ⊃P π t ,t/∈Pπ Tπ )E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] .\nBased on Bellmans optimality principle [24], we know that the optimal policy has to satisfy the following in every time step, i.e.\nδπ ∗\nt = arg infδt∈{0,1}Q(F̃t; (θ̂t = ∅, δt)).\nNow let us look at the optimal partition on P π ∗\nTπ∗ on the discrete time steps {0,∆t, 2∆t, . . .},\nand look at an arbitrary realization for P π ∗\nTπ∗ . Then we pick two consecutive time indexes in\n{0,∆t, 2∆t, . . .}, say n1∆t and n2∆t, with n1 < n2, for which δπ ∗ n1∆t = δπ ∗ n2∆t = 1, and δπ ∗\nn∆t = 0, ∀n1 < n < n2. Since the policy is optimal, we know that\narg infδn∆t∈{0,1}Q(F̃n∆t; (θ̂n∆t = ∅, δn∆t)) = 0, ∀n1 < n < n2,\nand arg infδn2∆t∈{0,1}Q(F̃n2∆t; (θ̂n2∆t = ∅, δn2∆t)) = 1,\nwhich is equivalent to\narg infδn∆t∈{0,1}E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃n∆t ] = 0, ∀n1 < n < n2,\nand arg infδn2∆t∈{0,1}E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃n2∆t ] = 1,\nwhich can be further decomposed into\narg infδn∆t∈{0,1}E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣σ(X(P π ∗ n1∆t)) ∨ Sn∆t ] = 0, ∀n1 < n < n2,\nand arg infδn2∆t∈{0,1}E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣σ(X(P π ∗ n1∆t)) ∨ Sn2∆t ] = 1, since both functions E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣σ(X(P π ∗\nn1∆t )) ∨ Sn∆t\n] and E [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣σ(X(P π ∗\nn1∆t )) ∨ Sn2∆t\n]\nare F̃n1∆t-measurable, then the decision-maker can compute the optimal decision sequence {δn∆t}\nn2 n=n1+1 at time n1∆t. Since this holds for an arbitrary discretization step ∆t, including\nan arbitrarily small step ∆t → 0, it follows that the sensing actions construct a predictable point process under the optimal policy, which concludes the Theorem.\nA direct implication of Theorem 2 is that the time variable can now be viewed as a state variable, whereas the problem is virtually solved in ”discrete-time” since the decision-maker effectively jumps from one time instance to another in a discrete manner. Hence, we alter the definition of the action δt from an indicator variable that indicates sensing the time series at time t, to a ”rendezvous action” that takes real values, and specifies the time after which the decision-maker would sense a new sample, i.e. if δt = ∆t, then the decision-maker gathers the new sample at t + ∆t. This transformation restricts our policy design problem to the space of rendezvous policies Πr, which we know from Theorem 2 that it contains the optimal policy (i.e. π∗ = arg infπ∈ΠrR(π)).\nHaving established the result in Theorem 2, in the following Theorem, we characterize the optimal policy π∗ in terms of the random process (Tπ∗ , θ̂π∗ , P π ∗\nt ) using discrete-time Bellman optimality conditions [24].\nTheorem 3 (The optimal policy). The optimal policy π∗ is a sequence of actions (θ̂π ∗ t , δ π∗ t )t∈R+ , resulting in a random process (θ̂π∗ , Tπ∗ , P π ∗\nTπ∗ ) with the following properties:\n(Continuation and stopping)\n1. The process (t, µt, X̄(P π ∗\nt ))t∈R+ is a Markov sufficient statistic for the distribution of (θ̂π∗ , Tπ∗ , P π∗\nTπ∗ ), where X̄(P π\n∗ t ) is the most recent sample in the partition P π∗ t , i.e.\nX̄(P π ∗ t ) = X(t ∗), t∗ = maxP π ∗ t .\n2. The policy π∗ recommends continuation, i.e. θ̂π ∗\nt = ∅, as long as the belief µt ∈ C(t, X̄(P π ∗\nt )), where C(t, X̄(P π∗\nt )), is a time and context-dependent continuation set with the following properties: C(t ′ , X) ⊂ C(t,X), ∀t ′ > t, and C(t,X ′ ) ⊂ C(t,X), ∀X ′ > X .\n(Rendezvous and decisions)\n1. Whenever µt ∈ C(t, X̄(P π ∗ t )), and t ∈ P π∗ Tπ∗ , then a rendezvous δπ ∗ t is set as follows\nδπ ∗\nt = arg infδ∈R+ ((C1 − Co)P(It(δ) ≥ ηt) + C1) St(δ) + Cr (1− St(δ)),\nwhere ηt = C1Co+C1 − µt.\n2. Whenever µt /∈ C(t, X̄(P π ∗ t )), then a decision θ̂ π∗\nt = θ̂π∗ ∈ {0, 1} is issued, and is based on a belief threshold as follows: θ̂π∗ = 1{µt≥ C1Co+C1 }. The stopping time is given by Tπ∗ = inf{t ∈ R+ : µt /∈ C(t, X̄(P π ∗ t ))}.\nProof: We start by proving that the optimal decision rule is 1{ µt>\nC1 Co+C1\n}. Fix an optimal stopping\ntime Tπ∗ and an optimal partition P π ∗\nTπ∗ . The optimal decision rule is given by\nθ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣P π ∗ Tπ∗ , Tπ∗ ] ,\nwhich is equivalent to θ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ (C1 1{θ̂π=0,θ=1} + Co 1{θ̂π=1,θ=0} + Cd Tπ∗)1{Tπ∗≤τ} + Cr 1{Tπ∗>τ} + CsN(P π∗ Tπ∗∧τ ) ] ,\nwhich by smoothing can be written as θ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ E [ (C1 1{θ̂π=0,θ=1} + Co 1{θ̂π=1,θ=0} + Cd Tπ∗)1{Tπ∗≤τ} + Cr 1{Tπ∗>τ} + CsN(P π∗ Tπ∗∧τ ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]] ,\nand hence we have that\nθ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ E [ (C1 1{θ̂π=0,θ=1} + Co 1{θ̂π=1,θ=0} + Cd Tπ∗)1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] +\nE\n[\nCr 1{Tπ∗>τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] + E [ CsN(P π∗ Tπ∗∧τ ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]] .\nSince the terms E [\nCr 1{Tπ∗>τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] , E [ Cd Tπ∗ 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] , and\nE\n[\nCsN(P π∗ Tπ∗∧τ ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] are the information and delay costs, which do not depend on the\nchoice of θ̂π, we have that\nθ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ E [ (C1 1{θ̂π=0,θ=1} + Co 1{θ̂π=1,θ=0})1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]] ,\nwhich can be reduced to the following\nθ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ E [ (C1 1{θ̂π=0,θ=1} + Co 1{θ̂π=1,θ=0})1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]]\n= arg infθ̂πE [ C1 · E [ 1{θ̂π=0,θ=1} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] + Co · E [ 1{θ̂π=1,θ=0} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]] = arg infθ̂πE [ C1 · E [ 1{θ̂π=0} · 1{θ=1} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] + Co · E [ 1{θ̂π=1} · 1{θ=0} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]] .\n(16)\nSince 1{θ̂π=θ} is an F̃Tπ∗ -measurable function, we have that\nθ̂π∗ = arg infθ̂πE [ C1 · E [ 1{θ̂π=0} · 1{θ=1} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] + C1 · E [ 1{θ̂π=1} · 1{θ=0} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]]\n= arg infθ̂πE [ C1 · 1{θ̂π=0} · E [ 1{θ=1} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ] + Co · 1{θ̂π=1} · E [ 1{θ=0} · 1{Tπ∗≤τ} ∣ ∣ ∣F̃Tπ∗ ]] = arg infθ̂πE [ C1 · 1{θ̂π=0} · (1− µTπ∗ ) + Co · 1{θ̂π=1} · µTπ∗ ] = arg infθ̂πE [ C1 · 1{θ̂π=0} · (1− µTπ∗ ) + Co · 1{θ̂π=1} · µTπ∗ ] , (17)\nwhich is simply minimized by setting θ̂π = 1 whenever C1(1 − µTπ∗ ) > CoµTπ∗ , hence we have that θ̂π = 1{}.\nNow we resume by first defining the value and the action-value functions, and find the policy characteristics under Bellman optimality conditions.\nDefine a value function V : N× [0, 1] → R+ as a map from the current history to the risk of the best policy given the history F̃t as follows:\nV (F̃t) , inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t,PπTπ⊃P π t )E\n[ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] ,\nand define the action-value function as the value function achieved by taking actions (θ̂t, δt), and then following the best policy thereafter, i.e.\nQ(F̃t; (θ̂t, δt)) , inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t+δt,PπTπ⊃P π t ∪{t+δt}) E\n[ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ] .\nBellman optimality condition requires that at any time step t, we have\n(θ̂π ∗ t , δ π∗ t ) = arg inf(θ̂t,δt)∈{0,1}×R+Q(F̃t; (θ̂t, δt)).\nRecall from the proof of Corollary 1 that the belief process follows the following dynamics\nµt+∆t =\nµt · St(∆t) · dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ)\nµt · St(∆t) · dP(Xτ (t+∆t)|Θ = 1, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ) + (1− µt) · dP(X τ (t+∆t)|Θ = 0, Xτ(P πt ), t+∆t < τ)\n,\nwhich depends only on µt and the most recent sample realization in the partition P πt , which we denote as X̄τ (P πt ). Hence, the tuple (t, µt, X̄ τ (P πt )) is a Markov process since X τ (t) is Markovian, and the belief process follows the above Markovian dynamics, and time is deterministic. Since the survival probability depends only on X̄τ (P πt ), we can write the action-value function as\nQ(F̃t; (θ̂t, δt)) , inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t+δt,PπTπ⊃P π t ∪{t+δt})\nE [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣µt, X̄ τ (P πt ) ] ,\nand consequently, the optimal actions at every time step t following Bellman conditions are given by\n(θ̂π ∗ t , δ π∗\nt ) = arg inf(θ̂t,δt)∈{0,1}×R+ inf(θ̂π,Tπ≥t+δt,PπTπ⊃P π t ∪{t+δt})\nE [ ℓ(π; Θ) ∣ ∣µt, X̄ τ (P πt ) ] .\nHence, at any time step t, we only need to know the tuple (t, µt, X̄τ (P πt )) in order to compute the optimal action-value function, and hence, on the path to the optimal policy, knowing only (t, µt, X̄ τ (P πt )) suffice to generate the random process (Tπ∗ , P π∗ Tπ∗ , θ̂π∗). Hence, (t, µt, X̄τ(P πt )) is a Markov sufficient statistic for (Tπ∗ , P π ∗\nTπ∗ , θ̂π∗).\nNote that our proof for the optimal decision rule θ̂π∗ implies that the action-value function for stopping at time t, i.e. θ̂π ∗\nt 6= ∅ is\nQ(t, µt, X̄ τ (P πt ); (θ̂t 6= ∅, δt)) = Coµt ∧ C1(1 − µt) + Cd t+ CsN(P π t ),\nwhereas the continuation cost at any time step t is given by finding the optimal rendezvous time infδt∈R+Q(t, µt, X̄\nτ(P πt )); (θ̂t = ∅, δt)). Therefore, the optimal action-value at any time step t is given by\nQ∗(t, µt, X̄ τ (P πt ); (θ̂t 6= ∅, δt)) = min{Coµt∧C1(1−µt)+Cd t+CsN(P π t ), infδt∈R+Q(t, µt, X̄ τ (P πt ); (θ̂t = ∅, δt))}.\nThe equation above determines the stopping and continuation conditions, and using the monotonicity of the survival function in both time t and the time series realizations X̄τ (P πt ), we can show the monotonicity of the continuation set C(t, X̄τ(P πt )) using the same arguments of Theorem 1 in [15].\nThe optimal rendezvous can be found by optimizing the time interval such that the cost of stopping in the next time step is minimized. Hence, we have that\nδπ ∗ t = infδt∈R+Q(t, µt, X̄ τ (P πt ); (θ̂t = ∅, δt))\n= infδt∈R+E [ (Coµt+δt ∧ C1(1− µt+δt) + Cd t+ δt) 1{t+δt<τ} + Cr1{t+δt≥τ} + CsN(P π t ) + 1 ∣ ∣ ∣F̃t ]\n= infδt∈R+\n(\n(C1 − Co)P(µt+∆t ≥ C1\nCo + C1 ) + C1\n)\nSt(δt) + Cr(1 − St(δt)), (18)\nwhere P(µt+∆t ≥ C1Co+C1 ) can be written as P(It(∆t) ≥ C1 Co+C1 −µt), where It(∆t) = µt+∆t−µt is the information gain.\nTheorem 3 establishes the structure of the optimal policy and its prescribed actions in the decisionmaker’s state-space. The first part of the Theorem says that in order to generate the random tuple (Tπ∗ , θ̂π∗ , P π ∗\nt ) optimally, we only need to keep track of the realization of the process (t, µt, X̄(Pt))t∈R+ in every time instance. That is, an optimal policy maps the current belief, the current time, and the most recently observed realization of the time series to an action tuple (θ̂πt , δ π t ), i.e. a decision on whether to stop and declare an estimate for θ or sense a new sample. Hence, the process (t, µt, X̄(Pt))t∈R+ represents the ”state” of the decision-maker, and the decision-maker’s actions can partially influence the state through the belief process, i.e. a decision on when to acquire the next sample affects the distributional properties of the posterior belief. The remaining state variables t and X(t) are beyond the decision-maker’s control.\nWe note that unlike the previous models in [9-16], with the exception of [17], a policy in our model is context-dependent. That is, since the state is (t, µt, X̄(P πt )) and not just the time-belief tuple (t, µt), a policy π can recommend different actions for the same belief and at the same time but for a different context. This is because, while µt captures what the decision-maker learned from the history, X̄(P πt ) captures her foresightedness into the future, i.e. it can be that the belief µt is not decisive (e.g. µt ≈ p), but the context is ”risky” (i.e. X̄(P πt ) is large), which means that a potential forthcoming adverse event is likely to happen in the near future, hence the decision-maker would be more eager to make a stopping decision and declare an estimate θ̂π. This is manifested through the dependence of the continuation set C(t, X̄(P πt )) on both time and context; the continuation set is monotonically decreasing in time due to the deadline pressure, and is also monotonically decreasing in X̄(P πt ) due to the dependence of the deadline on the time series realization.\nThe context dependence of the optimal policy is pictorially depicted in Figure 3 where we show two exemplary trajectories for the decision-maker’s state, and the actions recommended by a policy π for the same time and belief, but a different context, i.e. a stopping action recommended when X(t) is large since it corresponds to a low survival probability, whereas for the same belief and time, a continuation action can be recommended if X(t) is low since it is safer to keep observing the process for that the survival probability is high. Such a prescription specifies optimal decisionmaking in context-driven settings such as clinical decision-making in critical care environment [3-5], where a combination of a patient’s length of hospital stay (i.e. t), clinical risk score (i.e. µt) and current physiological test measurements (i.e. X̄(P πt )) determine the decision on whether or not a patient should be admitted to an intensive care unit.\nPolicy π: Stop and declare θ̂π\nX(t) θ̂π = 1\nPolicy π: Continue sampling Xτ (t)\nt\nµt\nSample path 1\nSample path 2\nµ̄\nt̄\nFigure 3: Context-dependence of the decision-making policy π. For the same belief and time pair (µ̄, t̄), different actions are recommended in different contexts (different sample paths).\nThe second part of Theorem 3 says that whenever the optimal policy decides to stop gathering information and issue a conclusive decision, it imposes a threshold on the posterior belief, based on which it issues the estimate θ̂π∗ ; the threshold is C1Co+C1 , and hence weights the estimates by their respective risks. When the policy favors continuation, it issues a rendezvous action, i.e. the next time instance at which information will be gathered. This rendezvous balances surprise and suspense: the decision-maker prefers maximizing surprise in order to draw the maximum informativeness from the costly sample it will acquire; this is captured in terms of the tail distribution of the information gain P(It(δ) ≥ ηt). Maximizing surprise may increase suspense, i.e. the probability of process termination, which is controlled by the survival function St(δ), and hence it can be that harvesting the maximum informativeness entails a survival risk when Cr is high. Therefore, the optimal policy selects a rendezvous δπ ∗\nt that optimizes a combination of the survival risk survival, captured by the cost Cr and the survival function St(∆t), and the value of information, captured by the costs Co, C1 and the information gain It(δ).\nTo get a feel of the surprise-suspense trade-off, we assume that Xτ (t)|Θ = 1 is a standard Brownian motion, and the prior on Θ = 1 is p = 0.5, whereas the stopping time is the hitting time of a target level η = 30. When should the decision-maker set the date for the first rendezvous? In Figure 4, we plot the expected information gain from the first sample (E[ |Io(∆t)|| F̃o]) (solid line), and the corresponding survival function So(∆t) (dotted line). It can be seen that the expected information gain is maximum at t = 42, but with a 50% survival probability, hence depending on the costs Co, C1 and Cr, the optimal policy may favor an earlier rendezvous (i.e. δπ ∗\no < 42) in order to keep the survival probability within a reasonable limit and at the same time attain a reasonable level of informativeness."

      "text" : "We developed a model for decision-making with endogenous information acquisition under time pressure, where a decision-maker needs to issue a conclusive decision before an adverse event (potentially) takes place. We have shown that the optimal policy has a ”rendezvous” structure, i.e. the\noptimal policy sets a ”date” for gathering a new sample whenever the current information sample is observed. The optimal policy selects the time between two information samples such that it balances the information gain (surprise) with the survival probability (suspense). Moreover, we characterized the optimal policy’s continuation and stopping conditions, and showed that they depend on the context and not just on beliefs. Our model can help understanding the nature of optimal decision-making in settings where timely risk assessment and information gathering is essential."

In our model, the decision-maker decides when to observe (costly) information by sampling an underlying continuoustime stochastic process (time series) that conveys information about the potential occurrence/non-occurrence of an adverse event which will terminate the decisionmaking process. In her attempt to predict the occurrence of the adverse event, the decision-maker follows a policy that determines when to acquire information from the time series (continuation), and when to stop acquiring information and make a final prediction (stopping). We show that the optimal policy has a ”rendezvous” structure, i.e. a structure in which whenever a new information sample is gathered from the time series, the optimal ”date” for acquiring the next sample becomes computable. The optimal interval between two information samples balances a trade-off between the decision maker’s ”surprise”, i.e. the drift in her posterior belief after observing new information, and ”suspense”, i.e. the probability that the adverse event occurs in the time interval between two information samples. Moreover, we characterize the continuation and stopping regions in the decisionmaker’s state-space, and show that they depend not only on the decision-maker’s beliefs, but also on the ”context”, i.e. the current realization of the time series.",
