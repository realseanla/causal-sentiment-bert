      "text" : "Weighted model counting is a fundamental problem in probabilistic inference that captures the computation of probabilities of complex predicates over independent random events (Boolean variables). Although the problem is #P-hard in general, there are a number of practical algorithms for model counting based on DPLL algorithms and on knowledge compilation techniques. The knowledge compilation approach, though more space intensive, can be much more convenient since it builds a representation for an input predicate independent of its weights that allows the count to evaluated easily given a particular choice of weights; that representation also can be re-used to analyze more complicated predicates. Moreover, with only a constant-factor increase in time, the methods using DPLL algorithms can be easily extended to be knowledge compilation algorithms [Huang and Darwiche, 2007]. (See [Gomes et al., 2009] for a survey.)\nThe representation to be used for knowledge compilation is an important key to the utility of these methods in practice; the best methods are based on restricted classes of circuits and on decision diagrams. All of the ones considered to date can be seen as natural sub-classes of the class of Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF) formulas/circuits introduced in [Darwiche, 2001], though it is not known how to do model counting efficiently for the full class of DNNF formulas/circuits. One sub-class for which model counting is efficient given the representation is that of d-DNNF formulas, though there is no efficient algorithm known to recognize whether a DNNF formula is d-DNNF.\nA special case of d-DNNF formulas (with a minor change of syntax) that is easy to recognize is that of decision-DNNF formulas. This class of representations captures all of the practical model counting algorithms discussed in [Gomes et al., 2009] including those based on DPLL algorithms. Decision-DNNFs include\n∗ Research supported by NSF grant CCF-1217099.\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n02 63\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 9\nA ug\nOrdered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDs), which are canonical and have been highly effective representations for verification, and also Free BDDs (FBDDs), which are also known as read-once branching programs. Using a quasi-polynomial simulation of decision-DNNFs by FBDDs, [Beame et al., 2013, Beame et al., 2014] showed that the best decision-DNNF representations must be exponential even for many very simple 2-DNF predicates that arise in probabilistic databases.\nRecently, [Darwiche, 2011] introduced another subclass of d-DNNF formulas called Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs). This class is strictly more general than OBDDs and (in its basic form) is similarly canonical. (OBDDs use a fixed ordering of variables, while SDDs use a fixed binary tree of variables, known as a vtree.) There has been substantial development and growing application of SDDs to knowledge representation problems, including a recently released SDD software package [SDD, 2014]. Indeed, SDDs hold potential to be more concise than OBDDs. [Van den Broeck and Darwiche, 2015] showed that compressing an SDD with a fixed vtree so that it is canonical can lead to an exponential blow-up in size, but much regarding the complexity of SDD representations has remained open.\nIn this paper we show the limitations both of general DNNFs and especially of SDDs. We show that the simulation of decision-DNNFs by FBDDs from [Beame et al., 2013] can be extended to yield a simulation of general DNNFs by OR-FBDDs, the nondeterministic extension of FBDDs, from which we can derive exponential lower bounds for DNNF representations of some simple functions. This latter simulation, as well as that of [Beame et al., 2013], is tight, since [Razgon, 2015a] (see also [Razgon, 2014]) shows a quasipolynomial separation between DNNF and OR-FBDD size using parameterized complexity.\nFor SDDs we obtain much stronger results. In particular, we relate the SDD size required to represent predicate f to the ”best-case partition” communication complexity [Kushilevitz and Nisan, 1997] of f . Using this, together with reductions to the communication complexity of disjointness (set intersection), we derive the following results: (1) There are simple predicates given by 2-DNF formulas for which FBDD size is polynomial but for which SDD size must be exponential. (2) For a natural, widely-studied class of database queries known as Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQ), the SDD size is linear iff the OBDD size is linear and is exponential otherwise (which corresponds to a query that contains an inversion [Jha and Suciu, 2013]). (3) Similar lower bounds apply to the dual of UCQ, which consists of universal, positive queries.\nTo prove our SDD results, we show that for any predicate f given by an SDD of size S, using its associated vtree we can partition the variables of f between two players, Alice and Bob, in a nearly balanced way so that they only need to send log2 S bits of communication to compute f . The characterization goes through an intermediate step involving unambiguous communication protocols and a clever deterministic simulation of such protocols from [Yannakakis, 1991].\nRelated work: The quasi-polynomial simulation of DNNFs by OR-FBDDs that we give was also shown independently in [Razgon, 2015b]. Beyond the lower bounds for decision-DNNFs in [Beame et al., 2013, Beame et al., 2014] which give related analyses for decision-DNNFs, the work of [Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche, 2010] on structured DNNFs is particularly relevant to this paper1. [Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche, 2010] show how sizes of what they term (deterministic) X-decompositions can yield lower bounds on the sizes of structured (deterministic) DNNFs, which include SDDs as a special case. [Pipatsrisawat, 2010] contains the full details of how this can be applied to prove lower bounds for specific predicates. These bounds are actually equivalent to lower bounds exponential in the best-partition nondeterministic (respectively, unambiguous) communication complexity of the given predicates. Our paper derives this lower bound for SDDs directly but, more importantly, provides the connection to best-partition deterministic communication complexity, which allows us to have a much wider range of application; this strengthening is necessary for our applications. Finally, we note that [Razgon, 2014] showed that SDDs can be powerful by finding examples where OBDDs using any order are quasipolynomially less concise than SDDs.\n1We thank the conference reviewers for bringing this work to our attention.\nRoadmap: We give the background and some formal definitions including some generalization required for this work in Section 2. We prove our characterization of SDDs in terms of best-partition communication complexity in Section 3 and derive the resulting bounds for SDDs for natural predicates in Section 4. We describe the simulation of DNNFs by OR-FBDDs, and its consequences, in Section 5."

      "heading" : "2 Background and Definitions",
      "text" : "We first give some basic definitions of DNNFs and decision diagrams.\nDefinition 2.1. A Negation Normal Form (NNF) circuit is a Boolean circuit with ¬ gates, which may only be applied to inputs, and ∨ and ∧ gates. Further, it is Decomposable (DNNF) iff the children of each ∧ gate are reachable from disjoint sets of input variables. (Following convention, we call this circuit a “DNNF formula”, though it is not a Boolean formula in the usual sense of circuit complexity.) A DNNF formula is deterministic (d-DNNF) iff the functions computed at the children of each ∨ gate are not simultaneously satisfiable.\nDefinition 2.2. A Free Binary Decision Diagram (FBDD) is a directed acyclic graph with a single source (the root) and two specified sink nodes, one labeled 0 and the other 1. Every non-sink node is labeled by a Boolean variable and has two out-edges, one labeled 0 and the other 1. No path from the root to either sink is labeled by the same variable more than once. It is an OBDD if the order of variable labels is the same on every path. The Boolean function computed by an FBDD is 1 on input a iff there is a path from the root to the sink labeled 1 so that for every node label Xi on the path, ai is the label of the out-edge taken by the path. An OR-FBDD is an FBDD augmented with additional nodes of arbitrary fan-out labeled ∨. The function value for the OR-FBDD follows the same definition as for FBDDs; the ∨-nodes simply make more than one path possible for a given input. (See [Wegener, 2000].)\nWe now define sentential decision diagrams as well as a small generalization that we will find useful.\nDefinition 2.3. For a set X, let > : {0, 1}X → {0, 1} and ⊥ : {0, 1}X → {0, 1} denote the constant 1 function and constant 0 function, respectively.\nDefinition 2.4. We say that a set of Boolean functions {p1, p2, . . . , p`}, where each pi has domain {0, 1}X, is disjoint if for each i 6= j, pi∧pj = ⊥. We call {p1, p2, . . . , p`} a partition if it is disjoint and ∨` i=1 pi = >.\nDefinition 2.5. A vtree for variables X is a full binary tree whose leaves are in one-to-one correspondence with the variables in X.\nWe define Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDDs) together with the Boolean functions they represent and use 〈.〉 to denote the mapping from SDDs into Boolean functions. (This notation is extended to sets of SDDs yielding sets of Boolean functions.) At the same time, we also define a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of the SDD.\nDefinition 2.6. α is an SDD that respects vtree v rooted at v iff:\n• α = > or α = ⊥. Semantics: 〈>〉 = > and 〈⊥〉 = ⊥. G(α) consists of a single leaf node labeled with 〈α〉.\n• α = X or α = ¬X and v is a leaf with variable X. Semantics: 〈X〉 = X and 〈¬X〉 = ¬X G(α) consists of a single leaf node labeled with 〈α〉.\n• α = {(p1, s1), . . . , (p`, s`)}, v is an internal vertex with children vL and vR, p1, . . . , p` are SDDs that respect the subtree rooted at vL, s1, . . . , s` are SDDs that respect the subtree rooted at vR, and 〈p1〉, . . . , 〈p`〉 is a partition.\nSemantics: 〈α〉 = ∨n i=1 ( 〈pi〉 ∧ 〈si〉\n) G(α) has a circle node for α labeled v with ` child box nodes labeled by the pairs (pi, si). A box node labeled (pi, si) has a left child that is the root of G(pi) and and a right child that is the root of G(si). The rest of G(α) is the (non-disjoint) union of graphs G(p1), . . . , G(p`) and G(s1), . . . , G(s`) with common sub-DAGs merged. (See Figure 1.)\nEach circle node α′ in G(α) itself represents an SDD that respects a subtree of v rooted at some vertex v′ of v; We say that α′ is in α and use Sdds(v′, α) to denote the collection of α′ in α that respect the subtree rooted at v′. The size of an SDD α is the number of nodes in G(α).\nCircle nodes in G(α) may be interpreted as OR gates and paired box nodes may be interpreted as AND gates. In the rest of this paper, we will view SDDs as a class of Boolean circuit. The vtree property and partition property of SDDs together ensure that this resulting circuit is a d-DNNF.\nWe define a small generalization of vtrees which will be useful for describing SDDs with respect to a partial assignment of variables.\nDefinition 2.7. A pruned vtree for variables X is a full binary tree whose leaves are either marked stub or by a variable in X, and whose leaves marked by variables are in one-to-one correspondence with the variables in X.\nWe generalize SDDs so that they can respect pruned vtrees. The definition is almost identical to that for regular SDDs so we only point out the differences.\nDefinition 2.8. The definition of a pruned SDD α respecting a pruned vtree v, its semantics, and its graph G(α), are identical to those of an SDD except that\n• if the root vertex v of v is a stub then 〈α〉 must be ⊥ or >, and\n• if the root vertex v of v is internal then we only require that 〈p1〉, . . . , 〈p`〉 are disjoint but not necessarily that they form a partition.\nWe now sketch a very brief overview of the communication complexity we will need. Many more details may be found in [Kushilevitz and Nisan, 1997]. Given a Boolean function f on {0, 1}X × {0, 1}Y, one can define two-party protocols in which two players, Alice, who receives x ∈ {0, 1}X and Bob, who receives y ∈ {0, 1}Y exchange a sequence of messages m1, . . . ,mC = f(x, y) ∈ {0, 1} to compute f . (After each bit, the player to send the next bit must be determined from previous messages.) The (deterministic) communication complexity of f , CC(f(X,Y)), is the minimum value C over all protocols computing f such that all message sequences are of length at most C. The one-way deterministic communication complexity of f , CCX→Y(f(X,Y)) is the minimum value of C over all protocols where Alice may send messages to Bob, but Bob cannot send messages to Alice.\nFor nondeterministic protocols, Alice simply guesses a string based on her input x and sends the resulting message m to Bob, who uses m together with y to verify whether or not f(x, y) = 1. The communication complexity in this case is the minimum |m| over all protocols. Such a protocol is unambiguous iff for each (x, y) pair such that f(x, y) = 1 there is precisely one message m that will cause Bob to output 1. A set of the form A×B for A ⊆ {0, 1}X, B ⊆ {0, 1}Y is called a rectangle. The minimum of |m| over all unambiguous\nprotocols is the unambiguous communication complexity of f ; it is known to be the logarithm base 2 of the minimum number of rectangles into which one can partition the set of inputs on which f is 1.\nA canonical hard problem for communication complexity is the two-party disjointness (set intersection) problem, ∨n i=1 xi ∧ yi where x and y are indicator vectors of sets in [n]. It has deterministic communication complexity n+ 1 (and requires Ω(n) bits be sent even with randomness, but that is beyond what we need). We will need a variant of the “best partition” version of communication complexity in which the protocol includes a choice of the best split of input indices X and Y between Alice and Bob.\nA typical method for proving lower bounds on OBDD size for a Boolean function f begins by observing that a size s OBDD may be simulated by a log s-bit one-way communication protocol where Alice holds the first half of the variables read by the OBDD and Bob holds the second half. In this protocol, Alice starts at the root of the OBDD and follows the (unique) OBDD path determined by her half of the input until she reaches a node v querying a variable held by Bob. She then sends the identity of the node v to Bob, who can finish the computation starting from v. Thus, if we show that f has one-way communication complexity CCX→Y(f(X,Y)) at least C in the best split {X,Y} of its input variables, then any OBDD computing f must have at least 2C nodes.\nOur lower bound for SDDs uses related ideas but in a more sophisticated way, and instead of providing a one-way deterministic protocol, we give an unambiguous protocol that simulates the SDD computation. In particular, the conversion to deterministic protocols requires two-way communication."

As a consequence, any function requiring large communication complexity under all such partitions requires large SDDs. To begin this analysis, we consider how an SDD simplifies under a partial assignment to its input variables."

Let Vars(v) denote the set of variables that are descendants of v in v and Shell(v) = X \\ Vars(v). Also let Parent(v) denote the (unique) vertex in v that has v as a child.\nWe define a construction to capture what happens to an SDD under a partial assignment of its variables.\nDefinition 3.2. Let α be an SDD that respects v, a vtree for the variables X, and suppose that α computes the function f . Let B ⊆ X and A = X \\B and let ρ : A → {0, 1} be an assignment to the variables in A. Let α|ρ be Boolean circuit remaining after plugging the partial assignment ρ into the SDD α and making the following simplifications:\n1. If a gate computes a constant c ∈ {>,⊥} under the partial assignment ρ, we can replace that gate and its outgoing edges with c.\n2. Remove any children of OR-gates that compute ⊥.\n3. Remove any nodes disconnected from the root.\nFor each vtree vertex v ∈ v that was not removed in this process, we denote its counterpart in the pruned vtree v|A by v|A.\nConstruct the pruned vtree v|A from v as follows: for each vertex v, if Vars(v) ⊆ A and Vars(Parent(v)) 6⊆ A, replace v and its subtree by a stub. We say that we have pruned the subtree rooted at v. (See Figure 2 for an example of an SDD and its vtree both before and after pruning.)\nFor A ⊆ X, we call {A,X \\ A} a shell partition for X if there is a vtree vertex v ∈ v such that Shell(v) = A. We call A the shell. If, for a restriction ρ : A→ {0, 1}, there exists a vtree vertex v ∈ v such that Shell(v) = A, we call ρ a shell restriction.\nProposition 3.3. Let α be an SDD that respects v, a vtree for the variables X, and suppose that α computes the function f . Let A ⊆ X and ρ : A → {0, 1} be a partial assignment of the variables in A. The pruned SDD α|ρ has the following properties: (a) 〈α|ρ〉 = f |ρ. (b) α|ρ is a pruned SDD respecting v|A. (c) G(α|ρ) is a subgraph of G(α).\nProof. (a): An SDD may be equivalently described as a Boolean circuit of alternating OR and AND gates. For any Boolean circuit in the variables X that computes f , plugging in the values for the restriction ρ yields a circuit computing f |ρ. Furthermore, the simplification steps do not change the function computed.\n(b): For each v such that Vars(v) ⊆ A and Vars(Parent(v)) 6⊆ A, we have replaced the subtree rooted at v by a stub and replaced the SDDs in α respecting v by either > or ⊥. Thus α|ρ respects v|A.\nWe now check that α|ρ is a pruned SDD. In particular we need to ensure that for each SDD α′ = {(p1, s1), . . . , (p`, s`)} in α, the corresponding pruned SDDs that remain from p1, . . . , p` in its pruned counterpart α′|ρ represent a collection of disjoint functions. From the first part of this proposition, these are 〈pi1〉|ρ, . . . , 〈pik〉|ρ for some k ≤ n, where we have only included those SDDs that are consistent under ρ. Since the original set of SDDs was a partition and thus disjoint, this set of restricted (pruned) SDDs is also disjoint.\n(c): The process in Definition 3.2 only removes nodes from G(α) to construct G(α|ρ). Further, it does not change the label of any SDD that was not removed."

      "text" : "The way that we will partition the input variables to an SDD between the parties Alice and Bob in the communication protocol will respect the structure of its associated vtree. The restrictions will correspond to assignments that reflect Alice’s knowledge of the input and will similarly respect that structure.\nNotice that a vtree cut along an edge (u, v) (where u is the parent of v) induces a shell partition for X consisting of the set B = Vars(v), and the shell A = X \\B.\nProposition 3.4. Let α be an SDD of size s computing a function f : {0, 1}X → {0, 1} that respects a vtree v. Suppose that {A,B} is a shell partition for X and that A is its shell. Let b be the vertex in v for which Vars(b) = B and Vars(Parent(b)) 6⊆ B.\nFor any shell restriction ρ : A→ {0, 1}, the set 〈Sddsα|ρ(b|A)〉 is a disjoint collection of functions.\nProof. For non-shell restrictions ρ′, the collection of functions 〈Sddsα|ρ′ (v)〉 for a vtree node v is not disjoint; we need to use the specific properties of A and b. Since ρ was a shell restriction, the pruned vtree v|A takes the form of a path v1|A, . . . , vk|A of internal vertices, where v1 is the root of v, and vk|A = b|A, with the other child of each of v1|A, . . . , vk−1|A being a stub, together with a vtree for the variables B rooted at b. We will show that if 〈Sddsα|ρ(vi|A)〉 is disjoint then so is 〈Sddsα|ρ(vi+1|A)〉. This will prove the proposition since 〈Sddsα|ρ(v1|A)〉 only contains the function 〈α|ρ〉 and is therefore trivially disjoint.\nWe will use the fact that every pruned-SDD from Sddsα|ρ(vi+1|A) is contained in some SDD from Sddsα|ρ(vi|A). We have two cases to check: vi+1|A is either a left child or a right child of vi|A.\nIf vi+1|A was a right child then each pruned-SDD η|ρ contained in Sddsα|ρ(vi|A) takes the form η|ρ = {(>, s|ρ)}. Then 〈Sddsα|ρ(vi+1|A)〉 = 〈Sddsα|ρ(vi|A)〉 and is therefore disjoint by assumption.\nOtherwise suppose that vi+1|A is the left child of vi|A. Let η|ρ ∈ Sddsα|ρ(vi|A). Let η|ρ = {(η1|ρ,>), . . . , (ηk|ρ),>)} where ∨k i=1〈ηi|ρ〉 = 〈η|ρ〉 and {〈η1|ρ〉, . . . , 〈ηk|ρ〉} , being a collection of primes for η|ρ, is disjoint. By assumption 〈Sddsα|ρ(vi|A)〉 is disjoint, so for any other η′|ρ = {(η′1|ρ,>), . . . , (η′k′ |ρ,>)} ∈ Sddsα|ρ(vi|A)} distinct from η|ρ, we have 〈η|ρ〉 ∧ 〈η′|ρ〉 = ⊥. Then for any i ∈ [k] and j ∈ [k′], we have 〈ηi|ρ〉 ∧ 〈η′j |ρ〉 = ⊥. Thus 〈Sddsα|ρ(vi+1|A)〉 is disjoint.\nTheorem 3.5. Let α be an SDD of size s that respects a vtree v and suppose that it computes the function f : {0, 1}X → {0, 1}. Suppose that {A,B} is a shell partition for X and that A is the shell. Let b be the vertex in v for which Vars(b) = B and Vars(Parent(b)) 6⊆ B.\nConsider the communication game where Alice has the variables A, Bob has the variables B, and they are trying to compute f(A,B). There is a log s-bit unambiguous communication protocol computing f .\nProof. Suppose that Alice and Bob both know the SDD α. Let ρ : A → {0, 1} be the partial assignment corresponding to Alice’s input. This is a shell restriction. Alice may then privately construct the pruned SDD α|ρ, which computes f |ρ by Proposition 3.3. Further, α|ρ evaluates to 1 under Bob’s input φ : B→ {0, 1} if and only if there exists a pruned-SDD η|ρ ∈ Sddsα|ρ(b|A) such that 〈η|ρ〉(φ) = 1.\nBy Proposition 3.4, 〈Sddsα|ρ(b|A)〉 is disjoint. Also, since ρ is a shell restriction with shell A, and Vars(b) = B = X \\ A, every SDD in Sddsα|ρ(b|A) was unchanged by ρ. In particular, this means that Sddsα|ρ(b|A) ⊆ Sddsα(b) and any pruned-SDD η|ρ can be viewed as some η ∈ Sddsα(b) that is also in Sddsα|ρ(b|A).\nFor the protocol Alice nondeterministically selects an η from Sddsα|ρ(b|A) and then sends its identity as a member of Sddsα(b) to Bob. This requires at most log s bits. Bob will output 1 on his input φ if and only if 〈η〉(φ) = 1, which he can test since he knows α and b. This protocol is unambiguous since the fact that 〈Sddsα|ρ(b|A)〉 is disjoint means means that for any input φ to Bob there is at most one η ∈ Sddsα|ρ(b|A) such that 〈η〉(φ) = 1. Since Bob knows α, he also knows η and can therefore compute 〈η〉(φ). Since α computes f , if 〈η〉(φ) = 1 then f(φ, ρ) = 1. Otherwise all of the functions in 〈Sddsα|ρ(b|A)〉 evaluate to 0 on input φ so f(φ, ρ) = 0.\nWe can relate the deterministic and unambiguous communication complexities of a function using the following result from [Yannakakis, 1991]. We include a proof of this result in the appendix for completeness.\nTheorem 3.6 (Yannakakis). If there is an g-bit unambiguous communication protocol for a function f : {0, 1}A × {0, 1}B → {0, 1}, then there is a (g + 1)2-bit deterministic protocol for f .\nThe following 1/3-2/3 lemma is standard.\nLemma 3.7. For a vtree v for L variables, if a vertex b satisfies 13L ≤ |Vars(b)| ≤ 2 3L, we call it a (1/3, 2/3) vertex. Every vtree contains a (1/3, 2/3) vertex.\nDefinition 3.8. Let X be a set of variables and (A,B) a partition of X. We call the partition (A,B) a (δ, 1 − δ)-partition for δ ∈ [0, 1/2] if min(|A|, |B|) ≥ δ|X|. That is, the minimum size of one side of the partition is at least a δ-fraction of the total number of variables.\nThe best (δ, 1 − δ)-partition communication complexity of a Boolean function f : {0, 1}X → {0, 1} is min(CC(f(A,B))) where the minimum is taken over all (δ, 1− δ)-partitions (A,B).\nTheorem 3.9. If the best (1/3, 2/3)-partition communication complexity of a Boolean function f : {0, 1}X → {0, 1} is C, then an SDD computing f has size at least 2 √ C−1.\nProof. Suppose that α is an SDD of size s respecting the vtree v for variables X, and that α computes f . From Lemma 3.7 the vtree v contains a (1/3, 2/3) vertex b. This (1/3, 2/3) vertex b induces a (1/3, 2/3)- partition of the variables {A,B} where B = Vars(b) and A = Shell(b). Further, this partition {A,B} is a shell partition. By Theorem 3.5, there exists a log s-bit unambiguous communication protocol for f(A,B). Then by Theorem 3.6, there exists a (log(s) + 1)2-bit deterministic communication protocol for f(A,B). Since the best (1/3, 2/3)-partition communication complexity of f is C, we have that C ≤ (log(s) + 1)2 which implies that s ≥ 2 √ C−1 as stated."

The usual best-partition communication complexity is (1/2, 1/2)-partition communication complexity. For example, the function ShiftedEQ which takes as inputs x, y ∈ {0, 1}n and z ∈ {0, 1}dlog2 ne and tests whether or not y = SHIFT (x, z) where SHIFT (x, z) is the cyclic shift of x by (z)2 positions. However, as is typical of these functions, the same proof which shows that the (1/2, 1/2)-partition communication complexity of ShiftedEQ is Ω(n) also shows that its (1/3, 2/3)-partition communication complexity is Ω(n). However, most of these functions are not typical of predicates to which one might want to apply weighted model counting. Instead we analyze SDDs for formulas derived from a natural class of database queries. We are able to characterize SDD size for these queries, proving exponential lower bounds for every such query that cannot already be represented in linear size by an OBDD.

The following formulas are lineages (or parts thereof) of well-known queries that that are fundamental for probabilistic databases [Dalvi and Suciu, 2012, Jha and Suciu, 2013]\nover a particular database D0 (called the complete bipartite graph of size m in [Jha and Suciu, 2013]): H0 = ∨\ni,j∈[m]\nRiSijTj\nQV = ∨\ni,j∈[m]\nRiSij ∨ SijTj ∨RiTj\nH1 = ∨\ni,j∈[m]\nRiSij ∨ SijTj\nHk0 = ∨ i∈[m] RiS 1 ij for k ≥ 1\nHk` = ∨\ni,j∈[m]\nS`ijS `+1 ij for 0 < ` < k\nHkk = ∨ i∈[m] SkijTj for k ≥ 1.\n(The corresponding queries are represented using lower case letters h0, qV , h1, hk0, . . . , hkk and involve unary relations R and T , as well as binary relations S and Sk. For example, h0 = ∃x0∃y0R(x0)S(x0, y0)T (y0).) The following lemma will be useful in identifying subformulas of the above query lineages that can be used to compute the set disjointness function.\nProposition 4.1. Let the elements of [m] × [m] be partitioned into two sets A and B, each of size at least δm2. Let Row(i) denote {i} × [m] and Col(j) denote [m] × {j}. Define WRow = {i ∈ [m] | ∅ 6= Row(i) ∩ A and ∅ 6= Row(i) ∩ B}. That is, Row(i) for i ∈ WRow is split into two nonempty pieces by the partition. Similarly, define WCol = {i ∈ [m] | ∅ 6= Col(j) ∩A and ∅ 6= Col(j) ∩B}. Then\nmax(|WRow|, |WCol|) ≥ √ δ ·m.\nProof. Suppose that both |WRow| < m and |WCol| < m. By definition, if i /∈ WRow then one of A or B contains an entire row, Row(i), say A without loss of generality. This implies that no column Col(j) is entirely contained in B. Since |WCol| < m, there is some column Col(j) that is entirely contained in A. This in turn implies that B does not contain any full row. In particular, we have that A contains all rows in [m] \\WRow and all columns in [m] \\WCol and thus B ⊆ WRow ×WCol and so |B| ≤ |WRow| · |WCol|. By assumption, |B| ≥ δm2. Hence |WRow| · |WCol| ≥ δm2 and so max{|wRow|, |wCol|} ≥ √ δ ·m.\nTheorem 4.2. For m ≥ 6, the best (1/3, 2/3)-partition communication complexity of QV , H0, and of H1 is at least m/3.\nProof. Let X be the set of variables appearing inQV (orH1) and let (A,B) be a (1/3, 2/3)-partition of X. Let (A,B) be the partition of [m]×[m] induced by (A,B) and define WRow and WCol as in Proposition 4.1. Since |X| = m2 +2m and only elements of [m]× [m] are relevant, |A|, |B| ≥ (m2 +2m)/3−2m = (1−4/m)m2/3 ≥ m2/9 for m ≥ 6 and hence max(|WRow|, |WCol|) ≥ m/3. We complete the proof by showing that computing QV (A,B) and H1(A,B) each require at least max(|WRow|, |WCol|) bits of communication between Alice and Bob. We will do this by showing that for a particular subset of inputs, QV is equivalent to the disjointness function for a max(|WRow|, |WCol|) size set.\nSuppose without loss of generality that |WRow| ≥ |WCol|. Set all Tj = 0 and for each i /∈ WRow set Ri = 0. For each i ∈WRow for which Ri ∈ A, set all Sij ∈ A to 0, let ji be minimal such that Siji ∈ B, and set Sij ∈ B to 0 for all j > ji. (Such an index ji must exist since i ∈ WRow.) Similarly, For each i ∈ WRow for which Ri ∈ B, set all Sij ∈ B to 0, let ji be minimal such that Siji ∈ A, and set Sij ∈ A to 0 for all j > ji. In particular, under this partial assignment, we have\nQV = H1 = ∨\ni∈WRow\nRiSiji\nand for each i ∈WRow, Alice holds one of Ri or Siji and Bob holds the other. We can reduce H0 to the same quantity by setting all Tj = 1. This is precisely the set disjointness problem on two sets of size |WRow| where membership of i in each player’s set is determined by the value of the unset bit indexed by i that player holds. Therefore, computing QV or H1 requires at least |WRow| bits of communication, as desired.\nCombining this with Theorem 3.9, we immediately obtain the following:\nTheorem 4.3. For m ≥ 6, any SDD representing QV or H1 requires size at least 2 √ m/3−1.\nAs [Jha and Suciu, 2013] has shown that QV has FBDD size O(m 2), we obtain the following separation.\nCorollary 4.4. FBDDs can be exponentially more succinct than SDDs. In particular, QV has FBDD size\nO(m2) but every SDD for QV requires size 2 √ m/3−1 for m ≥ 6.\nWe now consider the formulas Hki above. Though they seem somewhat specialized, these formulas are fundamental to UCQ queries: [Jha and Suciu, 2013] define the notion of an inversion in a UCQ query and use it to characterize the OBDD size of UCQ queries. In particular they show that if a query q is inversionfree then the OBDD size of its lineage Q is linear and if q has an minimum inversion length k ≥ 1 then it requires OBDD size 2Ω(n/k) where n is the domain size of all attributes. Jha and Suciu obtain this lower bound by analyzing the Hki we defined above. (We will not define the notion of inversions, or their lengths, and instead use the definition as a black box. However, as an example, the query associated with H1 has an inversion of length 1 so its OBDD size is 2Ω(m).)\nProposition 4.5. [Jha and Suciu, 2013] Let q be a query with a length k ≥ 1 inversion. Let D0 be the complete bipartite graph of size m. There exists a database D for q, along with variable restrictions ρi for all i ∈ [0, k], such that |D| = O(|D0|) and ΦDq |ρi = Φ D0 hki = Hki\nTheorem 4.6. Let k ≥ 2 and assume that m ≥ 6. Let q be a query with a length k ≥ 2 inversion. Then there exists a database D for which any SDD for Q = ΦDq has size at least 2 √ m/k/3−1. Proof. Given a query q, let D be the database for q constructed in Proposition 4.5. Fix the vtree v over Xk respected by an SDD α for Φ D q . By Lemma 3.7, there exists a (1/3, 2/3) node b in the vtree v that gives a (1/3, 2/3) partition {A,B} of Xk. By Proposition 4.5, there are restrictions ρ0, . . . , ρk such that ΦDq |ρi = Hki for all i. Thus α|ρi is a (pruned) SDD, of size ≤ that of α, respecting v|ρi and computing Hki. Observe that the restriction of {A,B} to the variables of Xki is also shell partition of v|ρi at node b.\nWe will show that there must exist an Hki for which CC(Hki(A,B)) ≥ m/(9k) and therefore by Theorem 3.6, this implies that the unambiguous communication complexity of Hki is at least 1 3 √ m/k − 1 Then by Theorem 3.5, any SDD respecting v that computes Hki has size at least 2 1 3 √ m/k−1.\nLet WChain contain all pairs (i, j) for which both A ∩ ⋃k `=1{S`ij} 6= ∅ and B ∩ ⋃k `=1{S`ij} 6= ∅ and Let γ = 1/9. We will consider two cases: either |WChain| ≥ γ ·m or |WChain| < γ ·m. In the first case, since |WChain| ≥ γ ·m, there must exist at least γ ·m tuples (i, j, `) for which either S`ij ∈ A and S`+1ij ∈ B or vice-versa. Call the set of these tuples T. Then, since there are k − 1 choices of ` < k, there exists some `∗ such that the set T`∗ := T ∩ [m]× [m]× {`∗} contains at least γ ·m/(k − 1) > m/(9k) elements. If we set all variables of Xk`∗ outside of T`∗ to 0, the function Hk`∗ corresponds to solving a disjointness problem between Alice and Bob on the elements of T`∗ . Thus the communication complexity of Hk`∗ under the partition {A,B} is at least m/(9k).\nIn the second case, consider the largest square submatrix M of [m] × [m] that does not contain any member of WChain. We mimic the argument of Theorem 4.2 on this submatrix M . By definition, M has side m′ ≥ (1 − γ)m. For every (i, j) in M , either A or B contains all S`ij ; let A be those (i, j) such that these are in A and B be those (i, j) for which they are in B. Since |A|, |B| ≥ |Xk|/3 = (km2 + 2m)/3 and there are at most 2m+ (γ2 + 2γ)km2 variables not in M ,\n|A|, |B| ≥ [(km2 + 2m)/3− 2m+ (γ2 + 2γ)km2]/k = [(1− γ)2 − 2/3− 4/(3km)]m2 > (m/18)2)\nsince k ≥ 2. Applying Proposition 4.1, we see that max(|WRow|, |WCol|) ≥ m/18 ≥ m/(9k). By the same argument presented in the proof of Theorem 4.2, we have both CC(Hk0(A,B)) ≥ |WRow| and CC(Hkk(A,B)) ≥ |WCol| so at least one of these is at least m/(9k) and the theorem follows.\nIt follows that for inversion-free UCQ queries, both SDD and OBDD sizes of any lineage are linear, while UCQ queries with inversions (of length k) have worse-case lineage size that is exponential (2Ω(m/k) for OBDDs and 2Ω( √ m/k) for SDDs). Note that the same SDD size lower bound for UCQ query lineage Q = ΦDq applies to its dual Q ∗ = ΦDq∗ as follows: Flipping the signs on the variables in Q\n∗ yields a function equivalent to ¬Q. So flipping the variable signs at the leaves of an SDD for Q∗ we obtain an SDD of the same size for ¬Q and hence a deteministic protocol that also can compute Q."

      "text" : "In this section, we extend the simulation of decision-DNNFs by FBDDs from [Beame et al., 2013] to obtain a simulation of general DNNFs by OR-FBDDs with at most a quasipolynomial increase in size. This simulation yields lower bounds on DNNF size from OR-FBDD lower bounds. This simulation is also tight, since [Razgon, 2015a, Razgon, 2014] has shown a quasipolynomial separation between the sizes of DNNFs and OR-FBDDs.\nDefinition 5.1. For each AND node u in a DNNF D, let Mu be the number of AND nodes in the subgraph Du. We call u’s left child ul and its right child ur. We will assume Mul ≤Mur (otherwise we swap ul and ur).\nFor each AND node u, we classify the edge (u, ul) as a light edge and the edge (u, ur) a heavy edge. We classify every other edge in D as a neutral edge.\nFor a DNNF D or an OR-FBDD F , we denote the functions that D and F compute as ΦD and ΦF .\nConstructing the OR-FBDD\nFor a DNNF D, we will treat a leaf labeled by the variable X as a decision node that points to a 0-sink node if X = 0 and a 1-sink node if X = 1, and vice-versa for a leaf labeled by ¬X. We also assume that each AND node has just two children, which only affects the DNNF size by at most polynomially.\nDefinition 5.2. Fix a DNNF D. For a node u in D and a path P from the root to u, let S(P ) be the set of light edges along P and S(u) = {S(P ) | P is a path from the root to u}.\nWe will construct an OR-FBDD F that computes the same boolean function as D. Its nodes are pairs (u, s) where u is a node in D and the set of light edges s belongs to S(u). Its root is (root(D), ∅). The edges in F are of three types:\nType 1: For each light edge e = (u, v) in D and s ∈ S(u), add the edge ((u, s), (v, s ∪ {e})) to F . Type 2: For each neutral edge e = (u, v) in D and s ∈ S(u), add the edge ((u, s), (v, s)) to F . Type 3: For each heavy edge (u, vr), let e = (u, vl) be its sibling light edge. For each s ∈ S(u) and 1-sink node w in Dvl , add the edge ((w, s ∪ {e}), (vr, s)) to F . We label the nodes u′ = (u, s) as follows: (1) if u is a decision node in D for the variable X then u′ is a decision node in F testing the same variable X, (2) if u is an AND-node, then u′ is a no-op node, (3) if u is an OR node it remains an OR node. (4) if u is a 0-sink node, then u′ is a 0-sink node, (5) if u is a 1-sink node, then: if s = ∅ then u′ is a 1-sink node, otherwise it is a no-op node.\nWe show an example of this construction in Figure 3.\nSize and Correctness\nLemma 5.3. For the DNNF D let L denote the maximum number of light edges from the root to a leaf, M the number of AND nodes and N the total number of nodes. Then F has at most NML nodes. Further, this is N · 2log2N .\nProof. The nodes in F are labeled (u, s). There are N possible nodes u and at most ML choices for the set s, as each path to u has at most L light edges.\nConsider a root to leaf path with L light edges. As we traverse this path, every time we cross a light edge, we decrease the number of descendant AND nodes by more than half. Thus we must have begun with more than 2L descendant AND nodes at the root so that N ≥ M > 2L. This implies that NML is quasipolynomial in N ,\nThis upper bound is quasipolynomial in N , we will show that M > 2L. Then, since N ≥ M , NML ≤ N2log 2M ≤ N2log2N .\nThe proof of the following lemma is in the full paper.\nLemma 5.4. F is a correct OR-FBDD with no-op nodes that computes the same function as D.\nUsing the quasipolynomial simulation of DNNFs by OR-FBDDs, we obtain DNNF lower bounds from OR-FBDD lower bounds.\nDefinition 5.5. Function PERMn takes an n×n boolean matrix M as input and outputs 1 if and only if M is a permutation matrix. The function ROW-COLn takes an n× n boolean matrix M as input and outputs 1 if and only if M has an all-0 row or an all-0 column.\nTheorem 5.6. Any OR-FBDD computing PERMn or ROW-COL, must have size 2 Ω(n) [Wegener, 2000]. Corollary 5.7. Any DNNF computing PERMn or ROW-COL has size at least 2 Ω( √ n)"

      "text" : "We have made the first significant progress in understanding the complexity of general DNNF representations. We have also provided a new connection between SDD representations and best-partition communication complexity. Best-partition communication complexity is a standard technique used to derive lower bounds on OBDD size, where it often yields asymptotically tight results. For communication lower bound C, the lower bound for OBDD size is 2C and the lower bound we have shown for SDD size is 2 √ C − 1. This is a quasipolynomial difference and matches the quasipolynomial separation between OBDD and SDD size shown in [Razgon, 2014]. Is there always a quasipolynomial simulation of SDDs by OBDDs in general, matching the quasipolynomial simulation of decision-DNNFs by FBDDs? Our separation result shows an example for which SDDs are sometimes exponentially less concise than FBDDs, and hence decision-DNNFs also. Are SDDs ever more concise than decision-DNNFs?\nBy plugging in the arguments of [Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche, 2010, Pipatsrisawat, 2010] in place of Theorem 3.5, all of our lower bounds immediately extend to size lower bounds for structured deterministic DNNFs (d-DNNFs), of which SDDs are a special case. It remains open whether structured d-DNNFs are strictly more concise than SDDs. [Pipatsrisawat and Darwiche, 2008, Pipatsrisawat, 2010] have proved an exponential separation between structured d-DNNFs and OBDDs using the Indirect Storage Access (ISA) function [Breitbart et al., 1995], but the small structured d-DNNF for this function is very far from an SDD.\nIt is immediate that, under any variable partition, the ISAn function has an O(log n)-bit two-round deterministic communication protocol. On the other hand, efficient one-round (i.e., one-way) communication protocols yield small OBDDs so there are two possibilities if SDDs and structured d-DNNFs have different power. Either (1) communication complexity considerations on their own are not enough to derive a separation between SDDs and structured d-DNNFs, or (2) every SDD can be simulated by an efficient one-way communication protocol, in which case SDDs can be simulated efficiently by OBDDs (though the ordering cannot be the same as the natural traversal of the associated vtree, as shown by [Xue et al., 2012])."

Then there exists a set D of 2g disjoint monochromatic rectangles that cover the 1’s of Mf .\nLet G be a graph whose nodes are the rectangles in D and which has an edge connecting two rectangles if they share some row of Mf . Then each row r of Mf corresponds to a clique Kr containing the rectangles intersecting r. Similarly, every column c corresponds to an independent set Ic containing the rectangles intersecting c. For each row r and column c, the corresponding entry Mf (r, c) is 1 if and only if Kr ∩ Ic 6= ∅. Thus for proving the theorem, it suffices to give a g2 deterministic protocol for solving the Clique vs Independent set problem on a graph G with 2g vertices.\nThe protocol reduces the graph in each step. Suppose that Alice holds a clique K of an n vertex graph G and Bob holds an independent set I. In each round Alice sends a node u ∈ K that is adjacent to fewer than half the nodes of G, or if no such node exists, she notifies Bob.\nIf Alice sent the node u, then Bob responds with whether (i) u ∈ I, in which case K ∩ I 6= ∅, or (ii) that u is not adjacent to any node of I, in which case K ∩ I = ∅. If neither (i) nor (ii) occur then the nodes not adjacent to u are removed from G as they cannot be in K and the protocol repeats.\nOtherwise, if every u ∈ K is adjacent to over half the nodes of G, Bob sends a node v ∈ I that is adjacent to at least half the nodes in G if such a v exists. In this case Alice tells Bob that (i) v ∈ K so that K ∩I 6= ∅, or (ii) v is adjacent to all nodes in K so that K ∩ I = ∅. Otherwise, Bob says he has no such v ∈ I and the nodes adjacent to v are removed from G and the protocol repeats.\nEach iteration of this protocol removes at least half the nodes so that there are at most g iterations.

      "heading" : "B Proof of Lemma 5.4",
      "text" : "Lemma B.1. F is a correct OR-FBDD with no-op nodes.\nProof. We need to show that F is acyclic and that every path reads a variable at most once. These two properties follow from the lemma:\nLemma B.2. If u is a leaf node in D labeled by the variable X and there exists a non-trivial path (with at least one edge) between the nodes (u, s), (v, s′) in F , then the variable X does not occur in Dv.\nThis lemma implies that F is acyclic: a cycle in F implies a non-trivial path from some node (u, s) to itself, but X ∈ Du. It also implies that every path in F is read-once: if a path tests a variable X twice, first at (u, s) and again at (u1, s1), then X ∈ Du1 contradicting the claim.\nTo prove the lemma, suppose to the contrary that there exists an OR-FBDD node (u, s) such that u is a leaf labeled with X and that there exists a path from (u, s) to (v, s′) in F such that X occurs in Dv. Choose v such that D is maximal; i.e. there is no path from (u, s) to some (v′, s′′) such that Dv ⊂ Dv′ and X occurs in Dv′ . Consider the last edge on the path from (u, s) to (v, s′) in F :\n(u, s), ..., (w, s′′), (v, s′).\nObserve that (w, v) is not an edge in D since Dv is maximal, and (u, v) is not an edge in D since u was a leaf. Therefore the edge from (w, s′′) to (v, s′) is Type 3. So D has an AND-node z with children vl, v and the last path edge is of the form (w, s′ ∪ {e}), (v, s′) where e = (z, vl) is the light edge of z. We claim that e 6∈ s, so that it is not present at the beginning of the path. If e ∈ s then, since s ∈ S(u), we have u, which queries X, in Dvl . Together with the assumption that some node in Dv queries X, we see that descendants of the two children vl, v of AND-node z query the same variable which contradicts that D is a DNNF. On the other hand, e ∈ s′′. Now, the first node on the path where e was introduced must have an edge of the form (z, s1), (vl, s1 ∪ {e}). But now we have a path from (u, s) to (z, s1) with X ∈ Dz ⊃ Dv, contradicting the maximality of v.\nThe next proposition says that on accepting paths P = {(u1, s1), (u2, s2), . . . (u`, s`)} in the constructed OR-FBDD F , the sequence of sets (s1, . . . , s`) behaves like the sequence of states of a stack. We will use this characterization of paths in the proof of Lemma B.4.\nProposition B.3. Suppose that F has been constructed from a DNNF D and that P = {(u1, s1), (u2, s2), . . . (u`, s`)} is a path in F consistent with a variable assignment θ. If, for j < i, we have e1 ∈ sj, e1 ∈ si, and e2 ∈ si \\ sj, then for no k > i do we have both e2 ∈ sk and e1 6∈ sk.\nProof. Suppose the statement is false. Then there must exist a Type 3 edge ((w, s∪{e1, e2}), (vr, s∪{e2})) in the path P , where w ∈ vl. However, we cannot have e2 ∈ S(vr): e2 was an edge in Dvl because (w, s∪{e1, e2}) was reachable in F meaning that e2 ∈ S(w).\nLemma B.4. F computes the same function as D. That is, ΦF [θ] = ΦD[θ] for all variable assignments θ.\nProof. Suppose that ΦF [θ] = 1. Then there exists a path P in F consistent with θ that ends in a 1-sink node.\nIf P = {(u1, s1), (u2, s2), . . . (u`, s`)} has no Type 1 edges then it also has no Type 3 edges. Therefore (u1, . . . , u`) is a path of neutral edges in D consistent with θ to a 1-sink with no AND-nodes along the way, thus ΦD[θ] = 1.\nOtherwise, let S = {(ui, si), (ui+1, si+1), . . . , (ui+j , si+j)}\nbe a sub-path of P . We say that S corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at u if there is a sub-DAG of D rooted at the node u whose OR nodes have fanout 1, AND nodes have full fanout, leaves are all 1-sinks under θ, and whose edges are ui, ui+1, . . . , ui+j .\nStarting from an empty path in F , we will work backwards from the end of P , adding two possible kinds of sub-path: with all Type 2 edges removed, the first contains exactly one Type 1 edge followed by one or more Type 3 edges. The second kind, with all Type 2 edges removed, contains only one Type 1 edge and no Type 3 edges. It is possible to construct P using these two types of subpath by Proposition B.3, which says that\ns1, s2 . . . s`\nis the sequence of states of a stack where, as we traverse the path P , its Type 1 edges push light edges while its Type 3 edges pop them. As P is an accepting path, we also have that s` = ∅. We will show that both\nof these types of additions give a path corresponding to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at all AND nodes mentioned in the Type 1 edges of the sub-path.\nIn the first case, say we add the sub-path Sh to the tail path St to form S = ShSt. Suppose Sh contains the Type 1 edge ((uh, s), (vl, s∪{e})), and that St corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG respecting the first AND node in St, which we call ut. We wish to show that S corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at uh. Sh must contain a Type 3 edge popping e, hence there is a path in D from vl to a 1-sink that is consistent with θ. Therefore Sh corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at vl (there are no AND-nodes along the way so the sub-DAG is the path). Further, since we can find a path of neutral edges in D from the sibling node of vl, vr, to ut (these come from the portion of P between the Type 3 edge popping e and the Type 1 edge ((uh, s), (vl, s ∪ {e}))), S corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at vr. Therefore, S corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at uh.\nIn the second case, we add a Type 1 edge ((uh, s), (vl, s ∪ {e})) to the tail path St, which corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at ut, the first AND node in St. Then ut must appear in Dvl . Otherwise the first Type 1 edge in St comes after we pop e, but then St began with the Type 3 edge popping e. This cannot happen because of our inductive assumption that we add sub-paths that begin with a Type 1 edge. So St gives a path of neutral edges in D from vl to ut (this is the sub-path in between the added Type 1 edge and the first Type 1 edge in St). Since St corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at ut, it also corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at vl. Similarly, St gives a neutral edge path in D from vr to the first AND node mentioned after popping e. Again, from our inductive hypothesis, St thus corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at vr. Therefore S corresponds to an accepting sub-DAG rooted at uh.\nNow suppose ΦD[θ] = 1. Then D has an accepting sub-DAG Dθ respecting θ. We can find an accepting path in F from edges coming from Dθ. This path will follow a left-to-right traversal of Dθ, keeping track of light edges pushed and popped. The Type 1 and Type 2 edge portions of this traversal (moving left down the tree) directly translate to the appropriate edges in F . The necessary Type 3 edges for this traversal also exist in F since Dθ only has 1-sinks. At the end of the traversal we will have popped all light edges and be at a 1-sink in Dθ so we will be at a 1-sink for F ."

In particular we show new lower bounds on knowledge compilation to SDD and DNNF forms. We give strong lower bounds on the complexity of SDD representations by relating SDD size to best-partition communication complexity. We use this relationship to prove exponential lower bounds on the SDD size for representing a large class of problems that occur naturally as queries over probabilistic databases. A consequence is that for representing unions of conjunctive queries, SDDs are not qualitatively more concise than OBDDs. We also derive simple examples for which SDDs must be exponentially less concise than FBDDs. Finally, we derive exponential lower bounds on the sizes of DNNF representations using a new quasipolynomial simulation of DNNFs by nondeterministic FBDDs.",
