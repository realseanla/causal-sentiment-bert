      "text" : "Can the ordinary concept of knowledge be defined in terms of justified true belief (“JTB”)? Since Gettier’s paper [10], the answer to this question is widely considered negative. Gettier produced two cases intended to show that a belief can be true, justified, and yet fall short of knowledge. The first concerns Smith, an applicant for a job who has “strong evidence” that Jones is the man who will get the job and also that Jones has ten coins in his pocket. Unknown to Smith, it turns out that Smith himself has ten coins in pocket and is actually the one selected for the job. Smith’s belief that “the man who will get the job has ten coins in his pocket” is therefore true and justified, but it seems inappropriate to say that this belief constitutes knowledge. The second case is one in which Smith believes a false proposition p based on persuasive evidence for p and infers from p some true proposition p ∨ q by picking the true disjunct q at random. Here too, Smith justifiably believes p ∨ q, but it seems incorrect to say that he knows p ∨ q.\nOur point of departure in this paper is the following: even though we agree with the force of Gettier’s examples, we think the notion of justification remains insufficiently analyzed, both in Gettier’s original paper and in most discussions that have followed.1 What Gettier’s examples show\n∗Funded by Programs ANR-10-LABX-0087 IEC, ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL* and by the ANR project “Trivalence and Natural Language Meaning.”\n†Funded by an Innovational Research Incentives Scheme Veni grant from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).\n1A notable exception is the analysis in the Justification Logic literature: [2, 3] uses a formal framework to track what goes wrong with specific lines of reasoning in the examples of Gettier, Goldman, and Kripke; and [4, 5] uses a related framework that has additional features from Belief Revision Theory to reason about the examples of Lehrer and Gettier. Our work here is different. First, while inspired by the Justification Logic approach to reasoning about justifications, our setting is in many respects simplified but at the same time includes certain novel features (see §2.4 for details). Second, our task here is different than that in [2, 3]: beyond providing a formal diagnosis of what goes wrong in certain Gettier-type examples, we define different kinds of JTB and discuss their relative susceptibility to\nis that an agent can have a plausible internal justification for believing a proposition without that justification being properly adequate to the truth of the proposition in question. But if so, Gettier cases must only show that knowledge is not identical with JTB under an internalist conception of justification. The examples do not thereby rule out the existence of a more externalist notion of justification capable of sustaining the equation between knowledge and JTB. Define knowledge as true belief with adequate justification, and it appears Gettier cases no longer have a bite.\nAdmittedly, this definition might not provide a noncircular or reductive analysis (see [17]): the notion of “adequacy” may ultimately have to be understood in ways that presuppose a prior grasp of the concept of knowledge. For example, if an adequate justification were to mean “a justification that is suitable to make the belief count as knowledge,” then it would appear that we define knowledge in terms of itself. We agree with this objection, but the notion of adequacy may also turn out to not depend on epistemic notions. Adequacy, for instance, may turn out to be definable in terms of truth-making, and the truth-making relation need not refer to prior epistemic notions. Or consider the relation between a fully formalized axiomatic proof and a mathematical statement derived in that proof: the “adequacy” of the proof as a vehicle for mathematical truth is a purely syntactic notion, with no epistemological concepts presupposed. These examples suggest to us that room remains for a fruitful investigation of the concepts of knowledge, belief, and justification that acknowledges the distinction between adequate and inadequate reasons.\nIn this paper, our main goal is to clarify this duality in the concept of justification and show precisely what role it plays in Gettier-type examples. The gist of our account, therefore, lies in the distinction between reasons that (merely) support belief in a proposition and reasons that are not only supportive but are also what we call adequate. In order to articulate this distinction, we present the Logic of Reason-Based Belief in §2. This logic provides an explicit representation of reasons to believe a proposition. We show that the logic is sufficiently flexible to accommodate quantifiers over reasons, limited or full closure of reason-based belief under implication, and an optional requirement that all beliefs be reason-based. In §3, we put this logic to work in the analysis of Gettier cases: first to tease apart two notions of justification, one internalist and the other externalist; and second to study the susceptibility of internal JTB and of external JTB to Gettier-type examples. We close the paper with a puzzle about whether knowledge ought to hold in cases in which an agent possesses several reasons for a proposition, some adequate and others inadequate. Technical notions and results that are not required for an understanding of the main text are relegated to an appendix."

      "text" : "We distinguish between two kinds of reasons: those that merely “support” a proposition by inclining an agent to believe in it, and those that not only support a proposition but are also themselves “adequate.” Our analysis of Gettier cases hinges on a precise understanding of this key distinction. Accordingly, our task in this section is to introduce a simple theory of reason-based belief in which we formalize this distinction.\nAn important caveat is that we do not attempt to resolve the notion of “adequate reason” into more basic concepts. One might wish, for instance, to analyze adequacy in terms of reliability, in terms of counterfactual sensitivity, or in terms of other concepts. We deliberately avoid such an\nsuch examples. This has some similarities with the work in [4, 5]; however, our logics are much simpler and we use them as part of a different analysis.\nanalysis in this paper. Instead, we merely have a primitive to express that “reason r is adequate,” though we require that adequacy of r implies “veridicality” of r (i.e., that r only supports true things). In so doing, we commit ourselves to the idea that adequacy forces truth (see [1]). However, reasons can be veridical without being adequate, a fact that will be essential to our account of Gettier cases."

So believing reason r is adequate and accepting reason r will be considered to mean the same thing.\nTo reduce the number of parentheses while ensuring unique readability of formulas, we adopt the convention that the colon operator binds more strongly than any Boolean connective. For example,\nr :ϕ → ψ denotes (r :ϕ) → ψ [ and not r : (ϕ → ψ) ] .\nThe theory RBB of Reason-Based Belief appears in Table 1. We write ⊢ ϕ to mean that ϕ is deriavable in RBB. The negation is written 0 ϕ.\nRegarding the axioms and rules of RBB from Table 1, (CL) and (MP) say that RBB is an extension of classical propositional logic. (RK) says that reasons are closed under material implication, and (RN) says that reasons support all derivable formulas. (A) says that if r is a reason to believe ϕ and r is an adequate reason, then ϕ is true. (RB) says that if r is a reason to believe ϕ and the agent believes that r is an adequate reason, then the agent believes ϕ. (D) says that the agent’s beliefs are consistent: she cannot have contradictory beliefs (i.e., believe both ϕ and ¬ϕ for\n2Whether P and R are taken to be disjoint is up to the user of our system: if they are not disjoint, then some propositional letters are also reasons; if they are disjoint, then propositional letters and reasons are distinct objects.\nsome ϕ). Finally, (E) says that the agent’s beliefs do not distinguish between provably equivalent formulas.\nAs for mnemonics, (CL) is “Classical Logic,” (MP) is “Modus Ponens,” (RK) is Kripke’s axiom K of modal logic (used here for reasons), (RN) is “Reason Necessitation,” (A) is “Adequacy,” (RB) is “Reasons to Beliefs,” (D) is a well-known axiom from modal logic [7], and (E) is a well-known rule from minimal modal logic [7].\nSome useful terminology: given a reason r and a formula ψ to be used as an assumption describing the key features of a particular situation of reason-based belief, to say\n• “r is adequate (assuming ψ)” means ⊢ ψ → r;\n• “r is veridical for ϕ (assuming ψ)” means ⊢ ψ → (r :ϕ → ϕ); and\n• “r is veridical (assuming ψ)” means ⊢ ψ → (r :ϕ → ϕ) for each formula ϕ.\nWithin the confines of a given discussion in which the above terminology is used, the assumption ψ will generally be clear from context or else immaterial (i.e., one may take an arbitrary ψ). Therefore, the parenthetical expressions in the above terminology are generally omitted when the terminology is actually used. Note that ψ may also be the trivial assumption ⊤ (i.e., a fixed propositional tautology such as p ∨ ¬p for some fixed p ∈ P ). One clarification before we proceed: it follows by (A) that every adequate reason is veridical; however, a veridical reason is not necessarily adequate (i.e., the set {¬r} ∪ {r :ϕ → ϕ | ϕ ∈ F} is consistent with RBB).\nA semantics for RBB is presented in §A.1. It is shown in Theorem A.1 that RBB is sound and complete for this semantics."

      "heading" : "2.2 Weak Belief But Strong Reasons",
      "text" : "RBB posits an extremely weak notion of belief. In particular, beliefs are not necessarily closed under material implication. That is, it is consistent to have\nB(ϕ → ψ) ∧Bϕ ∧ ¬Bψ ,\nwhich says that the agent believes an implication and the antecedent of the implication but not the consequent. Further, there is no principle of RBB that guarantees us a minimum collection of\nbeliefs that the agent will hold. Indeed, we might think of (RB) as the main route for determining what it is that the agent believes, but even this principle requires an additional assumption that the reason in question is believed to be adequate. So, like all other axioms and rules that have something to say about belief, (RB) tells us that a belief obtains only if we already assume some other belief is already present. As a result, our theory allows for the possibility that the agent has no beliefs whatsoever : the set\n{¬Bϕ | ϕ ∈ F}\nthat collects together all statements of non-belief is consistent with our theory. So RBB does not require that the agent have any beliefs. But whenever she does, they are consistent by (D), they do not distinguish between provable equivalence by (E), and they encompass all supported assertions of a believed reason by (RB). But no further restrictions are placed on the notion of belief. Belief is therefore governed by the minimal modal logic ED [7].\nReasons, on the other hand, are fairly strong. First, they encompass all derivable statements by (RN). Second, they are closed under implication (and hence under (MP)) by (RK). Third, if adequate, then (A) says that they are veridical : everything they support is true. Reasons therefore support many assertions (infinitely many, in fact, because each reason supports each of the infinitely many theorems of RBB by (RN)). This puts more requirements on reasons (i.e., they must do more things), which makes them stronger. Reasons are governed by what is essentially the normal multi-modal logic KT (with one modal operator “ r : ” for each reason r), except that the T axiom r :ϕ → ϕ (sometimes called “veridicality”) is not guaranteed to hold unless, according to (A), we make the additional assumption that r is adequate. This way of having a multi-modal logic like KT but with the “modal operator” r itself a formula (whose truth implies veridicality) is, to our knowledge, new.3\nWe have chosen a theory of weak belief but stong reasons in order to keep things as simple as possible but still address some of the major trends in the epistemological study of knowledge as justified true belief (“JTB”). In all of the examples from epistemology we consider in this paper, we need some way to track an agent’s logical inferences and some way to link these inferences to what the agent believes. Our theory RBB is a simple and minimalistic way of doing just this: reasons are used to handle the relevant inferencing, the agent can “accept” a reason (or not) by believing it to be adequate (or not), the agent comes to believe things supported by reasons she accepts, and the agent’s beliefs are always consistent. This way we can encode inferencing using a reason, indicate whether the agent accepts this inferencing, and thereby infer whether she believes some statement based on a reason. We also allow the possiblity that she believes something without a reason, by which we mean that the set\n{Bϕ} ∪ {r :ϕ → ¬Br | r ∈ R}\nis consistent with our theory. Accordingly, we can separate out reason-based beliefs from those not coming from any reason, and we can use the inferencing apparatus of reasons to characterize\n3The usual way of writing our formula r :ϕ would be ✷rϕ. So RBB is just a multi-modal logic with an extra formula r for each r ∈ R, a K-modality “ r : ” (our variant of ✷r) for each r ∈ R that respects the reflexivity scheme T if r holds (as per (A)), and an ED-modality B that is linked to the other modalities via scheme (RB). According to our intended semantics (§A.1), we interpret modal operators using a possible worlds semantics (with a neighborhood function for B), and the intended interpretation of the formula r is that the binary accessibility relation corresponding to the modal operator “ r : ” is reflexive. Certain hybrid logics [6] can express reflexivity of modal operators: the formula ↓x.¬✷r¬x says that the accessibility relation corresponding to ✷r is reflexive. However, hybrid logics generally include additional features permitting greater expressivity than we need.\nthe key features of a number of important epistemological examples. And all of this is done in a simple, minimalistic setting."

This principle says that if an agent believes reasons r and s are adequate, then r and s cannot support contradictory assertions. Intuitively, the derivability of (RC) follows because (RB) requires that an agent who believes a reason also believes everything that the reason supports and (D) requires that an agent not have contradictory beliefs. Notice that if we take r = s in (RC), then we obtain a statement provably equivalent to\n⊢ Br → (r :ϕ → ¬(r :¬ϕ)) , (IC)\nwhich says that a reason believed to be adequate is internally consistent.

Put another way, the formula\n¬Br ∧ r :ϕ ∧ r :¬ϕ\nis consistent with our theory. Similarly, if the agent believes r is an adequate reason but does not believe s is an adequate reason, then our theory does not rule out the possibility that r and s are inconsistent.

That is,\n⊢ ϕ → ψ implies ⊢ r :ϕ → r :ψ . (RCLC)\nThe proof: from ϕ → ψ, we obtain r : (ϕ → ψ) by (RN). This is the antecedent of an instance of (RK), so the consequent r :ϕ → r :ψ of this instance is derivable by an application of (MP). This\n4Consistency of RBB follows by soundness (Theorem A.1).\ncompletes the proof. In examining this proof, we see that (RCLC) is a consequence of the stronger logical principle encompassed by our axiom\nr : (ϕ → ψ) → (r :ϕ → r :ψ) , (RK)\nwhich says that reasons are closed under material implication. The principle (RCLC) says that reasons are closed under logical consequence. It is unclear whether this is a desirable principle. For example, it may make more sense to say that if ψ is a logical consequence of ϕ and r is a reason to believe ϕ, then it is not r itself that is a reason to believe the consequence ψ. Instead, what is wanted is some more complicated reason r′ that not only references r but also provides some reason s as to why ψ obtains from ϕ. That is, we might seek a principle like this:\ns : (ϕ → ψ) → (r :ϕ → (s · r) :ψ) . (App)\nThis is the principle of Application from Justification Logic [3]. It says: if s is a reason to believe the implication ϕ → ψ and r is a reason to believe the antecedent ϕ, then a new object s ·r obtained by combining s and r is a reason to believe the consequent ψ. In essence, the more complex reason s · r keeps track of everything we would need to check to see that ψ indeed obtains: the initial reason r for the antecedent ϕ and a reason s for the implication ϕ → ψ. Further, the syntactic structure of s · r, with s to the left and r to the right, tells us what kind of a reason we have: based on the form of (App), it is suggested that s is some implication, r is the antecedent of that implication, and s · r is a reason for the consequent. In essence, we are describing specific witnesses for an instance of the rule (MP) of Modus Ponens:\nϕ → ψ ϕ\nψ (MP) is encoded by\ns r s · r .\n(App) is a more nuanced version of (RK): if we have r : (ϕ → ψ) and r :ϕ, then we do not obtain r :ψ straightaway using (App). Instead, we must construct the reason r · r in support of ψ. The single instance of “ · ” in the syntactic structure of the latter reason reflects our use of one derivational step (i.e., one instance of (MP)) to obtain ψ.\nTo do away with (RCLC), we must do away with (K) and modify (RN). In particular, let R0 be a nonempty set of “basic” reasons, define R to be the smallest extension of R0 satisfying the property that s, t ∈ R implies s · t ∈ R, replace scheme (K) by scheme (App), and restrict (RN) by requiring that r ∈ R0. (It is assumed that all other schemes and rules can use reasons coming from the full set R.) Call the resulting theory RBB+(App). In RBB+(App), it is consistent to have\nr : (ϕ → ψ) ∧ r :ϕ ∧ ¬(r :ψ) , (1)\nwhich says that r is not closed under implication. As a result, it can be shown that (RCLC) no longer obtains. But note that (RK) and (RCLC) do not fail in RBB+(App) because logical or materially implied consequences of assertions are no longer “accessible” by some reason. Indeed, in the situation (1) under the theory RBB+(App), the logical consequence ψ of ϕ is still “accessible” by the reason r ·r. However, this reason r ·r is more “complex” than the original reason r (in terms of the number of instances of the (MP)-encoding Application operator “ · ” that appear inside it). In general, distant consequences that would require many repetitions of (App) are still accessible; it is just that the reasons that access these consequences may be very “complex.”\nJustification Logic (JL) [3] is the study of logics of reason-based belief (with reasons thought of as “justifications”). Defining JL0 to be the fragment of RBB+(App) obtained by omitting all belief formulas and belief axioms from the theory, Justification Logics may be thought of as extensions of JL0.\n5 Many JLs permit other kinds of combinations of reasons than what we saw with (App). Our logic RBB is closely related to the JL tradition, though we conspicuously omit (App), retain (K) (and thereby endorse (RCLC)), leave (RN) without the additional restriction, and maintain a set R of primitive reasons that cannot be combined to form more complex reasons. In so doing, we lose the ability to have the syntactic structure of reasons reflect the structure of derivations in the theory, and thereby forgo a more nuanced tracking of the interaction between logical consequence and the complexity of reasons. We accept these consequences in the interest of developing a system that is simple and yet still of use to the formal epistemologist. Nevertheless, we recognize that a reader may be interested to see a thorough study of more sophisticated extensions of our theory that allow for the combination of reasons along the lines of (App) (and perhaps for other features as well). We advise such a reader to consult the JL literature directly [3].\nSince our theory does not allow the agent to combine reasons in the sense of (App) and beliefs are not closed under implication, it is consistent for us to have a situation wherein the agent has the requisite information to draw a belief but simply does not draw it. For example, assuming s 6= r, it is consistent to have\nBs ∧Br ∧ s : (ϕ → ψ) ∧ r :ϕ ∧ ¬Bψ , (2)\nwhich says that the agent believes the reason s supporting an implication is adequate (and hence the agent believes the implication), the agent believes the reason r supporting the antecedent is adequate (and hence the agent believes the antecedent), and yet the agent does not believe the consequent (even though she believes the implication and its antecedent). The problem is that her beliefs are not closed under (MP). This is so despite the fact that, by (RCLC) and (RB), beliefs coming from the same reason are closed under (MP):\n⊢ (Bt ∧ t : (ϕ → ψ) ∧ t :ϕ) → Bψ .\nSo long as the implication and its antecedent come from separate beliefs as in (2), the agent need not believe the consequent.\nThe consistency of (2) is a consequence of our design: we use reason operators to encode inferencing, and we use belief operators to encode the particular inferencing and the individual assertions that the agent accepts (in terms of her affirmed beliefs). As such, the situation (2) is one in which the agent has not yet performed sufficient inferencing to accept the conclusion ψ, even though she is very close (after all, she has done enough to accept the implication ϕ → ψ and its antecedent ϕ). In essence, this lack of closure allows us to place one kind of constraint on the agent’s inferencing powers. If desired, one can place even more severe constraints as in [5]; however, this seems to require more syntax and additional axioms. One can also go the other way and lift these constraints entirely; in §2.5 we will suggest one natural way to do this in our setting. But for now we retain what we hope is a “happy medium” in the form our theory RBB.\n5Actually, Justification Logics are extensions of a fragment of RBB+(App) that places further restrictions on the rule (RN), but we set aside further discussion of this issue here."

      "text" : "We saw in (2) that reason-based beliefs in RBB need not be closed under implication if the source reasons are different. If we would like to ensure that reason-based beliefs are always closed under implication, even if the beliefs come from separate reasons, then a simple solution is to introduce a “master reason” σ that encodes the combined information of all reasons the agent accepts. This requires us to expand our reason set R to include a new symbol σ not already present and then add the following additional schemes to RBB:\n(MA) σ → (Br → r)\n(MB) Bσ\n(MR) r :ϕ → (Br → σ :ϕ)\n(MA) says that every accepted reason is adequate if the master reason is adequate, (MB) says that the agent always believes the master reason, and (MR) says that anything supported by a reason that the agent believes is also supported by the master reason. Adding these principles makes it so that σ is the sum of the agent’s evidence. Calling RBBσ the theory obtained from RBB by expanding the set R of reasons to include a new symbol σ and adding (MA), (MB), and (MR), it follows that\nRBBσ ⊢ (Bs ∧Br ∧ s : (ϕ → ψ) ∧ r :ϕ) → Bψ . (RCL2)\nIndeed, if the agent believes the reason s supporting an implication is adequate and the agent believes the reason r supporting the antecedent is adequate, then it follows by (MR) that σ supports the implication and its antecedent. Therefore, by (RK) and (MP), σ supports the consequent. But the agent believes σ to be adequate by (MB), and therefore it follows by (RB) that the agent believes the consequent. It is in this sense that the agent “combines” the information conveyed by reasons she believes to be adequate into the master reason σ.\nWhile we have shown that the RBBσ-agent may combine the information from two reasons to derive her beliefs, there is no need to restrict the number of reasons to two. Indeed, according to (MB), the agent implicitly combines into σ the information from every reason she believes to be adequate, no matter how many of these there may be.\nIn RBBσ, the master reason σ serves as a witness for an existential quantifier over reasons that the agent accepts (i.e., believes to be adequate).6 In particular, (MR) tells us that if there exists an accepted reason r that supports ϕ, then σ supports ϕ. Hence by (MB), if there exists such an r, then σ supports ϕ and is itself accepted. If we were to add quantifiers to the language (something we do later in §2.6), we could express this as:\n(∃r)(Br ∧ r :ϕ) → (Bσ ∧ σ :ϕ) .\nThat is, if there exists an accepted reason that supports ϕ, then σ is a witness to the existential quantifier.\nBoth RBBσ and the basic theory RBB allow for the possibility that the agent believes a formula ϕ without any supporting reasons (i.e., she does not believe to be adequate any reason that supports ϕ). This is the same as saying that the set\n{Bϕ} ∪ {r :ϕ → ¬Br | r ∈ R}\n6Said precisely: σ is a Skolem constant for the existential quantifier over accepted reasons. See [16] or any book on mathematical logic for details.\nis consistent with both RBBσ and RBB. If this situation is undesirable, then a simple remedy is to extend the theory RBBσ by adding a principle that says all beliefs are supported by the master reason:\n(MT) Bϕ → σ :ϕ\nWith (MT) in place, the agent believes only those things supported by σ and hence, by (MR), she believes only those things supported by some reason. In short, every belief is “reason-based.” Defining RBB+σ to be the theory obtained from RBBσ by adding (MT), it follows by (MT), (RB), and (MB) that\nRBB+σ ⊢ Bϕ ↔ σ :ϕ ,\nwhich says that the agent believes something just in case it is supported by the master reason. But then belief can be conflated with the master reason. As a result, we have by (RCLC) that the beliefs of the RBB+σ -agent are always closed under (MP). Belief in RBB + σ is therefore governed by the normal modal logic KD. Semantics for RBBσ and for RBB + σ may be found in §A.2. It is shown in Theorem A.2 that each of RBBσ and RBB + σ is sound and complete for its semantics."

For reasons s and r and a formula ϕ, we say that s is free for r in ϕ to mean that r has no free occurrence in ϕ within the scope of a quantifier (∀s). Put another way, if s is free for r in ϕ, then in the formula\nϕ[s/r]\nobtained by substituting all free occurrences of r in ϕ by s, no newly replaced occurrence is bound. Examples: s is free for r in (∀t)(t 6= r) but not in (∀s)(s 6= r).\nThe theory QRBB of Quantified Reason-Based Belief is defined in Table 2.

It is therefore unproblematic for us to simply write ⊢ ϕ to say that ϕ is provable.\nWe can extend QRBB to the theory QRBBσ obtained by extending R to include a new master reason σ and adding the schemes (MA), (MB), and (MR) for σ. We can further extend QRBBσ to the theory QRBB+σ obtained by adding the additional scheme (MT) to guarantee all beliefs are reason-based.\nSemantics for QRBB, for QRBBσ, and for QRBB + σ may be found in §A.3. It is shown in Theorems A.5 and A.12 that each of QRBB, QRBBσ, and QRBB + σ is sound and complete for its semantics. However, for the completeness result, there is one caveat: our proof requires that the set R of reasons be at least countably infinite."

      "text" : "In our theory, there are (at least) two natural ways to define JTB:\n• JTBer(ϕ) := r :ϕ ∧Br ∧ r, and\n• JTBir(ϕ) := r :ϕ ∧Br ∧ ϕ.\nBoth imply that the agent has a true belief that ϕ. However, JTBer(ϕ) suggests that the agent has a true belief justified by an adequate reason, whereas JTBir(ϕ) suggests that the agent only has a true belief justified by a prima facie reason (that may not be adequate). JTBer is thus externalist, while JTBir is internalist.\nGettier’s achievement was to deny that JTBir(ϕ) is the same as knowledge of ϕ. For example, if we assume that\nr : p ∧Br ∧ (¬p ∧ q) , (G2)\nthen we have Gettier’s second case.7 In particular, since r is a reason to believe p, we have by (RCLC) that r is a reason to believe p∨q. Since the agent believes r is an adequate reason, she will believe both p and p ∨ q. But p is false and q is true. So, assuming she has no reason supporting q that she believes is adequate, we are in a situation where she has a JTB of p ∨ q based solely on a reason supporting the false disjunct p. As a result, Gettier and many others argue that the agent does not know p ∨ q, even though she does have a JTB that p ∨ q (in the internal sense of JTBir(p ∨ q)).\nIn contrast, if we assume that JTBer(p), which is\nr : p ∧Br ∧ r , (G2′)\nthen, since r supports p, it also supports p ∨ q by (RCLC). But r is an adequate reason and therefore both p and p ∨ q are true. Since the agent believes r is an adequate reason, she believes both p and p ∨ q, and in this case her belief is based on an adequate (and hence veridical) reason.\nIn general, it is easy to see that JTBer(ϕ) satifies:\n• ⊢ JTBer(ϕ → ψ) → (JTB e r(ϕ) → JTB e r(ψ)),\nwhich says that external JTB is closed under implication (if supported by a fixed reason r);\n• ⊢ JTBer(ϕ) → ϕ,\nwhich says that external JTB is veridical;\n• ⊢ JTBer(ϕ) → (r :ψ → ψ),\nwhich says that if an agent has an external JTB based on reason r, then r cannot support any false assertions (so-called “false lemmas”); and\n7This is the case where the agent “Smith” has a reason to believe p (“Jones owns a Ford”) and concludes p ∨ q (“Jones owns a Ford or Brown is in Barcelona”) on the basis of this reason; however, unknown to Smith, p is false and q is true.\n• ⊢ ϕ implies ⊢ (Br ∧ r) → JTBer(ϕ),\nwhich says that for provable ϕ, if the agent correctly believes that reason r is adequate, then she will have external JTB of ϕ based on r.\nIn contrast, one can show that JTBir(ϕ) satisfies:\n• ⊢ JTBir(ϕ → ψ) → (JTB i r(ϕ) → JTB i r(ψ)),\nwhich says that internal JTB is closed under implication (if supported by a fixed reason r);\n• ⊢ JTBir(ϕ) → ϕ,\nwhich says that internal JTB is veridical;\n• 0 JTBir(ϕ) → (r :ψ → ψ),\nwhich says that if an agent has an internal JTB based on reason r, then r might support false assertions (so-called “false lemmas”); and\n• ⊢ ϕ implies ⊢ Br → JTBir(ϕ),\nwhich says that for provable ϕ, if the agent believes that reason r is adequate, then she will have internal JTB of ϕ based on r (even if her belief is mistaken).\nThe differences between JTBer and JTB i r are in the last two properties. So we see that the main difference between external and internal JTB is in the reliability of the reason on which the JTB is based. External JTB requires that the reason cannot be faulty, whereas internal JTB merely requires that the agent believe (correctly or not) that the reason is non-faulty.\nUsing our quantified language, we adopt the following abbreviations:\nJTBe(ϕ) := (∃r)JTBer(ϕ) and JTB i(ϕ) := (∃r)JTBir(ϕ) .\nJTBe(ϕ) says that the agent has an external JTB for ϕ (based on some reason), and JTBi(ϕ) says the same but for internal JTB.\n3.2 Is Knowledge JTBe?\nJTBi falls prey to Gettier’s examples because the supporting reason need not be veridical (i.e., it admits “false lemmas”). JTBe, however, requires an adequate supporting reason, and hence this reason is necessarily veridical (i.e., it admits “no false lemmas”). This suggests we examine the equation\nKϕ := JTBe(ϕ) , (KJTBe)\nwhich defines knowledge as external JTB. What should we think of this equation? Consider the “fake barn county” situation [11]: the agent is in a county that has numerous fake barns that look exactly like real barns. Not knowing she is in this county, she sees what she thinks is a barn and concludes that it is indeed a barn. It turns out she is correct because, by chance, she happens to be looking at the only real barn in the entire county. Obviously, she has an internal JTB that she sees a barn, though most philosophers argue that she does not know she sees a barn.8 But does\n8Intuitions about knowledge ascription in fake barn cases are notoriously less stable among philosophers than they are in the original Gettier cases (see [12, 15, 9]). Here we are considering a situation in which the belief seems simply “too lucky” to count as knowledge.\nshe have an external JTB in this case? One reason to answer affirmatively: the agent’s reason is veridical, unlike in Gettier’s original examples.9 However, veridicality does not imply adequacy. Take r and p so that\nr is read, “what the agent sees looks to her like a barn,” and\np is read, “what the agent sees is a barn.”\nOur agent is in the situation: r : p ∧Br ∧ p . (Barn)\nThat is, the claim that what the agent sees is a barn is supported by the reason r, which says that what she sees looks like a barn; the agent believes that r is adequate to guarantee the truth of what it supports; and the agent does actually see a barn. But is r in fact adequate? If we say it is, then we run into the following problem: had the agent picked a different barn-looking structure that turned out to be a fake, we would have\nr : p ∧Br ∧ ¬p , (Barn′)\nwhich implies that p is non-veridical, contradicting the assumed adequacy of r (since adequacy implies veridicality). This suggests to us that r is not necessarily adequate; that is, each of (Barn)∧r and (Barn)∧¬r is consistent with our intuitions about the “fake barn county” example. Conclusion: the agent need not have external JTB in this case.\nWe take it that the “fake barn county” example seeks to challenge the agent’s acumen in determining when it is safe to reason according to the principle\n(what I see looks like an X) → (what I see is an X) , (WSWG)\nwhich has the colloquial reading “what I see is what I get.”10 Since adequacy implies veridicality, one could use our notion of adequacy to indicate that the agent’s use of (WSWG) is licensed. In particular, if we assume that (Barn) ∧ r, then we might construe this as a case in which the agent is in “normal barn county” (where there are no fake barns) and so her use of (WSWG) is licensed: r is an externally valid reason for the agent to infer that she sees a barn, so the agent knows that she sees a barn. In contrast, if we assume that (Barn) ∧ ¬r, then we might construe this as a case in which the agent is back in “fake barn county” and not licensed to draw the conclusion: r is not an externally valid reason for her to infer that she sees a barn, so she does not know that she sees a barn.\nZagzebski’s criticism of a JTB-based analysis of knowledge [18] might apply here: we either must sever the link between truth and justification (thereby going so far as to concede that there is knowledge in Gettier cases) or else assert that “there is no degree of independence at all between truth and justification” (in order to avoid Gettier problems). Zagzebski’s position is that neither horn of her dilemma is satisfactory, and so the proper way to avoid the dilemma is to reject the possibility of analyzing knowledge in terms of JTB plus some extra component (i.e., reject the\n9Veridicality is defined in §2.1. Our framework can distinguish three “types” of reasons: those that are nonveridical (and hence inadequate), those that are veridical but inadequate, and those that are adequate (and hence veridical). Gettier’s second case (G2) has reasons of the first type: non-veridical. The “fake barn county” case has reasons of the second type: veridical but inadequate. And one might argue that a “normal barn county” variant of “fake barn county” (in which there are no fake barns) has reasons of the third type: adequate.\n10This diagnosis was suggested to the third author by Alexandru Baltag (private communication).\n“knowledge is JTB + x” approach all together); see also [17]. We accept that our approach is close to endorsing the second horn of Zagzebski’s dilemma. However, by distinguishing adequacy from veridicality, we can still maintain a notion of independence between truth and justification. In particular, pace Zagzebski, our semantic analysis distinguishes between “adequate belief” (i.e., JTBe) and “lucky true belief” (i.e., JTBi)."

      "text" : "So let us assume that our definition (KJTBe) of knowledge as external JTB is correct. Is it then possible to define knowledge (i.e., external JTB) in terms of internal JTB plus some other condition? Indeed it is:\n⊢ JTBe(ϕ) ↔ (∃r)(r ∧ JTBir(ϕ))\nIn words: to have external justification it is necessary and sufficient to have an adequate justification that serves as the basis for an internal JTB.\nHowever, this analysis immediately raises a concern regarding the force of the quantifier on the right side of the equivalence. To appreciate the problem, it is worth reminding ourselves of one of the first responses to Gettier’s examples: the so-called “no false lemmas” (hereafter “NFL”) requirement (see [8]). The NFL requirement is meant to rule out situations like Gettier’s second case, wherein the agent starts from a mistaken belief that p to obtain a correct belief that p ∨ q. Thinking of the reasoning sequence of beliefs 〈p, p ∨ q〉 as a “proof,” the initial “lemma” (i.e., assumption) p is false, but then a perfectly legitimate inference step to a logical consequence p ∨ q ends up on a formula that just so happens to be true.\nIn our framework, the obvious counterpart to the NFL requirement is the “no inadequate lemmas” (henceforth “NIL”) requirement:\nNIL(ϕ) := (∀s)(JTBis(ϕ) → s) .\nThis says that every reason that supports an internal JTB of ϕ is adequate. Since adequate reasons support only true formulas (by axiom scheme (A)), the NIL requirement guarantees that no false “lemma” (i.e., formula) intrudes on a reason justifying a potential internal JTB of ϕ. This gives rise to the following notion of JTB with no inadequate lemmas:\nJTB+NIL(ϕ) := JTBi(ϕ) ∧ NIL(ϕ) .\nThis notion of JTB is logically stronger than external JTB: JTBe(ϕ) only requires that there be one adequate reason supporting an internal JTB of ϕ, whereas JTB+NIL requires adequacy of every reason supporting an internal JTB of ϕ. Thus ⊢ JTB+NIL(ϕ) → JTBe(ϕ) but not the other way around.\nThese considerations raise a potential worry for the JTBe analysis of knowledge: what happens when the agent rests her beliefs in a proposition (such as p∨q) on multiple sources? For example,11 suppose our agent, who has excellent eyesight, sees someone in the distance but cannot quite make out who it is. Nevertheless, based on what she can see (represented by reason s), she correctly believes that the person in the distance is either Tweedle Dee or Tweedle Dum (represented respectively by p∨ q). Further, she has another reason r to believe that the person is Tweedle Dee (i.e., p). For example, a friend might have told her that Tweedle Dum is on vacation in some\n11The example was suggested to the first author by Timothy Williamson (private communication). See [9].\nfaraway country. Now, unknown to our agent, the person in the distance is actually Tweedle Dum. Put formally:\ns : (p ∨ q) ∧ ¬(s : p) ∧ ¬(s : q) ∧ r : p ∧Bs ∧Br ∧ s ∧ (¬p ∧ q) . (TDTD)\nThat is, s supports the disjunction (that the person is Dee or Dum) but no disjunct, r supports the claim it is Dee, the agent believes s and r to be adequate, s is adequate (by hypothesis, because the agent’s eyesight is excellent, and it could not possibly be someone other than Dee or Dum), and the person is actually not Dee but Dum. Now suppose we add to (TDTD) the assumption\n(∀t)((t 6= s ∧ t 6= r) → ¬Bt) (NoR)\nthat the agent believes no other reasons to be adequate. It can be shown that\n⊢ [(TDTD) ∧ (NoR)] → JTBe(p ∨ q) but\n0 [(TDTD) ∧ (NoR)] → JTB+NIL(p ∨ q) .\nIn words: the agent has external JTB that p ∨ q (because the adequate reason s supports the disjunction); however, she does not have JTB with NIL of p ∨ q (because the inadequate reason r supports the disjunction). But is it a mistake to equate knowledge with JTBe instead of with JTB+NIL?\nOne reaction is to deny that there is knowledge when the universal condition is not satisfied. For an example supporting this reaction, suppose the agent proves that a certain Mersenne number m = 2n − 1 is prime. Later, she bolsters her belief in the primality of m by coming to believe (incorrectly) that all Mersenne numbers are prime (i.e., all numbers of the form 2k − 1 are prime, which is false). Can the agent still be said to know that m is prime? On one account, it seems not. Such situations of mixed reasons, where an agent has both adequate and inadequate reasons supporting the same proposition, arguably occur often in everyday life.\nWe are inclined to the opposite view: in a situation of mixed reasons, the agent can still have knowledge. Returning to the primality example, if the agent learns that not all Mersenne numbers are prime, then she will still believe that m is prime on the basis of her adequate “backup” reason (that she proved m is prime). So she could still be said to know that m is prime.12 The Dee/Dum case is arguably similar: if the agent were to learn that r is unreliable, then she would still have an external JTB of the disjunction based on the “backup” reason s.\nPerhaps the most difficult challenge to the claim that (KJTBe) is correct even in the case of mixed reasons comes when the quantity of inadequate reasons vastly exceeds the quantity of adequate reasons. For example, suppose our agent has an adequate reason s (based on an assertion in some recent official document) that one of the 20 members of the faculty of department D is a logician; further, suppose she has inadequate reasons r1, . . . , r19 (based on a mistaken understanding of which specialties imply competence in logic) that the first 19 names listed on the department D faculty roster are logicians. We might be hard-pressed to say that our agent knows that department D has a logician on staff.\nPerhaps this suggests that the agent in a case of mixed reasons can only be said to know the proposition if she also knows that her reasons are adequate. We resist this move, postponing further discussion on this point until the conclusion. Therefore, if we assume for the sake of argument that our agent values all reasons equally, then a tiny island of adequacy within an ocean of inadequacy is\n12These ideas are related to the defeasibility theory of knowledge [13, 14].\nsufficient for the defender of mixed-reason knowledge. This might require granting that the agent’s reasons are in some sense confused or that an agent who has only adequate reasons (and hence satisfies JTB+NFL) seems to “know better” than the agent with mixed reasons. But if one agent “knows better,” it does not follow that the other does not know at all. Intuitions here may differ, so we prefer to leave a more detailed exploration of this problem for further work.\nLet us return to the question raised at the beginning of this section: can we legitimately define knowledge as JTBe? We have suggested an affirmative answer. But is JTBe too weak, especially when compared to JTB+NIL? Our answer is that JTB+NIL does indeed correspond to a more stringent concept of knowledge; perhaps we might call it “robust knowledge.” Such an ideal might be more desirable to achieve, but this does not imply that the purely existential condition of JTBe is itself insufficient. But does JTBe provide us with a noncircular analysis of knowledge (as “JTB + x”)? We have no conclusive argument for a positive answer, though in a bolder mood we might answer “maybe.” We did not provide an analysis of the notion of adequacy itself, so one can still object that we have not ruled out the possibility of circularity. But we have also argued that the notion of “adequate reason” does not necessarily involve an explicit reference to epistemic concepts. Metaphysically, our notion of adequacy, which links reasons and propositions, may indeed be independent of epistemic concepts. If anything, our analysis at least asserts the existence of an essential connection between knowledge and justification, along with the existence of justifications that are intrinsically better than others."

      "text" : "Is knowledge the same thing as JTB? We wrote this paper based on a persistent feeling that both answers are defensible.13 For the negative: Gettier’s examples show that plausible reasons may be inadequate. For the positive: a JTB based on an adequate reason seems to rule out the possibility of Gettier cases and can arguably be construed as a form of knowledge.\nWe have shown that our framework is sufficient to address reason-based belief and that it can be applied to important notions in epistemology. However, we have neglected to provide a further analysis of “adequacy of a reason” into more primitive concepts. While this notion was used as a primitive in this paper, an in-depth study of this notion may be required in a full philosophical analysis of the concept of knowledge. Regardless, we think that our three-part hierarchy of reasons (non-veridical, veridical but inadequate, and adequate) is itself sufficiently fruitful to legitimate our approach.\nA further and related difficulty on which we propose to end is the following: how does the agent know whether a reason is adequate? According to (KJTBe), the agent knows p if and only if there exists an adequate reason r that supports p and that the agent believes is adequate. Therefore, the agent knows r is adequate if and only if there exists an adequate reason s that supports r (i.e., s : r) and the agent believes that s is adequate.14 Our framework therefore admits the possibility that the agent may know p based on an adequate reason r without knowing that r is itself adequate. In\n13This ambivalence is not idiosyncratic to us. Turri [15] mentions that Sellars agrees with the force of Gettier’s examples but still thinks that knowledge is JTB.\n14Note that we may have s = r. In particular, it is consistent with our theory for reasons to be self-supporting (i.e., r : r). It is also consistent with our theory for reasons to be non–self-supporting (i.e., ¬(r : r)). Since our theory permits either option, it is up to the user of our theory to choose which way to go as per her preference. We also note that it is consistent for r to be self-rejecting (i.e., r :¬r), and it is consistent for r to be non–self-rejecting (i.e., ¬(r :¬r)).\nthis, our framework supports the main contention of an externalist account of knowledge: one may know p without knowing that one knows p (see [17]).15 We think this is right for the externalist, though we emphasize that our theory is in principle neutral regarding the existence of reasons justifying the adequacy of other reasons. We leave a more ample discussion of this issue for another occasion."

We also let r◦ denote the set\nr◦ := {v ∈ W | (v, v) ∈ [r]}\nof all worlds that are r-accessible from themselves. These are the worlds at which the reason r is said to be reflexive. As we will see shortly, a reason that is reflexive at a world will be adequate at that world. So reflexivity and adequacy are equivalent notions, and hence we may conflate the two, which ought not cause confusion. To indicate the sets r(w) and r◦ arise from worlds in model M , we may write rM (w) and rM◦ (respectively).\nWe require our models to satisfy three key properties:\n15The internalist who objects to this need not dispair: though we do not do so here, it is possible to extend our framework so that knowledge is internalizable; see [3] for details.\n(pr) For each x ∈ P ∩R, we have x ∈ V (w) if and only if w ∈ x(w).\nThis says that for propositional letters that are also reasons, the truth assignment given to x by the valuation V agrees with the reflexivity of x. This ensures that there is no ambiguity in the assignment of truth to propositional letters that are also reasons.16\n(d) X ∈ N(w) implies W −X /∈ N(w).\nThis says that if the agent believes X at world w, then she does not believe the complement W −X at world w.\n(rb) r(w) ⊆ X and r◦ ∈ N(w) together imply that X ∈ N(w).\nThis says that if r is a reason to believe X at world w and the agent believes at w that r is reflexive (i.e., an adequate reason), then the agent believes X at world w.\n(d) and (rb) are the model-theoretic analogs of the axioms (D) and (RB), respectively. It can be shown that properties (d) and (rb) together imply the following property:\n(rc) r◦ ∈ N(w) and s◦ ∈ N(w) together imply that r(w) ∩ s(w) 6= ∅,\nwhich says that if the agent believes reasons r and s are both reflexive, then these two reasons are consistent.\nIn essence, since (d) requires belief consistency and (rb) says that the agent believes everything supported by a reason she believes to be adequate, it follows that she will not believe contradictory reasons to be adequate. (rc) is the model-theoretic analog of the principle (RC) of reason consistency.\nA pointed model is a pair (M,w) consisting of a model M and a world w in M . We write M,w |= ϕ to say that ϕ is true at the pointed model (M,w), and we write M,w 6|= ϕ for the negation. We define the satisfaction relation |= and the set\nJχKM := {v ∈ W | M,v |= χ}\nof worlds in the model M at which the formula χ is satisfied as follows.\n• M,w |= p means that p ∈ V (w).\n• M,w |= ¬ϕ means that M,w 6|= ϕ.\n• M,w |= ϕ ∨ ψ means that M,w |= ϕ or M,w |= ψ.\n• M,w |= r :ϕ means that r(w) ⊆ JϕKM .\n• M,w |= r means that w ∈ r(w).\n• M,w |= Bϕ means that JϕKM ∈ N(w).\n16By definition, the nonempty sets P and R are not necessarily disjoint. Therefore, our language allows for the possibility that there are objects that are both propositional letters and reasons. The choice as to which possibility to realize is up to the user, who may decide to take P ∩R = ∅ or not as per her preference.\nWe note that |= is well-defined: for each x ∈ P ∩ R, we have x ∈ V (w) if and only w ∈ x(w) by (pr), and therefore M,w |= x is well-defined. To say that ϕ is valid in M , written M |= ϕ, means that JϕKM = W . To say that ϕ is valid, written |= ϕ, means that M |= ϕ for every model M . It is shown in Theorem A.1 that RBB is sound and complete for this semantics: we have ⊢ ϕ if and only if |= ϕ.\nThe following terminology is the semantic analog of terminology presented at the end of §2.1: given a reason r and a pointed model (M,w) representing the key features of a particular situation of reason-based belief, to say\n• “r is adequate at (M,w)” means M,w |= r;\n• “r is veridical for ϕ at (M,w)” means M,w |= r :ϕ → ϕ; and\n• “r is veridical at (M,w)” means M,w |= r :ϕ → ϕ for each formula ϕ.\nIn using the above terminology, we may omit mention of (M,w) if it should be clear from context which pointed model is meant. It follows by (rb) that every adequate reason is veridical; however, for the same reasons as we have seen in the syntactic case, a veridical reason is not necessarily adequate.\nIn the semantic context, an alternative notion of veridicality might be of interest: to say “r is semantically veridical for X at (M,w),” where X ⊆ WM is a proposition (i.e., set of worlds), means rM(w) ⊆ X implies w ∈ X; and to say “r is semantically veridical at (M,w)” means r is semantically veridical for each X ⊆ WM . This notion of “semantic veridicality” is more general than the notion of “syntactic veridicality” presented in the previous paragraph and at the end of §2.1. Nevertheless, our primary interest is in syntactic veridicality, and so any mention of “veridicality” should be assumed to refer to syntactic veridicality.\nA.2 Semantics for RBBσ and RBB +\nσ\nThe models for RBB can be construed as models for RBBσ if we require the following additional properties:\n(ma) w ∈ σ(w) and r◦ ∈ N(w) together imply that w ∈ r(w).\nwhich says that if σ is reflexive, then each reason r believed to be reflexive is in fact reflexive;\n(mb) σ◦ ∈ N(w),\nwhich says that the agent believes σ is reflexive; and\n(mr) r(w) ⊆ X and r◦ ∈ N(w) together imply that σ(w) ⊆ X,\nwhich says that σ supports X if r supports X and the agent believes r is reflexive.\nWe write the satisfaction relation |=σ to indicate that we restrict to models satisfying (ma), (mb), and (mr). By Theorem A.2, RBBσ is sound and complete for the class of models satisfying (ma), (mb), and (mr). Models for the theory RBB+σ must satisfy (ma), (mb), (mr), and the following property:\n(mt) X ∈ N(w) implies σ(w) ⊆ X,\nwhich says that σ supports X if the agent believes X.\nWe write |=+σ to indicate that we restrict to models satisfying (ma), (mb), (mr), and (mt). By Theorem A.2, RBB+σ is sound and complete for the class of models satisfying (ma), (mb), (mr), and (mt).\nGenerally, we shall work in the theory RBB and therefore none of principles (MA), (MB), (MR), or (MT) (or their corresponding lowercase-named semantic principles) are to be assumed in what follows, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\nA.3 Semantics for QRBB, QRBBσ, and QRBB +\nσ\nThe models for RBB can be used as models for QRBB as well. All that we must do is add the following satisfaction principles:\n• M,w |= r = s means that r = s.\n• M,w |= (∀r)ϕ means that M,w |= ϕ[s/r] for each s free for r in ϕ.\nIt is shown in Theorem A.5 that QRBB is sound and complete for this semantics: for each theory we have QRBB ⊢ ϕ if and only if |= ϕ. However, there is one caveat: our proof of the completeness result requires that the set R of reasons be at least countably infinite.\nAdditional semantic restrictions must be imposed to ensure that QRBB models also work for QRBBσ or for QRBB + σ ; see §A.2 for details. Soundness and completeness for QRBBσ and for QRBB + σ follows by Theorem A.12, with the same caveat for completeness as for QRBB.\nA.4 RBB Soundness and Completeness\nWe now prove the following theorem.\nTheorem A.1 (RBB Soundness and Completeness). For each ϕ ∈ F :\nRBB ⊢ ϕ iff |= ϕ .\nSoundness is by induction on the length of derivation. The arguments for (CL), (MP), (RK), (D), (RN), and (E) are straighforward. We consider the remaining cases.\n• Validity of (A): |= r :ϕ → (r → ϕ).\nM,w |= r :ϕ and M,w |= r together imply that r(w) ⊆ JϕKM and w ∈ r(w). But then M,w |= ϕ.\n• Validity of (RB): |= r :ϕ → (Br → Bϕ).\nM,w |= r :ϕ and M,w |= Br together imply that r(w) ⊆ JϕKM and r ◦ ∈ N(w). But then JϕKM ∈ N(w) by (rb) and hence M,w |= Bϕ.\nSo RBB is sound. For completeness, we prove that RBB 0 θ implies there exists a pointed model (Mc,Γ θ 1) satisfying Mc,Γ θ 1 6|= θ. We use a canonical model construction to build the model Mc = (W, [·], N, V ) as follows. First, to say that a set S of formulas is consistent means that for no finite S′ ⊆ S do we have RBB ⊢ ( ∧\nS′) → ⊥, where ⊥ is a fixed contradiction such as p ∧ ¬p. To say a set of formulas is maximal consistent means that it is consistent and adding any formula not already present will result in a set that is inconsistent (i.e., not consistent). Let M bet the set of all maximal consistent\nsets of formulas. By a standard Lindenbaum construction, it follows that {¬θ} can be extended to some Γθ ∈ M and therefore M is not empty. We define W := M ×{1, 2} and will write (Γ, i) ∈ W in the abbreviated form Γi. Since M is nonempty, W is nonempty. For each reason r ∈ R and Γ ∈ M , define the set\nΓr := {ϕ ∈ F | r :ϕ ∈ Γ}\nof r-supported formulas in Γ. We then define [r] by setting\nr(Γi) := {∆j ∈ W | Γ r ⊆ ∆ & (¬r ∈ Γ ⇒ ∆j 6= Γi)} .\nThis way, a world ∆j is r-accessible from Γi iff ∆j contains all formulas ϕ that are r-supported at Γi (as per membership of r :ϕ in Γ), unless of course ∆j = Γi and reflexivity is forbidden by ¬r ∈ Γ. For each formula ϕ ∈ F , define\nW (ϕ) := {Γi ∈ W | ϕ ∈ Γ}\nto be the set of worlds defined by the formula ϕ. Then let\nN+ := {X ⊆ W | ∀ϕ ∈ F : X 6= W (ϕ)}\nbe the set of worlds not definable by any formula. For each Γi ∈ W , we define\nN+(Γi) := {X ∈ N + | ∃Br ∈ Γ : r(Γi) ⊆ X} .\nIntuitively, this is the set of non–formula-definable neighborhoods X for which the agent believes there is a reason that supports X. The neighborhood function N is then defined by\nN(Γi) := {X ⊆ W | ∃Bϕ ∈ Γ : X = W (ϕ)} ∪N +(Γi) .\nTherefore, an agent believes a neighborhood X iff the agent believes some formula ϕ that defines X or, if X is non–formula-definable, the agent believes there is a reason supporting X. Finally, we define the valuation by\nV (Γi) := {p ∈ P | p ∈ Γ} .\nThis defines Mc. We prove the following Consistency Lemma: for each r ∈ R and Γi ∈ W , if Br ∈ Γ, then Γ\nr is consistent. Proceeding, assume Br ∈ Γ and hence that ¬B¬r ∈ Γ by (D) and maximal consistency. Toward a contradiction, suppose Γr is not consistent. Then there exists a finite S ⊆ Γr such that ⊢ ( ∧ S) → ⊥. Hence ⊢ ( ∧\nχ∈S r :χ) → r :⊥ by modal reasoning. Applying maximal consistency and the fact that S ⊆ Γr, we obtain r :⊥ ∈ Γ. By maximal consistency and the fact that ⊢ r :⊥ → r :ϕ for any ϕ, we obtain r :¬r ∈ Γ. Since Br ∈ Γ, it follows from r :¬r ∈ Γ by (RB) and maximal consistency that B¬r ∈ Γ. Since ¬B¬r ∈ Γ, it follows that Γ is not consistent, a contradiction. Conclusion: Γr is consistent.\nWe now prove that Mc satisfies the properties (pr), (d), and (rb).\n• Mc satisfies (pr): if x ∈ P ∩R, then x ∈ V (Γi) if and only if Γi ∈ x(Γi).\nSo assume x ∈ V (Γi). This means x ∈ Γ. But then we have ¬x /∈ Γ by the consistency of Γ. Further, since x ∈ Γ, it follows by (A) and the maximal consistency of Γ that Γx ⊆ Γ. But ¬x /∈ Γ and Γx ⊆ Γ together imply Γi ∈ x(Γi), which completes the argument for this direction. For the converse direction, if Γi ∈ x(Γi), then it follows by the definition of x(Γi) that ¬x /∈ Γ. So x ∈ Γ by the maximal consistency of Γ. But then we have x ∈ V (Γi) by the definition of V .\n• Mc satisfies (d): if X ∈ N(Γi), then X ′ := W −X /∈ N(Γi). There are two cases to consider.\nFirst case for (d): assume X ∈ N(Γi) − N +(Γi). It follows that there exists Bϕ ∈ Γ such that X = W (ϕ). By (D) and the maximal consistency of Γ, we have ¬B¬ϕ ∈ Γ. Toward a contradiction, assume X ′ ∈ N(Γi). Since X = W (ϕ), we have X\n′ = W (¬ϕ) by maximal consistency and therefore that X ′ /∈ N+. Hence X ′ ∈ N(Γi) − N\n+(Γi), which means there exists Bψ ∈ Γ such that X ′ = W (ψ). It follows that ⊢ ψ ↔ ¬ϕ, since otherwise {ψ,ϕ} could be extended to some ∆ ∈ M satisfying ∆j ∈ W (ψ) = X\n′ and ∆j ∈ W (ϕ) = X or {¬ψ,¬ϕ} could be extended to some Ω ∈ M satisfying Ωk ∈ W−W (ψ) = X and Ωk ∈ W−W (ϕ) = X\n′, but both situations are impossible because X ′ ∩ X = ∅. Hence ⊢ ψ ↔ ¬ϕ. Applying (E), we obtain ⊢ Bψ ↔ B¬ϕ and therefore that B¬ϕ ∈ Γ, contradicting the consistency of Γ. Conclusion: X ′ /∈ N(Γi).\nSecond case for (d): assume X ∈ N+(Γi). This means there exists Br ∈ Γ such that r(Γi) ⊆ X. Since X ∈ N+, it follows that X ′ ∈ N+ as well. So, toward a contradiction, assume X ′ ∈ N+(Γi). Then we have Br ′ ∈ Γ such that r′(Γi) ⊆ X ′, and hence r′(Γi) ∩ r(Γi) = ∅. If Γr ∪ Γr ′ were consistent, then we could extend this set to some ∆ ∈ M . Taking j 6= i, it would follow that Γr ⊆ ∆ and Γr ′ ⊆ ∆ and that ∆j 6= Γi. Hence we would have that ∆j ∈ r ′(Γi) ∩ r(Γi) = ∅, an impossibility. So Γ r ∪ Γr ′ is not consistent. Applying the Consistency Lemma and the fact that Br ∈ Γ and Br′ ∈ Γ, each of Γr and Γr ′ is consistent, so it follows from the inconsistency of Γr ∪ Γr ′ that there exists a finite S ⊆ Γr and some ϕ ∈ Γr ′ such that ⊢ ( ∧ S) → ¬ϕ. But then we have ⊢ ( ∧\nχ∈S r :χ) → r :¬ϕ by modal reasoning. Since S ⊆ Γr, it follows by maximal consistency that r :¬ϕ ∈ Γ. Applying our assumption Br ∈ Γ, it follows by (RB) and maximal consistency that B¬ϕ ∈ Γ. But ϕ ∈ Γr ′ and hence r′ :ϕ ∈ Γ. Since Br′ ∈ Γ, it follows by (RB) and maximal consistency that Bϕ ∈ Γ and therefore that ¬B¬ϕ ∈ Γ by (D) and maximal consistency. But then we have shown that Γ is inconsistent, a contradiction. Conclusion: X ′ /∈ N+(Γi).\n• Mc satisfies (rb): if r(Γi) ⊆ X and r ◦ ∈ N(Γi), then X ∈ N(Γi).\nAssume r(Γi) ⊆ X and r ◦ ∈ N(Γi). First, it follows by an easy argument that r ◦ = W (r). Therefore r◦ /∈ N+. So from r◦ ∈ N(Γi), it follows that there exists Bϕ ∈ Γ such that r◦ = W (ϕ). Since r◦ = W (r), it follows that ⊢ ϕ ↔ r. Applying (E), ⊢ Bϕ ↔ Br. By the maximal consistency of Γ, we have Br ∈ Γ. If X ∈ N+, then since we have shown that Br ∈ Γ and since we assumed that r(Γi) ⊆ X, it follows that X ∈ N\n+(Γi) ⊆ N(Γi). So assume X /∈ N+, which implies there exists ψ such that X = W (ψ). From r(Γi) ⊆ X = W (ψ) and j 6= i, it follows that for each ∆j ∈ W satisfying Γ\nr ⊆ ∆, we have ψ ∈ ∆. If Γr ∪ {¬ψ} were consistent, then we could extend this set to Ω ∈ M such that Γr ⊆ Ω, j 6= i, Ωj ∈ W , and ψ /∈ Ω, a contradiction. So from the inconsistency of Γr ∪ {¬ψ}, the fact that Br ∈ Γ, and the consistency of Γr (by way of the Consistency Lemma), it follows that there exists a finite S ⊆ Γr such that ⊢ ( ∧ S) → ψ and hence ⊢ ( ∧\nχ∈S r :χ) → r :ψ by modal reasoning. Since S ⊆ Γr, it follows by maximal consistency that r :ψ ∈ Γ. But since Br ∈ Γ, it follows by (RB) and maximal consistency that Bψ ∈ Γ and hence W (ψ) = X ∈ N(Γi).\nTo complete the argument, it suffices to prove the Truth Lemma: for each formula ϕ ∈ F and world Γi ∈ W , we have ϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= ϕ. The proof is by induction on the construction of formulas, and the arguments for the base and Boolean inductive step cases are standard, so we only consider the remaining non-Boolean inductive step cases.\n• Inductive step: r ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= r.\nIf r ∈ Γ, then it follows by (A) and maximal consistency that Γr ⊆ Γ and therefore that Γi ∈ r(Γi). But this is what it means to have Mc,Γi |= r.\nConversely, if Mc,Γi |= r, then we have Γi ∈ r(Γi). By the definition of N(Γi), we have ¬r /∈ Γ and therefore r ∈ Γ by maximal consistency.\n• Inductive step: r :ϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= r :ϕ.\nIf r :ϕ ∈ Γ, then we have r(Γi) ⊆ W (ϕ). By the induction hypothesis, r(Γi) ⊆ JϕKMc . But this is what it means to have Mc, w |= r :ϕ.\nConversely, if Mc, w |= r :ϕ, then we have r(Γi) ⊆ JϕKMc and hence r(Γi) ⊆ W (ϕ) by the induction hypothesis. Toward a contradiction, assume ¬r :ϕ ∈ Γ. It follows that Γr ∪ {¬ϕ} is consistent, for otherwise there would exist a finite S ⊆ Γr such that ⊢ ( ∧\nS) → ϕ, hence ⊢ ( ∧\nχ∈S r :χ) → r :ϕ by modal reasoning, and therefore r :ϕ ∈ Γ, which is impossible because it would follow by the assumption ¬r :ϕ ∈ Γ that Γ is inconsistent. So we may extend the consistent set Γr ∪ {¬ϕ} to some ∆ ∈ M . Taking j 6= i, it follows that ∆j /∈ W (ϕ) and ∆j ∈ r(Γi), which contradicts r(Γi) ⊆ W (ϕ). So our assumption that ¬r :ϕ ∈ Γ is incorrect; what we actually have is that ¬r :ϕ /∈ Γ and therefore that r :ϕ ∈ Γ by maximal consistency.\n• Inductive step: Bϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= Bϕ.\nIf Bϕ ∈ Γ, then it follows by the definition of N(Γi) that W (ϕ) ∈ N(Γi). By the induction hypothesis, W (ϕ) = JϕKMc, and hence JϕKMc ∈ N(Γi). But this is what it means to have Mc,Γi |= Bϕ.\nConversely, if Mc, w |= Bϕ, then we have JϕKMc ∈ N(Γi) and therefore that W (ϕ) ∈ N(Γi) by the induction hypothesis. Since W (ϕ) /∈ N+, it follows that there exists Bψ ∈ Γ such that W (ψ) = W (ϕ). From this we have that ⊢ ψ ↔ ϕ, for otherwise {ψ,¬ϕ} could be extended to ∆ ∈ M satisfying ∆i ∈ W (ψ)−W (ϕ) or {¬ψ,ϕ} could be extended to Ω ∈ M satisfying Ωi ∈ W (ϕ)−W (ψ), but both contradict W (ϕ) = W (ψ). Applying (E), we have ⊢ Bϕ ↔ Bϕ and therefore it follows by maximal consistency that Bϕ ∈ Γ.\nThis completes the proof of the Truth Lemma. By this lemma and the fact that ¬θ ∈ Γθ, we have Mc,Γ θ 1 6|= θ. Completeness follows.\nA.5 RBBσ and RBB + σ Soundness and Completeness\nRecalling the semantics for RBBσ and for RBB + σ from §A.2, we prove the following theorem.\nTheorem A.2 (RBBσ and RBB + σ Soundness and Completeness). Assume R contains the symbol σ. For each ϕ ∈ F :\nRBBσ ⊢ ϕ iff |=σ ϕ and RBB+σ ⊢ ϕ iff |= + σ ϕ .\nSoundness for RBBσ and for RBB + σ are as for RBB (Theorem A.1) except that we must check\nsoundness of the additional axioms. We consider each in turn.\n• Validity of (MA): |=σ σ → (Br → r) and |= + σ σ → (Br → r).\nAssume M,w |=σ σ and M,w |=σ Br. This means w ∈ σ(w) and r ◦ ∈ N(w), from which it follows by (ma) that w ∈ r(w). But then M,w |=σ r. The argument for the satisfaction operator |=+σ is the same.\n• Validity of (MB): |=σ Bσ and |= + σ Bσ.\nGiven (M,w), we have σ◦ ∈ N(w) by (mb). So M,w |=σ Bσ and M,w |= + σ Bσ.\n• Validity of (MR): |=σ r :ϕ → (Br → σ :ϕ) and |= + σ r :ϕ → (Br → σ :ϕ).\nAssume M,w |=σ r :ϕ and M,w |=σ Br. Then r(w) ⊆ JϕKM and r ◦ ∈ N(w). Applying (mr), it follows that σ(w) ⊆ JϕKM . But then M,w |=σ σ :ϕ. The argument for the satisfaction operator |=+σ is the same.\n• Validity of (MT): |=+σ Bϕ → σ :ϕ.\nAssume M,w |=+σ Bϕ. This means JϕKM ∈ N(w). Applying (mt), we have σ(w) ⊆ JϕKM . But this is what it means to have M,w |=+σ σ :ϕ.\nSo RBBσ and RBB + σ are sound. Completeness for RBBσ and for RBB + σ is as for RBB (Theorem A.1) except that provability is taken with respect to the theory in question and we must show that Mc satisfies the additional properties required of models of this theory (§A.2).\n• Mc satisfies (ma) for RBBσ and for RBB + σ : Γi ∈ σ(Γi) and r ◦ ∈ N(Γi) together imply that Γi ∈ r(Γi).\nAssume Γi ∈ σ(Γi) and r ◦ ∈ N(w). As in the proof that Mc satisfies (rb) from Theorem A.1, it follows from r◦ ∈ N(Γi) that Br ∈ Γ. Applying the definition of σ(Γi) to our assumption Γi ∈ σ(Γi), it follows that ¬σ /∈ Γ and therefore σ ∈ Γ by maximal consistency. Since σ ∈ Γ and Br ∈ Γ, we have by (MA) and maximal consistency that r ∈ Γ. But then Γr ⊆ Γ by (A) and maximal consistency. Since it follows from r ∈ Γ by maximal consistency that ¬r /∈ Γ and we have shown that Γr ⊆ Γ, it follows by the definition of r(Γi) that Γi ∈ r(Γi).\n• Mc satisfies (mb) for RBBσ and for RBB + σ : σ ◦ ∈ N(Γi).\nWe have Bσ ∈ Γ by (MB). Hence σ◦ = W (σ) ∈ N(Γi).\n• Mc satisfies (mr) for RBBσ and for RBB + σ : r(Γi) ⊆ X and r ◦ ∈ N(Γi) together imply that σ(Γi) ⊆ X.\nAssume r(Γi) ⊆ X and r ◦ ∈ N(Γi). As in the proof that Mc satisfies (rb) from Theorem A.1, it follows from r◦ ∈ N(Γi) that Br ∈ Γ. Applying (MR), classical reasoning, and maximal consistency, we have r :ϕ → σ :ϕ for each formula ϕ in the language. So if for some ∆ ∈ M we have Γσ ⊆ ∆ and ϕ ∈ Γr, then r :ϕ ∈ Γ by the definition of Γr, hence σ :ϕ ∈ Γ by maximal consistency and the fact that r :ϕ → σ :ϕ ∈ Γ, hence ϕ ∈ Γσ by the defintion of Γσ, and therefore ϕ ∈ ∆ by the assumption Γσ ⊆ ∆. That is, given ∆ ∈ M , we have Γσ ⊆ ∆ implies Γr ⊆ ∆. So if we are given ∆j ∈ σ(Γi), then we have Γ\nσ ⊆ ∆ and therefore that Γr ⊆ ∆. Now if ∆j 6= Γi, then we have ∆j ∈ r(Γi) by the definition of r(Γi). And if ∆j = Γi and therefore ¬σ /∈ Γ by the definition of σ(Γi), it follows by maximal consistency that σ ∈ Γ; hence r ∈ Γ by Br ∈ Γ, (MA), and maximal consistency; hence ¬r /∈ Γ by maximal consistency; and therefore we still have ∆j ∈ r(Γi) by the definition of r(Γi). So we have shown that σ(Γi) ⊆ r(Γi). Since r(Γi) ⊆ X, it follows that σ(Γi) ⊆ X.\n• Mc satisfies (mt) for RBB + σ : X ∈ N(Γi) implies σ(Γi) ⊆ X.\nAssume X ∈ N(Γi). There are two cases to consider. First case: if X ∈ N +(Γi), then there exists Br ∈ Γ such that r(Γi) ⊆ X. But we proved in the above argument for (mr) that Br ∈ Γ and r(Γi) ⊆ X together imply that σ(Γi) ⊆ r(Γi) ⊆ X. Second case: X ∈ N(Γi) −N\n+(Γi). Then there exists Bϕ ∈ Γ such that W (ϕ) = X. By (MT) and maximal consistency, σ :ϕ ∈ Γ. Hence σ(Γi) ⊆ W (ϕ) = X.\nA.6 Lemmas for QRBB Completeness\nThe results of this section will be used in §A.7 to prove completeness for QRBB. All provability in this section is taken with respect to QRBB.\nLemma A.3. QRBB satisfies the following:\n• Distributivity : ⊢ (∀r)(ϕ → ψ) → ((∀r)ϕ → (∀r)ψ);\n• the Distribution Rule: ⊢ ϕ → ψ implies ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → (∀r)ψ;\n• the Renaming Rule: if s has no occurrence in ϕ, then\n⊢ (∀r)ϕ ↔ (∀s)ϕ[s/r] and ⊢ (∃r)ϕ ↔ (∃s)ϕ[s/r] ;\n• the Equivalence Rule: ⊢ ϕ ↔ ϕ′ implies\n⊢ (∀r)ϕ ↔ (∀r)ϕ′ and ⊢ (∃r)ϕ ↔ (∃r)ϕ′ .\nProof. For Distributivity:\n1. ⊢ (∀r)(ϕ → ψ) → (ϕ → ψ) (UI)\n2. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → ϕ (UI)\n3. ⊢ ((∀r)(ϕ → ψ) ∧ (∀r)ϕ) → ψ by 1, 2\n4. ⊢ (∀r)[((∀r)(ϕ → ψ) ∧ (∀r)ϕ) → ψ] by 3, (Gen)\n5. ⊢ ((∀r)(ϕ → ψ) ∧ (∀r)ϕ) → (∀r)ψ by 4, (UD), (MP)\n6. ⊢ (∀r)(ϕ → ψ) → ((∀r)ϕ → (∀r)ψ) by 5\nFor the Distribution Rule:\n1. ⊢ ϕ → ψ assumption\n2. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → ϕ (UI)\n3. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → ψ by 1, 2\n4. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → (∀r)ψ by 3, (UD), (MP).\nFor the Renaming Rule: if s has no occurrence in ϕ, then\n1. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → ϕ[s/r] (UI)\n2. ⊢ (∀s)((∀r)ϕ → ϕ[s/r]) by 1, (Gen)\n3. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → (∀s)ϕ[s/r] by 2, (UD), (MP)\nFor the Equivalence Rule:\n1. ⊢ ϕ ↔ ϕ′ assumption\n2. ⊢ ϕ → ϕ′ by 1\n3. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ → (∀r)ϕ′ by 2, Distribution Rule\n4. ⊢ ϕ′ → ϕ by 1\n5. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ′ → (∀r)ϕ by 4, Distribution Rule\n6. ⊢ (∀r)ϕ ↔ (∀r)ϕ′ by 3, 5 — our first result\n7. ⊢ ¬ϕ ↔ ¬ϕ′ by 1\n8. ⊢ (∀r)¬ϕ ↔ (∀r)¬ϕ′ from 7 by an argument like 1–6\n9. ⊢ ¬(∀r)¬ϕ ↔ ¬(∀r)¬ϕ′ by 8\n10. ⊢ (∃r)ϕ ↔ (∃r)ϕ′ by 9\nLemma A.4.

We have:\n• QRBB is sound: QRBB ⊢ ϕ implies |= ϕ for each ϕ ∈ F ∀; and\n• if R is at least countably infinite, then QRBB is sound and complete: for each ϕ ∈ F ∀,\nQRBB ⊢ ϕ iff |= ϕ .\nSoundness is by induction on the length of derivation. Most cases are addressed in the proof of Theorem A.1. We only address the remaining cases.\n• Validity of (UD): |= (∀r)(ϕ → ψ) → (ϕ → (∀r)ψ), where r is not free in ϕ.\nAssumeM,w |= (∀r)(ϕ → ψ) andM,w |= ϕ. From the former, we have M,w |= (ϕ → ψ)[s/r] for each s free for r in ϕ → ψ. Since r is not free in ϕ, it follows that M,w |= ϕ → ψ[s/r] for each s free for r in ψ. By our assumption M,w |= ϕ, it follows that M,w |= ψ[s/r] for each s free for r in ψ. That is, M,w |= (∀r)ψ.\n• Validity of (UI): |= (∀r)ϕ → ϕ[s/r], where s is free for r in ϕ.\nBy the definition of satisfaction.\n• Validity of (EP) and (EN): |= r = r and |= ¬(r = s), where r and s are different.\nBy the definition of satisfaction.\n• (Gen) preserves validity: |= ϕ implies |= (∀r)ϕ.\nIf 6|= (∀r)ϕ, then there exists (M,w) and s free for r in ϕ such that M,w 6|= ϕ[s/r]. Given that M = (W, [·], N, V ), define the model M ′ = (W, [·]′, N, V ) by setting\n[t]′ :=\n{\n[s] if t = r,\n[t] otherwise.\nIt follows that rM ′ (w) = sM (w) and tM ′ (w) = tM (w) for all t 6= r. By the usual arguments about the preservation of truth of formulas under the renaming of quantified variables and their corresponding bound occurrences, we may assume without loss of generality that every occurrence of r in ϕ is free. But then it is easy to see that we haveM,w 6|= ϕ[s/r] iffM ′, w 6|= ϕ. After all, ϕ and ϕ[s/r] differ only in the occurrences of r in ϕ that are replaced by s in ϕ[s/r], and M ′ interprets all such occurrences of r just as M interprets the corresponding occurrences of s. And all other occurrences of symbols in ϕ are the same as they are in ϕ[s/r], they are syntactically different than r, and M ′ and M interpret them in the same way. Conclusion: 6|= ϕ.\nSo QRBB is sound. For completeness, we adapt the standard Henkin-style construction in [16, §3.1] to the present setting. To begin, our language F ∀ depends on two parameters: a nonempty set R of reasons and a nonempty set P of propositional letters. We shall keep P fixed but consider different options for R.\nAs such, it will be convenient to write L(R) to denote the set of formulas with quantifiers that we can form using R 6= ∅ as our set of reasons. By convention in this proof, we restrict all derivation to be with respect to QRBB. Also, we shall assume for the remainder of the argument that R is at least countably infinite.\nTo say that a set Γ ⊆ L(R) is consistent means that for no finite Γ′ ⊆ Γ is it the case that ⊢ ( ∧\nΓ′) → ⊥. To say that Γ ⊆ L(R) is maximal L(R)-consistent means that Γ is consistent and adding to Γ any formula of L(R) not already present would produce an inconsistent set.\nFor the purposes of the present proof, a theory in the language L(R) is a set T ⊆ L(R) of formulas in L(R) satisfying the following properties:\n• Closure under theorems: if ϕ ∈ L(R) and ⊢ ϕ, then ϕ ∈ T ; and\n• Closure under (MP): if ϕ → ψ ∈ T and ϕ ∈ T , then ψ ∈ T .\nGiven Γ ⊆ L(R), let TR(Γ) be the set of all theories in L(R) that contain Γ. The intersection of a collection of theories in L(R) is also a theory in L(R). Hence for each Γ ⊆ L(R), we may define the theory\nTR(Γ) := ⋂ TR(Γ)\ncalled the theory in L(R) generated by Γ. An L(R)-proof from Γ is a finite nonempty sequence 〈ϕ1, . . . , ϕn〉 of formulas in L(R) such that for each ϕi in the sequence, we have one of the following: ϕi ∈ Γ, QRBB ⊢ ϕi, or there exist ϕj and ϕk from earlier in the sequence (i.e., j < i and k < i) such that ϕi follows by (MP) from ϕj and ϕk (i.e., ϕk = ϕj → ϕi). To say that an L(R)-proof from Γ is of ϕ, means that ϕ is the last formula in the sequence. We write Γ ⊢R ϕ to mean that there exists an L(R)-proof of ϕ from Γ. Notation: in writing the set to the left of the turnstile ⊢R, we may use a comma to denote set-theoretic union, we may identify an individual formula with the singleton set containing the formula in question, and we may omit any set-indicating notation if the set is empty. We state without proof the following results, grouped together under the name Simple Lemma:\n• Γ ⊢R ϕ iff ϕ ∈ TR(Γ);\n• Γ ⊢R ϕ iff TR(Γ) ⊢R ϕ;\n• Γ ⊢R ϕ iff there exists a Γ ′ ⊆ Γ such that Γ′ ⊢R ϕ;\n• Γ ⊢R ϕ iff there exists a finite Γ ′ ⊆ Γ such that Γ′ ⊢R ϕ;\n• if Γ is finite, then Γ′ ⊢R ϕ iff ∧ Γ′ ⊢R ϕ, where ∧ Γ′ := ∧ χ∈Γ′ χ; and\n• ⊢R ϕ iff QRBB ⊢ ϕ.\nGenerally the Simple Lemma will be used only tacitly. Given a theory T in L(R) and a theory T ′ in L(R′), to say that T ′ is an extension of T means that T ⊆ T ′. To say that T ′ is a conservative extension of T means that T ′ ∩ L(R) = T . To say that a theory T in L(R) is Henkin means that for each closed formula (i.e., containing no free variables) of the form ¬(∀r)ϕ ∈ L(R), there exists a reason rϕ ∈ R called a witness (or Henkin constant) for ¬(∀r)ϕ for which we have\n(¬(∀r)ϕ → ¬ϕ[rϕ/r]) ∈ T .\nGiven a theory T in L(R), let R∗ be the set obtained from R by adding for each closed ¬(∀r)ϕ ∈ L(R) a new reason rϕ. To be clear: there is a bijection between the set of closed formulas ¬(∀r)ϕ ∈ L(R) and the set R∗ −R. We define the set\nH(R) := {¬(∀r)ϕ → ¬ϕ[rϕ/r] | ¬(∀r)ϕ ∈ L(R) is closed }\nof Henkin axioms in L(R) and let T ∗ := TR∗(T ∪ H(R)) be the theory in L(R ∗) generated by T ∪H(R).\nLemma A.6 (Constants). Assume R is at least countably infinite and R ⊆ R′. If Γ∪{ϕ} ⊆ L(R), then Γ ⊢R′ ϕ iff Γ ⊢R ϕ.\nProof. The right-to-left direction is immediate (since R ⊆ R′), so we prove only the left-to-right direction. Proceeding, assume Γ ∪ {ϕ} ⊆ L(R) and Γ ⊢R′ ϕ; that is, there exists an L(R\n′)-proof π′ = 〈ψ′1, . . . , ψ ′ n〉 of ϕ from Γ. Let r ′ 1, . . . , r ′ m be a non-repeating list of all reasons in R\n′ −R that appear in π′. Since R is at least countably infinite and π′ is finite, we may choose a non-repeating list r1, . . . , rm of reasons in R that do not appear anywhere in π\n′. Such a list exists because R is at least countably infinite. Form π := 〈ψ1, . . . , ψn〉 by defining ψi as the formula obtained from ψ ′ i by replacing all occurrences of r′1, . . . , r ′ m by r1, . . . , rm (respectively). Since Γ∪{ϕ} ⊆ L(R), one may verify that π is an L(R)-proof of ϕ from Γ (i.e., formulas in Γ ⊆ L(R) are left unchanged, QRBBtheorems in L(R′) are mapped to QRBB-theorems in L(R), formulas in L(R′) obtained via (MP) in π′ are mapped to formulas in L(R) obtained via (MP) in π, and ϕ ∈ L(R) is left unchanged). Hence Γ ⊢R ϕ.\nLemma A.7 (Deduction). For each R, we have:\nΓ ∪ {ϕ} ⊢R ψ iff Γ ⊢R ϕ → ψ .\nProof. The right-to-left direction is easy, so we only address the left-to-right direction. Proceeding, assume Γ ∪ {ϕ} ⊢R ψ, which implies there exists an L(R)-proof 〈χ1, . . . , χn〉 of ψ from Γ ∪ {ϕ}. It suffices for us to prove by induction on i ≤ n that Γ ⊢R ϕ → χi.\nIn the base case, i = 1 and therefore either ⊢ χi or χi ∈ Γ ∪ {ϕ}. If ⊢ χi, then Γ ⊢R χi. If χi ∈ Γ ∪ {ϕ}, then either χi ∈ Γ or χi = ϕ. If χi = ϕ, then since ⊢ ϕ → ϕ by (CL), we have Γ ⊢R ϕ → ϕ. So suppose χi ∈ Γ. Hence Γ ⊢R χi. Since for ǫi := χi → (ϕ → χi) we have ⊢ ǫi by (CL), we have Γ ⊢R ǫi and therefore Γ ⊢R ϕ → χi.\nFor the induction step (i > 1), we have that ⊢ χi, that χi ∈ Γ ∪ {ϕ}, or that χi follows by (MP) from χk and χk → χi appearing earlier in the L(R)-proof. The argument for the first two possibilities is as in the base case. So assume the third possibility obtains. By the induction hypothesis, we have Γ ⊢R ϕ → χk and Γ ⊢R ϕ → (χk → χi) Let θi be the classical tautology\nθi := (ϕ → (χk → χi)) → ((ϕ → χk) → (ϕ → χi)) .\nWe have ⊢ θi by (CL) and hence Γ ⊢R θi. But then Γ ⊢R ϕ → χi by (MP).\nWe remark that the version of Lemma A.7 for the QRBB consequence relation ⊢ does not hold in general. For example, we have r :ϕ ⊢ (∀r)(r :ϕ) and yet 0 r :ϕ → (∀r)(r :ϕ). As another example, we have p ⊢ r : p and yet 0 p → r : p. Lemma A.7 does not fail in similar ways because the consequence relation given by the R-specific turnstile ⊢R gives rise to a notion of proof (i.e., the L(R)-proof) that forbids the direct use of any QRBB rule other than (MP).\nLemma A.8 (Fresh Variable). If s ∈ R does not occur in any formula in Γ ∪ {ϕ} ⊆ L(R), then, letting Γ[s/r] := {χ[s/r] | χ ∈ Γ}, we have:\n1. ⊢ ϕ iff ⊢ ϕ[s/r], and\n2. Γ ⊢R ϕ iff Γ[s/r] ⊢R ϕ[s/r].\nProof. 1 follows by induction on the length of QRBB derivations. 2 follows by induction on the length of L(R)-proofs and makes use of 1.\nLemma A.9 (Conservativity). Assume R is at least countably infinite. If T is a theory in L(R), then T ∗ is a conservative extension of T .\nProof. We prove that for each ϕ ∈ L(R), we have T ∗ ⊢R∗ ϕ iff T ⊢R ϕ. The right-to-left direction is immediate, so we only need prove the left-to-right direction. Proceeding, if ϕ ∈ L(R), then we have T ∗ ⊢R∗ ϕ iff there exists a finite set H ⊆ H(R) of Henkin axioms satisfying T,H ⊢R∗ ϕ. So it suffices for us to prove by induction on the finite cardinality of H ⊆ H(R) that T,H ⊢R∗ ϕ implies T ⊢R ϕ. The base case (where H = ∅) follows by Lemma A.6, so we proceed directly to the induction step. That is, we assume that the result holds for H ⊆ H(R) having |H| = n and we prove the result holds for H ⊆ H(R) having |H| = n + 1. Proceeding, take H ⊆ H(R) satisfying |H| = n+ 1, choose a Henkin axiom h ∈ H with\nh = ¬(∀r)ψ → ¬ψ[rψ/r] ,\nand define H ′ := H − {h} so that H = H ′ ∪ {h} and |H ′| = n. Now assume T,H ⊢R∗ ϕ with ϕ ∈ L(R), and hence T,H ′, h ⊢R∗ ϕ. It follows that there is a finite T\n′ ⊆ T such that T ′,H ′, h ⊢R∗ ϕ. Let s ∈ R be a variable not occuring in any formula in the finite set T ′ ∪H ′ ∪ {h, ϕ}. Such s exists because R is at least countably infinite. Define\nh′ := ¬(∀r)ψ → ¬ψ[s/r] .\nThen, omitting mention of instances of classical reasoning, we have:\nT ′,H ′, h ⊢R∗ ϕ (derived above) T ′,H ′, h′ ⊢R∗ ϕ Lemma A.8 ⊢R∗ ∧ (T ′ ∪H ′) → (h′ → ϕ) Lemma A.7 ⊢ ∧ (T ′ ∪H ′) → (h′ → ϕ) Simple Lemma\n⊢ (∀s)( ∧ (T ′ ∪H ′) → (h′ → ϕ)) (Gen)\n⊢ ∧ (T ′ ∪H ′) → (∀s)(h′ → ϕ) (UD), no s in T ′ ∪H ′\n⊢R∗ ∧ (T ′ ∪H ′) → (∀s)(h′ → ϕ) Simple Lemma T ′,H ′ ⊢R∗ (∀s)(h ′ → ϕ) Lemma A.7 T ′,H ′ ⊢R∗ (∀s)((¬(∀r)ψ → ¬ψ[s/r]) → ϕ) write out h ′"

Applying the induction hypothesis, T ⊢R ϕ.\nNow, given a theory T in L(R), define:\nT0 = T Ti+1 = (Ti)\n∗ for i ∈ ω Tω = ⋃ i∈ω Ti\nR0 = R Ri+1 = (Ri)\n∗ for i ∈ ω Rω = ⋃ i∈ω Ri\nLemma A.10 (Henkin). Let R be at least countably infinite and T be a theory in L(R). Then Tω is a Henkin theory that is a conservative extension of T .\nProof. Take a closed ¬(∀r)ϕ ∈ L(Rω). Then there exists i ∈ ω such that ¬(∀r)ϕ ∈ L(Ri). But then there is a witness rϕ ∈ L(Ri+1) ⊆ L(Rω) such that\n¬(∀r)ϕ → ¬ϕ[rϕ/r] ∈ Ti+1 ⊆ Tω .\nSo Tω is a Henkin theory. By induction on i ∈ ω, we prove that Ti is a conservative extension of T . Base case: T0 = T and the result is immediate. Induction step: Ti+1 is a conservative extension of Ti by Lemma A.9; that is, Ti+1 ∩ L(Ri) = Ti. By the induction hypothesis, Ti ∩ L(R) = T . But then, since L(R) ⊆ L(Rj) ⊆ L(Rk) if j < k, we have\nTi+1 ∩ L(R) = (Ti+1 ∩ L(Ri)) ∩ L(R) = Ti ∩ L(R) = T .\nSo each Ti is a conservative extension of T . But then\nTω ∩ L(R) = ( ⋃ i∈ω Ti) ∩ L(R) = ⋃ i∈ω(Ti ∩ L(R)) = T ,\nwhich shows that Tω is a conservative extension of T .\nBy the usual Lindenbaum argument (using Zorn’s Lemma) [16, §3.1], for each R, any consistent set in L(R) may be extended to a maximal L(R)-consistent set. Hence for a consistent theory T in L(R), the theory Tω in L(Rω) is consistent and may be extended to a maximal L(Rω)-consistent set T ′ω. This set is a theory in L(Rω). Further, this theory is Henkin because Tω ⊆ T ′ ω, both theories are in the same language, Tω is Henkin by Lemma A.10, and any extension of a Henkin theory within the same language is still Henkin (because all Henkin axioms are already present).\nTo prove completeness of QRBB, we take θ such that QRBB 0 θ. We construct a structure Mc = (W, [·], N, V ) as in the proof of Theorem A.1 except that our set of worlds W is defined differently. First, let M0 be the set of all maximal L(R)-consistent sets; each such set is a theory in L(R). For each theory T ∈ M0, define Mω(T ) to be the set of all maximal L(Rω)-consistent extensions of Tω. As we have seen, each member of Mω(T ) is a maximal L(Rω)-consistent Henkin theory that is conservative over T (Lemma A.10). Define the set\nM := ⋃\nT∈M0 Mω(T )\nwhose members are maximal L(Rω)-consistent extensions of Tω for some T ∈ M0. It follows that {¬θ} can be extended to a T θ ∈ M0 and hence neither Mω(T\nθ) nor M is empty. We define W := M × {1, 2} and write (Γ, i) ∈ W in the abbreviated form Γi. Since M is nonempty, W is nonempty. The remaining components of Mc are defined as in the proof of Theorem A.1 except that all language-specific aspects of definitions are extended to the larger language L(Rω).\nThe proof that Mc satisfies (pr), (d), and (rb) is as in the proof of Theorem A.1. So all that remains is to prove the Truth Lemma: for each formula ϕ ∈ L(Rω) and world Γi ∈ W , we have ϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= ϕ. The proof is by induction on the construction of formulas. The arguments for all but two cases are as in the proof of Theorem A.1. All that remains are the equality and quantifier inductive step cases.\n• Inductive step: (s = r) ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= s = r.\nBy (EP) and (EN), we have (s = r) ∈ Γ iff s = r. But the latter holds iff Mc,Γi |= s = r.\n• Inductive step: (∀r)ϕ ∈ Γ iff Mc,Γi |= (∀r)ϕ.\nIf (∀r)ϕ ∈ Γ, then it follows by maximal L(Rω)-consistency and (UI) that ϕ[s/r] ∈ Γ for each s ∈ Rω that is free for r in ϕ. By the induction hypothesis, we have Mc,Γi |= ϕ[s/r] for each such s ∈ R. But this is what it means to have Mc,Γi |= (∀r)ϕ.\nConversely, if Mc,Γi |= (∀r)ϕ, then it follows that Mc,Γi |= ϕ[s/r] for all s ∈ Rω free for r in ϕ. By the induction hypothesis, we have ϕ[s/r] ∈ Γ for all such s. Since Γ is a Henkin theory, there is a Henkin constant rϕ ∈ Rω for ¬(∀r)ϕ. Hence ϕ[rϕ/r] ∈ Γ. But Γ contains the Henkin axiom\n¬(∀r)ϕ → ¬ϕ[rϕ/r] ,\nand so we have by L(Rω)-consistency that (∀r)ϕ ∈ Γ.\nThis completes the proof of the Truth Lemma. To complete the proof of completeness, we recall that we obtained T θ ∈ M0 as a maximal L(R)-consistent extension of {¬θ}. Hence there exists Γθ ∈ Mω(T θ) ⊆ M . But Γθ is a maximal L(Rω)-consistent extension of (T θ)ω, and (T\nθ)ω is a conservative extension of T θ by Lemma A.10. Therefore, since θ /∈ T θ by consistency, we have θ /∈ Γθ. Applying the Truth Lemma, Mc,Γ θ 1 6|= θ. Completeness follows.\nA.8 Conservativity of QRBB Over RBB\nAs a corollary of Theorems A.1 and A.5, we have the following.\nCorollary A.11. QRBB is a conservative extension of RBB: for each ϕ ∈ F ,\nQRBB ⊢ ϕ iff RBB ⊢ ϕ .\nProof. The right-to-left direction is obvious (QRBB contains all the axioms and rules of RBB). The left-to-right direction follows by QRBB soundness (Theorem A.5) and RBB completeness (Theorem A.1).\nA.9 QRBBσ and QRBB + σ Soundness and Completeness\nRecalling the semantics for QRBBσ and for QRBB + σ from §A.3, we prove the following theorem.\nTheorem A.12 (QRBBσ and QRBB + σ Soundness and Completeness). Assume R contains the symbol σ.\n• QRBBσ is sound: QRBBσ ⊢ ϕ implies |=σ ϕ for each ϕ ∈ F ∀.\n• if R is at least countably infinite, then QRBBσ is sound and complete: for each ϕ ∈ F ∀,\nQRBBσ ⊢ ϕ iff |=σ ϕ .\n• analogous soundness and completeness results hold for QRBB+σ with respect to the satisfaction relation |=+σ .\nSoundness is proved as in Theorem A.2. Completeness is proved as in Theorem A.5, except that provability is taken with respect to either QRBBσ or QRBB + σ and one must show (using an argument as in the completness portion of Theorem A.2) that Mc satisfies the relevant properties."

We argue that one can legitimately answer positively or negatively, depending on how the notion of justification is understood. To facilitate our argument, we introduce a simple propositional logic of reason-based belief. We show that this logic is sufficiently flexible to accommodate various useful features, including quantification over reasons. We use our framework to contrast two notions of JTB: one internalist, the other externalist. We argue that Gettier cases essentially challenge the internalist notion but not the externalist one. In particular, we may equate knowledge and JTB if the latter is grounded in what we call “adequate” reasons.",
