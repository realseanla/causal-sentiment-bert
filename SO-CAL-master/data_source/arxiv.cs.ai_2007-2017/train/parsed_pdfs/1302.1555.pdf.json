    "abstractText" : "We consider probabilistic inference in general hy­ brid networks, which include continuous and dis­ crete variables in an arbitrary topology. We re­ examine the question of variable discretization in a hybrid network aiming at minimizing the in­ formation loss induced by the discretization. We show that a nonuniform partition across all vari­ ables as opposed to uniform partition of each vari­ able separately reduces the size of the data struc­ tures needed to represent a continuous function. We also provide a simple but efficient procedure for nonuniform partition. To represent a nonuni­ form discretization in the computer memory, we introduce a new data structure, which we call a Bi­ nary Split Partition (BSP) tree. We show that BSP trees can be an exponential factor smaller than the data structures in the standard uniform discretiza­ tion in multiple dimensions and show how the BSP trees can be used in the standard join tree algo­ rithm. We show that the accuracy of the inference process can be significantly improved by adjusting discretization with evidence. We construct an it­ erative anytime algorithm that gradually improves the quality of the discretization and the accuracy of the answer on a query. We provide empirical evidence that the algorithm converges.",
