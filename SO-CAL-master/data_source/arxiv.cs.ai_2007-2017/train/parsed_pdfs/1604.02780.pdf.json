      "text" : "Category Theory generalized the use of graphic language to specify structures and properties through diagrams. These categorical techniques provide powerful\n2 tools for formal specification, structuring, model construction, and formal verification for a wide range of systems, presented on a grate variety of papers. The data specification requires finite, effective and comprehensive presentation of complete structures, this type of methodology was explored on Category Theory for algebraic specification by Ehresmann[6]. He developed sketches as a specification methodology of mathematical structures and presented it as an alternative to the string-based specification employed in mathematical logic. The functional semantic of sketches is sound in the informal sense that it preserves by definition the structure given in the sketch. Sketch specification enjoy a unique combination of rigour, expressiveness and comprehensibility. They can be used for data modelling, process modelling and meta-data modelling as well thus providing a unified specification framework for system modelling. For our goal we extend the syntax of sketch to multi-graphs and define its models on the Topos (see e.g. for definition [7]), defined by relation evaluated in a many-valued logic. We named specification system too our version of Ehresmanns sketch, and on its definition we developed a conservative extension to the notions of commutative diagram, limit and colimit for many-valued logic.\nIn this work, we use background knowledge about a problem to specify its domain structures. This type of information is assumed to be vague or uncertain, and described using multi-diagrams. We simplify the exposition and presentation of this notions using a string-based codification, for this type of multi-diagrams, named relational specification. We use this description for presenting structures extracted from data and on its integration.\nThere are essentially two representation paradigms to represent the extracted information, usually taken very differently. On one hand, symbolic-based descriptions are specified through a grammar that has fairly clear semantics. On the other hand, the usual way to see information presented using a connectionist description is its codification on a neural network (NN). Artificial NNs, in principle, combine the ability to learn and robustness or insensitivity to perturbations of input data. NNs are usually taken as black boxes, thereby providing little insight into how the information is codified. It is natural to seek a synergy integrating the white-box character of symbolic base representation and the learning power of artificial neuronal networks. Such neuro-symbolic models are currently a very active area of research. In the context of classic logic see [8] [9] [10], for the extraction of logic programs from trained networks. For the extraction of modal and temporal logic programs see [11] and [3]. In [12] we can find processes to generate connectionist representation of multi-valued logic programs and for Lukasiewicz logic programs ( LL) [?].\nOur approach to the generation of neuro-symbolic models uses Lukasiewicz logic. This type of many-valued logic has a very useful property motivated by the ”linearity” of logic connectives. Every logic connective can be defined by a neuron in an artificial network having, by activation function, the identity truncated to zero and one [13]. This allows the direct codification of formulas into network architecture, and simplifies the extraction of rules. Multilayer feedforward NN, having this type of activation function, can be trained efficiently\n3 using the Levenderg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm [5], and the generated network can be simplified using the ”Optimal Brain Surgeon” algorithm proposed by B. Hassibi, D. G. Stork and G.J. Stork [14].\nWe combine specification system and the injection of information extracted, on the specification, in the context of structures generated using a fuzzy automata. This type of automata are presented as simple process to generate uncertain structures. They are used to describe an example: where the generated data is stored in a specified structure and where we apply the extraction methodology, using different views of the data, to find new insights about the data. This symbolic knowledge is inject in the specification improving the available description about the data. In this sense we see the specification system as a knowledge base about the problem domain ."

      "text" : "Classical propositional logic is one of the earliest formal systems of logic. The algebraic semantics of this logic are given by Boolean algebra. Both, the logic and the algebraic semantics have been generalized in many directions [15]. The generalization of Boolean algebra can be based in the relationship between conjunction and implication given by (x ∧ y) ≤ z ⇔ x ≤ (y → z). These equivalences, called residuation equivalences, imply the properties of logic operators in Boolean algebras.\nIn applications of fuzzy logic, the properties of Boolean conjunction are too rigid, hence it is extended a new binary connective, ⊗, which is usually called fusion, and the residuation equivalence (x ⊗ y) ≤ z ⇔ x ≤ (y ⇒ z) defines implication.\nThese two operators induce a structure of residuated poset on a partially ordered set of truth values P [15]. This structure has been used in the definition of many types of logics. If P has more than two values, the associated logics are called a many-valued logics.\nWe focused our attention on many-valued logics having a subset of interval P = [0, 1] as set of truth values. In this type of logics the fusion operator ⊗ is known as a t -norm. In [16], it is described as a binary operator defined in [0, 1] commutative and associative, non-decreasing in both arguments, 1⊗ x = x and 0⊗ x = 0.\nAn example of a continuous t-norms is x ⊗ y = max(0, x + y − 1), named Lukasiewicz t-norm, used on definition of Lukasiewicz logic ( LL)[17].\nSentences in LL are, as usually, built from a (countable) set of propositional variables, a conjunction ⊗ (the fusion operator), an implication ⇒, and the truth constant 0. Further connectives are defined as: ¬ϕ1 is ϕ1 ⇒ 0, 1 is 0 ⇒ 0 and ϕ1 ⊕ ϕ2 is ¬ϕ1 ⇒ ϕ2. The interpretation for a well-formed formula ϕ in\n4 Llogic is defined inductively, as usual, assigning a truth value to each propositional variable.\nThe Lukasiewicz fusion operator x⊗y = max(0, x+y−1), its residue x⊗y = min(1, 1−x+y), and the lattice operators x∨y = max{x, y} and x∧y = minx, y, defined in Ω = [0, 1] a structure of resituated lattice [15] since:\n1. (Ω,⊗, 1) is a commutative monoid 2. (Ω,∨,∧, 0, 1) is a bounded lattice, and 3. the residuation property holds,\nfor all x, y, z ∈ Ω, x ≤ y ⇒ z iff x⊗ y ≤ z.\nThis structure is divisible, x ∧ y = x ⊗ (x ⇒ y), and ¬¬x = x. Structures with this characteristics are usually called MV-algebras [?].\nHowever truth table fϕ is a continuous structure, for our computational goal, it must be discretized, ensuring sufficient information to describe the original formula. A truth table fϕ for a formula ϕ, in LL, is a map fϕ : [0, 1]\nm → [0, 1], where m is the number of propositional variables used in ϕ. For each integer n > 0, let Sn be the set {0, 1 n , . . . , n−1 n , 1}. Each n > 0, defines a sub-table for fϕ defined by f (n) ϕ : (Sn) m → Sm, given by f (n) ϕ (v̄) = fϕ(v̄), and called the ϕ (n+1)-valued truth sub-table. Since Sn is closed for the logic connectives defined in LL, we define a (n+1)-valued Lukasiewicz logic (n- LL), as the fragment of LL having by truth values Ω = Sn. On the following we generic call them ”a LL”.\nFuzzy logics, like LL, deals with degree of truth and its logic connectives are functional, whereas probability theory (or any probabilistic logic) deals with degrees of degrees of uncertainty and its connectives aren’t functional. If we take two sentence from L the language of LL, ϕ and ψ, for any probability defined in L we have P (φ⊕ ϕ) = P (φ)⊕ P (ϕ) if ¬(φ⊗ ϕ) is a boolean tautology, however for a valuation v on L we have v(φ ⊕ ϕ) = v(φ) ⊕ v(ϕ). The divisibility in Ω, is usually taken as a fuzzy modus ponens of LL, ϕ, ϕ → ψ ⊢ ψ, where v(ψ) = v(ϕ) ⊗ v(ψ). This inference is known to preserve lower formals of probability, P (φ) ≥ x and P (ϕ → ψ) ≥ y then P (ψ) ≥ x ⊗ y. Petr Hájek presented in [18] extends this principle by embedding probabilistic logic in LL, for this we associated to each boolean formula ϕ a fuzzy proposition ”ϕ is provable”. This is a new propositional variable on LL, where P (ϕ) is now taken to be its degree of truth.\nWe assume in our work what the involved entities or concepts on a UoD can be described, or characterize, through fuzzy relations and the information associated to them can be presented or approximated using sentences on LL. In next section we describe this type of relations in the context of allegory theory [19]."

      "text" : "A vague relation R defined between a family of sets (Ai)i∈Att, and evaluated on Ω, is a map R : ∏\ni∈Att Ai → Ω. Here we assume that Ω is the set of truth\n5 values for a LL. In this case we named Att the set of attributes, where each index α ∈ Att, is called an attribute and the set indexed by i, Ai, represents the set of possible values for that attribute on the relation or its domain. In relation R every instance x̄ ∈ ∏\ni∈Att Ai, have associated a level of uncertainty, given by R(x̄), and interpreted as the truth value of proposition x̄ ∈ R, in Ω.\nEvery partition Atti ∪ Atta ∪ Atto = Att, where the sets of attributes Atti, Atta and Atto are disjoint, define a relation\nG : ∏\ni∈Atti\nAi × ∏\ni∈Atto\nAi → Ω,\nby\nG(x̄, z̄) = ⊕\nȳ∈ ∏\ni∈Atta Ai\nR(x̄, ȳ, z̄),\nand denoted by G : ∏\ni∈Atti Ai ⇀\n∏\ni∈Atto Ai, this type of relation we call a\nview for R. For each partition Atti ∪ Atta ∪ Atto = Att define a view G for R, where Atti and Atto are called, respectively, the set of G inputs and the set of its outputs. This sets are denoted, on the following, by I(G) and O(G). Graphically a view\nG:A0×A1×A2⇀A3×A4×A5 ,\ncan be presented by multi-arrow on figure 1.\nA view S : A ⇀ A is called a similarity relation is\n1. S(x̄, x̄) = 1 (reflexivity),\n2. S(x̄, ȳ) = S(ȳ, x̄) (symmetry), and\n3. S(x̄, ȳ)⊗ S(ȳ, z̄) ≤ S(x̄, z̄) (transitivity).\nWe use Greek lets for similarity relation relations, and if α : A ⇀ A is a similarity relation we write α : A, and call to A the support for similarity α. The similarity using α between to elements x̄ and ȳ is denoted by [x̄ = ȳ]α to mean α(x̄, ȳ).\nWe see a similarity relation α : A as a way to encoded fuzzy sets in LL. We do this interpreting, for x̄ ∈ A, its diagonal [x̄, x̄]α as the degree of true for proposition x̄ ∈ α. Given two elements in the support set x̄, ȳ ∈ A, we interpret [x̄, ȳ]α as the degree of true for proposition x̄ = ȳ in α. This offer us a way to evaluate the equality and de membership relation on the LL.\n6 Let Ω-Set be the class of views defined by relations evaluated in Ω. We define a monoidal structure in Ω-Set for every pair of views\nG : ∏\ni∈I(G)\nAi ⇀ ∏\ni∈O(G)\nAi and R : ∏\ni∈I(R)\nAi ⇀ ∏\ni∈O(R)\nAi\nwe define,\nR⊗G : ∏\ni∈I(G)∪I(R)\\O(G)\nAi ⇀ ∏\ni∈O(R)∪O(G)\\I(R)\nAi,\ngiven, for every\n(x̄, z̄) ∈ ∏\ni∈I(G)∪I(R)\\O(G)\nAi × ∏\ni∈O(R)∪O(G)\\I(R)\nAi,\nby\n(R⊗G)(x̄, z̄) = ⊕\nȳ∈O(R)∩I(G)\n(R(x̄, ȳ)⊗ S(ȳ, z̄)).\nWe call to this tensor product composition of view. This operation extends composition of functions: if relation G is a function between sets A and B, and if R is a function between sets B and A, then for this two views in Ω-Set, G⊗R is the function R ◦G.\nWhile composition between maps is a partial operator, it is defined only for componible maps, the tensor product ⊗ is total, it is defined for every pair of relations. In figure 2 for two multi-arrow R and G representing views such that I(R) = {A0, A1}, O(R) = {A2, A3, A4}, I(G) = {A2, A3}, and O(G) = {A5}, for the resulting view R⊗G we have I(R⊗G) = {A0, A1, A2} and O(R⊗G) = {A4, A5}.\nIn Ω-Set we denote by I : ∗ → Ω the relation defined on a singleton set by I(∗) = 1. This relation is the identity for ⊗; R⊗ I ≈ I ⊗R ≈ R.\nThe class Ω-Set have a natural structure of category, having by objects Ωsets and by morphisms view, such that R : α → β is a morphism from Ω-set α : A to β : B if R : A ⇀ B and\n7 1. α⊗R ≤ R, and 2. R⊗ β ≤ R.\nNote that every object α : A have by identity the relation ᾱ : A ⇀ A defined by reflexive the close of α, define making ᾱ(x̄, x̄) = 1.\nThe category Ω-Set is a symmetric monoidal closed category [20], where the tensor product of Ω-sets is given for α : A and β : B by\nα⊗ β : A×B\ndefined\n(α⊗ β)(a, b) = α(a) ⊗ β(b).\nThis can be used to describe a functor\nα⊗ : Ω − Set → Ω − Set,\ngiven for morphisms R : γ ⇀ β, with support f : A ⇀ B, by\nα⊗ f : α⊗ γ ⇀ α⊗ β\nhaving by support α⊗ f : A× C ⇀ A×B, described by\n(α⊗ f)(a, c, a′, b) = α(a, a′)⊗ f(c, b).\nFunctor α⊗ have by left adjunct a functor\nα ⊸ : Ω-Set → Ω-Set,\ndefined for Ω-sets β : B by\nα ⊸ β : [A,B],\nconstruct as the internalization for Ω-set Hom [21]\n(α ⊸ β)(t, h) = ∨\nb0,b1\n⊕\na\n(α(a, a) ⊗ t(a, b0)⊗ h(a, b1)⊗ β(b0, b1)),\nfor relations f : γ ⇀ β, with support f : C ⇀ D, we have\n(α ⊸ f) : (α ⊸ γ) ⇀ (α ⊸ β),\na relation with support α ⊸ f : [A,C] ⇀ [A,B], described by\n(α ⊸ f)(h, g)(a, c, a′, b) = h(a, c)⊗ g(a′, b)⊗ α(a, a′).\nThis adjunction α⊗ ⊢ α ⊸ have by unit [20] the natural transformation, λ defined for each Ω-set γ : C, by a multi-morphism\nλγ : (α ⊸ γ)⊗ α ⇀ γ,\n8 with support λγ : [A,C]×A ⇀ C, by\nλγ(h, a, b) = h(a, b),\nthe relation h evaluation evaluated in (a, b) ∈ A×B. The α ⊸ β : [A,B] reflexive closure defines a similarity relation in [A,B], we use this relation in the following to quantify the similarity between relation form S and B, and we call them power similarity relation. In the follow we use this relation to compare models or on the quantification of model quality.\nTwo views R and G, in Ω-Set, are called independents if R ⊗ G = G ⊗ R. By this we mean what the R output not depend on G inputs and the G output not depend on R input. Given a view R : A ⇀ B, we define projections RA : B → Ω and RB : B → Ω, respectively, by RA(b̄) = ⊕\nā∈A R(ā, b̄) and RB(ā) = ⊕\nb̄∈B R(ā, b̄). In the following we used R(ā, ) to denote the relation defined from R by fixing a input vector ā ∈ A, R(ā, )(b̄) = R(ā, b̄)."

We can use multi-arrows to generalize the notion of arrow in a graph. This allows the definition of a multigraph as a set of nodes linked together using multi-arrows. Examples of multigraphs can be seen on figures 2 and 4. A multi-diagram in Ω-Set, defined having by support a multi-graph G, is a multi-graph homomorphism D : G → Ω-Set, where each node in G is mapped to a Ω-set α : A, and each multi-arrows in G is mapped to a relation view.

We use the conservative extensions to this notions for the detrition of fuzzy structures. However the notion of colimit is more difficult to present generically. The construction of a colimit reduces to that of two coproducts and a coequalizer, siting [20], in the category of sets governed by classic logic the explicit description of a coequalizer is generically very technical since it involves the description of the equivalence relation generated by a family of pairs.

Γ (R0, R1)⊗ Γ (R1, R2) ≤ Γ (R0, R2) (transitivity).\nThe transitivity is a consequence of, in any ML-algebra Ω, for all λ0, λ1, λ2 ∈ Ω,(λ0 ⇒ λ1)⊗ (λ1 ⇒ λ2) ≤ λ0 ⇒ λ2. When Γ (R0, R1) = λ we write R0 ∼λ R1 and we say that, R0 is λ-similar to R1, for R0 ∼1 R1 we write R0 = R1.\nWe named this similarity measure of exponential similarity. In the literature we can find other measures for relation similarity measurement. Like the infsimilarity, used in Possibilistic logic,\nΓ (R0,R1)= ∧\nx̄∈ ∏ α∈Att Aα (R0(x̄)⇔R1(x̄)),\nor the and-similarity, used in Boolean logic,\nΓ (R0,R1)= ⊗\nx̄∈ ∏ α∈Att Aα (R0(x̄)⇔R1(x̄)),\n14\nhowever these relations are to crispy for model evaluation. We need to be able to quantify who models are similar to a concept description.\nThis notion is fundamental to make fuzzy some key concepts of relational algebra, useful on data structure specification. Example of this is the description of a ”is a” relation evaluated on multi-valued logic. For that, let R : A ⇀ B be a concept description, here we assume the existence of a similarity ΓA defined in A. The concept description R defines a ”is a” relation, for similarity ΓA, if sentence\nR(a0,b)⊗R(a1,b)⇒ΓA(a0,a1),\nhave by truth-value 1, for every a0, a1 ∈ A and every b ∈ B, i.e.\n⊗\na0,a1∈A\n⊗\nb∈B(R(a0,b)⊗R(a1,b)⇒ΓA(a0,a1))=1.\nIn this sense we call to view R a mono-view or a clustering.\nViews R : A ⇀ B such that ⊗ b∈B ⊕ a∈A R(a,b) = 1, are called epi-views."

      "text" : "All the widely used data specification mechanisms (like Entity Relationship Model [22], the Fundamental Data Model [23], the Generic Semantic Model [24]), OOA&D-schemas in a million of versions and UML which itself comprises a host of various notations, have a strong graphical component. They are essentially graphs with special markers in them. Usually the semantics of these markers is defined in an ad-hoc and sometimes non-formal way. An important component of the mathematical structure that will be used to formalized knowledge, are multi-graph homomorphisms into the class Set(Ω) of relations views. When specifying an information system, it will be necessary to formulate constrains on such graph homomorphisms. A identical notion of a specification whose models are graphs homomorphisms into a category theory are known on the category community under the name of sketch. Sketches where invented by Charles Ehresmann and can be perceived as a graphic based logic, which formalizes in a precise and uniform way the semantic of graph with marks [25]. For our propose we extended Ehresmann’s sketch to formalize a graphic based fuzzy logic. We named, this mathematical structure, specification system. On information specification, specification system will be used to specify finite fuzzy structures. Semantic data specification have been used for may years in the early stages of database design, and they have become key ingredients of object-oriented software. The goal of a semantic data specification is to build a mathematical abstraction of a small part of the real word. This small part of the word is usually called the universe of discourse (UoD) in the database literature. The models of the data specification are possible states of the UoD, and will be the structures stored in an information system. The mathematical structure that will be used to describe the UoD are finite models of specification systems together with a labeling of all the elements of these models.\n15\nHence a data specification will consist of two parts. The first part will be a specification system, and it describes the fuzzy structure and the interdependencies of the various entities about which we want to store information. The second part indicates what kind of information we want to store about each type of entity: for each type of entity, we give its set of possible attribute values, i.e. the set of all possible labels that an entity of the given type can have. The structure defined, by specification system S and model M , we named the semiotic (S,M).\nBy a specification system S we understood as a structure S = (G, C, L, coL), where G is a multi-graph, C is a set of pairs (G, λ), and L and coL are sets of tuples (f,G, i(G), o(G), λ), such that f is a multi-arrow in G, D ⊂ G is a multi-graph, λ ∈ Ω and i(G) and o(G) are sets of nodes from G.\nGiven a specification system S = (G, C, L, coL) a model for S is a diagram M : G → Set(Ω), mapping multi-arrows to concept description, such that:\n1. for every (G, λ) ∈ C, M(G) is λ-commutative, 2. for every (f,G, i(G), o(G), λ) ∈ L, M(f) have by input M(i(G)) and by\noutput M(o(G)) and is λ-equivalent to relation Lim M(G), and 3. for every (f,G, i(G), o(G), λ) ∈ L, M(f) have by input M(i(G)) and by\noutput M(o(G)) and is λ-equivalent to relation coLim M(G).\nThe pair (S,M) defined by a model M : G → Set(Ω) for a specification system S is called a semiotic, where the multi-graph G describes a library of components.\nA specification system S, if consistent, describes the fuzzy structure for a class of UoD. If the set of all models for specification system S is denoted by Mod(S), everyM ∈ Mod(S) can be seen as a system state. Two statesM0,M1 ∈ Mod(S) have similar structures and the specification S can be enriched with now knowledge to increase the dissimilarity between the states. The knowledge need to distinguish between M0 and M1 can be extracted querying the state M0, trying to find its particularities.\nFor that, every multi-graph homomorphism I : I → G defines a query to a model M : G → Set(Ω) ∈ Mod(S). And this query I have by answer the relation given by\nLim M ◦ I,\nand each of its views can be used as a data set, usable to feed a data mining processes, to extracted insights about the model."

      "text" : "Specification systems are graphic specifications formalisms (its components are multi-graphs and markers in these graphs) and can be taken as repositories of knowledge about the UoD. They are described using a rigorous graphic language with a precise semantic, where we have a methodology to querying its models. Your goal is the enrichment of this structure with knowledge extracted from one of its models. We simplify this process by expressing constraints of first-order logic formulae into a graphical marker.\n16\nTo be able to do that, we consider the multi-graph used on the definition of the specification system component library as a presentation of a first-order many-sorted signature: nodes of the graph are interpreted as data sorts, and multi-arrows are interpreted as relations evaluated in Ω. A structure for this signature is exactly a multi-graph homomorphism from G to Set(Ω). Every formula for this signature are particularly simple, since there are only relations. A formula R(x1, x2, . . . , xn) is defined through a multi-graph homomorphism R : I → G and its interpretation in model M , is the relation Lim M ◦ R. Where the interpretation of each initial and terminal node of the multi-diagram R defines the sorts for variables x1, x2, . . . , xn.\nEvery atomic formula is a relation R(x1, x2, . . . , xn). The finite conjunction of atomic formulas on variables x1, x2, . . . , xn, using relations R1, R2, . . . , Rm is denoted by: (R1 ⊗ R2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Rm)(x1, x2, . . . , xn) and it is interpreted as the relation Lim M ◦ (R1 ⊗R2 ⊗ . . .⊗Rm). In this sense, every disjunctive formula defined using relation can be interpreted as the limit of a finite diagram.\nThe translation in the other direction is also simple. Given a limit mark (f,G, i(G), o(G), λ) in S, the meaning for sign f , is the interpretation of a disjunctive formula defined trough the interpretation of each multi-arrows used on the definition of multi-graph G having its interdependencies (gluing order in G) defined using variable repetition.\nSimilarly, every conjunctive formula defined using relation on semiotic (S,M) can be interpreted as the colimit of a finite diagram. For colimit makes (f,G, i(G), o(G), λ) is S, the interpretation for f , can be defined as the interpretation for a conjunctive formula defined using each multi-arrow in G .\nGiven a semiotic (S,M) every formula ϕ, extracted from model M using a query I, can be described by a set of limit marks and colimit marks. This allows the enrichment of specification system S, defining a new system S′, such that Mod(S′) ⊆ Mod(S) and M ∈ Mod(S′).\nHowever, it is known from [2] what where are structures specifiable using sketches but not in first-order logic. Then first-order logic have less expressive power as specification systems. This result allows to use a mixture of limits, colimits and formulas in the UoD specification and be sure that the resulting specification can always be translated to a specification system [25]."

      "text" : "A specification system is by nature a graphic specification described, however, some times like in this exposition, it is preferable a description for the specification system using a string-based presentation. For this we used a string-based codification for specification systems named relational specification, generalizing the notion of essentially algebraic specification: the original idea goes back to Freyd [26] and having the same expressive power as finite limit sketches [27]. The essentially algebraic fragment, are interesting computer sciences mainly because theories, of many kinds of specification formalisms, are in fact initial algebras for some essentially algebraic specification. A number of proof systems for essentially algebraic specification have been introduced [28].\n17\nRecall that an ordering on a set X is well-founded iff every strictly decreasing chain of elements of X must be finite. A relational specification consists of:\n1. A set of sorts. 2. A set of relational signs, with a well-founded ordering (called a library of\ncomponents). 3. A set of diagrams defined using relational views, with a well-founded ordering\n(called a a set of diagrams). 4. A set of condition build on relational signs and diagrams.\nEvery relation sign or view sign ω have an arity and a set Def(ω) of relations with the same arity as w, called the set of domain condition.\nFor our propose sorts are nominal and finite, and we list its possible values by writing A : {a1, a2, . . . , at},. These are the basic structures for UoD specification, used on the description of relations and views. Every relation have an arity described by a list of data sorts. We denote a relation symbol R, with arity the list of sorts A1, A2, . . . , An, as R : A1, A2, . . . , An. Interpreted as a concept description M(R) : O ⇀ ∐\ni Ai. A view of R having by source arity the list A1, A2, . . . , An and by target arity\nB1, B2, . . . , Bm is denoted by:\nR : { A1, A2, . . . , An ⇀ B1, B2, . . . , Bm;\n}\nThese are interpreted as concept descriptions M(R) : O × ∏ iAi ⇀ ∐\nj Bj . The relationship between relations and views may be defined using marked diagrams. A diagram is described by a set of views where we marked some of its sorts as input or output sort. We write\nD : { A1, A2, . . . , An ⇀ B1, B2, . . . , Bm; D : D1 ⊗ D2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Dk;\n}\nwhere (Di)i∈I is a list of diagram signs, what are smaller than D, describing the proper sequence of gluing to form D. Note what, every view can be seen as a diagram with only one multi-arrow. The commutativity or λ-commutativity for a diagram D, for view G, in the model, is denote, respectively, by G : [D] or G : [D]λ. When the interpretation for a relation or view G must satisfy a limit or a colimit, we writing G:lim D, G:λ−lim D, G:colim D, or G:λ−colim D. In specification:\nG : { A1, A2, . . . , An ⇀ B1, B2, . . . , Bm; D : { A1, A2, . . . , An ⇀ B1, B2, . . . , Bm;\nD : D1 ⊗ D2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ Dk; }\nG : λ0-lim D; D′ : { A1, A2, . . . , An ⇀ B1, B2, . . . , Bm;\nD′ : D′1 ⊗ D ′ 2 ⊗ . . . ⊗ D ′ k;\n}\nG:[D′]λ1 ;\n}\nevery interpretation for view G must be λ0-similar to Lim D, there D is diagram defined gluing diagrams or multi-arrows (Di)i∈I , and must transform D\n′ is a λ0commutative diagram. However, this type of properties are very generic and some\n18\ntimes difficult to understand. When we want to be more specific, we describe some of the relations or views properties using first-order formulas. We will express internal properties on a relation or view G using formulas, with the same arity as G, and defined using only signs that are smaller than G in the library of component. For it we write,\nG := { A1, A2, . . . , An; G(x1, x2, . . . , xn) : P(R1(x1, x2, . . . , xn), R1(x1, x2, . . . , xn), . . . , Rm(x1, x2, . . . , xn));\n}\nif view or relation G interpretation satisfies formula P having the some arity as R and, dependente from relations R1, R2, . . . , Rn that are smaller than R in the library of componentes.\nWe simplify the specification using some special meta-signs, following the spirit of M. Makkai [28] and Z. Diskin [29]. If a view D is a is a relation or a clustering relation using the similarity relation Γ , we write:\nD : { A1, A2, . . . , An ⇀ B; Γ : { A1, A2, . . . , An;\nΓ : similarity; }\nD : is a(Γ ); }\nIn the next section we describe a process useful for knowledge extraction.

For that the information structure is crystallized in a neural network and codified in stringbased notation as a formula. Different concept can be seen as answers to different queries to a UoD models. In this sense different concepts represent different perspective for the available data, allowing the enrichment of a knowledge base or specification systems with new insights. In this section, we present a methodology to extract first-order formulas using neural networks describing available information in a Llogic.\nAs mentioned in [30] there is a lack of a deep investigation of the relationships between logics and NNs. In [13] it is shown how, by taking as activation function, ψ, the identity truncated to zero and one,\nψ(x)=min(1,max(x,0)),\nit is possible to represent the corresponding NN as a combination of propositions of Lukasiewicz calculus and vice-versa [30].\nFor used NNs to learn Lukasiewicz sentences, we define the first-order language as a set of circuits generated from the plugging of atomic components.\n19\nFor this, we used the library of components presented in table 1, interpreted as neural units and we gluing them together, to form NNs having only one output, without loops. This task of construct complex structures based on simplest ones can be formalized using generalized programming [31]. The neurons\nof these types of networks, which have two inputs and one output, can be interpreted as a function (see figure 5) and are generically denoted, in the following, by ψb(w1x1, w2x2), where b represent the node bias, w1 and w3 are the weights and, x1 and x2 input values. We simplify exposition by calling to w1x1 and w2x2 variables in ψb. In this context a network is the functional interpretation of a formula in the string-based notation when the relation, defined by network execution, corresponds to the formula truth table. The use of NNs as interpretation\nof formulas simplifies the transformation between string-based representations and the network representation, allowing one to write:\nProposition 2 Every well-formed formula in the Llogic language can be codified using a NN, and the network defines the formula interpretation, when the activation function is the identity truncated to zero and one.\nFor instance, the semantic for sentence ϕ=(x⊗y⇒z)⊕(z⇒w), can be described using the bellow network or can be codified by the presented set of matrices.

A truth table fϕ for a formula ϕ, in a fuzzy logic, is a map fϕ : [0, 1]\nm → [0, 1], where m is the number of propositional variables used in ϕ. For each integer n > 0, let Sn be the set {0, 1 n , . . . , n−1 n , 1}. Each n > 0, defines a sub-table for fϕ defined by f (n) ϕ : (Sn) m → [0, 1], given by f (n) ϕ (v̄) = fϕ(v̄), and called the ϕ (n+1)-valued truth sub-table."

A CNN is called Lukasiewicz neural network ( LNN) if it can be codified as a binary NN: i.e. a CNN where each neuron has one or two inputs. A CNN is representable when can be codified using an equivalent LNN.\nEach neuron, with n inputs, in a CNN can be described using configuration\nα=ψb(x1,x2,...,xn−1,xn)\nand it is representable when can be describes by a LNN\nα=ψb1y1,ψb2(y2,ψb3 (...,ψbn−1(yn−1,yn))).\nA CNN is representable if each of its neurons is representable. Note that, a representable CNN can be translated directly into Lukasiewicz first-order language, using the correspondences between configurations and formulas described on table 1.\nGiven the configuration α=ψb(x1,x2,...,xn), in a CNN, with 0≤x1+x2+...+xn+b≤1, we have 0≤x1+(x2+...+xn+b2)+b1≤1, where b=b1+b2 for integers b0 and b1. And we have\nψb(x1,x2,...,xn)=ψb1 (x1,ψb2 (x2,...,xn)) .\n21\nNaturally, a neuron configuration - when representable - can by codified by different LNN. Particularly, we have:\nProposition 3 If the neuron configuration α=ψb(x1,x2,...,xn−1,xn) is representable, but not constant, it can be codified in a LNN with the following structure:\nα=ψb1 (x1,ψb2(x2,...,ψbn−1(xn−1,xn)...)),\nwhere b1,b2,...,bn−1 are integers, and b=b1+b2+...+bn−1.\nAnd, since the n-nary operator ψb is commutative, variables x1,x2,...,xn−1,xn) could interchange its position in function α=ψb(x1,x2,...,xn−1,xn) without changing the operator output. By this we mean that, for a three input configuration, when we permutate variables, we generate equivalent configurations:\nψb(x1,x2,x3)=ψb(x2,x3,x1)=ψb(x3,x2,x1)=...\nWhen these are representable, they can be codified in string-based notation using logic connectives. But these different configuration only generate equivalent formulas if these formulas are disjunctive or conjunctive. A disjunctive formulas is formula written using the disjunction of propositional variables or negation of propositional variable. Similarly, a conjunctive formulas are formulas written using only the conjunction of propositional variables or its negation.\nProposition 4 If α=ψb(x1,x2,...,xn−1,xn) is representable, it is the interpretation of a disjunctive formula or a conjunctive formula.\nThis leave us with the task of classifying a neuron configuration according to its representation. For that, we must note what, if\nα=ψb(−x1,−x2,...,−xn,xn+1,...,xm)\nis representable:\n1.

Note that, a representable CNN can be transformed by the application of rule R in a set of equivalent LNN with simplest neuron configuration:\nProposition 7 Un-representable neuron configurations are those transformed by rule R in, at least, two non-equivalent NNs.\nFor instance, the un-representable configuration ψ0(−x1, x2, x3), is transformed by rule R in three non-equivalent configurations:\nψ0(x3, ψ0(−x1, x2)) = fx3⊕(¬x1⊗x2) ψ−1(x3, ψ1(−x, x2)) = fx3⊗(¬x1⊗x2) ψ0(−x1, ψ0(x2, x3)) = f¬x1⊗(x2⊕x3)\nThe representable configuration ψ2(−x1,−x2, x3) is transformed by rule R on only two distinct but equivalent configurations:\n23\nψ0(x3, ψ2(−x1,−x2)) = fx3⊕¬(x1⊗x2) ψ1(−x2, ψ1(−x1, x3)) = f¬x2⊕(¬x1⊕x3)\nFor the extraction of knowledge from trained NNs, we translate neuron configuration in propositional connectives to form formulas. However, not all neuron configurations can be translated in formulas, but they can be approximate by one. To quantify the approximation quality we used the exponential-similarity.\nTwo neuron configurations α = ψb(x1, x2, . . . , xn) and β = ψb′(y1, y2, . . . , yn),\nare called λ-similar, in a (m + 1)-valued Llogic, if λ = e− 1 |O|\n∑\nx̄∈T ¬(α(x̄)⇔β(x̄)), we write α ∼λ β. If α is un-representable and β is representable, the second configuration is called a representable approximation to the first.\nOn the 2-valued Llogic (the Boolean logic case), we have for the un-representable configuration α = ψ0(−x1, x2, x3):\nψ0(−x1, x2, x3) ∼0.883 ψ0(x3, ψ0(−x1, x2)) ψ0(−x1, x2, x3) ∼0.883 ψ−1(x3, ψ1(−x1, x2)) ψ0(−x1, x2, x3) ∼0.883 ψ0(−x1, ψ0(x2, x3))\nIn this case, the truth sub-tables of, formulas α1 = x3 ⊕ (¬x1 ⊗ x2), α1 = x3 ⊗ (¬x1 ⊗ x2) and α1 = ¬x1 ⊗ (x2 ⊕ x3) are both λ-similar to ψ0(−x1, x2, x3), where λ = 0.883, since they differ in one position on 8 possible positions. This means that both formulas are 92% accurate.\nFor an un-representable configuration, α, we can generate the finite set S(α), of representable networks similar to α, using rule R. Given a (n+1)-valued logic, from that set of formulas we select to approximate α the formula having the interpretation more similar to α. This identification of un-representable configuration, using representable approximations, is used to transform networks with un-representable neurons into representable structures. The stress associated with this transformation characterizes the translation quality.\nBellow we present an example of a un-representable CNN:\n\n −1 1 −1 1 0 −1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 −1 1 1 0 0 0 0 −1\n\n\n\n 0 1 0\n\n i1 un-representable A4 ⊕ A5 ⊕ ¬A7 i3 un-representable\n[ 1 −1 1 ] [ 0 ]\nj1un-representable\nFor each local un-representable configuration α, we selected the most similar representable configuration on S(α), after applying rule R, we have in this case:\n1. i1 ∼0.9387 ((¬A1 ⊗ A4) ⊕ A2) ⊗ ¬A3 ⊗ ¬A6, 2. i3 ∼0.8781 (A1 ⊕ ¬A7) ⊗ A2, and 3. j1 ∼0.8781 (i1 ⊗ ¬i2) ⊕ i3.\nUsing this substitutions we reconstructed the formula:\nα = (((((¬A1 ⊗ A4) ⊕ A2) ⊗ ¬A3 ⊗ ¬A6) ⊗ ¬(A4 ⊕ A5 ⊕ ¬A7)) ⊕ ((A1 ⊕ ¬A7) ⊗ A2),\nλ-similar to the original CNN, with λ = 0.7323, in a 5-valued Llogic."

Since Newton’s method implicitly uses quadratic assumptions, the Hessian matrix dos not need be evaluated exactly. Rather, an approximation can be used, such as Hk≈JTk Jk, where Jk is the Jacobian matrix that contains first derivatives of the network errors with respect to the weights wk.\nThe simple gradient descent and Newtonian iteration are complementary in the advantages they provide. Levenberg proposed an algorithm based on this observation, whose update rule blends aforementioned algorithms and is given as\nwk+1=wk−[JTk Jk+µI] −1JTk ek\n,\nwhere ek is a vector of current network errors and µ is the learning rate. This update rule is used as follows. If the error goes down following an update, it implies that our quadratic assumption on the function is working and we reduce µ (usually by a factor of 10) to reduce the influence of gradient descent. In this way, the performance function is always reduced at each iteration of the algorithm [34]. On the other hand, if the error goes up, we would like to follow the gradient more and so µ is increased by the same factor.\nWe can obtain some advantage out of the second derivative, by scaling each component of the gradient according to the curvature. This should result in larger movements along the direction where the gradient is smaller so the classic ”error valley” problem does not occur any more. This crucial insight was provided by Marquardt. He replaced the identity matrix in the Levenberg update rule with the diagonal of Hessian matrix approximation resulting in the LM update rule.\nIn each LM iteration we restricted the NN representation bias, making its structure similar to a CNN. For that, we used a smooth crystallization procedure resulting from function,\nΥn(w)=sign(w).((cos(1−abs(w)−⌊abs(w)⌋). π 2 ) n+⌊abs(w)⌋),\niteration, where sign(w) is the sign of w and abs(w) its absolute value. Denoting by Υn(N) the function having by input and output a NN, where the weights on the output network results of applying Υ to all the input network weights and neurons biases. Each interactive application of Υ produce a networks progressively more similar to a CNNs. For show that, we define by representation error,\n25\nfor a network N , with weights w1, . . . , wn,\n∆(N) =\nn ∑\ni=1\n(wi − ⌊wi⌋).\nWhen N is a CNNs we have ∆(N) = 0. Since, for every network N and n > 0, ∆(N) ≥ ∆(Υn(N)), we have\nProposition 8 Given a neural networks N with weights in the interval [0, 1]. For every n > 0 the function Υn(N) have by fixed points Lukasiewicz neural networks N ′.\nWe changed the LM algorithm by applying a soft crystallization step after the LM update rule:\nwk+1=Υ2(wk−[JTk Jk+µ.diag(J T k Jk)] −1JTk ek )\nThis can be seen as a process to regularize the network and improves drastically the convergence to a CNN preserving its ability to learn. On our method network regularization is made using three different strategies:\n1. using the described soft crystallization process, where we restricted the knowledge dissemination on the network structure, information is concentrated on some weights; 2. after the training we use crisp crystallization, where links between neurons with weights near 0 are removed and weights near -1 or 1 are consolidated; 3. the resulting crisp network is pruned using ”Optimal Brain Surgeon” method.\nThe first regularization technic avoids knowledge dissemination on the NN. The last regularization technic avoid redundancies, in the sense that the same or redundant information can be codified at different locations. We minimized this by selecting weights to eliminate. The ”Optimal Brain Surgeon” method uses the criterion of minimal increase in training error. It uses information from all second-order derivatives of the error function to perform network pruning.\nThe Optimal Brain Surgeon method is derived from Taylor series of the error with respect to weights,\n∆E = JTw .∆w + 1\n2 ∆wTHw∆w +O(‖∆w‖ 3).\nFor a network trained to a local minimum in error, ∆w ≈ 0, the first linear term vanishes, third and all higher order terms are ignored. The method finds a weight to be set to zero (which we call wq) to minimize ∆E the increase in error. Making wq zero correspond to change its value using ∆wq making ∆wq+wq = 0 or more generally:\neTq ∆w + wq = 0,\nwhere eq is the unit vector in weight space corresponding to (scalar) weight wq. This reduces our goal to solve:\nmin q {min ∆w\n1 2 ∆wTHw∆w | e T q ∆wq + wq = 0}\n26\nThe optimization problem is constrained, following [14], we form the Lagrangian operator\nL = 1\n2 ∆wTHw∆w + λ(e T q ∆wq + wq),\nwhere λ is a Lagrange undetermined multiplier. After take functional derivatives, employ the constraint eTq ∆w + wq = 0, and use matrix inverse to find that the optimal weight change and resulting change in error are respectively\n∆w = − wq\n[H−1w ]qq H−1w eq and Lq =\n1\n2\nw2q\n[H−1w ]qq .\nThe method recalculates the magnitude of all the weights in the NN. Hassibi, Stork and Stork called Lq the ”saliency” of weight q, the increase in error that results when the weight is eliminated.\nAlgorithm 1 describes our methodology for training CNN and extraction of symbolic pattern descriptions.\nAlgorithm 1 Reverse Engineering algorithm 1: Given a concept description evaluated on a (n+1)-valued Lukasiewicz logic 2: Define an initial network complexity 3: Generate an initial neural network 4: Apply the LM algorithm with soft crystallization 5: if the generated network have bad performance then 6: If need increase network complexity 7: Try a new network.

For that our implementation generates neural networks with a fixed number of hidden layers (in our implementation we used three). When a network have bad learning performance, training is stopped, and train is initiate for a new network, with random heights. After a fixed number of tries the network topology is changed. This number iterations depends on the number of network inputs. After trying configure a set of networks with a given complexity and bad learning performance, the system tries to apply LM algorithm, with soft crystallization, for a more complex set of networks. The process stops when a adequate description for data is find. And after the network be pruned, unrepresentable configurations are approximated using representable ones. This defines a description for the information using a LNN.\n27"

      "text" : "A Ω-automata is an non-deterministic state machine, where state transition relation. This change is made after reading a sign from a word. Each symbol used to define automata input string is a sign having the form α =λ x, where α ∈ Att is an attribute, x a possible value for α, x ∈ Aα, and λ quantifies the truth value of α = x evaluated in Ω. The input sting at position i defines the truth of α =λ x for each α ∈ Att. The automata is defined by a set of states E, and at each moment this states have associated a level of uncertainty in Ω of being the automata state. In this sense an Ω-automata actual state is describes by a relation evaluated in Ω, ei : E → Ω, having by support the set of automata possible states. The states of an automata are classified in three classes: input states, auxiliary states and output states. The input states have its uncertainty directly assigned by the uncertainty on the input signs. Each of this state is associated directly with one sign α = x, used on the input string, and its uncertainty is the truth value of equality α = x on the actual reading position. After all input string have been read, the level of uncertainty on output states defines the Ω-automata output. An Ω-automata begins its activity in a initial state e0 : E → Ω, reads a string s1s2 . . . sn, in each iteration a position si is read and on the n-iteration reach its final state en : E → Ω. The final state is used to describe the automata output o : EO → Ω. Formally\nDefinition 3 An Ω-automata A is a structure described by\n( L, (Ai)i∈Att, E,EO, {Mλ,M¬λ}λ∈Σ , e0)\nwhere:\n28\n1. L is a finite multi-valued logic having truth values in Ω; 2. (Aα)α∈Att a family Ω-sets used as domain for attributes in construction of\nsigns ′α = x′; 3. E is the set of states, where each input sign ′α = x′ have a state associated.\nThe states, with a sign associated, are called input states; 4. EO is a subset of E, called set output states; 5. two boolean matrices M0 and M1, describing state transition. M0 describes\nnegative uncertainty propagation and M1 positive uncertainty propagation; 6. e0 : E → Ω is a relation describing the initial automata state; 7. if the automata state on iteration k is ek : E → Ω and let Xk : ∐\nα∈Att Aα → Ω describe the input sign on position k, the new automata state is given by\nek+1 = M1(ek)⊕M0(¬ek),\nwhere in ek : E we update, the input states, with the sign uncertainty on the reading position, described by vector Xk.\nA Ω-automata is called a Lukasiewicz automata when the system is governed by a finite Lukasiewicz logic.\nWe named relational automata to an extension to the Ω-automata defined using transition matrices M0 and M1 with values in Ω. This type of fuzzy automata have its behaviour described using formulas of Relational Lukasiewicz logic, introduced in [36], outfitting the scope of this work.\nIn this sense we interpret a word as a string of begs, where the possibility of a sign is in the beg is described by a relation Xk : ∐\nα∈Att Aα → Ω. In each iteration the Ω-automata reads a position on the string. If in the iteration k the position k is read, on the position k + 1 it reads the string position k + 1. Each position in the string can have more than a sign or can be empty. On iteration k the automata reads the position k, updating the uncertainty on each input states, using the sign uncertainties on the reading positions. This uncertainty is propagating to other states, applying the state transformation matrices. The update and the propagation of state uncertainty is done for each iteration. The input string length determines the number of automata iteration.\nIn this context a word w can be define as a sequence of relations\ns1, s2, . . . si . . . , sn\nhaving the type si : ∐\nα∈Att Aα → Ω. Using w as input to the automata, it generates a sequence of states described using a sequence of relation\ne1, e2, . . . ei . . . , en,\nhaving the type ei : E → Ω, describing the change on automata state between iterations. The Ω-set e1 is defined using the automata initial state e0, where the input states were update with the reading position s0. The state ei, when i > 1, depends on state ei−1 updated with the uncertainty on input sign, described by the reading position si. The automata output is defined by the uncertainty in each output state EO in the automata state en. The following example illustrates an automata execution.\n29\nExample 1 (A binary Lukasiewicz automata) The string of a binary Lukasiewicz automata is defined using only an attribute, having two possible values. Let this attribute be a and its possible values 0 or 1. Words interpreted using this automata are described using a sequence of Ω-sets having by support the set of signs {′a = 0′,′ a = 1′}. An example, of this type of words is presented on table 2, where each column codifies the existence of each sign in that position. For this example, we fixed the finite Lukasiewicz logic having by truth values\nΩ={0,1/4,1/2,3/4,1}. This table can be interpreted by saying what: first and second marks in the word are a ’1’, position 4 and 12 have a ’0’, and in position 11 we not know the symbol used, on position 6 we can not distinguished between a ’0’ or a ’1’.\nFor simplify the graphic presentation, we labelled each input state by its associates sign and to each not input state we labelled it with a number. Lets\n〈I(a=1),I(a=0),1,2,3,4,5,6〉\nbe the list of states, where I(a = 1) and I(a = 0) represent the input states, its uncertainty is indexed to the uncertainty on the reading of sign ′a = 1′ and ′a = 0′, and let 4, 5, and 6 be the automata output states. Let the state change boolean relations described using the graph presented on figure 6, where the arrows labelled with 0 represents the propagation of negative uncertainty and the arrows labelled with 1 represents the propagation of positive uncertainty. This graph can\nbe codified using two graph adjacency matrices: M0, for sub-graph having arrows labelled with 0, describing the state change when a state isn’t active, and M1 the adjacency for sub-graphs having arrows labelled with 1, describing behaviour\n30\nwhen a state is active.\nM0 =\n\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n   M1 =\n\n   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n\n  \nExecuting this automata, for word described on table 2, and taking the automata initial state uncertain, i.e. making the initial state e1=[1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2]′ . After reading the first position, we update e1 using the uncertain for each signs on first position, e1=[1,0,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2,1/2]′ , from it we compute e2 by:\ne2=M0⊗(¬e1)⊕M1⊗e1=[0,0,0,1,1,1/2,1,1/2] ′.\nUpdating the resulting state, since the second mark is ’a=1’, we have\ne2=[1,0,0,1,1,1/2,1,1/2]′.\nUsing the same procedure e3=[1/2,1/2,0,0,1,1,1,1/2,1/2]′, since we not know if in position 3 we have ’a=1’ or ’a=0’. Repeating the process for other word positions we have:\ne4 = [0, 1, 1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1/2, 1] ′ e8 = [1, 0, 0, 1, 3/4, 1/2, 3/4, 3/4] ′ e5 = [1/4, 3/4, 1, 1, 1/2, 1, 0, 1] ′ e9 = [1/2, 1/2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1/2, 1/2] ′ e6 = [1/2, 1/2, 3/4, 3/4, 0, 1, 1/2, 1] ′ e10 = [1/4, 3/4, 1/2, 1, 1, 1, 1/2, 1] ′ e7 = [1, 0, 1/2, 1/2, 1/4, 3/4, 1, 1] ′ e11 = [0, 0, 2/3, 1, 1/2, 1, 0, 1] ′\ne12 = [0, 1, 1, 1/2, 1/4, 1, 1/2, 1] ′\nThe automata final state is defined using, e13=[0,0,1,1/4,0,1/2,3/4,1]′, and it is A(w)=[1/2,3/4,1]′ since these are the uncertainties in e13 for output states {4, 5, 6}. We will interpret A(w)=[1/2,3/4,1]′ as the output for automata A when it is executed over the fuzzy string w.\nSince in this type of automata transitions are defined using only boolean relations, they can be described using CNNs. Each node depends on a positive or on a negative way from its neighbours, and the relation can be expressed through a sentence in disjunctive form. We can see this translation from a local configuration to an admissible configuration on figure 7. Note what, neuron bias is defined by the number of arrows labelled with zero. In string-base notation it could be write as ci=c1⊕c2⊕c3⊕¬c4⊕¬c5, which can also be seen as a colimit sentence.\n31"

For this we used automata to generate complex artificial data sets.\nWe selected two binary automata described graphically on figure 8, and constructed data sets using information generated through automata execution. This was made selecting possible input configuration with length 6, in a 5-valued Llogic. Where we impose a consistence principle in the automata reading sensor: the uncertainty for sign ’s = 0’, is the negation of sign ’s = 1’ uncertainty. For both automata we generated a data set describing the dependence between states, relating state uncertainty on iteration t with the state in iteration t+ 1. With this data set we reverse engineering the automata structure, using Algorithm 1 presented in last section. Trying predict the uncertainty in each state on iteration t+ 1 using the information, about the automata state uncertainty, in iteration t and the input uncertainty. For each prediction task we selected a rule describing the relationships between states. Figure 9 describes the reverse engineering output for each state, generated using the data produced by the acyclic automata from figure 8.\nEach configuration can be expressed or approximate using a string-based presentation. Each of this formulas is interpreted as knowledge extracted from different views of the data set. The set of all extracted formulas (equalities)\n32\nwe call a theory, and can be codified as an specification system. For acyclic automata, on figure 8, and translating configurations presented in figure 9, we have the theory:\nT0={A2(t+1)=I(at=1), A3(t+1)=¬(¬I(at=1)⊕A4(t)), A4(t+1)=¬(¬A2(t)⊕A6(t)),\nA5(t+1)∼0.97¬A3(t)⊕A4(t)⊕A6(t)⊕¬A7(t), A6(t+1)=¬A2(t), A7(t+1)=A6(t)}\nThis symbolic description allows forecast the automata behaviour. In this case theory T0 isn’t a prefect automata description, since we only have a approximation to automata beaver on state A5. The consistence level of a equational theory T , with a model D, is describes by the disjunction of each similarity level associated to each equality in T . In the case of equational theory T0, we have a consistence level of 0.97. Given a generic word w = s0s1s2s3s4 in the interaction t = 5, the uncertainty on state A4 depends on signs from positions s2 and s3.\nA4(5) = A2(4) ⊗ ¬A6(4) = I(s3 = 1) ⊗ ¬A2(3) = I(s3 = 1) ⊗ I(s2 = 1)\nIn interaction t = 6, the uncertainty on state A5, is given by:\nA5(6) ∼0.97 ¬A3(5) ⊗ A4(5) ⊗ A6(5) ⊗ ¬A7(5) ∼ ¬I(s2 = 1) ⊕ (I(s3 = 1) ⊗ I(s2 = 1)) ⊕ ¬A3(4) ⊕ ¬A6(4) ∼ ¬I(s2 = 1) ⊕ I(s3 = 1) ⊕ ¬I(s3 = 1) ⊕ A4(3) ⊕ A3(3) ∼ 1\nFrom a functional point of view, knowledge integrated in theory T0, are interpreted using the first Lukasiewicz neural network on figure 10. This NN configuration results from integrating NNs presented on figure 9. The resulting NN have 6 outputs, one for each non input state.\nIntegrating configuration representing knowledge in an NN usually introduce redundancies. In the sense that the same or similar information is codified by different configurations in different locations. This can be minimized by regularizing the produced NN using ”Optimal Brain Surgeon” method [14].\nIn the other direction, every formula in Lukasiewicz logic can be used to describe a state uncertainty. By this we mean that, for every formula we can define an automata with a state having by uncertainty level the result of formula\n33\nevaluation, after some interactions. For this the automata must have by input a string, having by first position the uncertainty on formula arguments, followed by marks with uncertainty zero for every possible sign. The number of positions in input sting must be equal to the formula parsing tree height.\nInjecting a formula in an automata structure is a simple process. For this we must note what every formula can be expressed in the disjunctive normal form, i.e. using only the connectives disjunction and negation. For instance the formula ((a⊗ b)⊕ c) → d, is equivalent to ¬(¬(¬a ⊕ ¬b) ⊕ c) ⊕ d, evaluated as the uncertainty on state E, after 4 interaction, using automata describe in figure 11. Note that, this defines a concept view R:O×{a,b,c,d}⇀{E}."

      "heading" : "7 CONCLUSIONS",
      "text" : "This methodology to codify and extract symbolic knowledge from a NN is very simple and efficient for the extraction of comprehensible rules from medium-sized data sets. It is, moreover, very sensible to attribute relevance.\n36\nIn the theoretical point of view it is particularly interesting that restricting the values assumed by neurons weights restrict the information propagation in the network, thus allowing the emergence of patterns in the neuronal network structure. For the case of linear neuronal networks, having by activation function the identity truncate to 0 and 1, these structures are characterized by the occurrence of patterns in neuron configuration directly presentable as formulas in Llogic.\nThe application of procedures like the one above, on information systems, generates grates amount of information. We organize this information in a specification systems using a relational language. And we propose this language as an Interface Layer for AI. Here, classic graphical models like Bayesian and Markov networks have to some extent played the part of an interface layer, but one with a limited range having insufficiently expressive for general AI [37]."

In this work we extend traditional algebraic specification methods [2] in this direction. Here we assume that such interface for AI emerges from an adequate Neural-Symbolic integration [3]. This integration is made for universe of discourse described on a Topos[4] governed by a many-valued Lukasiewicz logic. Sentences are integrated in a symbolic knowledge base describing the problem domain, codified using a graphicbased language, wherein every logic connective is defined by a neuron in an artificial network. This allows the integration of first-order formulas into a network architecture as background knowledge, and simplifies symbolic rule extraction from trained networks. For the train of such neural networks we changed the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm [5], restricting the knowledge dissemination in the network structure using soft crystallization. This procedure reduces neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the learning performance, allowing the emergence of symbolic patterns. This makes the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar to the descriptive power of Lukasiewicz logic language, reducing the information lost on translation between symbolic and connectionist structures. We tested this method on the extraction of knowledge from specified structures. For it, we present the notion of fuzzy state automata, and we use automata behaviour to infer its structure. We use this type of automata on the generation of models for relations specified as symbolic background knowledge. Using the involved automata behaviour as data sets, we used our learning methodology, to extract new insights about the models, and inject them into the specification. This allows the improvement about the problem domain knowledge. ———————————————————————–",
