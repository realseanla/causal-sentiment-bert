      "text" : "Fuzzy graphs have demonstrated to properly capture imprecision\nof real world problems [4, 6]. Hence, we have used algebraic struc-\nture of fuzzy graphs for capturing the imprecision associated with\nstrengths of value-related dependencies. We have specially modi-\ned the classical de nition of fuzzy graphs in order to consider not\nonly the strengths but also the qualities (positive or negative) [5–7]\nof value-related dependencies (De nition 1).\nDe nition 1. Value Dependency Graph (VDG). A VDG is a signed\ndirected fuzzy graph [11] G = (E,σ , ρ) in which a non-empty set\nof elements E : {e1, ..., en} constitute the graph nodes. Also, the qualitative function σ : E × E → {+,−,±} and the membership\nfunction ρ : E×E → [0, 1] denote qualities and strengths of explicit\nvalue-related dependencies receptively. As such, a pair of elements\n(ei , ej ) with ρi, j , 0 and σi, j , ± denotes an explicit value-related dependency from ei to ej . It is clear that we have ρi, j = 0 if the value of an element ei is not explicitly in uenced by selecting or ignoring ej . In such cases we have σi, j = ± where ± denotes the quality of (ei , ej ) is non-speci ed.\nDe nition 2. Value-Related Dependencies. A value-related depen-\ndency in a VDGG = (E,σ , ρ) is de ned as a sequence of elements di : ( e(1), ..., e(k) ) such that for each e(j) in di , 2 ≤ j ≤ k , we have ρj−1, j , 0. A consecutive pair ( e(j − 1), e(j) ) speci es an explicit value-related dependency from e(j − 1) to e(j).\ne strength of a value-related dependency di : ( e(1), ..., e(k) )\nis calculated by (1). at is, the strength of a value-related depen-\ndency equals to the strength of the weakest of all the k − 1 explicit\nvalue-related dependencies along the path. ∧ denote Zadeh’s [14]\nfuzzy AND operator that is taking minimum over operands.\n∀di : ( e(1), ..., e(k) ) , ρ(di ) =\nk ∧\nj=2\nρj−1, j (1)\ne quality of a value-related dependency di : ( e(1), ..., e(k) )\non the other hand, is calculated through employing qualitative se-\nquential inference [2, 3, 12] as given by (2).\n∀di : ( e(1), ..., e(k) ) , σ (di ) =\nk ∏\nj=2\nσj−1, j (2)\nLet D = {d1,d2, ...,dm} be the set of all explicit and implicit value-related dependencies from ei ∈ E to ej ∈ E in a VDG G = (E,σ , ρ). As explained earlier, positive and negative value-related\ndependencies can simultaneously exist between a pair of elements\nei and ej . e strength of all positive value-related dependencies from ei to ej is denoted by ρ +∞ i, j and calculated by (3), that is to nd the strength of the strongest positive value-related dependency [8]\namong all the positive value-related dependencies from ei to ej . Fuzzy operators ∧ and ∨ denote Zadeh’s [14] fuzzy AND (tak-\ning minimum) and fuzzy OR (taking maximum) operations respec-\ntively. In a similar way, the strength of all negative value-rrelated dependencies from ei to ej is denoted by ρ −∞ i, j and calculated by (4).\nρ+∞i, j = ∨\ndm ∈D σ (dm )=+\nρ(dm) (3)\nρ−∞i, j = ∨\ndm ∈D σ (dm )=−\nρ(dm) (4)\nIi, j = ρ +∞ i, j − ρ −∞ i, j (5)\ne overall strength of all positive and negative value-related de-\npendencies from ei to ej , is referred to as the Overall In uence of ej on the value of ei and denoted by Ii, j . As given by (5), Ii, j ∈ [−1, 1] is calculated by subtracting the strength of all negative value-related dependencies (ρ−∞i, j ) from the strength of all positive value-related dependencies (ρ+∞i, j ). Ii, j > 0 states that ej will ultimately in uence the value of ei in a positive way whereas Ii, j < 0 indicates that the ultimate in uence of ej on ei is negative."

      "text" : "e extent to which the value of an element ei is in uenced by ignoring positive value-related dependencies and/or selecting nega-\ntive value-related dependencies ofei , is referred to as the penalty [6] of ei and denoted by pi . pi is calculated by taking supremum over the overall in uences of all ignored positive dependencies and se-\nlected negative dependencies of ei as given by (6).

Also, wi and vi denote weight and value of an element ei respectively whileW speci es the capacity of the knapsack.

Integer lin-\near programming models on the other hand, are known to be solv-\nable e ciently due to the advances in tools [10].\nHence, we have converted (7) to its corresponding linear form\nby substituting the non-linear expression xipi with the linear expression yi (yi = xipi ). As such, either a : (xi = 0) → (yi = 0), or b : (xi = 1) → (yi = pi ) can occur. In order to capture the relation betweenpi andyi in a linear form, we have introduced an auxiliary variable дi = {0, 1} and Constraints (14)-(18) are added to the initial model.
