    "abstractText" : "Much recent research in decision theoretic plan­ ning has adopted Markov decision processes (MOPs) as the model of choice, and has at­ tempted to make their solution more tractable by exploiting problem structure. One particular al­ gorithm, structured policy construction achieves this by means of a decision theoretic analog of goal regression, using action descriptions based on Bayesian networks with tree-structured condi­ tional probability tables. The algorithm as pre­ sented is not able to deal with actions with cor­ related effects. We describe a new decision theo­ retic regression operator that corrects this weak­ ness. While conceptually straightforward, this extension requires a somewhat more complicated technical approach.",
