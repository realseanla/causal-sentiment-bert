    "abstractText" : "To coordinate with other agents in its envi­ ronment, an agent needs models of what the other agents are trying to do. When com­ munication is impossible or expensive, this information must be acquired indirectly via plan recognition. Typical approaches to plan recognition start with a specification of the possible plans the other agents may be follow­ ing, and develop special techniques for dis­ criminating among the possibilities. Perhaps more desirable would be a uniform procedure for mapping plans to general structures sup­ porting inference based on uncertain and in­ complete observations. In this paper, we de­ scribe a set of methods for converting plans represented in a flexible procedural language to observation models represented as proba­ bilistic belief networks.",
