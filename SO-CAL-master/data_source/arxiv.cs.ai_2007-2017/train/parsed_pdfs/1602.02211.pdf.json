      "text" : "Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) stands at the crossroads of logic, graph theory and computer science in general. For this reason, nowadays more problems are being solved faster by SAT solvers than other means. A lot of real-life problems are difficult to solve because they pose computational challenges. In many of these problems, it is not sufficient to find a solution but rather one that is optimal. These are called optimization problems and they arise frequently in the real world. One of the most effective ways to solve optimization problems is to first model them mathematically or logically, then solve them using a suitable algorithm.\nMaximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) is the optimization version of SAT. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing efficient algorithms[18, 19] and implementing them into competent solvers that could solve instances from real-life applications[6, 12, 21, 4, 5]. In fact, an annual competition called The MaxSAT Evaluations is held for the purpose of running recent solvers on categories of benchmarks (random, crafted and industrial instances) then declaring a winner for each categories. Indeed, the performance of MaxSAT solvers is getting better with time and hence it is becoming more feasible to solve practical problems using MaxSAT.\nFuzzy logic is an extension of Boolean logic by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965 based on the theory of fuzzy sets, which is a generalization of the classical set theory. Introducing the notion of degree in the verification of a condition enables a condition to be in a state other than true or false (thus, infinite truth degrees).\nFuzzy logic provides a very valuable flexibility for reasoning, which makes it possible to take into account inaccuracies and vagueness."

      "text" : "A Boolean variable x can take one of two possible values: 1 or 0. A literal l is a variable x or its negation ¬x. A disjunction C is a group of r literals joined by ∨. This is expressed as C =\n∨r i=1 li A Boolean formula φ in Conjunctive\nNormal Form (CNF) is a group ofm disjunctions joined by ∧ (i.e., a conjunction of disjunctions). From now on, we will refer to a disjunction in a CNF formula as a clause. If φ consists of m clauses where each clause Ci is composed of ri literals, then φ can be written as\nφ = m ∧\ni=1\nCi\nwhere\nCi =\nri ∨\nj=1\nli,j\nA formula is said to be k-CNF if each clause has exactly k literals. Sometimes we consider a CNF formula as a set of clauses φ = {C1, . . . , Cm}. A Boolean CNF formula will be referred to as just a formula for short. If φ is a formula over the n variables x1, . . . , xn, then a complete assignment of φ is a set A = {x1 = b1, . . . , xn = bn}, where each bi, (1 ≤ i ≤ n) is either 1 or 0. A partial assignment is an assignment that leaves out some variables unassigned. An assignment A (complete or partial) satisfies a literal x if x is assigned 1 in A and satisfies a literal ¬x if x is assigned 0 in A. A clause C is satisfied by A if at least one literal of C is satisfied by A. A formula φ is satisfied by A if A satisfies all the clauses of φ.\nThe decision version of the SAT problem, given a formula φ, is deciding whether there exists an assignment that satisfies φ. The search version is concerned with finding (searching) for a satisfying assignment for φ. For example, φ1 = {(x1 ∨ ¬x2), (¬x1 ∨ x3), (¬x1 ∨ x2 ∨ ¬x3)} has the satisfying assignment A1 = {x1 = 1, x2 = 0, x3 = 0}. The formula φ2 = {(x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3 ∨ x4 ∨ ¬x5), (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3 ∨ ¬x4 ∨ x5), (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ ¬x3 ∨ x4 ∨ x5), (x1 ∨ ¬x2 ∨ x3 ∨ x4 ∨ x5), (¬x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3 ∨ x4 ∨ x5), (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ x3 ∨ x4 ∨ x5)} has the solution A2 = {x1 = 0, x2 = 1, x3 = 1, x4 = 0, x5 = 0}, which indeed satisfies φ2."

      "text" : "Maximum Satisfiability is a generalization of SAT. The idea behind it is that sometimes not all restrictions of a problem can be satisfied, and we try to satisfy as much of them as possible.\nGiven a CNF formula φ, MaxSAT asks for an assignment that maximizes the number of satisfied clausespipatsrisawat2007clone. For example, φ = {(y ∨ z), (¬z), (x ∨ ¬y), (¬x ∨ z)} has A = {x = 0, y = 0, z = 0} as a solution. The maximum number of satisfied clauses in φ is three. Table 1.1 shows all the possible assignments for φ and the number of clauses that each one satisfies.\nThere are two general techniques to solve MaxSAT: (1) branch and bound algorithms, and (2) SAT-based algorithms. Branch and bound algorithms[8]\nwork by searching the binary tree of all partial assignments to the variables of the input formula. The procedure starts with the empty assignment at the root of the tree and traverses it in a depth-first manner to find an optimal complete solution (represented by leaf nodes). Branching occurs on an unassigned variable at some node and the children of this node correspond to assigning the variable 1 or 0. Later works added more effective techniques in order to boost the search. Namely, more efficient data-structures, new branching heuristics, new simplification rules and more accurate lower bounds[20, 1, 22, 23, 15, 13]. In practice, branch and bound Max-SAT solvers are suitable for instances generated at random and some crafted ones.\nSAT-based MaxSAT algorithms[10, 17, 16, 14, 2] are based on iteratively calling a SAT solver. These techniques work by maintaining and refining a lower bound and/or an upper bound to the optimal solution with the help of a SAT-solver. It has been found that these techniques are particularly suitable for benchmarks coming from industrial applications and some crafted ones. One way to do this, given a Max-SAT instance, is to check if there is an assignment that falsifies no clauses. If such an assignment can not be found, the algorithm checks if there is an assignment that falsifies only one clause. This is repeated and each time the algorithm increments the number of clauses that are allowed to be falsified until the SAT solver returns 1 (or true), meaning that the minimum number of falsified clauses has been determined. Comprehensive surveys on SAT-based MaxSAT solving can be found in[18, 3]."

We will be dealing with five operations, namely negation (¬), the strong and weak disjunction (⊕ and ∨ respectively) and the strong and weak conjunction (⊙ and ∧ respectively).\nGiven a formula φ in Lukasiewicz logic and an assignment I, we say that I satisfies φ iff [φ]I = 1.\nExample 1.1. Let φ = ¬(x1 ⊙ x2 ⊙ ¬x3). Consider the following two assignments:\n1. I1 with I1(x1) = 0, I1(x2) = 0, I1(x3) = 1.\n[φ]I1 = ¬(max{0 + 0− 1, 0} ⊙ ¬1) = ¬(0 ⊙ 0) = ¬0 = 1\n2.

Like its classical counterpart, it is useful for solving a variety of problems. We say that a formula φ in Lukasiewicz logic is satisfiable iff there exists an assignment I such that [φ]I = 1.\nExample 1.2. In the previous example, φ is satisfiable since there exists an assignment (I1) that satisfies it.\nAn assignment I is said to be a model of a set of formulas Φ iff l ≤ [α]I ≤ u for every formula α ∈ Φ, given a lower bound l and upper bound u for that formula (usually u = 1, and in classical logic even both l = u = 1).\nSolving satisfiability in fuzzy logics is still growing in theory as well as in application. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, MaxSAT has not been defined over fuzzy logic."

Given a set of formulae Φ in Lukasiewicz logic, the MaxSAT problem asks for an assignment I that maximizes the number of satisfied formulae in Φ.\nFrom now on we will call the MaxSAT problem defined over propositional logic “Boolean MaxSAT” and the one defined over Lukasiewicz logic “fuzzy MaxSAT”.\nDefinition 2.2. The fuzzy Partial MaxSAT problem (fuzzy PMaxSAT) for the Lukasiewicz set of formulae φ = S ∪ H is the problem of finding an assignment that satisfies all the formulae in H and maximizes the number of satisfied formulae in S.\nExample 2.1. Consider solving fuzzy MaxSAT on φ in example 1. Assignment I1 is a solution since [φ]I1 = 1, which is the largest truth degree possible.\nTheorem 2.1. Boolean MaxSAT is reducible to fuzzy PMaxSAT in polynomial time.\nProof. Let φ be a instance Boolean MaxSAT instance. We will construct a fuzzy MaxSAT instance φ′ = S ∪ H such that I maximizes the number of satisfied clauses in φ iff I maximizes the number of clauses in φ′, where I is an assignment.\nWe construct S and H as follows:\n1. For every variable x appearing in H , add the formula ¬(x⊕ x)⊕ x to φ′. This formula evaluates to 1 iff xk = 0 or xk = 1.\n2. For every clause (l1 ∨ . . . ∨ li) in φ, add the formula (l1 ⊕ . . .⊕ li) to S.\nThus H = {¬(x⊕ x)⊕ x | x appears in φ}\nand S = {(l1 ⊕ . . .⊕ li) | (l1 ∨ . . . ∨ li) ∈ φ}\nIf the number of variables appearing in φ is n and |φ| = m, then |φ′| = n+m such that |S| = m and |H | = n.\nAssume that there are k satisfied clauses in φ. Then every variable x evaluates to either 0 or 1. Thus, every ¬(x ⊕ x) ⊕ x is satisfied and hence all H is satisfied. If a clause (l1∨ . . .∨ lm) is satisfied, then (l1⊕ . . .⊕ lm) is also satisfied. Hence, there are exactly k satisfied formulae in S.\nNow assume that I is a solution that satisfies k clauses in S. Then surely every variable x appearing in φ′ has a value either 0 or 1. This is because I certainly satisfies all formulae in H , which ensure just that. Since the semantics of the strong disjunction when restricted to 0 and 1 is identical to the semantics of Boolean disjunction, then if (l1⊕. . .⊕li) ∈ S is satisfied then so is (l1∨. . .∨li) ∈ φ. Therefore, I satisfies exactly k clauses in φ."

It has been shown[7] that the satisfiability problem for any simple L-clausal form is solvable in linear time, contrary to the SAT problem in Boolean logic which is NP-complete in the general case. In addition, the expressiveness of simple L-clausal forms is limited. That is, not every Lukasiewicz formula has an equivalent simple L-clausal form. To remedy this matter, another form has been proposed called L-clausal form, for which the SAT problem is NP-complete1.\nDefinition 3.1. Let X = {x1, . . . , xn} be a set of variables. A literal is either a variable xi ∈ X or ¬xi. A term is a literal or an expression of the form ¬(l1 ⊕ . . .⊕ lk), where l1, . . . , lk are literals. A L-clause is disjunction of terms.

Moreover, it is based on the basic SAT-based technique of Boolean MaxSAT solving.\nLet φ = {C1, . . . , Cm} be a MaxSAT instance. The following formula is satisfiable iff there are\nφk = {C1 ∨ b1, . . . , Cm ∨ bm} ∪ CNF (\nm ∑\ni=1\nbi ≤ k)\nwhere each bi, (1 ≤ i ≤ m) is a new variable and CNF ( ∑m\ni=1 bi ≤ k) is the encoding of the constraint ∑m\ni=1 bi ≤ k to CNF. This constraint is satisfied if φk has at most k falsified clauses. There are three ways to start searching for the value of k which corresponds to the optimal solution, denoted kopt:\n1The proof involves reducing Boolean 3SAT to the SAT problem for L-clausal forms.\n1. Start at k = 0 and increase k while φk is unsatisfiable.\n2. Start at k = m and decrease k while φk is satisfiable.\n3. Do binary search for kopt: alternate between satisfiable φk and unsatisfiable φk until the algorithm converges to kopt.\nAn interesting question is, can we use the same technique for simple Lclausal forms? Remember that for such forms, the satisfiability problem is solvable in linear time, and thus the time complexity of the resulting algorithm will be a huge improvement over that of Boolean MaxSAT."

Three possible solutions (encodings) are proposed to the new problem: (1) Disjunctive Linear Relations (DLRs), (2) Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and (3) Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP). Like its Boolean counterpart, the extended fuzzy MaxSAT will have numerous applications in optimization problems that involve vagueness.",
