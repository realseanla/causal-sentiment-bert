      "text" : "In this paper, we study how to model exchangeability, a structural assessment for uncertainty models that is important for inference purposes, in the framework of choice functions, an interesting approach to modelling uncertainty. This work builds on the work about exchangeability for lower previsions (see de Cooman et al. (2009)) and exchangeability for sets of desirable gambles (see de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012)).\nChoice functions are related to the fundamental problem in decision theory: how to make a choice from within a set of available options. In their book, von Neumann and Morgenstern (1972) provide an axiomatisation of choice based on pairwise comparison between the options. Later on, Rubin (1987) generalised that idea and proposed a theory of choice functions based on choice between more than two elements. One of the aspects in Rubin (1987)’s theory is that, between any pair of options, the agent either prefers one of them, or he is indifferent between them, so two options can never be incomparable. However, for instance when the information available does not allow for a complete comparison of the options, the agent may be undecided between two options without being indifferent between them; this will for instance typically be the case when there is no relevant information available at all. This is one of the motivations for a theory of imprecise probabilities (see Walley (1991)), where incomparability and indifference are distinguished. Kadane et al. (2004) and Seidenfeld et al. (2010) generalise the axioms in Rubin (1987) to allow for incomparability.\nExchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables. Loosely speaking, making a judgement of exchangeability means that the order in which the variables are observed is considered irrelevant. This irrelevancy will be modelled through an indifference assessment. The first detailed study of exchangeability was de Finetti (1937). For a brief historical overview, we refer to Ref. (de Cooman and Quaeghebeur, 2012, Sec. 1).\nIn Sec. 2, we will recall the necessary tools for modelling indifference with choice functions. Next, in Sec. 3, we will derive de Finetti-like Representation Theorems for a finite sequence that is exchangeable. We will take this one step further in Sec. 4, where we consider a countable sequence and derive a representation theorem for such sequences. Because it will be useful to compare\nwith de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), we will also provide representation theorems for sets of desirable gambles."

      "text" : "The material in this section is based on (Van Camp et al., 2017, Sec. 5). Consider a real vector space V , provided with the vector addition and scalar multiplication. Elements u of V are intended as abstract representations of options amongst which a subject can express his preferences, by specifying, as we will see below, choice functions. Mostly, options will be real-valued maps on the possibility space, interpreted as uncertain rewards, and therefore also called gambles. The set of all gambles on the possibility space X will be denoted as L(X). Given any subset O of V , we will define the linear hull span(O) ∶= {∑nk=1λkuk ∶ n ∈ N,λk ∈ R,uk ∈ O} ⊆ V and the positive hull posi(O) ∶= {∑nk=1λkuk ∶ n ∈N,λk ∈R>0,uk ∈O} ⊆ span(O), where R>0 is the set of all (strictly) positive real numbers. A subset O of V is called a convex cone if it is closed under positive finite linear combinations, i.e. if posi(O) = O. A convex cone K is called proper if K∩−K = {0}. With any proper convex cone K ⊆V , we associate an ordering ⪯K on V as follows: u ⪯K v⇔ v−u ∈ K for any u and v in V . For any u and v in V , we write u ≺K v if u ⪯K v and u ≠ v. We collect all the options u for which 0 ≺K u in V≻0. When we work with gambles, then V = L(X) and the ordering will be the standard one ≤, given by f ≤ g⇔(∀x ∈ X) f (x) ≤ g(x). We collect the positive gambles—gambles f for which 0 < f—in L(X)>0. Then ≤ corresponds to ⪯K where we let K ∶= L(X)>0∪{0}.\nWe denote by Q(V) the set of all non-empty finite subsets of V . Elements of Q(V) are the option sets amongst which a subject can choose his preferred options.\nA choice function C on V is a map C∶Q→Q∪{∅}∶O ↦C(O) such that C(O) ⊆O. Not every such map represents a rational belief; only the coherent choice functions do. We call a choice function C on V coherent1 if, for all O, O1 and O2 in Q(V), all u and v in V , and all λ in R>0: C1. C(O) ≠ ∅; C2. if u ≺ v then {v} =C({u,v}); C3. a. ifC(O2) ⊆O2∖O1 and O1 ⊆O2 ⊆O then C(O) ⊆O∖O1; b. ifC(O2) ⊆O1 and O ⊆O2∖O1 then C(O2∖O) ⊆O1; C4. a. if O1 ⊆C(O2) then λO1 ⊆C(λO2);\nb. if O1 ⊆C(O2) then O1+{u} ⊆C(O2+{u}).\nConsider two isomorphic vector spaces V and W , a linear order isomorphism φ between V and W , and a choice function C on V . Define the choice function C′ onW as u ∈C(O)⇔ φ(u) ∈C′(φ(O)) for all O in Q(V) and u in O. Then, because φ is a bijection, C satisfies Axioms C1 and C3 if and only if C′ does; furthermore, because φ is order preserving, C satisfies Axiom C2 if and only if C ′ does; and finally, because φ is linear,C satisfies Axiom C4 if and only ifC ′ does: such isomorphisms preserve coherence.\nA set of desirable options (or gambles) D ⊆V is essentially the restriction to pairwise comparison of a choice function: D = {u ∈ V ∖{0} ∶ {u} =C({0,u})}. We call D coherent if 0 ∉ D, V≻0 ⊆ D, u ∈D⇒ λu ∈D, and u,v ∈D⇒ u+v ∈D for all u and v in V and λ in R>0. D is coherent if the choice function C it is based on, is coherent.\nSince, as we will see, an exchangeability assessment amounts to a specific indifference assessment, we recall how to model an indifference assessment. For more information, we refer\n1. Our rationality axioms are based on those in Seidenfeld et al. (2010), slightly modified for use with sets of desirable\ngambles.\nto (Van Camp et al., 2017, Sec. 5). Next to C(O)—the options that the agent strictly prefers from O—or D—the options that he strictly prefers to 0—we consider the options that the agent considers to be equivalent to the zero option I ⊆ V . We call I coherent if, for all u and v in V and λ in R: I1. 0 ∈ I; I2. if u ∈ V≻0∪V≺0 then u ∉ I; I3. if u ∈ I then λu ∈ I; I4. if u,v ∈ I then u+v ∈ I. We collect all options that are indifferent to an option u in V into the equivalence class [u] ∶= {v ∈ V ∶ v−u ∈ I} = {u}+ I. The set of all these equivalence classes is the quotient space V/I ∶= {[u] ∶ u ∈ V}, being a linear space itself. We provide it with the natural ordering inherited from V: ũ ⪯ ṽ⇔ (∃u ∈ ũ,v ∈ ṽ)u ⪯ v for all ũ and ṽ in V/I.\nConsider any coherent set of indifferent options I. A choice functionC is then called compatible with I if there is some representing choice function C′ on V/I such that C(O) = {u ∈ O ∶ [u] ∈ C′(O/I)} for all O in Q(V). In that case, C′ is uniquely determined by C′(O/I) =C(O)/I for all O in Q(V), and, moreover, C is coherent if and only if C′ is. Equivalently, we find the following useful characterisation: C is compatible with I if and only if 0 ∈C(O)⇔ u ∈C(O) for all u in I and O ⊇ {0,u} in Q(V), which corresponds to the definition of indifference in Ref. Seidenfeld (1988).\nFor desirability, compatibility with a coherent set of indifferent options I is defined as follows. We call a set of desirable gambles D compatible with I if D+I ⊆D, and this is equivalent toD =⋃D′ where D′ ⊆ V/I is the representing set of desirable options. In that case, D′ is uniquely given by D′ =D/I, and, moreover, D is coherent if and only if D′ is."

The possibility space of the uncertain sequence (X1, . . . ,Xn) is X n .\nWe denote by x = (x1, . . . ,xn) an arbitrary element of X n . For any n in Nwe call Pn the group of all permutations π of the index set {1, . . . ,n}. There are ∣Pn ∣ = n! such permutations. With any such permutation π, we associate a permutation of X n , also denoted by π, and defined by (πx)k ∶= xπ(k) for every k in {1, . . . ,n}, or in other words, π(x1, . . . ,xn) = (xπ(1), . . . ,xπ(n)). Similarly, we lift π to a permutation πt on L(X n) by letting πt f = f ○π, so (πt f )(x) ∶= f (πx) for all x in X n . Observe that πt is a linear permutation of the vector space L(X n) of all gambles on X n .\nIf a subject assesses that the sequence of variables X inX n is exchangeable, this means precisely that he is indifferent between any gamble f on X n and its permuted variant πt f , for any π in Pn . This leads us to the following proposal for the corresponding set of indifferent gambles:\nIPn ∶= span{ f −πt f ∶ f ∈L(X n),π ∈Pn}. Definition 1 A choice function C on L(X n) is called (finitely) exchangeable if it is compatible with IPn . Similarly, a set of desirable gambles D ⊆ L(X n) is called (finitely) exchangeable if it is compatible with IPn .\nOf course, so far, we do not yet know whether this notion of exchangeability is well-defined: indeed, we do not know yet whether IPn is a coherent set of indifferent gambles. In the next section, we will show that this is indeed the case."

      "text" : "In this section, we will provide the tools necessary to prove that IPn is a coherent set of indifferent gambles. In de Cooman et al. (2009) and de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), all the maps we use here are defined.\nThe permutation invariant atoms [x] ∶= {πx ∶ x ∈ X n}, x in X n are the smallest permutation invariant subsets of X n . We introduce the counting map T ∶X n → N n ∶x ↦ T (x) where T (x) is called the count vector of x. It is the X -tuple with components Tz(x) ∶= ∣{k ∈ {1, . . . ,n} ∶ xk = z}∣ for all z in X , so Tz is the number of times that z occurs in the sequence x1, . . . , xn . The range of T—the set N n—is called the set of possible count vectors and is given by\nN n ∶= {m ∈ ZX≥0 ∶ ∑ x∈X mx = n}. Remark that applying any permutation to x leaves its result under the counting map unchanged: T (x) = T (πx) for al x in X n and π in Pn . For any x in X n , if m = T (x) then [x] = {y ∈X n ∶ T (y) =m}, so the permutation invariant atom [x] is completely determined by the count vector m of all its elements, and is therefore also denoted by [T (x)] = [m]. Remark that {[m] ∶m ∈N n} partitions X n into disjoint parts with constant count vectors, and that ∣[m]∣ = (n\nm ) ∶= N! ∏z∈X mz! .\nIn order to extend the idea of the count vectors for use with gambles, let us define the set of all permutation invariant gambles as LPn(X n) ∶= { f ∈L(X n) ∶ (∀π ∈Pn)πt f = f} ⊆L(X n), and a special transformation invPn of the linear space L(X n)\ninvPn ∶L(X n)→L(X n)∶ f ↦ invPn ( f ) ∶= 1 N! ∑ π∈Pn πt f , (1)\nwhich, as we will see, is closely linked with LPn(X n) (see de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012); Van Camp et al. (2017)). Proposition 2 invPn is a linear transformation of L(X n), and (i) invPn ○π t = invPn = π t ○ invPn for all π in P;\n(ii) invPn ○ invPn = invPn ; (iii) kern(invPn ) = IPn ; (iv) rng(invPn ) =LPn(X n).\nSo we see that invPn is a linear projection operator that maps any gamble to a permutation invariant counterpart.\nAs shown by de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), the linear projection operator invPn renders a gamble insensitive to permutation by replacing it with the uniform average of all its permutations. As a result, it assumes the same value for all gambles that can be related to each other through some permutation: invPn( f ) = invPn (g) if f = πtg for some π in Pn , for all f and g in L(X n). Furthermore, for any f in L(X n), its transformation invPn ( f ) is permutation invariant and therefore constant on the permutation invariant atoms [m]: (invPn ( f ))(x) = (invPn ( f ))(y) if [x] = [y], for all x and y in X n . We can use the properties of invPn to prove that IPn is suitable for the definition of exchangeability.\nProposition 3 Consider any n in N. Then IPn is a coherent set of indifferent gambles.\nSince IPn is coherent, exchangeability is well-defined, and by the discussion in Sec. 2, the representing choice function C′ is defined on L(X n)/IPn , and, similarly, the representing set of desirable gambles D′ ⊆ L(X n)/IPn . So we shall focus on the quotient space and its elements, exchangeable equivalent classes of gambles.\nBut before we do that, it will pay to further explore the notions we have introduced thus far.\nConsider any f in L(X n). What is the constant value that invPn ( f ) assumes on a permutation invariant atom [m]? To answer this question, consider any x in [m], then (invPn ( f ))(x) = 1 n!∑π∈Pn f (πx) = 1n! ∣Pn ∣∣[m]∣∑y∈{πx∶π∈Pn} f (y) = 1(n m )∑y∈[x] f (y) = 1(n m )∑y∈[m] f (y), whence\ninvPn = ∑ m∈N n Hn(⋅∣m)I[m], (2) where Hn(⋅∣m) is the linear expectation operator associated with the uniform distribution on the invariant atom [m]:\nHn( f ∣m) ∶= 1(n m ) ∑y∈[m] f (y) for all f in L(X n) and m in N n . (3) It characterises a (multivariate) hyper-geometric distribution (see Ref. Johnson et al. (1997)), associated with random sampling without replacement from an urn with n balls of types X , whose composition is characterised by the count vector m.\nThe result of applying a gamble f on X n to the map Hn ∶L(X n)→L(N n)∶ f ↦Hn( f ) ∶=Hn( f ∣⋅) (4)\nis the gamble Hn( f ) on N n that assumes the value 1(n m )∑y∈[m] f (y) for every m in N n ."

      "text" : "We already know that exchangeable choice functions are represented by choice functions on the quotient space L(X n)/IPn , and similar for sets of desirable gambles. In the quest for an elegant representation theorem, we thus need to focus on the quotient space L(X n)/IPn and its elements, which are exchangeable equivalent classes of gambles.\nIn this section we investigate how the representation of permutation invariant gambles helps us find a representation for exchangeable choice functions. To that end, the representation will use equivalence classes [ f ] ∶= { f}+ IPn of gambles, for any f in L(X n). Recall that the quotient spaceL(X n)/IPn ∶= {[ f ] ∶ f ∈L(X n)} is a linear space itself, with additive identity [0] = IPn , and therefore any element f̃ of L(X n)/IPn is invariant under addition of IPn : f̃ + IPn = f̃ . Elements of L(X n)/IPn will be generically denoted as f̃ or g̃.\nProposition 4 Consider any f and g in L(X n). Then [ f ] = [g] if and only if Hn( f ) =Hn(g) Therefore, it makes sense to introduce the map H̃n :\nH̃n ∶L(X n)/IPn →L(N n)∶ f̃ ↦Hn( f ) for any f in f̃ . (5)\nThen Proposition 4 guarantees that elements of L(X n)/IPn are characterised using H̃n , in the sense that f̃ = { f ∈L(X n) ∶Hn( f ) = H̃n( f̃ )} for all f̃ in L(X n)/IPn .\nThe map H̃n takes as input an equivalence class of gambles, and maps it to some representing\ngamble on the count vectors. It will be useful later on to consider some converse map H̃−1n :\nH̃−1n ∶L(N n)→L(X n)/IPn ∶ f ↦ [ ∑ m∈N n f (m)I[m]]. (6) Proposition 5 The maps H̃n as defined in Eq. (5) and H̃ −1 n as defined in Eq. (6) are each other’s inverses. The importance of Prop. 5 lies in the fact that now, H̃n is a bijection between L(X n)/IPn andL(N n), and therefore, exchangeable equivalence classes of gambles are in a one-to-one correspondence with gambles on count vectors.\nL(X n) L(N n)\nL(X n)/IPn\nHn\n[⋅] H̃n\nThe commuting diagram shows the surjections [⋅]∶L(X n)→L(X n)/IPn ∶ f ↦ [ f ] and Hn (indicated with a single arrow), and the bijection H̃n (indicated with a double arrow). Since the representing choice functionC′ is defined fromC through [⋅]—working point-wise on sets—this already suggests thatC′ can be transformed into a choice function on L(N n). To prove that they preserve coherence, there is only one missing link: the ordering between L(X n)/IPn and L(N n) should be preserved.\nTherefore, to define the ordering ⪯ on L(X n)/IPn , as usual, we let ⪯ be inherited by the ordering ≤ on L(X n): f̃ ⪯ g̃⇔(∃ f ∈ f̃ ,∃g ∈ g̃) f ≤ g (7) for all f̃ and g̃ in L(X n)/IPn , turning L(X n)/IPn into an ordered linear space. It turns out that this vector ordering on L(X n)/IPn can be represented elegantly using H̃n : Proposition 6 Consider any f̃ and g̃ in L(X n)/IPn , then f̃ ⪯ g̃ if and only if H̃n( f̃ ) ≤ H̃n(g̃).\nProps. 5 and 6 imply that Hn is a linear order isomorphism."

Since it no longer makes sense to count in such sequences, we first need to find a equivalent representation theorem in terms of something that does not depend on counts. More specifically, we need, for every n in N another order-isomorphic linear space to L(X n)/IPn , that allows for embedding: the linear space for n1 < n2 must be a subspace of the one for n2.\nAll the maps we use here have been introduced by de Cooman et al. (2009). Moreover, we use their idea and work with polynomials on the X -simplex ΣX ∶= {θ ∈ RX ∶ θ ≥ 0,∑x∈X θx = 1}. We consider the special subset V(ΣX ) of L(ΣX ): V(ΣX ) are the polynomial gambles h on ΣX , which are those gambles that are the restriction to ΣX of a multivariate polynomial p on R X , in the sense that h(θ) = p(θ) for all θ in ΣX . We call p then a representation of h. It will be useful to introduce a notation for polynomial gambles with fixed degree n in N: Vn(ΣX ) is the collection of all polynomial gambles that have at least one representation whose degree is not bigger than n. Both V(ΣX ) and Vn(ΣX ) are linear subspaces of L(ΣX ), and, as wanted, for n1 < n2, Vn1(ΣX ) is a subspace of Vn2(ΣX ).\nSome special polynomial gambles are the Bernstein gambles:\nDefinition 8 (Bernstein gambles) Consider any n in N and any m in N n . Define the Bernstein basis polynomial Bm on R\nX as Bm(θ) ∶= (nm)∏x∈X θmxx for all θ in RX . The restriction to ΣX is called a Bernstein gamble, which we also denote as Bm.\nAs shown in de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012); De Bock et al. (2016), the set of all Bernstein gambles forms a basis of the linear space Vn(ΣX ): Proposition 9 Consider any n in N. The set of Bernstein gambles {Bm ∶m ∈N n} constitutes a basis of the linear space Vn(ΣX ).\nAs we have seen, we need linear order isomorphisms to preserve coherence. So we wonder whether there is one between L(X n)/IPn and Vn(ΣX ). In Sec. 3.2 we have seen that there is one between L(X n)/IPn and L(N n), namely H̃n . Therefore, it suffices to find one between L(N n) and Vn(ΣX ). Consider the map\nCoMn ∶L(N n)→ Vn(ΣX )∶r↦ ∑ m∈N n r(m)Bm. (8) Before we can establish that CoMn is a linear order isomorphism, we need to provide the linear space Vn(ΣX ) with an order ⪯nB . We use the proper cone {0}∪posi({Bm ∶ m ∈ N n}) to define the order ⪯nB:\nh1 ⪯ n B h2 ⇔ h2−h1 ∈ {0}∪posi({Bm ∶m ∈ N n}) for all h1 and h2 in Vn(ΣX ).\nThe following proposition is shown in de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012).\nProposition 10 Consider any n in N. Then the map CoMn is a linear order isomorphism between the ordered linear spaces L(N n) and Vn(ΣX ). The linear order isomorphism CoMn helps us to define a linear order isomorphism between the linear spaces L(X n) and Vn(ΣX ), a final tool needed for a representation theorem in terms of polynomial gambles. Indeed, consider for the map Mn ∶=CoMn ○Hn :\nMn ∶L(X n)→ Vn(ΣX )∶ f ↦Mn( f ∣θ), where Mn( f ∣θ) ∶=∑m∈N n ∑y∈[m] f (y)∏x∈X θmxx is the expectation of f associated with the multinomial distribution whose parameters are n and θ . We introduce its version\nM̃n ∶= CoMn ○ H̃n , (9)\nmapping L(X n)/IPn to Vn(ΣX ). There is an immediate connection between Mn and M̃n : they are both compositions of two linear order isomorphisms, and are therefore linear order isomorphisms themselves. Due to Prop. 4, considering any f̃ in L(X n)/IPn , Mn is constant on f̃ , and the value it takes on any element of f̃ is exactly M̃n( f̃ ).\nL(X n)\nL(N n) Vn(ΣX )\nL(X n)/IPn\nHn Mn\n[⋅]\nCoMn\nM̃nH̃n\nThe commuting diagram shows the surjections [⋅], Hn and Mn , and the bijections H̃n , M̃n and CoMn . It shows that both L(N n) and Vn(ΣX ) are order-isomorphic to L(X n)/IPn , so they are both suitable to define a representing choice function on. In Theorem 7, we used the space L(N n).

Furthermore, in that case, C̃ is given by C̃(Mn(O)) =Mn(C(O)) for all O in Q(L(X n)). Finally, C is coherent if and only if C̃ is.\nSimilarly, consider any set of desirable gambles D ⊆ L(X n). Then D is exchangeable if and only if there is a unique representing set of desirable gambles D̃ ⊆Vn(ΣX ) such that D =⋃M̃−1n (D̃). Furthermore, in that case, D̃ is given by D̃ =Mn(D).

Indeed, since we will never be able to know the actual outcome, gambles will never be actually paid-off, and hence every assessment is essentially without any risk. Instead, we believe that it makes sense to only consider choices between gambles of finite structure: gambles that depend upon a finite number of variables only. See De Bock et al. (2016) for more information.\nDefinition 13 (Gambles of finite structure) We will call any gamble that depends only upon a finite number of variables a gamble of finite structure.

      "text" : "We studied exchangeability and we have found counterparts to de Finetti’s finite and countable representation results, in the general setting of choice functions. We have shown that an exchangeability assessment is a particular indifference assessment, where we identified the set of indifferent options. The main idea that made (finite) representation possible is the linear order isomorphism H̃−1n between the quotient space and the set of gambles on count vectors, indicating that (finitely) exchangeable choice functions can be represented by a choice function that essentially represents preferences between urns with n balls of types X with different compositions m. Alternatively, for the countable case, we have shown that there is a polynomial representation.\nChoice functions form a belief structure (see Van Camp et al. (2017)). Therefore, any infimum of coherent choice functions is a coherent choice function itself. Since any infimum of choice functions compatible with some fixed set of indifferent options I, is compatible with I as well (see Van Camp et al. (2017)), our results indicate that, using choice functions, it is conceptually easy to reason about exchangeable sequences: infima of exchangeable and coherent choice functions will be exchangeable and coherent as well.\nA possible future goal is to investigate how exchangeability behaves under updating. It is shown, in de Cooman and Quaeghebeur (2012), that, for exchangeable sets of desirable gambles, updating can be done directly for the representing set of desirable gambles in the count space. We expect this to be the case for choice functions as well."

      "text" : "Proof [Proof of Prop. 3] For Axiom I1, since IPn is a linear span, 0 is included in IPn . For Axiom I2, consider any f in IPn and assume ex absurdo that f ∈ L(X n)>0∪L(X n)<0. If f ∈ L(X n)>0 then πt f ∈ L(X n)>0 for all π in Pn , and therefore invPn ( f ) > 0, a contradiction with Prop. 2(iii). If f ∈L(X n)<0 then, similarly invPn( f ) < 0, again a contradiction with Prop. 2(iii). Axioms I3 and I4 are satisfied because IPn is a linear span.\nProof [Proof of Prop. 4] Infer the following equivalences. Start with [ f ] = [g], what, due to the definition of equivalence classes, is equivalent to f +h1 = g+h2, and equivalently, g− f = h1−h2, for some h1 and h2 in IPn . In turn, since IPn is a linear space, that is equivalent to g− f ∈ IPn . Because ker(invPn ) = IPn [by Proposition 2(iii)], we find equivalently that invPn (g− f ) = 0, and, due to the linearity of invPn , equivalently invPn ( f ) = invPn(g). Use Lemma 20 to find that, indeed, equivalently Hn( f ) =Hn(g).\nLemma 20 Consider any f and g in L(X n). Then invPn ( f ) = invPn(g) if and only if Hn( f ) = Hn(g). Proof [Proof of Lemma 20] Infer the following equivalences. Start with invPn ( f ) = invPn(g), what, by Eq. (2), is equivalent to ∑m∈N n Hn( f ∣m)I[m] =∑m∈N n Hn(g∣m)I[m]. Equivalently, we find that Hn( f ∣m) =Hn(g∣m) for all m in N n . In turn, by Eq. (4), that is equivalent to Hn( f ) =Hn(g). Proof [Proof of Prop. 5] This proof is structured as follows: we show that (i) H̃−1n ○H̃n = idL(X n)/IPn , and (ii) H̃n ○ H̃−1n = idL(N n), together implying that H̃n and H̃ −1 n are each other’s inverses.\nFor (i), consider any f̃ in L(X n)/IPn . We need to show that then H̃−1n (H̃n( f̃ )) = f̃ . Let h be an arbitrary element of f̃ , and f ∶= invPn(h). Then invPn( f ) = invPn (h) by Prop. 2(ii), and therefore, using Lemma 20, Hn( f ) =Hn(h), so Prop. 4 implies that f ∈ f̃ as well. Then H̃n( f̃ ) assumes the value Hn( f )(m) = 1(n m )∑y∈[m] f (y) on every m in N n . But f is constant on every permutation atom [m], so 1(n m )∑y∈[m] f (y) = 1(n\nm ) ∣[m]∣ f (x) = f (x) for every x in [m], and therefore f = ∑\nm∈N n H( f )(m)I[m] = ∑ m∈N n H̃( f̃ )(m)I[m]. (10)\nThen indeed H̃−1n (H̃n( f̃ )) = [∑m∈N n H̃( f̃ )(m)I[m]] = [ f ] = f̃ , where the first equality follows from Eq. (6), the second one from Eq. (10), and the last one from the fact that f ∈ f̃ and [ f ] = { f}+ IPn .\nFor (ii), consider any f in L(N n). We need to show that then H̃n(H̃−1n ( f )) = f . Let g ∶= ∑m∈N n f (m)I[m], being a gamble on X n . Then H̃−1n ( f ) = [g] by Eq. (6), so H̃n(H̃−1n ( f )) = H̃n([g]), and since g ∈ [g], we find using Eq. (5) that H̃n([g]) = Hn(g) and therefore H̃n(H̃−1n ( f )) =Hn(g). The proof is finished if we show that Hn(g) = f . Consider any m′ in N n , and infer that\nHn(g)(m′) = 1( n m′ ) ∑y∈[m′]g(y) = 1 ( n m′ ) ∑y∈[m′] ∑m∈N n f (m)I[m](y)\n= ∑ m∈N n f (m) 1( n m′ ) ∑y∈[m′]I[m](y) = ∑m∈N n f (m)I{m}(m ′) = f (m′),\nwhere the first equality follows from Eq. (3) and the penultimate from the fact that\n1 ( n m′ ) ∑y∈[m′]I[m](y) = ⎧⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎩ 1 if m′ =m, 0 otherwise.\nTherefore indeed H̃n(H̃−1n ( f )) =Hn(g) = f . Proof [Proof of Prop. 6] For necessity, assume that f̃ ⪯ g̃. Then, by Eq. (7), f ≤ g for some f in f̃ and g in g̃. Consider any m in N n , and infer that Hn( f )(m) = 1(n m )∑y∈[m] f (y) ≤ 1(n m )∑y∈[m]g(y) = Hn(g)(m). Then Hn( f ) ≤Hn(g), and therefore, by Eq. (5), indeed H̃n( f̃ ) ≤ H̃n(g̃). For sufficiency, assume that H̃n( f̃ ) ≤ H̃n(g̃). Then, by Eq. (5) and Prop. 4, Hn( f ) ≤Hn(g) for all f in f̃ and g in g̃. Consider any f in f̃ and g in g̃ and let f ′ ∶= invPn( f ) and g′ ∶= invPn (g). Then invPn( f ′) = invPn ( f ) and invPn(g′) = invPn(g) by Prop. 2(ii), so Lemma 20 and Prop. 4 together imply that f ′ ∈ f̃ and g′ ∈ f̃ , so Hn( f ′) ≤ Hn(g′). Then, by Eqs. (4) and (3), 1(n\nm )∑y∈[m] f ′(y) ≤ 1\n(n m )∑y∈[m]g ′(y) for every m in N n . But f ′ and g′ are constant on every [m], so f ′(y) ≤ g′(y) for every y in [m] and every m in N n . Then f ′ ≤ g′, and therefore indeed f̃ ⪯ g̃. Proof [Proof of Theorem 7] We begin with the representation of choice functions. For the first statement, note that C is exchangeability is equivalent to compatibility with IPn [by Def. 1], and equivalently, there is some representing choice function C′ on L(X n)/IPn such thatC(O) = { f ∈O ∶[ f ] ∈C′(O/IPn )} for allO inQ(L(X n)). We use the linear order isomorphism H̃n to define a choice function C̃ on L(N n): we let [ f ] ∈C′(O/IPn )⇔ H̃n([ f ]) ∈ C̃(H̃n(O/IPn)) for all f in L(X n) and O in Q(L(X n)). Since f ∈ [ f ], use Prop. 4 and Eq. (5) to infer that H̃n([ f ]) =Hn( f ). Similarly, infer that H̃n(O/IPn )= {H̃n([g]) ∶ g ∈O} = {Hn(g) ∶ g ∈O}=Hn(O), so [ f ] ∈C′(O/IPn )⇔Hn( f ) ∈ C̃(Hn(O)). Then indeed\nC(O) = { f ∈O ∶Hn( f ) ∈ C̃(Hn(O))} for all O in Q(L(X n)). To show that C̃ is unique, use that C′ is unique and H̃n is a bijection to infer that C̃ is unique too.\nFor the second statement, consider any O inQ(L(X n)) and infer, using the definition of C̃, that C̃(H̃n(O/IPn)) = H̃n(C′(O/IPn )) , and therefore C̃(Hn(O)) = H̃n(C′(O/IPn)). Since C′ is given by C′(O/IPn) =C(O)/IPn , we find H̃n(C′(O/IPn)) = H̃n(C(O)/IPn) = Hn(C(O)), and therefore indeed C̃(Hn(O)) =Hn(C(O)).\nFor the third statement, by the compatibility with IPn guarantees that C is coherent if and only if C′ on L(X n)/IPn is coherent. But since C̃ is defined from C′ using the linear order isomorphism Hn , we have immediately that C̃ is coherent if and only if C ′ is coherent. Therefore indeed C is coherent if and only if C̃ is coherent.\nWe now turn to the representation for sets of desirable gambles. Since D is compatible with IPn , there is some representing set of desirable gambles D ′ ⊆ L(X n)/IPn such that D =⋃D′. Using the linear order isomorphism H̃n we can transform D ′ to D̃ ∶= H̃n(D′) on the isomorphic space L(N n). Then D′ = H̃−1n (D̃), so indeed D =⋃H̃−1n (D̃). Because compatibility with IPn guarantees that D′—and therefore also D̃—is unique, we have shown the first statement to be true.\nFor the second statement, infer that indeed D̃ = H̃n(D′) =Hn(D) by Eq. (5).\nFor the third statement, compatibility with IPn guarantees that D is coherent if and only if D ′ is coherent. But since D̃ is defined from D′ using the linear order isomorphism Hn , we have immediately that D̃ is coherent if and only if D′ is coherent. Therefore indeed D is coherent if and only if D̃ is coherent.\nProof [Proof of Theorem 11] Let C′′ on L(N n) and D′′ ⊆ L(N n) be the representing choice function and set of desirable gambles from Theorem 7, and let C̃ be defined by\nCoMn( f ) ∈ C̃(CoMn(O))⇔ f ∈C′′(O) for all O in Q(L(N n)), and D̃ ∶= CoMn(D′′). Since CoMn is a linear order isomorphism, then Mn( f ) ∈ C̃(Mn(O)) ⇔ Hn( f ) ∈C′′(Hn(O)) for all O in Q(L(X n)), and D̃ = CoMn(Hn(D)) = Mn(D), and all the coherence properties are preserved, from which the statements follow. Proof [Proof of Prop. 15] For Axiom I1, since, by Prop. 3, 0 ∈ IPn for every n in N, also 0 ∈ IP . For Axiom I2, consider any f in IP , then there is some n in N for which f ∈ IPn By Prop. 3, we infer that indeed f /< 0 and f /> 0. For Axioms I3 and I4, consider any f1, f2 and f3 in IP and any λ in R. Then there are ni inN such that fi ∈ IPni , for every i in {1,2,3}. Let n ∶=max{n1,n2,n3}. Then f1, f2 and f3 are elements of IPn , so λ f1 ∈ IPn and f2+ f3 ∈ IPn by Prop. 3. Then indeed λ f1 ∈ IP and f2+ f3 ∈ IP .\nProof [Proof of Prop. 17] The proof for sets of desirable gambles, in a more general context, can be found in (De Bock et al., 2016, Proposition 18).\nWe give the proof for choice functions. For necessity, assume that C is exchangeable, or equivalently, that C is compatible with IP . Use Ref. (Van Camp et al., 2017, Proposition 31) to infer that then, equivalently,\n(∀h̃ ∈ IP)(∀Õ ∈ Q(L̄(XN)))({0, h̃} ⊆ Õ⇒(0 ∈C(Õ)⇔ h̃ ∈C(Õ))). (11) Consider any n in N. We need to prove that then Cn is compatible with IPn , or equivalently, that\n(∀h ∈ IPn )(∀O ∈ Q(L(X n)))({0,h} ⊆O⇒(0 ∈Cn(O)⇔ h ∈Cn(O))). (12) So consider any O in Q(L(X n)) such that 0 ∈ O, and any h in O. Then O is an element of Q(L̄(XN)) and h an element of L̄(XN), so 0 ∈C(O)⇔ h ∈C(O). Therefore, by marginalisation, 0 ∈Cn(O)⇔ h ∈Cn(O), whence Cn is compatible with IPn , and therefore indeed exchangeable.\nFor sufficiency, assume that Cn is exchangeable for every n in N—so it satisfies Eq. (12) for every n in N. We need to prove that then C is exchangeable. Using Eq. (11), it suffices to consider any Õ in Q(L̄(XN)) such that 0 ∈ Õ, and any h̃ in Õ, and prove that 0 ∈C(Õ)⇔ h̃ ∈C(Õ). Since Õ ∪ {h̃} consist of gambles of finite structure, there is some (sufficiently large) n in N for which Õ ∈Q(L(X n)) and h̃ ∈L(X n). Then by Eq. (12), 0 ∈Cn(Õ)⇔ h̃ ∈Cn(Õ), so 0 ∈C(Õ)⇔ h̃ ∈C(Õ), whence C is compatible with IP , and therefore indeed exchangeable.\nProof [Proof of Prop. 18] We only prove sufficiency, since necessity is trivial. So consider any C′ on V(ΣX ) such that for every n in N,C′n is coherent. We prove that then C′ is coherent.\nFor Axiom C1, consider any O in V(ΣX ). Then every polynomial in O has a certain degree; let n be the maximum of those degrees. Then O ∈ Q(Vn(ΣX )), whence indeed C′(O) =C′n(O) ≠ ∅, since C′n is coherent.\nFor Axiom C2, consider any h1 and h2 in V(ΣX ) such that h1 ⪯B h2. Then h2 −h1 ∈ posi({Bm ∶ m ∈ N n ,n ∈ N}). Let n1 be the degree of h1 and n2 the degree of h2, and let n ∶= max{n1,n2}. Then the degree of the polynomial h2 −h1 is not higher than n, so h2 −h1 ∈ Vn(ΣX ) and therefore h2−h1 ∈ posi({Bm ∶m ∈ N n}). That guarantees that h1 ⪯nB h2, whence indeed {h2} =C′n({h1,h2}) = C′({h1,h2}), since C′n is coherent.\nFor Axiom C3, consider any O, O1 and O2 in Q(V(ΣX )), and let n be the highest degree that appears inO∪O1∪O2. ThenO,O1 andO2 all are elements ofQ(Vn(ΣX )). For Axiom C3a, assume thatC′(O2) ⊆O2∖O1 and O1 ⊆O2 ⊆O. ThenC′n(O2) ⊆O2∖O1 and therefore, since C′n is coherent, indeed C′(O) =C′n(O) ⊆O∖O1. For Axiom C3b, assume that C′(O2) ⊆O1 and O ⊆O2∖O1. Then C′n(O2) ⊆O2∖O1 and therefore, since C′n is coherent, indeed C′(O2∖O) =C′n(O2∖O) ⊆O1.\nFor Axiom C4, consider any h in V(ΣX ), any λ in R>0 and any O1 and O2 in Q(V(ΣX )), and let n be the highest degree that appears in {h}∪O1∪O2. Then h ∈ Vn(ΣX ) and O1 and O2 both are elements of Q(Vn(ΣX )). Assume that O1 ⊆C′(O2) =C′n(O2), then, since C′n is coherent, indeed λO1 ⊆C ′ n(λO2) =C′(λO2) and O1+{h} ⊆C′n(O2+{h}) =C′(O2+{h}).\nProof [Proof of Theorem 19] We first prove the representation theorem for choice functions. That C is exchangeable is, by Prop. 17, equivalent to, Cn is exchangeable, for every n in N. Therefore, for all n in N, by Theorem 11, that is equivalent to\nCn(O) = { f ∈O ∶Mn( f ) ∈ C̃n(Mn(O))} for all O in Q(L(X n)), where C̃n is uniquely given by C̃n(Mn(O)) =Mn(Cn(O)) for all O in Q(L(X n)). (13) Consider any choice function C̃ on Q(V(ΣX )) such that C̃(Mn(O)) = C̃n(Mn(O)). Since Mn is a surjection, we find that then C̃(O′) = C̃n(O′) for all O′ inQ(Vn(ΣX )). But every O′ inQ(Vn(ΣX )) can be identified with O∩Vn(ΣX ) for some O in Q(V(ΣX )), so C̃(O) = C̃n(O∩Vn(ΣX )) for all O in Q(V(ΣX )), where, again, we use the assumption that C̃n(∅) = ∅, and thus making C̃ unique. Then C̃(Mn(O)) =⋃n∈NC̃n(Vn(ΣX )∩Mn(O)) = C̃n(Mn(O)), so indeed Cn(O) = { f ∈O ∶Mn( f ) ∈ C̃(Mn(O))} for all O in Q(L(X n)), (14) proving the first and second statement.\nFor the third statement, infer from Prop. 12 and Prop. 14 that C is coherent if and only if Cn is coherent for every n in N. Infer from Theorem 11 that, for every n in N,Cn is coherent if and only if C̃n on V n(ΣX ) is coherent. Infer that, by construction, C̃(O) = C̃n(O) for every O in Q(Vn(ΣX )), then Prop. 18 tells us that indeed C̃n is coherent if and only if C̃ on V(ΣX ) is coherent. We now turn to the representation theorem for sets of desirable gambles. ThatD is exchangeable is, by Prop. 17, equivalent to, Dn is exchangeable, for every n in N. Therefore, for any n in N, by Theorem 11, that is equivalent to Dn =⋃M̃−1n (D̃n) where D̃n is uniquely given by D̃n =Mn(Dn). Infer that Dn = ⋃Dn/IPn by the compatibility of Dn with IPn . Using Eq. (5), infer that Dn/IPn = M̃−1n (Mn(Dn)), whence Dn = ⋃M̃−1n (Mn(Dn)), which is equal to M̃−1n (⋃k∈NMk(Dk)∩Vn(ΣX )).\nThis shows that Dn equals M̃ −1 n (D̃ ∩Vn(ΣX )) for some D̃, and that D̃ is exactly given by D̃ = ⋃n∈NMn(Dn)=⋃n∈N D̃n , also proving its uniqueness. This proves the first and the second statement. For the third statement, since D̃ =⋃n∈NMn(Dn), we see that clearly D̃ is coherent if and only every Mn(Dn) is coherent, which is, by Theorem 11 equivalent to Dn is coherent for every n in N. Now use Props. 12 and 14 to infer that this is equivalent to D is coherent, proving the third statement."
