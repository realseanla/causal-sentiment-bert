The supervised pattern recognition is thus based on the theory of continuous belief functions, which is a way to consider imprecision and uncertainty of data. The distributions of features are supposed to be unimodal and estimated by a single Gaussian and α-stable model. Experimental results are first obtained from synthetic data by combining two features of one dimension and by considering a vector of two features. Mass functions are calculated from plausibility functions by using the generalized Bayes theorem. The same study is applied to the automatic classification of three types of sea floor (rock, silt and sand) with features acquired by a mono-beam echo-sounder. We evaluate the quality of the α-stable model and the Gaussian model by analyzing qualitative results, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test), and quantitative results with classification rates. The performances of the belief classifier are compared with a Bayesian approach.\nKeywords: Gaussian and α-stable model, unimodal features, continuous belief functions, supervised pattern recognition, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Bayesian approach."

      "text" : "The choice of a model has an important role in the problem of estimation. For example, the Gaussian model is a very efficient model which fits data in many applications as it is very simple to use and saves computation time. However, as is the case for all distribution models, Gaussian laws have some weaknesses and results can end-up being skewed. Indeed, as the Gaussian probability density function (pdf) is symmetrical, it is not valid when the pdf is not symmetrical. It is therefore difficult to choose the right model which fits data for each application. The Gaussian distribution belongs to a family of distributions called stable distributions. This family of distributions allows the representation of heavy tails and skewness. A distribution is said to have a heavy tail if the tail decays slower than the tail of the Gaussian distribution. Therefore, the property of skewness means that it is impossible to find a mode where probability density function is symmetrical. The main property of stable laws introduced by Lévy [1] is that the sum of two independent stable random variables gives a stable random variable. α-stable distributions are used in different fields of research such as radar [2, 3], image processing [4] or finance [5, 6], ...\nThe aim of this study is to show the interest in fitting data with an α-stable distribution. In [7], the author proposes to characterize the sea floor from a vector of features modeled by Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) using an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). However, the problem with the Bayesian approach is the difficulty in considering the uncertainty of data. We therefore favored the use of an approach based on the theory of belief functions [8, 9]. In [10], the authors compared a Bayesian and belief classifier where data from sensors are modeled using GMMs estimated via an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm [11]. This work has been extended to data modeled by α-stable mixture models [12]. However, it is difficult to choose between these two models because the results\n∗Corresponding author.

This paper raises two problems. Firstly, it is necessary to work on a data set where features are modeled by α-stable pdfs. The second problem is to know how to apply the theory of belief functions when data from sensors are modeled by α-stable distributions. This point has been dealt with in [13].\nThe recent characterization of uncertain environments has taken an important place in several fields of application such as the SOund Navigation And Ranging (SONAR). SONAR has therefore been used for the detection of underwater mines [14]. In [15], the author developed techniques to perform automatic classification of sediments on the seabed from sonar images. In [10], the authors classified sonar images by extracting features and modeling them with GMMs. In [16], the authors characterized the sea floor using data from a mono-beam echo-sounder. A data set represents an echo signal amplitude according to time. They compare the time envelope of echo signal amplitude with a set of theoretical reference curves. In this paper, we build a classifier based on the theory of belief functions where a vector of features extracted from a mono-beam echo-sounder is modeled by a Gaussian and an α-stable distribution. The feature pdfs have only one mode. We finally show that it would be interesting to fit features with an α-stable model.\nThis paper is organized as follows: we first introduce the definition of stability, the method to construct α-stable probability density functions and the methods of estimation in Section 2. The definitions in the multivariate case are also presented. We introduce the notion of belief functions in discrete and continuous cases in Section 3. Belief functions are then calculated in the particular case of α-stable distributions and a belief classifier is constructed in Section 4. We finally classify data by modeling data with Gaussian and α-stable distributions before the generated data are classified by comparing the theory of belief functions with Gaussian and α-stable distributions in Section 5. We compare the results obtained with the theory of belief functions using a Bayesian approach."

      "text" : "Gauss introduced the probability density function called “Gaussian distribution” (in honor of Gauss) in his study of astronomy. Laplace and Poisson developed the theory of characteristic function by calculating the analytical expression of Fourier transform of a probability density function. Laplace found that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian law is also a Gaussian law. Cauchy tried to calculate the Fourier transform of a “generalized Gaussian” function with the expression fn(x) = 1π ∫ +∞ 0 exp (−ct\nn) cos (tx)dt, but he did not solve the problem. When the integer n is a real α, we define the family of α-stable distributions. However, Cauchy did not know at that time if he had defined a probability density function. With the results of Polya and Bernstein, Janicki and Weron [17] demonstrated that the family of α-stable laws are probability density functions. The mathematician Paul Lévy studied the central limit theorem and showed, with the constraint of infinite variance, that the limit law is a stable law [1]. Motivated by this property, Lévy calculated the Fourier transform for all α-stable distributions. These stable laws which satisfy the generalized central limit theorem are interesting as they allow the modeling of data as impulsive noise when the Gaussian model is not valid. Another property of these laws is the ability to model heavy tails and skewness. In the following, we define the notions of stability, characteristic function, the way to build a pdf from characteristic function, the different estimators of α-stable distributions and the extension of α-stable distribution to the multivariate case."

(3)\nHowever, this definition is problematic for two reasons: while the integrand function is complex, its bounds are infinite. Nolan [20] therefore proposed a way to represent normalized α-stable distributions (i.e. γ = 1 and δ = 0). The main idea of Nolan [20] is to use variable modifications so that the integral has finite bounds. Each parameter has an influence on the shape of the fS α(β,γ,δ). The curve has a large peak when α is near 0 and a Gaussian shape when α = 2 (Figure 1(a)). The shape of the distribution skews to the left if β = 1, to the right if β = −1 (Figure 1(b)) while the distribution is symmetrical when β = 0. Finally, the scale parameter enlarges or compresses the shape of the distribution (Figure 1(c)) and the location parameter leads to the translation of the mode of the fS α(β,γ,δ) (Figure 1(d))."

However, the algorithm proposed by Fama and Roll suffers from a small asymptotic bias in α and γ and restrictions on α ∈]0.6, 2] and β = 0. McCulloch [22] extended the quantile method to the asymmetric case (i.e. β = 0). The McCulloch estimator is valid for α ∈]0.6, 2].\nPress [23, 24] proposed a method based on transformations of characteristic function. In [31], the author compared the performances of several estimators. For example, the Press method is efficient for specific values. Koutrouvelis [25] extended the Press method and proposed a regression method to estimate the parameters of α-stable distributions. He proposed a second version of his algorithm which is distinct that it is iterative [26]. In [32], the authors proved that the method proposed by Koutrouvelis is better than both the quantile method and the Press method because it gives consistent and asymptotically unbiased estimates.\nThe Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was first studied in the symmetric case [27, 28]. Dumouchel [29] developed an approximate maximum likelihood method. The MLE was also developed in the asymmetric case.\nNolan [30] extended the MLE in general case. The problem with the MLE is the calculation of the α-stable probability density function because there is no closed-form expression. Moreover, the computational algorithm is timeconsuming.\nConsequently, we estimate a univariate α-stable distribution using the Koutrouvelis method [26]."

To avoid this problem, it is possible to consider a discrete spectral measure [33] which has the form:\nσ(.) = K∑\ni=1\nγiδsi (.), (6)\nwith γi corresponding to weight and δsi the Dirac measure in si.

At this point, it is important to underline that the features extracted from mono-beam echo-sounders have the properties of heavy-tails and skewness. Consequently, we decided to estimate the data with an α-stable model. These data are however imprecise and uncertain: the imprecision and uncertainty of data can be linked to poor quality estimation of these data. To take these constraints into consideration, we used an uncertain theory called the theory of belief functions. Consequently, the goal of the next section is to present the theory of belief functions."

To resolve this issue, we can use the consonant basic belief density. A basic belief density is said to be “consonant” when focal elements are nested. Focal elements Iu can be labeled as an index u such that Iu ⊆ I′u with u′ > u. This definition is used to apply the least commitment principle, which consists in choosing the least informative belief function when a belief function is not totally defined and is only known to belong to a family of functions. The least commitment principle relies on an order relation between belief functions in order to determine if a belief function is more or less committed than another. For example, it is possible to define on order based on the commonality function:\n(∀A ⊆ Θ, qΘ1 (A) ≤ qΘ2 (A))⇔ (mΘ1 ⊆q mΘ2 ).

The features are modeled by a probability density function because the features have continuous values. We can calculate a plausibility function related to its probability density functions by using the least commitment principle.

In R2, isoprobability points of a multivariate Gaussian pdf of mean δ and covariance matrix Σ are ellipses. In dimension d, the authors defined focal elements as the nested sets HVα enclosed by the isoprobability hyperconics HCα = {x ∈ Rd |(x− δ) tΣ−1(x− δ)}. They obtain bbd by applying the least commitment principle:\nmR d (HVα) = α\nd+2 2 −1\n2 d+2 2 Γ( d+22 ) exp (−1 2 α) with α ≥ 0. (43)\nEquation (43) defines a χ2 distribution with d + 2 degrees of freedom. The plausibility function at point x belonging to a surface S i corresponds to the volume delimited by S i (we give an example in Figure 4 for an α-stable pdf). Consequently, the plausibility function at point x is defined by:\nplR d (x ∈ Rd) = ∫ α=+∞ α=(x−δ) tΣ−1(x−δ) α d+2 2 −1 2 d+2 2 Γ( d+22 ) exp (−1 2 α)dα. (44)\nEquation (44) can be simplified by:\nplR d (x ∈ Rd) = 1 − Fd+2((x − δ)(Σ)−1(x − δ)). (45)\nThe function Fd+2 is a cumulative density function of the χ2 distribution with d + 2 degrees of liberty (d is the dimension of vector x).\nThe authors also calculate plausibility functions in the particular case of GMMs with their pdfs denoted by pGMM:\npGMM(x) = k=n∑ k=1 wkN(x, δk,Σk), (46)\nwhere N(x, δk,Σk) is the normal distribution of the k components with mean δk and matrix of covariance Σk and wk is the weight of each mixture. They assign belief to nested sets belonging to a component. Consequently, the\nplausibility function of the GMMs can be seen as a weighted sum of plausibility functions defined by each component of the mixture:\nplR d (x ∈ Rd) = 1 − k=n∑ k=1 wkFd+2((x − δk)(Σk)−1(x − δk)). (47)\nWe want to extend the calculation of plausibility function for any α-stable pdf. However, there is no closed-form expression for α-stable pdf. We use the approach developed by Doré et al. [44] to build belief functions."

Probability density functions (Gaussian or α-stable models) are estimated from samples belonging to classes. The rest of the samples is used for the test base (N × (1 − p) vectors). We use a validation test to determine if samples belong to an estimated model. If the test is not valid, we stop the classification, otherwise we continue the classification (Figure 5). The classification step diagram in one and d dimensions is shown in Figure 6.\nPlausibility functions knowing classes for x are calculated either from their probability density functions by using Equation (41) for an unsymmetric α-stable probability density function or by using Equation (45) for a Gaussian probability density function. We obtain d mass functions (one for each feature) at point x with the generalized Bayes theorem [47, 48] (Equation (42)). These d mass functions are combined by a combination rule to obtain a single mass function (section 3.1.2). Finally, the mass function is transformed into pignistic probability (Equation (19)) to make the decision.\nIt is also possible to work with a vector x of d dimensions. For an α-stable probability density function, plausibility functions are calculated for each feature by using the approach of Doré et al [44] (section 3.3). For a Gaussian probability density function, we use Equation (45) to calculate plausibilty functions. We calculate one mass function at point x by using the generalized Bayes theorem (Equation (42)). There is no combination step because we are calculating a single mass function. We use Equation (19) to transform the mass function into pignistic probabilities.

In [12], synthetic data are classified by modeling features using Gaussian and α-stable mixture models. By observing confidence intervals, the hypothesis of α-stable mixture models is significantly better than the hypothesis of Gaussian mixture models. However, when the number of Gaussian distributions increases, classification accuracies are significantly the same. Images from a side-scan sonar are automatically classified by extracting Haralick features [49, 50]. However, classification accuracies are roughly the same.\nIn this section, we limit algorithms with a vector of features in dimension d ≤ 2. Indeed, the generalization of α-stable pdf in dimension d > 2 increases CPU time because there is no closed-form expression. Consequently, we distinguish two cases during the classification step:\n• The one dimension case: each dimension is considered as a feature.\n• The two case: we considered a vector of two features.\nWe also use a statistical test called Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) to evaluate the quality of each model. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) with a significance level of 5 % is also used to determine if two datasets differ significantly. Let us assume two null hypotheses:\n• H1: “Data follow a Gaussian distribution”.\n• H2: “Data follow an α-stable distribution”.\nThe notation H1 and H2 are used for the rest of the paper. If the test rejects a null hypothesis Hi, we stop the classification. Otherwise, if the test is valid, we then classify the samples belonging to the test base by using the belief classifier.\nThe results obtained with the belief functions are compared using a Bayesian approach. The prior probability p(Ci) is first calculated corresponding to the proportion of each class in the learning set. For each class, the application of Bayes theorem gives posterior probabilities:\np(Ci/x) = p(x/Ci)p(Ci) n∑ u=1 p(x/Cu)p(Cu) . (48)\nFinally, the decision is chosen by using the maximum nimber of posterior probabilities. We first present a classification of synthetic data, belonging to Gaussian distributions, by modeling features using a Gaussian distribution and α-stable pdf. We then compare the α-stable and Gaussian model with synthetic data belonging to α-stable distributions. The same approach is finally applied to real data from a mono-beam echo-sounder."

We needed to make a mesh between [−4, 4]× [−4, 4] to calculate plausibility functions in R2 with the α-stable model. Consequently, samples were chosen possessing features with dimensions within [−4, 4].\nThe one dimension case. For each class Ci, we consider each feature as a source of information. The estimated probability density functions can be seen as pignistic probability functions. For each pignistic probability function, we associate a mass function which will subsequently be combined with other mass functions.\nThe K-S test is valid for the two null hypotheses H1 and H2 (Table 2). We can assert that samples are drawn from the same distribution. The proposed method performs well in the particular case of synthetic data belonging to Gaussian distributions. However, the classification rates (Table 3) are very low because there is confusion between classes (Figure 8). The classification accuracy obtained with the Bayesian approach is significantly the same as the belief functions. Indeed, the Bayesian performs well provided that the probability density functions are wellestimated. The classification results depend on the prior probabilitiy estimation: if a prior probability of a class is underestimated, the confusion between classes increases.\nWe extended our study to a vector of two dimensions to try to improve the classification rate.\nThe two dimension case. We generalized the study by considering a vector of two features. The learning base was used to estimate each mean and matrix of covariance for the Gaussian distributions (Figure 9) and each parameter α, σ, θ and δ for the α-stable distributions [35] (Figure 10).\nAs in one dimension, the two null hypotheses H1 and H2 were verified (Table 4). The classification results (Table 3) are somewhat less than impressive because there is confusion between classes (between C1 and C2 cf. Figure 7). Furthermore, the work in two dimensions enables better results to be obtained than the combination. The Bayesian approach gives significantly the same results as the theory of belief functions.

      "text" : "We can assert that the estimation with the α-stable hypothesis is better than the Gaussian hypothesis (Figure 12). There is a difference between the mode of the Gaussian model and the mode of α-stable model. Indeed, the mean, calculated from samples, for the Gaussian model does not correspond to the mode when samples do not belong to a Gaussian law. Moreover, the values of pdfs are not the same compared to the real pdfs.\nThe K-S test is not satisfied for the null hypothesis H1 for each class and each component. Consequently, we stopped the classification step for the Gaussian model. However, the K-S test is valid for the null hypothesis H2 (Table 6). We can observe that the results obtained with the theory of belief functions are significantly the same as the results obtained using the Bayesian approach. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that prior probabilities were well-estimated. Consequently, we changed voluntarily the values of prior probabilities. We fixed arbitrarily the prior probabilities: p(C1) = 1/6, p(C2) = 2/3 and p(C3) = 1/6. The classification accuracy decreased to 53.10 % (Table 7). Indeed, the learning base and the test base can sometimes be significantly different. For example, the prior probability of class sand can be greater than the prior probabilities of classes rock and silt, although it does not\nrepresent the truth, and the classification rate of class sand can be favoured. This phenomenon introduces confusion between classes and the classification rate can decrease. Consequently, the learning step is an important step for the Bayesian approach and can have a bad effect on the classification rate whereas the theory of belief functions is less sensitive to the learning step.\nThe two dimension case. We considered a vector of two features. In Figure 13, we draw the iso-contour lines of data estimated with the Gaussian model and in Figure 14 the iso-contour lines of data estimated with the α-stable model As in one dimension, the null hypothesis H1 is rejected at significance level 5 %, but the null hypothesis H2 is valid (Table 8). The classification results (Table 9) are somewhat less than impressive because there is confusion between classes. Furthermore, we obtain the same classification accuracies with the vector of two dimensions compared to the combination of two features. However, the classification decreases when the prior probabilities are not well-estimated (Table 7).\nWe also compared these results with a GMM. It is well-known that the GMM can accurately model an arbitrary continuous distribution. This model estimation can be performed efficiently using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We compared classification accuracies by increasing the number of components. We drew the classification accuracy (Figure 15) in relation to the number of components. Let us assume the null hypothesis:\n• Gn: “Data follow a Gaussian mixture model with n components”.\nThe K-S test rejects the null hypothesis Gn for a number of components n < 4. The representations of iso-contour lines (Figure 16, Figure 17 and Figure 18) confirm the K-S test. Furthermore, the classification accuracies are lower than classification rates with a single α-stable pdf.\nHowever, we can not increase indefinitely the number of components because a phenomenon of overfitting can appear (for example the representation of iso-contour by using a GMM with 5 components). Consequently, the number of 4 components seems to be a good compromise between the overfitting and good estimation. The classification accuracies are roughly the same between the single α-stable model and the GMM with 4 components."

In [16], the authors classify seven types of sea floor by comparing the time envelope of echo signal amplitude with a set of theoretical references curves. In our application, raw data (Figure 19) were processed using the Quester Tangent Corporation (QTC) software [53] to\nobtain some features, which were normalized between [0,1]. These data had already been used for the navigation of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) [54]. The frame of discernment is Θ = {silt, rock, sand}, with 4853 samples from silt, 6017 from rock and 7338 from sand. The selection of features plays an important role in classification because the classification accuracy can be different according to the features. In [55], the author gave an overview of methods based on features to classify data and choose features which discriminate all classes. Some features calculated by the QTC software can be modeled by an α-stable pdf. There is a graphical test called converging variance test [56] which enables us to determine if samples belong to an α-stable distribution. This test calculates the estimation of variances by varying the number of samples. If the estimation of variance diverges, the samples can belong to an α-stable distribution. We give an example of this test for the feature called “third quantile calculated on echo signal amplitude” of the class rock (Figure 20). We chose the features called the “third quantile calculated on echo signal amplitude” and the “25th quantile calculated on cumulative energy”."

We considered the imprecision and uncertainty of data for modeling pdf and the theory of belief functions offers a way to model these constraints. We have examined the fundamental definitions of this theory and have shown a way to calculate plausibility functions when the knowledge of sensors is an α-stable pdf. We finally validated our model by making a comparison with the model examined by Caron et al. [43] where the pdf is a Gaussian.\nSynthetic and real data were finally classified using the theory of belief functions. We estimated the learning base, calculated plausibility functions, combined plausibility functions and calculated maximum pignistic probability to obtain the classification accuracy. The K-S test shows that synthetic data can be modeled by an α-stable model. The proposed method performs well for synthetic data. The consideration of two features improves the classification rate compared to the combination of two features for the Gaussian data. This study was then extended to a real application by using features extracted from a mono-beam echo-sounder. The Gaussian model is limited when modeling features compared to the α-stable model because the α-stable model has more degrees of freedom. To sum up, the interest in using an α-stable model is that data, in both one or two dimensions, can be modeled. The problem with the α-stable model is the computation time. Indeed, we proceed numerically to calculate plausibility functions (discretization for the bivariate α-stable pdf). Furthermore, it is difficult to generalize in dimension d > 2 without increasing CPU time.\nWe present preliminary results about classification problem by modeling features with α-stable probability density functions in dimension d ≤ 2. In future works, we plan to make experiments in the high-dimensional case with d ≥ 3. One solution in perspective to improve the computation time is to optimize the code in another language such that C/C++. Another perspective to this work is the use of other features from sensors to improve the classification accuracy, images from side-scan sonar."

The supervised pattern recognition is thus based on the theory of continuous belief functions, which is a way to consider imprecision and uncertainty of data. The distributions of features are supposed to be unimodal and estimated by a single Gaussian and α-stable model. Experimental results are first obtained from synthetic data by combining two features of one dimension and by considering a vector of two features. Mass functions are calculated from plausibility functions by using the generalized Bayes theorem. The same study is applied to the automatic classification of three types of sea floor (rock, silt and sand) with features acquired by a mono-beam echo-sounder. We evaluate the quality of the α-stable model and the Gaussian model by analyzing qualitative results, using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test), and quantitative results with classification rates. The performances of the belief classifier are compared with a Bayesian approach.",
