      "text" : "This publication describes an extension of our previous works related to trust issues in international nation relations. In our previous works (Mohd Anuar Mat Isa et al., 2012a, 2012b), we have mentioned the need for a “trust model” in Common Criteria (CC). In this work, we model the international relations between nations using a calculus model, which we call a trust algebra. The proposed method will allow a trust computation, which is previously subjective and incomputable."

      "text" : "There are many trust definitions that were expressed in natural languages. To enable trust computation in computing systems, the trust definitions need to be conveyed in a measurable or quantifiable notations such as statistical representations. The first attempt to represent trust in the statistical notations was by (Dempster, 1967). Dempster showed a probability measurement that is to define an upper and lower probabilities for a multivalued mapping. The probability measurement is a generalization of calculus in Bayesian theory. His statistical scheme is adopted by (Shafer, 1979, 1976) and it provides elegant method to compute trust. Many researchers later (in 1980-1995) addressed both works as the foundation for a concrete trust computation, which they began to call as Dempster-Shafer theory in the early 1980s (Shafer,\n1 This manuscript is a draft version. The final version will be published in a reputable journal. One may contact the main author (anuarls@hotmail.com) for further clarification or discussion for an implementation of the trust algebra.\n2015). Later (Jøsang, 1997) provided an extension to a probabilistic calculus for the Dempster-Shaper theory by introducing an artificial reasoning, named subjective logic. The following subsections will further discuss the Bayesian theory, DempsterShafer theory and subjective logic."

Referring to the UN’s Charter\n(“Charter of the United Nations,” 1945):\nChapter I, Articles 1: “To maintain international peace and security…” and “to develop friendly relations among nations\nbased on respect for the principle of equal rights…”. Articles 2: “…principle of the sovereign equality of all its Members.”.\nChapter II, Articles 4: “Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace-loving states which accept the obligations\ncontained in the present Charter…”.\nReferring to the UN’s Charter, we define a nation term in this work as the nation state or any UN member states.\nDefinition 2.

Trust relations for ℛ\uD835\uDC34,\uD835\uDC35 is a product of Mass Trust Perception \uD835\uDCE3\uD835\uDC74\uD835\uDC82\uD835\uDC94\uD835\uDC94.

To determine the trust relations for\nthe ℛ\uD835\uDC34,\uD835\uDC35, i.e. either friendly, neutral or hostile:\n If the point falls into less than middle bound, it is a hostile relation;\n If the point falls into greater than middle bound, it is a friendly relation;\n If the point falls into the middle bound, it is a neutral relation.\nRemark 7.1 Theorems 1 through 4 rely on three major conditions of relations between nations (hostile, neutral and\nfriendly). One may define more than triple conditions to implement granularity and fuzziness in the relations.\nRemark 7.2 One should not modify in order to implement an additional condition of relations because it will increase\ndifficulties in properties \uD835\uDCAB classification and nominal data (value assignment). Our suggestion for more than the triple scalar\nrelations is to directly map the Mass Trust Perception’s value in Theorem 4 into the septuple scalar. One must define a\nlower bound and an upper bound for each new relation element. The new relation element is a subset of the existing triple\n(e.g. Near-Hostile ⊂ Hostile).\nTheorem 4.

The method supports decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be known as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.",
