      "text" : "Interval-valued fuzzy sets [31], as an extension of fuzzy sets [39], is a powerful mathematical tool to describe uncertainty information, in which the concept of the membership function using the subintervals of the interval [0, 1] as the set of membership grades is a fundamental notion. It has been intensively investigated, not only its theoretical aspects, but also its numerous applications, and the approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using several levels of membership grades have became an important research direction.\nRecently, researchers [1, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14–16, 20–22, 40] have investigated fuzzy sets from different aspects. For example, Pedrycz [22] proposed shadowed sets for interpreting fuzzy sets by using several\n∗Corresponding author.

Sequently, a lot of investigations [2–4, 8, 11, 19, 23–27, 32, 41] have been done on shadowed sets. For instance, Deng et al. [7] computed a pair of thresholds, whose interpretation and determination is a fundamental issue for expressing fuzzy sets, for three-way approximations of fuzzy sets by using loss functions, and classify a set of objects into three regions by using the pair of thresholds. In practical situations, interval-valued fuzzy sets whose membership functions are using the subintervals of the interval [0, 1] are of interest because such type of sets are frequently encountered. So far we have not seen the similar investigation on interval-valued fuzzy sets. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate that how to express interval-valued fuzzy sets as fuzzy sets.\nTo computing and interpreting a pair of thresholds, a lot of investigations [13–18, 33–37] have been done on three-way decision-theory by using loss functions in literatures. For example, Li et al. [13] evaluated the cost and benefit of assigning an instance to a specific subcategory and defined a general loss function for supervised leaning. Liang et al. [14, 15] presented triangular fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets and systematic studies on three-way decisions with interval-valued decision-theoretic rough sets. Liu et al. [17] proposed stochastic decision-theoretic rough sets, interval-valued decision-theoretic rough sets, fuzzy decision-theoretic rough sets and dynamic decision-theoretic rough sets. In practical situations, interval-valued loss functions as interval-valued numbers [16,28,29] are of interest because such functions are frequently encountered. Although interval-valued loss functions are complex in practice, we have not seen enough investigations on interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions so far. Therefore, it is urgent to further study interval-valued loss functions for making a decision by using threeway decision-theory.\nThe purpose of this paper is to further investigate interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 2 introduces the basic principles of decision-theoretic rough sets, shadowed sets and decision-theoretic three-way approximations of fuzzy sets. Section 3 presents shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 4 is devoting to errors-based interpretation of shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets. Section 5 presents decisiontheoretic rough sets-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using transforming interval-valued loss functions into single loss functions. Section 6 investigates decision-theoretic rough sets-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions from another view. The conclusion comes in Section 7."

An interval-valued fuzzy set A in U is given by A = {(x, µ̃A(x))|x ∈ U}, where µ̃A : X −→ D[0,1] : x −→ µ̃A(x) = [µ−A(x), µ + A(x)].\nDefinition 3.2 Let A be an interval-valued fuzzy set, µ̃A(x) = [µ−A(x), µ + A(x)] be a membership grade of x ∈ U, and θ ∈ [0, 1]. Then the transformed formula of µ̃A(x) is mθ (̃µA(x)) = (1 − θ) · µ−A(x) + θ · µ + A(x); Furthermore, Aθ = {(x,mθ (̃µA(x)))|x ∈ U}.\nExample 3.3 (1) Let µ̃A(x) = [0.1, 0.2] and µ̃B(x) = [0.15, 0.25] for x ∈ U, and θ = 0.5. Then\nmθ (̃µA(x)) = (1 − 0.5) × 0.1 + 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.15;\nmθ (̃µB(x)) = (1 − 0.5) × 0.15 + 0.5 × 0.25 = 0.2.\n(2) Let A = x1 µ̃A(x1) + x2 µ̃A(x2) + x3 µ̃A(x3) + x4 µ̃A(x4) be an interval-valued fuzzy set, where µ̃A(x1) = [0.1, 0.2], µ̃A(x2) =\n[0.6, 0.8], µ̃A(x3) = [0.3, 0.5] and µ̃A(x4) = [0.8, 0.1]. If we take θ = 0.5, then Aθ = x1 0.15 + x2 0.7 + x3 0.4 + x4 0.45 .\nFor simplicity, we denote µ̃A as µA in the following discussion.\nDefinition 3.4 Let A be an interval-valued fuzzy set, then the shadowed set S µA of A is defined as\nS µA(x) =  1, mθ(µA(x)) ≥ α; 0, mθ(µA(x)) ≤ β;\n[0, 1], β < mθ(µA(x)) < α.\nFor an object x, we elevate the membership grade from µA(x) to 1 if mθ(µA(x)) ≥ α; We reduce the membership grade from µA(x) to 0 if mθ(µA(x)) ≤ β; We change the membership grade from µA(x) to [0, 1] if β < mθ(µA(x)) < α.\nThe pair of thresholds α and β are important for computing three-way approximations of intervalvalued fuzzy sets. In what follows, we introduce a systematic way to compute the pair of thresholds α and β by minimizing an objective function as\nV(α,β)(A) = |Elevated Area(α,β)(A) + Reduced Area(α,β)(A) − Shadowed Area(α,β)(µA)|\n= | ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≥α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))) + ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≤β\n(mθ(µA(x))) − Card({x ∈ U |β < mθ(µA(x)) < α})|,\nwhere card(·) denotes the cardinality of a set ·, and an optimal pair of thresholds α and β can be derived by minimizing the objective function V(α,β)(A). Similarly, minimizing V(α,β)(A) involves two parameters α and β. For convenience, by assuming that α + β = 1, the objective function is simplified into\nV(α,1−α)(A)\n= |Elevated Area(α,1−α)(mθ(µA(x))) + Reduced Area(α,1−α)(mθ(µA(x))) − Shadowed Area(α,1−α)(mθ(µA(x)))| = | ∑\nmθ(µA(x))(x)≥α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))) + ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≤1−α\n(mθ(µA(x))) − Card({x ∈ U |1 − α < mθ(µA(x)) < α})|.\nThere exist two interpretations of shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets. In a wide sense, a shadowed set is a three-valued fuzzy set, which is used to approximate an interval-valued fuzzy set. In a narrow sense, we interpret the notion of a shadowed set according to its exact formulation, namely, the choice of the set of membership grades {0, [0, 1], 1} and the objective function. Therefore, shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets are examples of three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets."

      "text" : "In this section, we present a detailed analysis of a objective function for shadowed sets of intervalvalued fuzzy sets in terms of errors of approximations. We also provide a new objective function by the total error of approximations for determining the thresholds α and β.\nTo further study shadowed sets of interval-valued fuzzy sets, we express the objective function in terms of the errors introduced by a shadowed set approximation. For an object x with membership grade mθ(µA(x)), the elevation operation changes the membership grade from mθ(µA(x)) to 1, the reduction operation changes the membership grade from mθ(µA(x)) to 0, and the errors induced by elevation and reduction are shown as\nEe(µA(x)) = 1 − mθ(µA(x)), Er(µA(x)) = mθ(µA(x)).\nThe errors Ee(µA) and Er(µA) induced by the elevation and reduction operations for an interval-valued\nfuzzy set A of the universe U, respectively, are shown as\nEe(µA) = ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≥α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))), Er(µA(x)) = ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≤β\nmθ(µA(x)).\nThe error for the shadowed area is not clear because of the unit interval [0, 1] as the membership grade when β < mθ(µA(x)) < α. By computing the difference between mθ(µA(x)) and the maximum 1 and the minimum value 0 and summarizing them up, we have\nEs(µA) = ∑\nβ<mθ(µA(x))<α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))) + ∑\nβ<mθ(µA(x))<α\nmθ(µA(x)).\nSubsequently, we express the objective function in terms of errors by using the error-based interpreta-\ntion of the three areas as\nV(α,β)(µA)\n= |Ee(µA) + Er(µA) − Es(µA)| = | ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≥α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))) + ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≤β\nmθ(µA(x) − ∑\nβ<mθ(µA(x))<α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))) + ∑\nβ<mθ(µA(x))<α\n(mθµA(x))|.\nThe objective function is a kind of trade-off of errors produced by three regions. But the rationale for such a trade-off is not entirely clear. On one hand, Es(mθ(µA(x))) consists the errors of elevation and reduction operations, and it is impossible to elevate mθ(µA(x)) to 1 and reduce mθ(µA(x)) to 0 if β < mθ(µA(x)) < α simultaneously. On the other hand, we are not able to allocate any numeric membership grade for the elements in the shadowed area. In other words, any numeric value of the unit interval [0, 1] could be permitted to reflect the uncertainty. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate that which numeric value is meaningful to the membership grade of elements in the shadowed area.\nBelow, we present a three-way approximation of an interval-valued fuzzy set by replacing the unit\ninterval [0, 1] with 0.5 as,\nTµA(x) =  1, mθ(µA(x)) ≥ α; 0, mθ(µA(x)) ≤ β;\n0.5, β < mθ(µA(x)) < α.\nBy analyzing TµA(x), we see that the correspondences between areas of elevation and reduction and errors of elevation and reduction remain to be the same. But we need to revise the errors of the shadowed region as\nEs0.5 (µA) = ∑\n0.5<mθ(µA(x))<α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x))) + ∑\nβ<mθ(µA(x))<0.5\n(mθ(µA(x))).\nBy using Ee(µA), Er(µA) and Es0.5 (µA), we have\nE(α,β)(µA) = Ee(µA) + Er(µA) + Es0.5 (µA)\n= ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≥α\n(1 − mθ(µA(x)) + ∑\nmθ(µA(x))≤β\n(mθ(µA(x))) − ∑\n0.5<mθ(µA(x))<α(t)\n(mθ(µA(x)) − 0.5)\n+ ∑\nβ<mθ(µA(x))<0.5\n(0.5 − mθ(µA(x))).\nThe total errors of the three areas are minimized instead of searching for a trade-off between different\nareas. Correspondingly, we express the total error as the summation of errors of all objects as\nE(α,β)(µA) = ∑\nx∈U\nE(α,β)(mθ(µA(x))),\nwhere\nE(α,β)(µA(x)) =  1 − mθ(µA(x)), mθ(µA(x)) ≥ α; 0.5 − mθ(µA(x)), β < mθ(µA(x)) ≤ 0.5; mθ(µA(x)) − 0.5, 0.5 < mθ(µA(x)) < α;\nmθ(µA(x)), mθ(µA(x)) ≤ β.\nThe total error will be minimized by minimizing the error of each individual object, and we can search for a pair of thresholds α and β such that E(α,β)(µA(x)) is minimized for each object. We consider the following actions and associated errors for minimizing the error of each object:\n(1) : elevate to 1 : 1 − mθ(µA(x)); (2) : reduce to 0 : mθ(µA(x)) − 0; (3) : reduce or elevate to 0.5 : |mθ(µA(x)) − 0.5|.\nThat is, the absolute differences between mθ(µA(x)) and three values 1, 0.5 and 0, respectively, are the associated errors. A minimized difference is obtained if mθ(µA(x)) is changed into a value that is closest to mθ(µA(x))."

More specially, there are two situations for the third case: reduce the\nmembership grade to 0.5 if mθ(µA(x)) ≥ 0.5 and elevate the membership grade to 0.5 if mθ(µA(x)) < 0.5.

      "text" : "In Section 4, we investigate three-way approximation of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using three membership grades of 0, 0.5 and 1. We take one of the following three actions for an object with a\nmembership grade: elevate the membership grade to 1, reduce the membership grade to 0, and change the membership grade to 0.5. More specially, there are two situations for the third case: reduce the membership grade to 0.5 if mθ(µA(x)) ≥ 0.5 and elevate the membership grade to 0.5 if mθ(µA(x)) < 0.5. Each action will incur error and the costs of different actions are not necessarily the same.\nTable 3 summarizes information about three-way approximations of an interval-valued fuzzy set. Concretely, the set of actions {ae, ar, as↓ , as↑} describes four possible actions on changing the membership grade. For simplicity, we also use {e, r, s↓, s↑} to denote the four actions. Concretely, the elevation action ae elevate the membership grade of x from mθ(µA(x)) to 1, the reduction action ar reduce the membership grade of x from mθ(µA(x)) to 0, the elevation as↑ elevate the membership grade of x from mθ(µA(x)) to 0.5 if mθ(µA(x)) < 0.5, the reduction as↓ reduce the membership grade of x from mθ(µA(x)) to 0.5 if mθ(µA(x)) > 0.5. The fuzzy membership grade mθ(µA(x)) represents the state of object in the second column, and the errors of different actions are given in the fourth column, and the losses of different actions are given in the fifth column.\nEach of the four losses mθ(̃λe),mθ (̃λr),mθ (̃λs↓) and mθ (̃λs↑ ) provides the unit cost, and the actual cost of each action is weighted by the magnitude of its error. Suppose Ra(x) = mθ (̃λa)Ea(µA(x)) denote the loss for taking actions {e, r, s↓, s↑}, the losses of four actions for an object can be computed as\nRe(x) = mθ (̃λe)Ee(µA(x)) = (1 − mθ(µA(x)))mθ (̃λe);\nRr(x) = mθ (̃λr)Er(µA(x)) = mθ(µA(x))mθ (̃λr);\nRs↓(x) = mθ (̃λs↓ )Es↓(mθ(µA(x))) = (mθ(µA(x)) − 0.5)mθ (̃λs↓ ); Rs↑(x) = mθ (̃λs↑ )Es↑(mθ(µA(x))) = (0.5 − mθ(µA(x)))mθ (̃λs↑ ).\nSince only an action is taken for each object, the total loss of the approximation is computed by\nR = ∑\nx∈U\nRa(x) = ∑\nx∈U\nmθ (̃λa)Ea(µA(x)).\nTo minimize the total loss R, we take an action τ(x) that minimizes the loss Ra(x) for each object, and\nτ(x) is a solution to the following minimization problem as\narg mina∈actionRa(x),\nwhere a ∈ {e, r, s↓, s↑}.\nAccording to the value µA(x) of an object x, we have two groups of decision rules for obtaining three-\nway approximations of an interval-valued fuzzy set as follows:\n(1) When mθ(µA(x)) ≥ 0.5, (E1) If R(ae|x) ≤ R(ar |x) and R(ae|x) ≤ R(as↓ |x), then take action ae; (R1) If R(ar|x) ≤ R(ae|x) and R(ar |x) ≤ R(as↓ |x), then take action ar; (S 1) If R(as↓ |x) ≤ R(ae|x) and R(as↓ |x) ≤ R(ar|x), then take action as↓ .\n(2) When mθ(µA(x)) < 0.5, (E2) If R(ae|x) ≤ R(ar |x) and R(ae|x) ≤ R(as↑ |x), then take action ae; (R2) If R(ar |x) ≤ R(ae|x) and R(ar |x) ≤ R(as↑ |x), then take action ar; (S 2) : If R(as↑ |x) ≤ R(ae|x) and R(as↑ |x) ≤ R(ar|x), then take action as↑ ."

      "text" : "In this section, we investigate four semantics issues of decision-theoretic three-way approximations\nof interval-valued fuzzy sets.\n(1) Interpretations of interval-valued loss functions\nIn decision-theoretic three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets, the pair of thresholds depends on the choice of interval-valued loss functions which are fundamental notions of the decisiontheoretic model. In other words, given an interval-valued loss function, the pair of thresholds can be computed accordingly. On the other hand, if the pair of thresholds is interpreted in terms of an intervalvalued loss function, then the user can provide a better estimation of the thresholds in time. Therefore, the decision-theoretic model gives an interpretation of the pair of thresholds, and it is important to discuss approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions.\n(2) Relationships to shadowed sets of fuzzy sets\nIn Sections 3 and 4, we see that three regions of decision-theoretic rough set-based three-way approximation Tµ(A) and shadowed set S µ(A) are both defined through a pair of thresholds α and β. For shadowed sets, the objective function is given with respect to the membership functions, and different membership functions will produce different shadowed sets. In contrast, the objective function of the decision-theoretic framework is given with respect to interval-valued loss functions, which is independent of any particular fuzzy membership functions.\n(3) Relationships to decision-theoretic rough sets\nIn Section 4, we adopt the main ideas from decision-theoretic rough set in developing decisiontheoretic rough set-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. A rough membership function can be viewed as a fuzzy membership function. There are some differences between three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets and decision-theoretic rough sets. For decision-theoretic rough sets, we deal with two-state three-way decision problems. A rough membership function denotes the probability that an object is in the set. On the other hand, three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets are a many-state decision problem.\n(4) Relationships to decision-theoretic three-way approximations of fuzzy sets\nIn [7], Deng et al. discussed three-way approximations of fuzzy sets by using loss functions. In practice, there are a lot of interval-valued loss functions. Compare with Deng’s model, we discuss threeway approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusions",
      "text" : "Many researchers have investigated approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. In this paper, firstly, we have presented shadowed sets for interpreting and understanding interval-valued fuzzy sets. Sec-\nondly, we have constructed decision-theoretic rough set-based three-way approximations of intervalvalued fuzzy sets. Thirdly, we have computed the pair of thresholds for decision-theoretic rough set-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions. Fourthly, we have constructed approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions from another view. Finally, we have employed several examples to illustrate that how to make a decision for interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions.\nThere are still many interesting topics deserving further investigations on fuzzy sets. For example, there are many types of fuzzy sets and loss functions, and it is of interest to investigate loss functionsbased three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. In the future, we will further investigate interval-valued fuzzy sets and discuss its application in knowledge discovery.\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank the anonymous reviewers very much for their professional comments and valuable suggestions.

In this paper, firstly, we present shadowed sets for interpreting and understanding interval fuzzy sets. We also provide an analytic solution to computing the pair of thresholds by searching for a balance of uncertainty in the framework of shadowed sets. Secondly, we construct errorsbased three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets. We also provide an alternative decision-theoretic formulation for calculating the pair of thresholds by transforming intervalvalued loss functions into single-valued loss functions, in which the required thresholds are computed by minimizing decision costs. Thirdly, we compute errors-based three-way approximations of interval-valued fuzzy sets by using interval-valued loss functions. Finally, we employ several examples to illustrate that how to take an action for an object with intervalvalued membership grade by using interval-valued loss functions.",
