    "abstractText" : "This work proposes action networks as a se­ mantically well founded framework for rea­ soning about actions and change under un­ certainty. Action networks add two primi­ tives to probabilistic causal networks: con­ trollable variables and persistent variables. Controllable variables allow the representa­ tion of actions as directly setting the value of specific events in the domain, subject to preconditions. Persistent variables provide a canonical model of persistence according to which both the state of a variable and the causal mechanism dictating its value persist over time unless intervened upon by an ac­ tion (or its consequences). Action networks also allow different methods for quantifying the uncertainty in causal relationships, which go beyond traditional probabilistic quantifi­ cation. This paper describes both recent re­ sults and work in progress.",
