In this paper, we consider in depth the implications of wireless communication as a measurement input of gradient-based taxis algorithms. We discuss how gradients can be measured and determine the errors of this estimation. We then introduce a gradient-based taxis algorithm as an example of a family of gradient-based, convergent algorithms and discuss its convergence in the context of network robotics.

      "text" : "Wireless networks, ranging from cellular networks to ad-hoc networks as used in car-to-car communication, are becoming a crucial part of our communication infrastructure. Additionally, the paradigm shift towards the internet of things will add wireless network capabilities to many physical objects which will then be able to commence machine-to-machine communication [1]. These connections can in turn span entire (ad hoc) wireless networks in between these networked objects. One example of this already deployed today are sensor networks.\nIn many scenarios for robot applications, such as using the sensing capabilities of a decentralized sensor network or getting access to cloud based resources, robots have to be able to integrate themselves into different wireless networks. In addition to these machine-to-machine communication scenarios, mobile robots can also be nodes of very flexible, easily deployable wireless communication networks, which can be used as communication infrastructure. These networks are needed for example in disaster scenarios as a robust ad hoc communication infrastructure when local communication infrastructure is (partly) unavailable. This approach is explored in projects like SMAVNET [2] or AirShield [3].\nOn a very basic level integration means that robot has to be in communication range of network nodes to be able to communicate with these nodes. Because of effects like shadowing, different spatial locations have different signal qualities even inside the communication range. Robots have to be able to cope with these modalities.\nWireless communication has more degrees of freedom than wired communication, which can be explored and exploited by a robot. Tasks like finding a position with good reception or localizing a network node can however pose some constraints on the network integration of the robot."

      "text" : "In this paper, we consider a very basic but nevertheless very relevant task for the robot. Finding the physical location of a specific network node is the prototypical task for many tasks dealing with navigation inside a wireless network. Later in this paper we show how to adapt the presented framework to cope with more complex objectives.\nA robot receives packets from the network node to be found at different spatial positions and measures the signal strength of theses packets as a scalar measurement. Thus, a scalar field is sampled at different points in space. The robot does not have any means to detect the direction from which the packets arrive as would be possible with a directional antenna. Furthermore, it cannot measure the time flight of the packets, which would enable the robot to simply trilaterate the source. While both options are technologically feasible, we do not want to consider them here in order to be independent of additional technology and hardware as would be needed for such time-of-flight measurements.\nIn addition to measurements of the signal strength, the robot is able to perform local odometry measurements. They are local in the sense that they are precise for small distances but not sufficient for global localization for example by path integration of these measurements. Other global localization methods like for example GPS measurements are not available to the robot.\nFor the sake of simplicity we assume an obstacle-free space, which is valid in some scenarios like for example with flying robots. In other scenarios the algorithm has to be expanded with obstacle avoidance for which there are standard methods that are not the focus of our discussion. The algorithm presented here converges from any starting point thus obstacle avoidance can be implemented by stopping the taxis algorithm and restarting it after clearing the obstacle. In general, this paper is concerned with the convergence properties of this family of the algorithm, not with an engineering solution to a problem. As stated, in principle the algorithm can be expanded to take obstacles into account but we are not interested in this discussion."

      "text" : "A similar problem as discussed here exists in nature for example in the form of chemotaxis [4, 5, 6] where bacteria have to move to the point of highest concentration of food molecules (or to the point of lowest concentration of harmful molecules). Because of their size, they cannot directly measure gradients in the concentration of the molecules but they evolved behavior suited for coping with that restriction. These algorithms have been adapted to the case of signal strength measurements [7]. While these algorithms are effective without using gradient information, they\nare less efficient because of their stochastic nature. Furthermore, while the algorithms proposed here are similar to the behavior exhibited by bacteria performing chemotaxis, bacteria typically do not have access to odometry information leading to more stochastic behavior.\nThe network community has developed some algorithms similar to the gradient-based taxis algorithm discussed here. There exist for example algorithms to calculate relative bearing from gradients [8]. These algorithms employ, in contrast to the finite differences used here, principal component analysis to estimate gradients. Furthermore, gradients can be used to localize network nodes by fitting a local model to the measured signal strength data [9]. This and similar algorithms need precise position information acquired for example via GPS measurements or using laser range finders [10]. The most straightforward linear model was explored successfully in [11, 12].\nA taxis algorithm from the same family as the algorithm introduced here was presented in [13] for general abstract taxis. This algorithm is based on Random Direction Stochastic Approximation (RDSA) known from the stochastic approximation literature [14, 15]. RDSA uses a very efficient but rather unintuitive formulation of the gradient estimation. The authors discuss the noise characteristics of the physical model only very briefly and fail to mention motor noise at all. As discussed later, small scale fading is especially problematic and can violate some of the convergence conditions if not dealt with correctly (see Sec. 2.3). Because of that we discuss the physical characteristics of wireless communication and the robot in detail in the next sections.\nThus, our contribution in this paper focuses on the one hand on the gradient estimation and its properties in the context of wireless networks. We discuss the implication of our use case of network robotics on the gradient estimation and on the convergence of the taxis algorithm in detail. In Sec. 2 we discuss the nature of wireless communication with particular attention on the proposed algorithms. We then discuss different noise sources and their effect on the estimated gradients in Sec. 3. In Sec. 4 we make use of these gradients to introduce a stochastic approximation algorithm and translate it into the robotics world. The convergence results of this algorithm for the case of wireless communication can then be extended to the whole family of stochastic approximation algorithms. We then show an exemplary implementation of the algorithm in Sec. 5 which shows how to deal with some of the specific challenges posed by our use case. As a last step, we adapt the proposed algorithm to more advanced tasks in the same framework in Sec. 6."

      "text" : "The measured signal strength depends on a lot of environmental parameters and is in general hard to calculate. In many cases, values can only be obtained through direct measurement or numerical solution of Maxwell’s Equations.\nA minimalistic model of path loss, which ultimately defines the signal strength measured by a user, is a simplified path loss model derived from the open space path loss model. It can be written as [16, Chap. 2]\nP (x) = −10γ log10 ( x\nd0\n)\n(1)\nin dB where d0 and γ are empirical constants and x is the distance between receiver and transmitter. d0 has typical values of several meters and γ is about 3 for urban environments.\nSince this model is only used to get an intuition about the general behavior of path loss and thus signal strength, we only present the one-dimensional rotation-symmetric version of path loss. To get an intuition about its derivatives (and thus also its gradients) the first three derivatives of the path loss are given as\n∂xP (x) = − 10 γ\nln 10\n1 x , (2)\n∂2xP (x) = 10 γ\nln 10\n1\nx2 , (3)\n∂3xP (x) = − 20 γ\nln 10\n1\nx3 .

      "text" : "In general, Maxwell’s equations have to be solved to correctly calculate radio wave propagation. With complete knowledge of the environment this is indeed possible but practically almost never feasible because of the high computational costs and because complete knowledge is unobtainable in real scenarios.\nAs a consequence, effective radio propagation models have been developed. In general, there are three components which constitute these models. Not all models make use of all components depending on the purpose of the model. These three components are the following [16]:\n• path loss (large scale)\n• shadowing (medium scale)\n• fading (small scale)\nIn the following paragraphs these components are discussed with a robot as a network node in mind.\nLarge scale path loss is the simplified path loss model discussed in Sec. 2.1. The most straightforward case for this is the free space model which takes only the most basic physical effect, i.e., wave propagation in free space, into account. More elaborate models usually approximate all kinds of empirical effects on path loss by adjusting the exponent of the path loss function (1).\nThis exponent is tuned to different scenarios via empirical measurements. For the following discussion on taxis algorithms, it is important to note that these models are strictly monotonically decreasing.\nShadowing is the effect of large obstructions such as a hill or wall in the direct path of wave propagation. In some cases, such as the standard double plasterboard wall in an office environment, these effects can simply be measured and added as additional path loss. More complex scenarios need more complicated models. Note that shadowing can only attenuate signals.\nSome configurations of obstructions, consisting for example of walls of different attenuation, can create situations in which a robot simply following the proposed algorithms can get stuck because the signal strength gradient would try to guide the robot through a wall. An obstacle avoidance algorithm, which needs some degree of knowledge about the environment, has to be used to help the robot escape these situations. As stated earlier, the taxis algorithm itself converges regardless of starting point so it can be stopped when the robot starts the obstacleavoidance algorithm and restarted once it has cleared the obstacle.\nFading is a result of multipath propagation of radio waves. Superposition of waves traveling different paths interfere because of their different phases on a physical level either constructively or destructively. This leads to spatially varying signal strengths on the length scale of the wave length of the radio signal (about 12.5 cm for 2.4 GHz). Fading will be discussed in detail in Sec. 2.3.\nTaking these three effects together, a robot measuring the signal strength of a fixed receiver deals with a strictly monotonically increasing function with a considerable amount of noise and spatially varying characteristics. The signal strength is in general — because of shadowing — a non-monotonic function of distance to the transmitter, preventing direct distance estimations using only signal strength measurements.\nFor moving robots, Doppler shift [16] can be an additional factor. In general, Doppler shift does not affect signal strength on a global level. However, for a sender-receiver pair working in some specified frequency band, Doppler shift can lead to a reduced received signal strength by shifting part of the signal to frequencies which are outside of the communication channel bandwidth. Doppler shift is dependent among others on the speed of the robot, carrier frequency and modulation. Because of this it is difficult to give a general answer to how important this effect is. However, most robots are capable of holding their position — for example hovering flying robots — for the time it takes to make a measurement. This works trivially for ground based robots but also for some flying robots but is an issue for flying robots based on the fixed wing principle."

      "heading" : "2.3 Small Scale Fading",
      "text" : "As discussed in the previous section, small scale fading is the result of interference and has an effect on the length scale of the wavelength. It leads to fluctuations with periodic character with a periodicity of the wavelength of the wireless signal (which is dependent on the used channel, i.e., the base frequency). This effect is deterministic and can lead to local minima in the signal strength, which would violate some convergence conditions (see Sec. 4.2).\nAn example measurement is depicted in Fig. 1. The deterministic fluctuations on the scale of the wavelength (12.5 cm for 2.4 GHz in this case) can clearly be seen. These effects can be\nstronger than the noise sources and have to be dealt with in order to ensure convergence of the presented algorithms.\nFor a flying robot, this is typically not a problem because it cannot hold position with a precision of this magnitude. This means that because of the stochastic movement (induced by aerodynamics and external factors like wind) these deterministic fluctuations are turned into additional noise. For ground based robots, this effect has to be mitigated by for example taking several samples and averaging over an area larger than the wavelength. This will also be demonstrated in our experiments in Sec. 5."

It encompasses all previously discussed more complex models and is rather vague to enable the short notation. It should be noted that it implicitly contains all characteristics needed for the convergence discussion.\nIn our model, we can measure the true signal strength f(~x) only up to a measurement error\nfmes(~x) = f(~x) + ǫ(~x) (5)\nwhere the measurement error ǫ(~x) is a random variable with\nE[ǫ(~x)] = 0, (6)\nV [ǫ(~x)] = σ2.

Two things should be noted: Firstly this definition does not make any assumptions about the distribution as long as the two conditions above are met and secondly that this condition can be violated by small scale fading (see Sec. 2.3) if not dealt with correctly. The signal strength function f(~x) is a p-dimensional scalar field with one global maximum.\nThis model is agnostic in regard to the actual characteristics of the function f(~x). When discussing the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm in Sec. 4.2, we discuss its characteristics. For now it serves as a pure notational convenience."

In general this noise is vectorial and affects every infinitesimally small movement of the robot thus leading to a random walk-like behavior. This behavior is depicted in the inset of Fig. 2 in a graphical way.\nSince it does not make a qualitative difference for our argument 1 but simplifies notation, we abstract here from this vectorial noise to a noise in the direction of movement only. For the central differences this means that f(~x) is not sampled at f(~x+h~ei)) but at f(~x+(h+ ǫh)~ei)). This yields a gradient estimation of\n~̂gmes,i(~x) = 1\n2h (fmes(~x+ (h+ ǫh,1)~ei)− fmes(~x− (h+ ǫh,2)~ei)) (15)\n1The argument is purely statistical and no fixed coordinate system is used, so the actual end position of the robot is not important.\nThe ǫh are assumed to be i.i.d. and bias-free2. In contrast to a real random walk, the end positions are only distributed with a one-dimensional distribution in the direction of movement. Writing the full vectorial distributions would clutter the formulas but not change our results so we only discuss the simplified case.

(19)\nFor large h the error due to the remainder term of the Taylor expansion, which is the bias of the gradient estimation, dominates. The SNR as defined above then loses its meaning.\nFor the specific problem of path loss (1) as the function for which the gradient is estimated, the third derivative of the path loss (4) vanishes like 1\nx3 . This means that far from the source this\napproximation is valid also for large h since the bias only increases like h2.\n2The specific distribution has no influence on the results of the discussion here as long as it is normalizable. Even a bias in the distribution, as for example the robot always moving a bit more to the left of its movement axis, has no influence since in the real algorithm, the movement direction is a stochastic quantity which changes every iteration step. 3While the path loss noise is often modeled by Rayleigh or Rician fading models, which result in non-Gaussian noise, these models are stochastic approximations to multipath fading. Multipath fading itself however is deterministic and only the measurement errors themselves are stochastic and Gaussian (see also Sec. 2.3)."

It has one global maximum which can easily be turned into a global minimum by multiplying the measured values by minus one.\nThe second condition constrains the noise of the signal. Measurement noise as modeled in Sec. 2.4 has mainly physical origins and is discussed in Sec. 2.2. Additionally, there is noise originating from the motors of the robot as discussed in Sec. 3.3. Finite variance of the noise is easily satisfied by all real systems. Small scale fading can be a deterministic bias for the signal strength measurements as discussed in Sec. 2.3, but that bias can be dealt with as shown in Sec. 5. The bias of motor noise has been discussed to be zero in Sec. 3.3 because of the stochastic nature of the iterate.\nThe third condition — in simplified terms — requires the scalar field to be smooth. This constraint is satisfied because path loss is a physical effect and physical fields governed by Maxwell’s equations always fulfill this smoothness condition.\nFurthermore (and with the most practical relevance), gain sequences ak as well as the sequences of step sizes hk for the central differences are restricted for a convergent algorithm:\nak > 0, (21)\nhk > 0, (22) ak → 0, (23) hk → 0, (24)\n∞ ∑\nk=0\nak = ∞, (25)\n∞ ∑\nk=0\nakhk < ∞, (26)\n∞ ∑\nk=0\na2k h2k < ∞.

The most likely reason for this behavior is small scale fading because of its local periodic nature and the resulting effect on this naive gradient estimation.\nSince a robot has to move from one sampling point to the next while executing the algorithm, we decided to exploit this movement and measure continuously while moving along the two axes of the gradient estimation.

For this, a target function, which satisfies the conditions stated in Sec. 4.2 has to be constructed in terms of signal strength measurements only.\nAs an example objective we choose a typical task in network robotics, namely bridging two network nodes, i.e., moving to the position between the nodes with maximum signal strength and equal signal strength to both nodes. This task often occurs when a gap in the network has to be bridged.\nFor this task we define the objective function g(~x) as\ng(~x) = ‖f1(~x)− f2(~x)‖ − ‖f1(~x) + f2(~x)‖ (32) which can be written (assuming f(~x) >= 0 which is true for signal strengths) as\ng(~x) =\n\n \n  −2f2(~x) f1(~x) > f2(~x) −2f1(~x) f2(~x) > f1(~x) −‖f1(~x) + f2(~x)‖ f1(~x) = f2(~x)\n(33)\nand only consists of signal strength measurements. This objective function has one global minimum at the desired point with properties as stated above. A hypothetical example run of this algorithm is depicted in Fig. 5.\nIn principle, the behavior of this algorithm shows two stages. First the robot moves towards the line — in two dimensions, in three dimensions this is a plane — of equal signal strength to both nodes and then oscillates about this line towards the point of maximum signal strength. This can be seen as a general gradient descent in the first stage and then a line search — or a one dimensional gradient descent — in the reduced space of this line.\nThis objective function has the same properties as the signal strength itself, satisfying the constraints of the algorithm. This is true because noise is added before the absolute value is calculated. However, close to the area equal signal strength of both nodes, both signal strengths cancel out in the first term of (32). This results in the absolute value to be only calculated from the noise, thus positively biasing it which in turn violates the constraint on the noise of having an expectation value of zero. Thus, in this area convergence cannot be guaranteed analytically. Nevertheless, this is not of any practical relevance because the problem reduces to a lowerdimensional gradient descent algorithm in this area."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This paper showed that network robotics can make use of algorithms based on stochastic approximation, working with signal strength measurements, for tasks like navigation. We established estimates of the precision of gradients calculated from signal strength measurements. Signal strength measurements as well motor noise was physically motivated and its effects on the convergence of these algorithms was discussed in depth. The algorithm was also implemented experimentally to show how to deal with some of the specific challenges posed by network robotics. Additionally, we showed that more complex objectives can be formulated in this framework"
