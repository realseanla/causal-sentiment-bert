      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nThe probabilistic roadmap (PRM) [1] is a cornerstone of robot motion planning. It is widely used in practice or as the foundation for more complex planning algorithms. The method is divided into two phases: the PRM graph is first constructed followed by, potentially multiple, shortest path queries on this graph to solve motion planning problems. For a single motion planning query, a feasibility checking subroutine executed repeatedly during PRM construction dominates run-time. However, once the PRM is constructed it can be reused for multiple motion planning queries or modified slightly according to minor changes in the environment. Applicability to multi-query problems is one of the advantages of the PRM over tree-based planners such as Rapidly exploring Random Trees (RRT) [2] and Expansive Space Trees (EST) [3] which are tailored to single-query problems.\nRecent efforts have focused on fine tuning various aspects of PRM-based motion planning for real-time applications. Highly parallelized feasibility checking using FPGAs was recently developed in [4] to alleviate this computational bottleneck during the construction phase. The sparse roadmap spanner was introduced in [5] to reduce memory required to store the PRM and speed up the query phase by keeping only a sparse subgraph with near-optimality properties.\nIn this paper we examine the effectiveness of a landmark based admissible heuristic for reducing the running time of the query phase of the PRM. The landmark heuristic was originally developed for vehicle routing problems in road networks [6] where many shortest path queries are solved on a single graph. In theory, any amount of time spent preprocessing the graph is negligible in comparison to the\na The authors are with The Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control at ETH (email: {padenb,ynager,emilio.frazzoli}@ethz.ch).\nb The first two authors made equal contributions to this work.\ntime spent solving shortest path queries if sufficiently many queries must be solved. This observation suggests solving the all-pairs shortest path problem in order to answer each routing problem in constant time with respect to graph size. However, the memory required to store a solution to the all-pairs shortest is prohibitive for large road networks. The landmark heuristic provides a trade-off between memory requirements and query times by solving a small number of single-source shortest path problems and using their solutions to construct an effective heuristic for a particular graph.\nThis investigation is inspired by the similarities between road networks and the PRM; multiple path queries are solved on both graphs and both graphs are, in practice, too large to store an all pairs shortest path solution in memory.\nA useful feature of the landmark heuristic is that it can be used together with the sparse roadmap spanner and FPGAbased collision checking for a compounded speedup over a standard PRM implementation. Based on the results presented in this paper, we conclude that the landmark heuristic is effective on PRM graphs; solving shortest path queries as much as 20 times faster than Dijkstra’s algorithm and twice as fast as the Euclidean distance-based heuristic in cluttered environments. The downside to the approach is that constructing the heuristic requires preprocessing the graph which adds to the computation time required before the PRM can be used for motion planning queries.\nAn overview of the motion planning problem is presented in Section II, followed by a review of the build and query phases of the PRM method. Section III introduces the landmark heuristic, discusses its admissibility and the complexity of its construction, and illustrates its utility with a simple shortest path problem. However, to better understand the effectiveness of the landmark heuristic in general, we construct randomized environments with a quantifiable degree of clutter and run numerous motion planning queries on these environments to obtain the average case performance. The environment construction and experimental results are presented in Section IV. In Section V we evaluate the landmark heuristic on a simulation of the Kinova Jaco robotic manipulator and find the landmark heuristic to be effective on realistic robot models. Lastly, we conclude with a discussion of our experimental observations in Section VI."

To avoid confusion with curves on Xfree, a path is a sequence of vertices in a graph {xi} such that (xi, xi+1) is an edge in the graph. Curves in Γfree are approximated using paths in the graph by associating each edge of the graph with the line segment between the two vertices making up that edge. The PRM method falls into this category of approximations to Γfree.\nThe PRM∗ method [7] is a popular variation of the PRM because it generates a sparse graph with the following property: if x0 and xg belong to a connected subset of Xfree, then for any fixed ε > 0, the probability that the PRM∗ graph contains a curve γ̂ ∈ Γfree satisfying\nc(γ̂) < inf γ∈Γsol (c(γ)) + ε,\n‖γ̂(0)− x0‖ < ε, ‖γ̂(1)− xg‖ < ε,\n(2)\nconverges to 1 as the number of vertices is increased."

      "text" : "After construction, paths in the graph (VPRM, EPRM) can be used to solve motion planning queries. One subtlety is that the probability of x0 and xg being present in the PRM graph is zero. There are a number of practical ways to resolve this issue, but to keep the exposition as concise as possible we will simply select the nearest vertex x̃0 ∈ VPRM to x0 and x̃g ∈ VPRM to xg as an approximation in light of (2).\nOnce initial and final states x̃0 and x̃g are selected, the motion planning query reduces to a shortest path problem on the PRM graph with edge weights determined by the cost of the line segments between vertices of the graph.\nAlgorithm 2 summarizes the A∗ algorithm for finding a shortest path in the PRM graph from x̃0 to x̃g . The function parent : VPRM → VPRM ∪ {NULL} is used to keep track of the shortest path from x̃0 to each vertex examined by the algorithm. Initially, parent maps all vertices of the graph to NULL, but is redefined in each iteration of the algorithm as shorter paths from x̃0 to vertices in the graph are found. The function label : VPRM → [0,∞] maps each vertex to the cost of the shortest known path reaching that vertex from x̃0. The function label initially maps all vertices to ∞, but is updated at each iteration with the cost of newly discovered paths.\nA set Q of vertices represents a priority queue. The distinguishing feature of the A∗ algorithm is the ordering of vertices in the priority queue according to the labeled cost of the vertex plus a heuristic estimate of the remaining cost to reach the goal h : VPRM → [0,∞]. The subroutine pop(Q) returns a vertex x ∈ Q such that\nx ∈ argmin ν∈Q {label(ν) + h(ν)} (3)\nThe heuristic h is called admissible if it never overestimates the cost to reach the goal from a particular vertex. The A∗ algorithm is guaranteed to return the shortest path from x̃0 if the heuristic in equation (3) is admissible.\nThe pathToRoot subroutine returns the sequence of vertices {vi}i=1,...,N , terminating at vN = x̃0, generated by the recursion\nvi+1 = parent(vi), v1 = x̃g, (4)\nIf pathToRoot is evaluated in Algorithm 2, then its output is a shortest path from x̃0 to x̃g .\nFor graphs with nonnegative edge-weights the heuristic h(x) = 0 for all x ∈ VPRM is clearly admissible. In this special case, the A∗ algorithm is equivalent to Dijkstra’s algorithm. However, the more closely h underestimates the optimal cost from each vertex to x̃g the fewer iterations required by the A∗ algorithm to find the shortest path from x̃0 to x̃g . Therefore, it is desirable to use a heuristic which estimates the optimal cost to reach the goal as closely as possible.\nAlgorithm 2 The A∗ algorithm 1: Q← x̃0; 2: label(x̃0)← 0 3: while Q 6= ∅ 4: v ← pop(Q) 5: if v = x̃g 6: return pathToRoot(xg) 7: S ← neighbors(v) 8: for w ∈ S 9: if label(v) + cost(v, w) < label(w) 10: label(w)← label(v) + cost(v, w) 11: parent(w)← v 12: Q← Q ∪ {w} 13: return NO SOLUTION\nWhen the cost functional is simply the length of the path, as in equation (5), the canonical heuristic is the Euclidean distance between x̃0 to x̃g which is the length of the optimal path in the absence of obstacles.\nc(γ) = ∫ 1 0 ‖γ′(t)‖2 dt (5)\nThe Euclidean distance heuristic is specific to shortest path objectives, and may not be admissible for cost functionals other than (5)."

      "text" : "The landmark heuristic is tailored to a particular graph and requires preprocessing the graph before it can be used in the A∗ algorithm. The resulting heuristic is admissible regardless of cost functional and environment making it a very general approach to obtaining an admissible heuristic.\nThe idea behind the landmark heuristic is as follows: Let d : VPRM × VPRM → [0,∞] be the function which returns the cost of a shortest path from one vertex of the graph to another; taking the value ∞ if no path exists. It follows from the definition that d satisfies the triangle inequality. Consider a vertex xl ∈ VPRM that will represent a landmark. Rearranging the triangle inequality with xl and x̃g yields\n|d(x, xl)− d(xl, x̃g)| ≤ d(x, x̃g) ∀x ∈ VPRM. (6)\nThus, the left hand side of (6) is a lower bound on cost of the shortest path to x̃g . While computing d explicitly would require solving the all-pairs shortest path problem, only the solution to the single-source shortest path problem from x̃l is required to evaluate (6).\nWhen the lower bound in (6) is evaluated at a vertex x that lies on or near to the shortest path from xl to x̃g\nor vice-versa it provides a surprisingly close estimate of the minimum cost path from x to x̃g . Figure 1 illustrates this lower bound. However, obtaining an effective heuristic for all origin-destination pairs requires having a collection of landmarks Vl ⊂ VPRM. The landmark heuristic then leverages (6) for each landmark:\nh(x, xg) = max xl∈Vl\n{|d(x, xl)− d(xl, x̃g)|}. (7)\nTo simplify the analysis presented in this paper, each landmark is an i.i.d. random variable selected from the uniform distribution on VPRM. However, other selection rules can be used to improve the heuristic."

Thus, the time complexity of constructing the heuristic is in O(|Vl| · |VPRM| log(|VPRM|)). From this observation it is clear that this heuristic is only useful in instances where the number of motion planning queries that will be evaluated on the PRM graph will be greater than |Vl| since this many shortest path queries can be solved in the time required to construct the heuristic. Then evaluating the landmark heuristic (7) requires looking up the optimal cost to a landmark 2 · |Vl| times so the complexity of (7) is linear in the number of landmarks.\nStoring the cost of the shortest path to each vertex from a landmark for use in (7) requires O(|VPRM|) memory per landmark for a total memory requirement in O(|Vl|·|VPRM|).\nThe next question is how many landmarks should be used? A natural choice is to select a fixed fraction of the PRM vertices to be landmarks. That is, |Vl| = κ · |VPRM| for some constant κ. This results in O(|VPRM|2) space required to store the heuristic’s lookup tables in memory. However, with just than 16 landmarks, the landmark heuristic has been observed to speed up routing queries by a factor of 9 to 16 on city to continent-scale road networks. On a PRM with a shortest path objective, this observation can be made precise as stated in the next result.\n1This assumes the PRM graph is constructed using Algorithm 1 which has O(|VPRM| log(|VPRM|) edges [7].\nLemma 1.

Two planning\nobjectives were considered for this problem, a shortest path objective and a minimum mechanical work objective. Motivation for using the shortest path objective is that the Euclidean distance is available as an admissible heuristic. On the other hand, minimizing the mechanical work required to execute the motion is a more natural objective that is likely similar to the motion a human would use for the task. The drawback to the latter objective is that there is no obvious heuristic to inform the A∗ search.

      "text" : "The landmark heuristic is well known in the vehicle routing literature where it has been shown to reduce shortest path query times by a factor of 9 to 16 on city to continentscale road networks. Multi-query applications of the PRM in robot motion planning have striking similarities with vehicle routing problems in road networks in that shortest path queries are evaluated repeatedly on a large graph. The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of the landmark heuristic in robotic motion planning applications. Since the heuristic is based on preprocessing the PRM graph, our hypothesis was that its effectiveness would be independent of how densely cluttered the environment was— a useful feature for complex planning tasks.\nTo make this evaluation, we constructed a randomized environment parameterized by the probability that the line segment between two random points did not intersect obstacles. The average case relative performance of the landmark heuristic relative to the Euclidean distance heuristic was then measured through numerous randomized trials. Additionally, the performance of the landmark heuristic was evaluated on a manipulator arm model in a realistic planning scenario.\nThe landmark heuristic was empirically observed to be less sensitive to environment clutter than the Euclidean distance heuristic. For the range of parameters evaluated, the query times were reduced by a factor of 5 to 20 in comparison to Dijkstra’s algorithm. Secondly, a theoretical analysis showed that, with a fixed fraction of PRM vertices assigned to be landmarks, the landmark heuristic converges to the optimal cost between any origin-destination pair with increasing graph size. This analysis was then validated in our experimental results.\nThe landmark heuristic is an effective heuristic for querying large PRM graphs. In particular, it is more effective than the Euclidean distance heuristic in all but nearly obstacle free problem instances. However, the preprocessing time\nrequired to construct the heuristic makes it only suitable for multi-query applications where the heuristic will be used repeatedly on the same graph. A valuable direction for future investigation would be an efficient update to the heuristic when small changes are made to the PRM as a result of changes in the workspace.\nAPPENDIX\nThe proof of Lemma 1 requires some additional notation. The symbol µ denotes the Lebesgue measure on Rd so that the uniform probability measure of a measurable subset S of Xfree is given by µ(S)/µ(Xfree). Since each landmark is an i.i.d. random variable with the uniform distribution on Xfree, the set of landmarks {l1, ..., l|Vl|} can be viewed as a random variable on the product space, denoted X |Vl|free . The probability of li ∈ Si for subsets Si of Xfree is given by the product measure m:\nP ( {l1, ...l|Vl|} ∈ S1 × ...× S|Vl| ) = m ( S1 × ...× S|Vl| ) = ∏|Vl| i=1 µ(Si) µ(Xfree)\n(12) Next, an -net on Xfree is a subset {z1, ..., zk} of Xfree\nsuch that 1) Xfree ⊂ ⋃M i=1B (zi),\n2) B /2(zi) ∩B /2(zj) = ∅ ∀i 6= j. Based on these two properties it is clear that the number of points k making up an -net on Xfree is bounded by\nµ(Xfree) µ(B (·)) ≤ k ≤ µ(Xfree) µ(B /2(·)) . (13)\nObserve that not every B (zi) ∩ Xfree is convex since it may intersect the boundary of Xfree. The the index set K ⊂ {1, ..., k} will identify open balls of the -net which have a convex intersection with Xfree. As the -net becomes finer, a greater fraction of points will lie on the interior of Xfree with a distance to the boundary greater than so\nlim →0 ⋃ i∈K B (zi) = Xfree. (14)\nProof (Lemma 1). Consider the -net described above with = r/2, half the connection radius of the PRM. Note that every vertex in Br/2(zi) is connected by a line segment for i ∈ K.\nThe probability that the landmarks {l1, ..., l|Vl|} ∩ Br/2(zi) = ∅ for some i ∈ K can be written as\nP ( (l1, ..., l|Vl|) ∈ ⋃ i∈K(B c r/2(zi)) |Vl| )\n≤ ∑ i∈Km((B c r/2(zi)) |Vl|)\n≤ µ(Xfree)µ(Br/4) · ( 1− µ(Br/2(zi))µ(Xfree) )|Vl| (15)\nBy inserting the expression for r in Algorithm 1 and replacing |Vl| with λ · |VPRM|, the last expression in (15) simplifies to\nα · |VPRM| log(|VPRM|)\n· (\n1− β · log(|VPRM|) |VPRM|\n)λ·|VPRM| , (16)\nfor constants α, β ∈ (0, 1) that depend only on the dimension d of Xfree. One can readily verify that this expression converges to zero as |VPRM| → ∞. Thus, the probability that there is at least one landmark in each Br/2(zi) for i ∈ K converges 1. It follows that every vertex x ∈ VPRM ∩(⋃\ni∈KBr/2(zi) )\nhas a landmark as a neighbor almost surely as |VPRM| → ∞. Therefore, for at least one landmark l∗, the optimal cost from x to l∗ satisfies d(x, l∗) ≤ r. Thus,\nh(x, xg) = max xl∈Vl {|d(x, xl)− d(xl, x̃g)|} ≥ d(x, l∗)− d(xg, l∗)\n(17)\nExpanding d(x, l∗) with the triangle inequality between x, l∗, and xg yields\nh(x, xg) ≥ d(x, xg)− d(xg, xn)− d(xg, xn) ≥ d(x, xg)− 2r\n(18)\nCombining (6) and (17) we have d(x, xg)−2r ≤ h(x, xg) ≤ d(x, xg), and since r → 0 as |VPRM| → ∞ we obtain\nlim |VPRM|→∞ h(x, xg) = d(x, xg), (19)\non ⋃ i∈KBr/2(zi). The desired result (8) then follows in light of (14)."

The heuristic is generated by storing minimum spanning trees from a small number of vertices within the PRM graph and using these trees to approximate the cost of a shortest path between any two vertices of the graph. The intermediate step of preprocessing the graph increases the time and memory requirements of the classical motion planning technique in exchange for speeding up individual queries making the method advantageous in multi-query applications. This paper investigates these trade-offs on PRM graphs constructed in randomized environments as well as a practical manipulator simulation. We conclude that the method is preferable to Dijkstra’s algorithm or the A∗ algorithm with conventional heuristics in multi-query applications.",
