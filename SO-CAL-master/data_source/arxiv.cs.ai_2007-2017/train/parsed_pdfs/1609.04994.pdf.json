      "text" : "Good exploration strategies are currently a major obstacle for reinforcement learning (RL). The state of the art in deep RL (Mnih et al., 2015, 2016) relies on ε-greedy policies: in every time step, the agent takes a random action with some probability. Yet ε-greedy is a poor exploration strategy and for environments with sparse rewards it is quite ineffective (for example the Atari game ‘Montezuma’s Revenge’): it just takes too long until the agent randomwalks into the first reward.\nMore sophisticated exploration strategies have been proposed: using information gain about the environment (Sun et al., 2011; Orseau et al., 2013; Houthooft et al., 2016) or pseudo-count (Bellemare et al., 2016). In practice, these exploration strategies are employed by adding an exploration bonus (‘intrinsic motivation’) to the reward signal (Schmidhuber, 2010). While the methods above require the agent to have a model of its environment and formalize the strategy ‘explore by going to where the model has high uncertainty,’ there are also model-free strategies like the automatic discovery of options proposed by Machado and Bowling (2016). However, none of these explicit exploration strategies take the problem’s reward structure into account. Intuitively, we want to explore more in parts of the environment where the\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n04 99\n4v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n8 N\nreward is high and less where it is low. This is readily exposed in optimistic policies like UCRL (Jaksch et al., 2010) and stochastic policies like PSRL (Strens, 2000), but these do not make the exploration/exploitation tradeoff explicitly.\nIn this paper, we propose exploration potential, a quantity that measures rewarddirected exploration. We consider model-based reinforcement learning in partially or fully observable domains. Informally, exploration potential is the Bayes-expected absolute deviation of the value of optimal policies. Exploration potential is similar to information gain about the environment, but explicitly takes the problem’s reward structure into account. We show that this leads to a exploration criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic optimality (learning to act optimally across an environment class): a reinforcement learning agent learns to act optimal in the limit if and only if the exploration potential converges to 0. As such, exploration potential captures the essence of what it means to ‘explore the right amount’.\nAnother exploration quantity that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic optimality is information gain about the optimal policy (Russo and Van Roy, 2014; Reddy et al., 2016). In contrast to exploration potential, it is not measured on the scale of rewards, making an explicit value-of-information tradeoff more difficult.\nFor example, consider a 3-armed Gaussian bandit problem with means 0.6, 0.5, and −1. The information content is identical in every arm. Hence an exploration strategy based on maximizing information gain about the environment would query the third arm, which is easily identifiable as suboptimal, too frequently (linearly versus logarithmically). This arm provides information, but this information is not very useful for solving the reinforcement learning task. In contrast, an exploration potential based exploration strategy concentrates its exploration on the first two arms."

With abuse of notation, we treat histories both as outcomes and as random variables.\nA policy is a function mapping a history æ<t and an action a to the probability π(a | æ<t) of taking action a after seeing history æ<t. An environment is a function mapping a history æ1:t to the probability ν(et | æ<tat) of generating percept et after this history æ<tat. A policy π and an environment ν generate a probability measure νπ over infinite histories, the expectation over this measure is denoted with\nEπν .

Admitting a strongly unique optimal policy is an even stronger requirement because it requires that there exist no other policies that approach the optimal value asymptotically but take different actions (i.e., there is a constant gap in the argmax). For any finite-state (PO)MDP with a unique optimal policy that policy is also strongly unique.\nProposition 6 (Asymptotic Optimality⇒ EP→ 0). If the policy π is asymptotically optimal in mean in the environment classM and each environment ν ∈ M admits a strongly unique optimal policy, then EPM → 0 in µπ-probability for all µ ∈M.\nProof. Since π is asymptotically optimal in mean inM, we have that V ∗µ −V πµ → 0 and since µ admits a strongly unique optimal policy, π converges to π∗µ in µ πprobability, thus V̂ πt − V̂ π∗µ t → 0.

      "text" : "In this section we use experiments with multi-armed Bernoulli bandits to illustrate the properties of exploration potential. The class of Bernoulli bandits is Θ = [0, 1]k (the arms’ means). In each time step, the agent chooses an action (arm) i ∈ {1, . . . , k} and receives a reward rt ∼ Bernoulli(θ∗i ) where θ∗ ∈ Θ is the true environment. Since Θ is uncountable, exploration potential is defined with an integral instead of a sum:\nEPΘ(æ<t) := ∫\nΘ p(θ | æ<t)|θj(θ) − θ̂j(θ)|dθ\nwhere p(θ | æ<t) is the posterior distribution given the history æ<t, θ̂ := ∫\nΘ θp(θ | æ<t)dθ is the Bayes-mean parameter, and j(θ) := arg maxi θi is the index of the best arm accoding to θ.\nFigure 1 shows the exploration potential of several bandit algorithms, illustrating how much each algorithm explores. Notably, optimally confident UCB (Lattimore,\n2015) stops exploring around time step 700 and focuses on exploitation (because in contrast to the other algorithms it knows the horizon). Thompson sampling, round robin (alternate between all arms), and ε-greedy explore continuously (but ε-greedy is less effective). The optimal strategy (always pull the first arm) never explores and hence its exploration potential decreases only slightly.\nExploration potential naturally gives rise to an exploration strategy: greedily minimize Bayes-expected exploration potential (MinEP); see Algorithm 1. This strategy unsurprisingly explores more than all the other algorithms when measured on exploration potential, but in bandits it also turns out to be a decent exploitation strategy because it focuses its attention on the most promising arms. For empirical performance see Figure 2. However, MinEP is generally not a good exploitation strategy in more complex environments like MDPs.\nAlgorithm 1 The MinEP Algorithm 1: for t ∈ N do 2: at := arg mina∈A Eet∼posterior[EP(æ<taet)] 3: take action at 4: observe percept et"

      "text" : "Several variants on the definition exploration potential given in Definition 1 are conceivable. However, often they do not satisfy at least one of the properties that make our definition appealing. Either they break the necessity (Proposition 3), sufficiency (Proposition 6), our proofs thereof, or they make EP hard to compute. For example, we could replace |V ∗ν −V̂ π ∗ ν\nt | by |V ∗ν −V πν |where π is the agent’s future policy. This preserves both necessesity and sufficiency, but relies on computing the agent’s future policy. If the agent uses exploration potential for taking actions (e.g., for targeted exploration), then this definition becomes a self-referential equation and might be very hard to solve. Following Dearden et al. (1999), we could consider |V ∗ν − V̂ ∗t | which has the convenient side-effect that it is model-free and therefore applies to more reinforcement learning algorithms. However, in this case the necessity guarantee (Proposition 6) requires the additional condition that the agent’s policy converges to the greedy policy π∗\nV̂ . Moreover, this does not remove the\ndependence on a model since we still need a model classM and a posterior. Based on the recent successes in approximating information gain (Houthooft et al., 2016), we are hopeful that exploration potential can also be approximated in practice. Since computing the posterior is too costly for complex reinforcement learning problems, we could (randomly) generate a few environments and estimate the sum in Definition 1 with them.\nIn this paper we only scratch the surface on exploration potential and leave many open questions. Is this the correct definition? What are good rates at which EP should converge to 0? Is minimizing EP the most efficient exploration strategy? Can we compute EP more efficiently than information gain?"

    "abstractText" : "We introduce exploration potential, a quantity that measures how much a reinforcement learning agent has explored its environment class. In contrast to information gain, exploration potential takes the problem’s reward structure into account. This leads to an exploration criterion that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic optimality (learning to act optimally across the entire environment class). Our experiments in multi-armed bandits use exploration potential to illustrate how different algorithms make the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation.",
