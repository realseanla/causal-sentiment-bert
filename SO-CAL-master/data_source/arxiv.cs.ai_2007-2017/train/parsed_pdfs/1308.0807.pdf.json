      "text" : "Definition 1 (Abstract Argumentation Framework). An abstract argumentation framework AF is a tuple AF = (Arg,→) where Arg is a set of arguments and → is a relation →⊆ Arg × Arg.\nFor two arguments A,B ∈ Arg the relation A → B means that argument A attacks argument B. Abstract argumentation frameworks can be concisely represented by directed graphs, where arguments are represented as nodes and edges model the attack relation.\nExample 1. Consider the abstract argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→) depicted in Figure 1. Here it is Arg = {A1,A2,A3,A4,A5} and →= {(A1,A2), (A2,A1), (A2,A3), (A3,A4), (A4,A5), (A5,A4), (A5,A3)}.\nSemantics are usually given to abstract argumentation frameworks by means of extensions [Dun95] or labelings [WC10]. An extension E of an argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→) is a set of arguments E ⊆ Arg that gives some coherent view on the argumentation underlying\nAF. A labeling L is a function L : Arg → {in, out, undec} that assigns to each argument A ∈ Arg either the value in, meaning that the argument is accepted, out, meaning that the argument is not accepted, or undec, meaning that the status of the argument is undecided. Let in(L) = {A | L(A) = in} and out(L) resp. undec(L) be defined analogously. As extensions can be characterized by the arguments that labeled in in some labeling, we restrain our attention to labelings henceforth. In order to distinguish extension- and labeling-based semantics to the probabilistic semantics in the next section we denote the former classical semantics.\nIn the literature [Dun95, Cam06] a wide variety of different types of classical semantics has been proposed. Arguably, the most important property of a semantics is its admissibility.\nDefinition 2. A labeling L is called admissible if and only if for all arguments A ∈ Arg\n1. if L(A) = out then there is B ∈ Arg with L(B) = in and B → A, and\n2. if L(A) = in then L(B) = out for all B ∈ Arg with B → A,\nand it is called complete if, additionally, it satisfies\n3. if L(A) = undec then there is no B ∈ Arg with B → A and L(B) = in and there is a B′ ∈ Arg with B′ → A and L(B′) 6= out.\nThe intuition behind admissibility is that an argument can only be accepted if there are no attackers that are accepted and if an argument is not accepted then there has to be some reasonable grounds. The idea behind the completeness property is that the status of argument is only undec if it cannot be classified as in or out. Different types of classical semantics can be phrased by imposing further constraints.\nDefinition 3. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an abstract argumentation framework and L : Arg → {in, out, undec} a complete labeling.\n• L is grounded if and only if in(L) is minimal.\n• L is preferred if and only if in(L) is maximal.\n• L is stable if and only if undec(L) = ∅.\n• L is semi-stable if and only if undec(L) is minimal.\nAll statements on minimality/maximality are meant to be with respect to set inclusion.\nNote that a grounded labeling is uniquely determined and always exists [Dun95]. Besides the above mentioned types of classical semantics there are a lot of further proposals such as CF2 semantics [BGG05]. However, in this paper we focus on complete (c), grounded (gr), preferred (p), stable (s), and semi-stable (ss) semantics. In the following, let σ ∈ {c, gr, p, s, ss} be some semantics.\nExample 2. We continue Example 1. Consider the labeling L defined via\nL(A1) = in L(A2) = out L(A3) = out\nL(A4) = out L(A5) = in\nClearly, L is an admissible labeling as it satisfies properties 1.) and 2.) from above. Additionally, it is complete and also preferred, stable, and semi-stable. Furthermore, consider the labeling L′ defined via\nL′(A1) = out L ′(A2) = in L ′(A3) = out L′(A4) = in L ′(A5) = out\nThe labeling L′ is also admissible, complete, preferred, stable, and semi-stable. Note, that the grounded labeling Lg is defined via Lg(A1) = Lg(A2) = Lg(A3) = Lg(A4) = Lg(A5) = undec."

      "heading" : "3 Stratified Labelings",
      "text" : "In the following, we define stratified labelings as a novel approach to give semantics to an abstract argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→).\nDefinition 4. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an abstract argumentation framework and let σ be a semantics. A σ-stratified labeling S for AF is a function S : Arg → N ∪ {∞} such that there is a σ-labeling L for AF and\n1. if in(L) = ∅ then S(A) = ∞ for all A ∈ Arg.\n2. if in(L) 6= ∅ then there is a σ-stratified labeling S′ for AF′ = (Arg′,→ ∩Arg′ × Arg′) with Arg′ = Arg \\ in(L) such that\na) S(A) = 0 for all A ∈ in(L) and\nb) S(A) = 1 + S′(A) for all A ∈ Arg \\ in(L).\nA σ-stratified labeling S is called finite if S−1(∞) = ∅.\nThe idea behind σ-stratified labelings is to measure the amount of controversiality or indeterminateness of assigning the label in to an argument. In particular, a value S(A) = 0 means that an argument is uncontroversially accepted. The larger the value the more controversial an argument becomes. Note that, in particular, there may be arguments which are considered “out” by the initial σ-labeling L but classified with rank one by a corresponding stratified labeling while “undecided” arguments may get even larger values. This behavior is in contrast to other approaches for graded assessments of arguments [LON11, Thi12, Hun13, JCV08, DHM+11, MT08, ABN13] where controversial arguments are usually assessed as in between “in” and “out” arguments. The rationale behind the assessment of stratified labelings is that arguments classified as “out” with classical semantics are less controversial than undecided arguments (although they are not accepted they are uncontroversially classified as “out”). The interpretation of stratified labelings follows the idea of dynamics of argumentation frameworks [CdSCLS08, FKIS09] and, specifically, the notion of enforcement [Bau12]: how much must an argumentation framework be changed in order to accept a given argument? Arguments uncontroversially classified as “out” are (basically) more easily enforced. We will have another look at these issues in Section 6.\nConsider the following examples.\nExample 3. The grounded-stratified labeling for the argumentation framework from Example 1 is Sgr\nAF with\nSgr AF (A1) = S gr AF (A2) = S gr AF (A3) = S gr AF (A4) = S gr AF (A5) = ∞\nExample 4. The grounded-stratified labeling for the argumentation framework depicted in Figure 2 is Sgr\nAF with\nSgr AF (A1) = 0 S gr AF (A2) = 1 S gr AF (A3) = 2\nThe grounded labeling of AF assigns to A1 the value in and to all other arguments the value\nA1 A2 A3\nFigure 2: Argumentation framework from Example 4\nout. Therefore, A1 gets the value 0. Removing A1 from AF yields a framework consisting of arguments A2,A3 and A2 attacking A3. The grounded labeling of this framework assigns to A2 the value in and to A3 the value out. Therefore, A2 gets the value 1. Finally, A3 gets the value 2.\nExample 5. The grounded-stratified labeling for the argumentation framework depicted in Figure 3 is Sgr\nAF with\nSgr AF (A1) = 0 S gr AF (A2) = 1 S gr AF (A3) = 3 Sgr AF (A4) = 1 S gr AF (A5) = 2\nThe last example also shows the advantage of using stratified labelings instead of ordinary labelings. While for AF from Example 5 only argument A1 is labelled in (with respect to grounded semantics), A2 is labeled out, and all other arguments are labeled undec, the groundedstratified labeling gives a more graded assessment of the arguments’ controversiality.\nExample 6. The argumentation framework AF shown in Figure 4 has six different stablestratified labelings\nSs,1 AF (A1) = 0 S s,1 AF (A2) = 1 S s,1 AF (A3) = 2 Ss,2 AF (A1) = 0 S s,2 AF (A2) = 2 S s,2 AF (A3) = 1 Ss,3 AF (A1) = 1 S s,3 AF (A2) = 2 S s,3 AF (A3) = 3 Ss,4 AF (A1) = 1 S s,4 AF (A2) = 3 S s,4 AF (A3) = 2 Ss,5 AF (A1) = 2 S s,5 AF (A2) = 1 S s,5 AF (A3) = 3 Ss,6 AF (A1) = 2 S s,6 AF (A2) = 3 S s,6 AF (A3) = 1\nWe now look at some general properties of stratified labelings.\nProposition 1. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an argumentation framework.\n1. The grounded-stratified labeling Sgr AF always exists and is uniquely determined.\n2. If A → A for some A ∈ Arg then S(A) = ∞ for every semantics σ and σ-stratified labeling S.\n3. for every stable-stratified labeling S it holds ∞ /∈ Im S.\nProof. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an argumentation framework.\n1. Due to [Dun95] there is exactly one grounded labeling Lgr of AF. It follows that for every two grounded-stratified labelings S1, S2 it holds S −1 1 (0) = S −1 2 (0). By induction, it follows\nS−11 (i) = S −1 2 (i) for every i ∈ N ∪ {∞} and therefore S1 = S2.\n2. If A → A then L(A) 6= in for every semantics σ and σ-labeling L. Therefore, neither condition 1.) nor condition 2.) in Definition 4 can be satisfied for A and it follows S(A) = ∞ for every semantics σ and σ-stratified labeling S.\n3. Assume that S is a stable-stratified labeling with S(A) = ∞ and let L be the labeling in condition 3.) of Definition 4 responsible for setting S(A) = ∞. As L is stable (requiring undec(L) = ∅) and L(A) 6= in it follows L(A) = out. Then there must be a B with B → A and L(B) = in. This is a contradiction and therefore ∞ /∈ Im S.\nProposition 2. Each σ-stratified labeling S of an argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→) is characterized by a set of nested subsets A0 ⊇ A1 ⊇ . . . ⊇ Ak ⊇ A−1 of Arg with k ≥ −1, A0 = Arg if k ≥ 0, and an appertaining vector (L0, L1, . . . , Lk, L−1) of σ-labelings Li such that\n1. Li is a labeling on (Ai,→ ∩(Ai ×Ai)), −1 ≤ i ≤ k,\n2. in(Li) = Ai\\Ai+1 6= ∅, 0 ≤ i ≤ k,\n3. A−1 = Arg\\(∪ k i=0Ai), in(L−1) = ∅,\n4. S(A) = max{i | A ∈ Ai, 0 ≤ i ≤ k}, if k ≥ 0,\n5. S(A) = S(B) iff A,B ∈ Ai for some −1 ≤ i ≤ k,\n6. S(A) ≤ S(B) iff A ∈ Ai implies B ∈ Ai for all −1 ≤ i ≤ k,\n7. S(A) = ∞ for all A ∈ A−1.\nIf S is characterized as given above, we write S ↔ 〈(A0, A1, . . . , Ak, A−1), (L0, L1, . . . , Lk, L−1)〉.\nNote that k = −1 is possible, in which case we have A−1 = Arg, and that on the other hand, A−1 can be empty, which is equivalent to S being finite."

      "text" : "In [ABN13], the authors consider ranking-based semantics of argumentation frameworks, i. e., they interpret AF = (Arg,→) uniquely in terms of a total preorder on Arg that expresses\nacceptability. They set up a set of postulates that such semantics should satisfy, and present examples for ranking-based semantics as a proof of concept.\nIn our approach, stratified labelings are not uniquely determined by the argumentation framework, but different labelings are possible, depending on the chosen semantics. To make the ideas of [ABN13] applicable, we first generalize their properties to handle classes of rankings for an argumentation framework. Furthermore, to comply better with the intuitive notion of rankings as a kind of (numerical) ordinal degrees, we specify rankings as an assignment of natural numbers to arguments.\nDefinition 12. An ordinal ranking λ of an argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→) is a function λ : Arg → N ∪∞. If for A,B ∈ Arg, λ(A) ≤ λ(B), then we say that A is at least as acceptable as B. Let Λ(AF) be the set of all ordinal rankings of AF.\nFor the above rankings we consider the interpretation of values as given by [ABN13], i. e., rankings express degrees of acceptability : The lower the rank of an argument, the more acceptable it is deemed. If λ(A) = ∞, then A is not acceptable at all. Note that σ-stratified labelings are syntactically ordinal rankings but differ in their interpretation. More specifically, stratified labelings are meant as a measure of controversiality and not acceptability. Nonetheless, in the following we adopt the properties discussed in [ABN13] and apply them to stratified labelings as well. For that, it is clear that each ranking defined by Definition 12 induces a ranking in the sense of [ABN13] and vice versa. Moreover, it would be possible to define stratified labelings as total preorders as well, but using natural numbers (plus ∞) allows a more compact handling of technical details.\nHere, rankings are not looked upon as transformations of argumentation frameworks as in [ABN13] but are rather meant to be kind of models of argumentation frameworks. With the next definition, we define semantics to argumentation frameworks by assigning to each framework a class of such ordinal rankings.\nDefinition 13. An ordinal semantics O is a function that assigns a class of rankings to each argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→):\nO : AF 7→ OAF ⊆ Λ(AF).\nσ-stratified labelings define an ordinal semantics for argumentation frameworks:\nDefinition 14. Let σ be a semantics. The ordinal σ-stratified semantics Ostratσ is defined by\nOstratσ (AF) = {S | S is a σ-stratified labelings for AF}.\nNow, we elaborate on formal properties of ordinal semantics in analogy to [ABN13], enhancing the names of the postulates with an asterisk to indicate that they refer to semantics in terms of sets of rankings.\nFirst, if two argumentation frameworks AF1,AF2 are isomorphic, then they should have basically the same semantics. We define isomorphisms between argumentation frameworks in terms of graph isomorphisms.\nDefinition 15. Let AF1 = (Arg1,→1),AF2 = (Arg2,→2) be two argumentation frameworks. An isomorphism ϕ from AF1 to AF2 is a bijective mapping φ : Arg1 → Arg2 such that for all A,B ∈ Arg1, A →1 B iff ϕ(A) →1 ϕ(B). The frameworks AF1 and AF2 are called isomorphic if there is an isomorphism ϕ from AF1 to AF2.\nThe first property, Abstraction∗ states that isomorphisms between two argumentation frameworks are apt to carry over ordinal semantics:\nAbstraction∗ (Ab∗) An ordinal semantics O satisfies (Ab∗) iff for any isomorphic argumentation frameworks AF1 = (Arg1,→1) and AF2 = (Arg2,→2), and for every isomorphism ϕ : AF1 → AF2, it holds that\nO(AF2) = {λ1 ◦ ϕ −1 | λ1 ∈ O(AF1)} = O(AF1) ◦ ϕ −1. (1)\nProposition 4. Ostratσ satisfies (Ab ∗) for all semantics σ.\nProof. Let ϕ : AF1 → AF2 be an isomorphism. For each σ-stratified labeling S1 on AF1 that is characterized by A0 ⊇ A1 ⊇ . . . ⊇ Ak ⊇ A−1 and (L0, L1, . . . , Lk, L−1), (L0 ◦ ϕ\n−1, L1 ◦ ϕ−1, . . . , Lk ◦ ϕ −1, L−1 ◦ ϕ −1) defines a σ-stratified labeling S2 on ϕ(A0) ⊇ ϕ(A1) ⊇ . . . ⊇ ϕ(Ak) ⊇ ϕ(A−1) such that S2 = S1 ◦ ϕ −1.\nAlso the next property, Irrelevance∗ (Ir∗) deals merely with properties of the argumentation graph. Note that Irrelevance∗ (Ir∗) corresponds to Independence in [ABN13].\nLet WCom(AF) be the set of all subgraphs of AF that arise from (finite) unions of weakly connected components of AF; in particular, each weakly connected component of AF is contained in WCom(AF). Note that each BF ∈ WCom(AF) contains all relevant information for labelings, as it contains all relevant edges. We consider labelings and rankings on elements BF of WCom(AF).\nIrrelevance∗ (Ir∗) An ordinal semantics O satisfies (Ir∗) iff for all argumentation frameworks AF such that O(AF) 6= ∅, and for any BF ∈ WCom(AF), for all λ′ ∈ O(BF), there is λ ∈ O(AF ) such that, for any B1,B2 ∈ BF, the following conditions are fulfilled:\n(i) λ′(B1) = λ ′(B2) iff λ(B1) = λ(B2), and\n(ii) λ′(B1) ≤ λ ′(B2) iff λ(B1) ≤ λ(B2).\nProposition 5. Ostratσ satisfies (Ir ∗) for all semantics σ.\nProof. Let AF be an argumentation framework such that O(AF) 6= ∅, let BF ∈ WCom(AF); then BFc = AF\\BF is in WCom(AF) as well. First, if L is a σ-labeling on AF, it can be partitioned into σ-labelings (L′, L′′) with σ-labeling L′ on BF and L′′ on BFc such that\nL(A) =\n{\nL′(A) if A ∈ BF, L′′(A) if A ∈ BFc,\nin particular, in(L) = in(L′)∪in(L′′). In principle, the same can be done for σ-stratified labelings S. If S is characterized by (A0, A1, . . . , Ak, A−1) and appertaining σ-labelings (L0, L1, . . . , Lk, L−1), then intersecting each Ai with BF resp. BF\nc gives rise to labelings within the scope of BF resp. BFc. However, as it can be the case that in(Li) ∩ BF = ∅ or in(Li) ∩ BF\nc = ∅, the final stratum ∗−1 can be reached earlier. Due to the properties of the semantics, either both in(Li) ∩ BF or in(Li) ∩ BF\nc are not empty for all i (if σ = stable), or if one of them is empty before the final stratum of S is reached, all following intersections must also be empty while the in(Li) then are concentrated on the other component. The other way round, σ-labelings on the components BF and BFc can be combined to a σ-labeling on AF. If these relationships hold between a σ-labeling S on AF and σ-labeling S′ resp. S′′ on BF resp. BFc, then we write S = (S′, S′′), and S′ = S|BF.\nLet σ be a semantics and consider Ostratσ . Let AF be an argumentation framework such that O(AF) 6= ∅, let BF ∈ WCom(AF), and let S′ ∈ Ostratσ (BF) be a σ-stratified labeling of BF, S\n′ ↔ 〈(B0, B1, . . . , Bj, B−1), (L ′ 0, L ′ 1, . . . , L ′ j , L ′\n−1)〉. From the construction above, and since O(AF) 6= ∅, there is a σ-stratified labeling S ∈ Ostratσ (AF), S ↔ 〈(A0, A1, . . . , Ak, A−1), (L0, L1, . . . , Lk, L−1)〉 such that S ′ = S|BF, i. e., in particular, j ≤ k, Bi = Ai ∩ BF, L ′\ni = Li|BF. For any two arguments B1,B2 ∈ BF, due to Proposition 2, we have S(B1) = S(B2) iff B1,B2 are elements of the same Ai, hence iff they are elements of the same Bi, therefore iff S ′(B1) = S ′(B2). Similarly, S(B1) ≤ S(B2) iff S ′(B1) ≤ S ′(B2); note that S(B) = ∞ implies S ′(B) = ∞, and S(B), S′(B) ≤ ∞ for all arguments B. This completes the proof.\nVoid Precedence∗ (VP∗) An ordinal semantics O satisfies (VP∗) iff for all argumentation frameworks AF = (Arg,→), for all λ ∈ O(AF), for all A,B ∈ Arg the following holds: If A is not attacked but B is attacked, then λ(A) < λ(B).\nProposition 6. For every semantics σ, Ostratσ does not satisfy (VP ∗).\nThis can be easily seen since for any σ, σ-labelings do not distinguish between the value “in” and not being attacked at all. And indeed, (VP∗) is not indebatable because one might deem an argument that has survived attacks not to be worse than arguments that have not proved their strength against counterarguments. So, we propose a weakened version of (VP∗):\nWeak Void Precedence∗ (WVP∗) An ordinal semantics O satisfies (WVP∗) iff for all argumentation frameworks AF = (Arg,→), for all λ ∈ O(AF), for all A,B ∈ Arg the following holds: If A is not attacked at all, then λ(A) ≤ λ(B).\n(WVP∗) ensures that non-attacked arguments are at least as acceptable as any other arguments.\nProposition 7. Ostratσ satisfies (WVP ∗) for all semantics σ.\nProof. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an argumentation framework and let σ be a semantics, let A ∈ Arg be an argument. If A is not attacked at all, then for all σ-labelings L on AF, L(A) = in, so for all S ∈ Ostratσ (AF), S(A) = 0 ≤ S(B) for all B ∈ Arg.\nThe philosophy pursued in [ABN13] is that attacks always weaken an argument whereas in our framework, we aim at assessing the controversiality of an argument, i. e., arguments that are clearly defended by other arguments are as uncontroversial. However, if one wishes to do so, a modification of the definition of stratified labelings would be possible where each layer is split into two layers, one (lower) layer containing the non-attacked arguments (which are trivially in) and a (higher) layer that contains the rest of the in-Arguments.\nDefinition 16. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an argumentation framework, let A ∈ Arg. Then AttAF(A) = {B ∈ Arg | B → A} is the set of attackers of A, and DefAF(a) = {B ∈ Arg | ∃C ∈ Arg such that C → A and B → C} is the set of defenders of A.\nDefense Precedence∗ (DP∗) An ordinal semantics O satisfies (DP∗) iff for all argumentation frameworks AF = (Arg,→), for all λ ∈ O(AF), for all A,B ∈ Arg the following holds: If |Att(A)| = |Att(B)| and Def(A) = ∅, but Def(B) 6= ∅, then λ(A) < λ(B).\nThis postulate is highly debatable as it focusses too much on quite local topological aspects of the argumentation frameworks, in particular, the sheer number of attackers, but neglects the global topology. In our framework, it is more the depth of attacks and the complexity of the topology of the networks that count. For the same reason, also the postulates (Strict) CounterTransitivity, Cardinality Precedence, and Distributed-Defense Precedence from [ABN13] are not useful in our framework.\nThe last property from [ABN13] to be considered here is Quality Precedence:\nQuality Precedence∗ (QP∗) An ordinal semantics O satisfies (QP∗) iff for all argumentation frameworks AF = (Arg,→), for all λ ∈ O(AF), for all A,B ∈ Arg the following holds: If there is C ∈ AttAF(B) such that for all D ∈ AttAF(A), λ(C) < λ(D), then λ(A) < λ(B).\nQuality Precedence∗ is not satisfied in general by the σ-ordinal semantics. For instance, as a counterexample, consider Example 5 with A = A5,B = A2. Here we have AttAF(A) = {A4}, AttAF(B) = {A1}, and indeed, S gr AF (A1) = 0 < 1 = S gr AF (A4), but S gr AF\n(A5) = 2 > 1 = Sgr AF\n(A2). In general, the approach in [ABN13] differs from ours in various respects: First, we consider classes of ordinal rankings for argumentation frameworks and not just one (more general) ranking. Second, those authors define a ranking-based semantics in order to assess the strength of an argument while we aim at assessing the controversiality of an argument. Other properties might be more useful and it is up to future work to develop and investigate such properties."

The core notion of his framework is the (σ,U)-characteristic which is based on the attack-distance of two frameworks.\nDefinition 17. Let AF1 = (Arg1,→1),AF2 = (Arg2,→2) be abstract argumentation frameworks. The attack-distance d(AF1,AF2) between AF1 and AF2 is defined via\nd(AF1,AF2) = | →1 ∆ →2 | .\nDefinition 18. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an abstract argumentation framework and σ a semantics. The (σ,U)-characteristic NAFσ (C) of a set C ⊆ Arg is defined as\nNAFσ (C) =\n\n\n\n0 C ⊆ in(L) for some σ-labeling L k k = min{d(AF,AF′) | NAF ′\nσ (C) = 0} ∞ otherwise\nThe (σ,U)-characteristic of a set of arguments C is the minimal effort required to establish C being accepted.\nConjecture 1. Let AF = (Arg,→) be an argumentation framework without cycles and σ a semantics. For all A,B ∈ Arg, if NAFσ ({A}) < N AF σ ({B}) then for all finite σ-stratified labelings S it holds S(A) < S(B).\nThe general statement does not hold as the following example shows.\nExample 8. The grounded-stratified labeling for the argumentation framework depicted in Figure 6 is Sgr\nAF with\nSgr AF (A1) = 2 S gr AF (A2) = 1 S gr AF (A3) = ∞ Sgr AF (A4) = ∞ S gr AF (A5) = 1 S gr AF (A6) = 0 Sgr AF (A7) = 1 S gr AF (A8) = 0\nbut we have NAFgr ({A1}) = 1 (by just removing the attack from A2 → A1) and N AF gr ({A2}) = 2 (by removing e. g. the attacks A4 → A2 and A3 → A2)."

      "text" : "Although [KIS11] also investigates the relationship between argumentation and ordinal conditional functions, in general, and system Z, in particular, the methods used in that paper are quite different from the approach presented here. In [KIS11], the arguments are built from rules, and the argumentation framework suitably chosen there is DeLP [GS04]. In the present approach, arguments are more atomic (i. e., possible worlds), and the argumentation semantics are abstract. The relations between system Z and argumentation could only be established in some special cases in [KIS11], whereas we found a general argumentative characterization of system Z here.\nIn [Wey12], Weydert defines so-called ranking models for abstract argumentation frameworks. He associates a kind of conditional with each argument, symbolizing premise and claim of the argument, and interprets attack in terms of (generalized) ordinal conditional functions. While such functions are also the basis for defining system Z, the contributions of that work are quite different from our approach. Most prominently, we assign ranking degrees to abstract arguments, not to the propositional content of arguments. Moreover, in our framework, these ranking degrees are computed solely on the base of the abstract topological structure of the argumentation graph whereas in [Wey12], rankings are induced partly by the conditionals associated with the arguments, i. e., by the internal structures of the arguments."

      "text" : "In this paper, we presented preliminary work on a novel semantical notion for abstract argumentation frameworks: stratified labelings. We analyzed some general properties of our approach and compared it to ranking functions for conditional reasoning and similar approaches from argumentation theory. The core difference between our approach of stratified labelings and other graded approaches for semantics is that we measure controversiality of arguments instead of their strength.\nOngoing work is about a deeper analysis of the approach and its relationships to other approaches."

    "abstractText" : "argumentation frameworks [Dun95] take a very simple view on argumentation as they do not presuppose any internal structure of an argument. Abstract argumentation frameworks only consider the interactions of arguments by means of an attack relation between arguments. Definition 1 (Abstract Argumentation Framework). An abstract argumentation framework AF is a tuple AF = (Arg,→) where Arg is a set of arguments and → is a relation →⊆ Arg × Arg. For two arguments A,B ∈ Arg the relation A → B means that argument A attacks argument B. Abstract argumentation frameworks can be concisely represented by directed graphs, where arguments are represented as nodes and edges model the attack relation. Example 1. Consider the abstract argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→) depicted in Figure 1. Here it is Arg = {A1,A2,A3,A4,A5} and →= {(A1,A2), (A2,A1), (A2,A3), (A3,A4), (A4,A5), (A5,A4), (A5,A3)}. Semantics are usually given to abstract argumentation frameworks by means of extensions [Dun95] or labelings [WC10]. An extension E of an argumentation framework AF = (Arg,→) is a set of arguments E ⊆ Arg that gives some coherent view on the argumentation underlying",
