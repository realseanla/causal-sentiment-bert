      "text" : "Sensitivity methods for the analysis of the outputs of discrete Bayesian networks have been extensively studied and implemented in different software packages. These methods usually focus on the study of sensitivity functions and on the impact of a parameter change to the Chan-Darwiche distance. Although not fully recognized, the majority of these results heavily rely on the multilinear structure of atomic probabilities in terms of the conditional probability parameters associated with this type of network. By defining a statistical model through the polynomial expression of its associated defining conditional probabilities, we develop a unifying approach to sensitivity methods applicable to a large suite of models including extensions of Bayesian networks, for instance context-specific and dynamic ones, and chain event graphs. By then focusing on models whose defining polynomial is multilinear, our algebraic approach enables us to prove that the Chan-Darwiche distance is minimized for a certain class of multi-parameter contemporaneous variations when parameters are proportionally covaried.\nKeywords: CD distance, Chain Event Graphs, Covariation, Interpolating Polynomial, Sensitivity Analysis"

      "text" : "Many discrete statistical problems in a variety of domains are nowadays often modeled using Bayesian networks (BNs) [35]. There are now thousands of practical applications of these models [1, 7, 25, 26], which have spawned many useful technical developments: for instance, a variety of fast exact, approximate and symbolic propagation algorithms for the computation of probabilities that exploit the underlying graph structure [14, 16, 17]. Some of these advances are hard-wired into software [9, 28, 32] which further favored the applicability and success of these models.\nHowever, BN modelling would not have experienced such a widespread application without tailored methodologies of model validation, i.e. for checking that a model produces outputs that are in line with current understanding, following a defensible and expected mechanism [19, 38]. Such techniques are now well established for BN models [12, 28, 38, 39]. These techniques are especially fundamental for expert elicited models, where both the probabilities and the covariance structure are defined from the suggestions of domains experts, following knowledge engineering protocols tailored to the BN’s bulding process [34, 40]. We can broadly categorize the validation process in two steps: the first concerns the auditing of the underlying graphical structure; the second, assuming the graph represents a user’s beliefs, checks the impact of the elicited probabilities within this parametric family on outputs of interest. The focus of this paper lies in this second validation phase, usually called a sensitivity analysis.\nThe most common investigation is the so-called one-way sensitivity analysis, where the impacts of changes of one probability parameter at a time are studied. Analyses where more than one parameter at a time is varied are usually referred to as multi-way. In both cases a complete sensitivity analysis entails the study of Chan-Darwiche (CD) distances [9, 10, 11] and sensitivity functions [13, 21]. The CD distance is used to quantify global changes. It measures how the overall distribution behaves when one (or more) parameter is varied. A great portion of research has focused on identifying parameter changes such that the original and the ‘varied’ BN distributions are close in CD distance [11, 41]. This is minimized when, after a single arbitrary parameter change, other covarying parameters, e.g. those from the same conditional distributions, have the same proportion of the residual probability mass as they originally\nPreprint submitted to Artificial Intelligence October 23, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n02 26\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n7 D\nec 2\n01 5\nhad. Sensitivity functions, on the other hand, model local changes with respect to an output of interest. These describe how that output probability varies as one (or potentially more) parameter is allowed to be changed. Although both these concepts can be applied to generic Bayesian analyses, they have almost exclusively been discussed and applied only within the BN literature. This is because the computations of both CD distances and sensitivity functions are particularly straightforward for BN models.\nIn this paper we introduce a unifying comprehensive framework for one-way analyses by investigating models from a polynomial point of view. Using the notion of an interpolating polynomial [36] we are able to describe a large variety of models based on their polynomial form. We demonstrate that sensitivity methods defined for BNs straightforwardly generalize to any model whose interpolating polynomial is multilinear, for example context-specific BNs [6] and chain event graphs [3, 42]. We will extensively focus on this latter class of asymmetric models which are built by merging certain vertices of a probability tree whose associated probabilities are identified. Both the BN and the context-specific BN model class can be seen as a subset of the class of CEGs, which enables users to model a large variety of asymmetric conditional independences. Methodologies to embellish CEG modeling are now in place, for instance learning algorithms [15], causal reasoning [45] and inference routines [22, 44]. However, sensitivity methods tailored to CEGs have not been introduced yet, which would become fundamental for the application of these models in real-world problems.\nBy studying sensitivity analysis from a polynomial point of view we are able to consider a much larger class of models for which such methods are not currently available. We investigate the properties of sensitivity analysis in models whose interpolating polynomial is not multilinear, which are usually associated to dynamic settings where probabilities are recursively defined. As we will show below, this difference gives us an even richer class of sensitivity functions, which are not simply linear as in the BN and multilinear one-way case. We further introduce a procedure to compute the CD distance in these models and demonstrate that no unique updating of covarying parameters lead to the smallest distance between the original and the varied distribution.\nWe then conclude the paper relating multi-way methods in multilinear models, where many parameters are contemporaneously allowed to vary, to one-way methods in models whose interpolating polynomial is non-multilinear. Multi-way methods have not been extensively discussed in the literature: see [5, 10] for some exceptions. Importantly, our approach will allow us to prove that multi-way analyses - usually called in the context of BNs single full conditional probability table (CPT) analyses - where one parameter from each CPT of one vertex of a BN given each configurations of its parents is optimal under proportional covariation in the sense that minimizes the CD distance between the original and the varied distribution. The optimality of this covariation method has been an open problem in the sensitivity analysis literature for quite some time [10]. This result gives a further incentive in investigating sensitivity methods through the polynomial definition of parametric models we introduce next."

      "text" : "In this section we first provide a generic definition of a parametric statistical model together with the notion of interpolating polynomial. We then categorize parametric models according to the form of their interpolating polynomials and show that many commonly used models fall within two classes.\n2.1. Parametric models and interpolating polynomials Let Y = (Y1, . . . , Ym) be a random vector with an associated discrete and finite sample space Y, with #Y = n. Although our methods straightforwardly applies when the entries of Y are random vectors, for ease of notation, we henceforth assume its elements are univariate.\nDefinition 1. Denote by pθ = (pθ(y) | y ∈ Y) the vector of values of a probability mass function pθ : Y → [0, 1] which depends on a choice of parameters θ ∈ Rk. The entries of pθ are called atomic probabilities and the elements y ∈ Y atoms. Definition 2. A discrete parametric statistical model on n ∈ N atoms is a subset PΨ ⊆ ∆n−1 of the n − 1 dimensional probability simplex, where Ψ : Rk → PΨ, θ 7→ pθ, (1) is a bijective map identifying a particular choice of parameters θ ∈ Rk with one vector of atomic probabilities. The map Ψ is called a parametrisation of the model.\nThe above definition is often encountered in the field of algebraic statistics, where properties of statistical models are studied using techniques from algebraic geometry and commutative computer algebra, among others [18, 37]. We next follow [23] in extending some standard terminology.\nDefinition 3. A model PΨ ⊆ ∆n−1 has a monomial parametrisation if\npθ(y) = θαy , for all y ∈ Y,\nwhere αy ∈ Nk0 denotes a vector of exponents and θαy = θ α1,y 1 · · · θ αk,y k is a monomial. Then equation (1) is a monomial map and θαy ∈ Rk[Θ], for all y ∈ Y. Here Θ = {θ1, . . . , θk} is the set of indeterminates and Rk[Θ] is the polynomial ring over the field R.\nFor models entertaining a monomial parametrisation the network polynomial we introduce in Definition 4 below concisely captures the model structure and provides a platform to answer inferential queries [17, 22].\nDefinition 4. The network polynomial of a model PΨ with monomial parametrisation Ψ is given by cPΨ (θ, λ) = ∑ y∈Y pθ(y) = ∑ α∈A λyθ α,\nwhere λy is an indicator function for the atom y and A = {αy | y ∈ Y} ⊂ Nk0.\nProbabilities of events in the underlying sigma-field can be computed from the network polynomial by setting equal to one the indicator function of atoms associated to that event. In the following it will be convenient to work with a special case of the network polynomial where all the indicator functions are set to one.\nDefinition 5. The interpolating polynomial of a model PΨ with monomial parametrisation Ψ is given by the sum of all atomic probabilities, cPΨ (θ) = ∑ α∈A θα.\n2.2. Multilinear models\nIn this work we will mostly focus on parametric models whose interpolating polynomial is multilinear.\nDefinition 6. We say that a parametric model PΨ is multilinear if its associated interpolating polynomial is multilinear, i.e. if A ⊆ {0, 1}k.\nWe note here that a great portion of well-known non-dynamic graphical models are multilinear. We explicitly show below that this is the case for BNs, context-specific BNs [6] and certain CEG models. In addition, decomposable undirected graphs [30] and probabilistic chain graphs [20] can be defined to have a monomial parametrisation whose associated interpolating polynomial is multilinear.\n2.2.1. Bayesian networks For an m ∈ N, let [m] = {1, . . . , m}. We denote with Yi, i ∈ [m], a generic discrete random variable and with Yi = {0, . . . , mi} its associated sample space. For an A ⊆ [m], we let YA = (Yi)i∈A and YA = ×i∈AYi.\nDefinition 7. A BN over a discrete random vector Y[m] consists of\n• m − 1 conditional independence statements of the form Yi ⊥ Y[i−1] |YΠi , where Πi ⊆ [i − 1];\n• a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G with vertex set V(G) = {Yi : i ∈ [m]} and edge set E(G) = {(Yi, Y j) : j ∈ [m], i ∈ Π j};\n• conditional probabilities θi jπ = Pr(Yi = j | YΠi = π) for every j ∈ Yi, π ∈ YΠi and i ∈ [m].\nFrom [10] we know that for any atom y ∈ Y[m] its associated monomial in the network polynomial can be written as\npθ(y) = ∏\ny∼{i j,π} λi jθi jπ,\nwhere ∼ denotes the compatibility relation among instantiations.\nLemma 1. From [17, 22], the interpolating polynomial of a BN model can be written as cBN(θ) = ∑\ny∈Y[m] ∏ y∼{i j,π} θi jπ. (2)\nFrom Equation (2) we can immediately deduce the following.\nProposition 1. A BN is a multilinear parametric model, whose interpolating polynomial is homogeneous with monomials of degree m.\nExample 1. Suppose a newborn is at risk of acquiring a disease and her parents are offered a screening test (Y1) which can be either positive (Y1 = 2), negative (Y1 = 2) or inconclusive (Y1 = 0). Given that the newborn either acquired (Y2 = 1) or not (Y2 = 0) the disease, her parents can then decide whether or not to give her a vaccine to prevent a relapse (Y3 = 1 and Y3 = 0, respectively). We assume that the parents’ decision about the vaccine does not depend on the screening test if the newborn contracted the disease, and that the probability of choosing vaccination is the same for inconclusive and positive screening evidence when the newborn does not acquire the disease.\nThe above situation can be described, with some loss of information, by the BN in Figure 1, with probabilities\nPr(Y1 = i) = θ1i , Pr(Y2 = j |Y1 = i) = θ2 j1i , Pr(Y3 = k |Y2 = j, Y1 = i) = θ3k2 j1i .\nIts associated network polynomial has degree 2m = 6 and equals\ncBN(θ, λ) = 2∑\ni=0 1∑ j=0 1∑ k=0 λ1iλ2 jλ3kθ1iθ2 j1iθ3k2 j1i .\n2.2.2. Context-specific Bayesian networks In practice it has been recognized that often conditional independence statements do not hold over the whole sample space of certain conditioning variables but only for a subset of this, usually referred to as a context. A variety of methods have been introduced to embellish a BN with additional independence statements that hold only over contexts. A BN equipped with such embellishments is usually called context-specific BN. Here we consider the representation known as context specific independence (CSI)-trees and introduced in [6].\nExample 2. Consider the medical problem in Example 1. Using the introduced notation, we notice that by assumption, for each k = 0, 1, the probabilities θ3k211i , θ3k211 are equal for all i = 0, 1, 2. Also θ3k2010 = θ3k2012 , θ3k201 are equal. These equations can be represented by the CSI-tree in Figure 2, where the inner nodes are random variables and the leaves are entries of the CPTs of one vertex. The tree shows that, if Y2 = 1 then no matter what the value of Y1 is, the CPT for Y3 = k will be equal to θ3k211. Furthermore, as shown in the left hand side of the tree, the probability that Y3 = k is equal when {Y2 = 0, Y1 = 0} and {Y2 = 0, Y1 = 2}. The network polynomial of the context-specific BN described by the DAG in Figure 1 and the CSI-tree in Figure 2 corresponds to the polynomial in equation (2) where the appropriate indeterminates are substituted with θ3k211 and θ3k201. This polynomial is again multilinear and homogeneous, just like for all context-specific BNs embellished with CSI-trees.\n2.2.3. Staged trees and chain event graphs We next consider models represented by trees. These are able to capture more general asymmetric conditional independence statements. Let T = (V , E), with E ⊂ V × V , be a directed rooted tree where each inner vertex v ∈ V , also called situation, has at least two children. In this graph representation, the set of root-to-leaf paths RT is in oneto-one correspondence with the sample space of an underlying model. We write r = (e | e ∈ E(r)) ∈ RT for one such path, which is a sequence of edges E(r) ⊂ E. We assume that every edge e = (v, v′) ∈ E has a primitive probability label θe ∈ (0, 1) which can be thought of as the transition probability from v to v′. These labels are assumed to obey local summing-to-unity constraints in the sense that ∑ e∈E(v) θe = 1 where E(v) ⊆ E is the set of edges emanating from v ∈ V . For a situation v, F (v) = (v, E(v)) and θv = (θe | e ∈ E(v)) are called a floret and a (floret) parameter vector, respectively. Set ΘT = {θv | v ∈ V} to be the set of parameter vectors associated to a tree. Then, the probability of an atom in the model space is given by the product of primitive probabilities along the edges of its path representation, pθ(r) = ∏ e∈E(r) θe. We call the pair (T , ΘT ) a probability tree.\nDefinition 8. We call a probability tree a staged tree if for some v, v′ ∈ V , the corresponding floret parameter vectors are identified θv = θv′ . Then, v and v′ are said to be in the same stage.\nBeing in the same stage thus implies that the associated transition probabilities of two different vertices are identified. Thus, staged trees depict information on context-specific conditional independence of the type discussed in Section 2.2.2. When drawing a tree, vertices in the same stage are equally framed in order to have a visual counterpart for that information. A second partition of the situations of a tree is as follows.\nDefinition 9. We say that two situations v and v′ are in the same position if the induced subtrees with roots v and v′ have the same graph and the same vertex framing. We let W denote the set of positions of a staged tree.\nNote that all leaves are trivially in the same stage, denoted w∞. Two situations in the same position are by definition also in the same stage, whilst it does not necessary follow that two situations in the same stage are also in the same position.\nExample 3. Consider the problem described in Example 1. The associated BN representation could be transformed into a staged tree where all the vertices are in different stages. However, if we straightforwardly build a staged tree for the situation described in the example, we can visually model all the asymmetric conditional independence constraints as shown in Figure 3. In particular in this case the stages, which are also positions, are\nw1 = {v1}, w2 = {v2}, w3 = {v3}, w4 = {v4}, w5 = {v5, v9}, w6 = {v6, v8, v10}, w7 = {v7}.\nAlthough staged trees have the capability of modeling much more complex problems than BNs, their size usually becomes unmanageable when the sample space grows moderately. However, a convenient representation of a staged tree model is via a CEG [3, 42], which is less cluttered and can more concisely describe its conditional independence statements.\nDefinition 10. A CEG C = C(T ) is the graph obtained by collapsing a staged tree T into its positions. Its vertex set, V(C), is equal to W∪{w∞}, where positions in the same stage are equally framed. Its edge set, E(C), is such that there is an edge (wi, w j), wi, w j ∈W, for every edge from a generic vertex vi ∈ wi to any vertex v j ∈ w j.\nExample 4. Figure 4 shows the CEG representation of the staged tree in Figure 3.\nJust as for staged trees, the set of root-to-leaf paths RC of a CEG is in one-to-one correspondence with the sample space of the underlying model. Note that here two different paths might go through the same sequence of positions, but not through the exactly same sequence of edges. We write r = (e | e ∈ E(r)) ∈ RC for one such path, which is a sequence of edges E(r) ∈ E(C). The CEG inherits from the associated staged trees the primitive probabilities θe ∈ (0, 1), describing the likelihood of going from position w to w′, for e = (w, w′). The probability of an atom is again simply the product of the primitive probabilities along the edges of its paths, πθ(r) = ∏ e∈E(r) θe.\nOf special interest in this context are edge-centred events Λ(e) = {r ∈ RC | e ∈ e, e ∈ E(r)}, for e ⊆ E(C) and e = (w, w′) ∈ e, which collect all atoms in the sample space which pass from position w to w′. Position-centred events Λ(w) = {r ∈ RC |w ∈ w, (·, w) ∈ E(r)}, for w ⊂ W, collect all atoms which reached a position w ∈ w. A CEG is not only very expressive for describing how certain events might unfold, but its graph can also embed formal conditional independences. For a position w ∈ V(C), let Y(w) be a variable whose state space Y(w) can be identified with the set of w → w∞ subpaths. Let Z(w) be a variable whose state space Z(w) can be identified with the set of w1 → w subpaths, w1 being the root of the CEG. Then, from [46], we have that\nY(w) ⊥ Z(w) | Λ(w),\nwhich can be read as ‘variables defined downstream of w are independent of variables defined upstream, given the event Λ(w)’.\nJust as for BNs, we can easily express the form of the interpolating polynomial of a CEG model as follows:\nLemma 2. The interpolating polynomial of a CEG can be written as cC(θ) = ∑ r∈RC πθ(r) = ∑ r∈RC ∏ e∈E(r) θe.\nIn [22] we introduced the CEG network polynomial and showed that its derivatives can be used to answer various inferential queries. We extensively discussed there the advantages of the symbolic representation of CEGs over the one of BNs: for instance, the network polynomial of the CEG has most often less terms and terms of lower degree than the one of the associated BN representation. For a more extensive comparison of the two polynomial forms see [22].\nExample 5. Letting θi j denote the primitive probability associated to j-th emanating edge from position wi as shown in Figure 4, the interpolating polynomial of the CEG in Figure 4 equals, by Lemma 2,\ncC(θ) = θ11θ21θ51 + θ11θ21θ52 + θ11θ22θ61 + θ11θ22θ62 + θ12θ41θ51 + θ12θ41θ52+ θ12θ42θ61 + θ12θ42θ52 + θ13θ31θ61 + θ13θ31θ62 + θ13θ32θ71 + θ13θ32θ72. (3)\nAlthough many CEGs have an associated multilinear polynomial, as the one in Example 5, this does not necessarily need to be the case. The notion of stages gives enough flexibility to build models with non-multilinear interpolating polynomials. This happens whenever two positions in the same stage are along the same path.\nDefinition 11. A CEG with multilinear interpolating polynomial is said to be square-free [23].\n2.3. Non-multilinear models Having discussed multilinear models, we now introduce more general structures which are often encountered in dynamic settings. Although many more models have this property, for instance dynamic chain graphs [2] and dynamic chain event graphs [4], for the purposes of this paper we focus here on two important model classes: dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) [33] and non-square-free CEGs.\n2.3.1. Dynamic Bayesian networks DBNs extend the BN framework to dynamic and stochastic domains. As often in practice, we consider only stationary, feed-forward DBNs respecting the first order Markov assumption with a finite horizon T ∈ N, see e.g. [27]. This assumes that probabilities do not vary when shifted on time (stationarity), that current states only depend on the previous time point (first-order Markov assumption) and that contemporaneous variable cannot directly affect each other (feed-forward). These DBNs can be simply described by an initial distribution over the first time point and a BN having as vertex set two generic time slices. Such latter BN is usually called 2-Time slice Bayesian Network (2-TBN). Let {Y(t)}t∈[T ] = {Yi(t) : i ∈ [m]}t∈[T ] be a time series. Definition 12. A 2-TBN for {Y(t)}t∈[T ] is a BN with DAG G such that V(G) = {Yi(t), Yi(t + 1) : i ∈ [m]}, any vertex Yi(t) has no parents and there are no edges (Yi(r), Y j(r)), i, j ∈ [m], r = t, t + 1, t ∈ [T − 1].\nDefinition 13. A DBN for the time series {Y(t)}t∈[T ] is a pair (G,G′), such that G is a BN with vertex set V(G) = {Yi(1) : i ∈ [m]}, and G′ is a 2-TBN such that its vertex set V(G′) is equal to {Yi(t), Yi(t + 1) : i ∈ [m]}.\nExample 6. Consider the problem of Example 1 and suppose the newborn can acquire the disease once a year. Suppose further that the screening test and the vaccine are available for kids up to three years old. This scenario can be modeled by a DBN with time horizon T = 3, where Yi(t), i, t ∈ [3], corresponds to the variable Yi of Example 1 measured in the t-th year. Suppose that the probabilities of parents choosing the screening test and vaccination depend on whether or not the newborn acquired the disease in the previous year only. Furthermore, there is evidence that kids have a higher chance of contracting the disease if they were sick the previous year, whilst a lower chance if vaccination was chosen. This situation can be described by the DBN in Figure 5 where at time t = 1 the correlation structure of the non-dynamic problem is assumed.\nFor a finite time horizon T = 3, the sample space has 33 · 26 atoms and therefore the interpolating polynomial has 972 monomials each of degree 9. To show that this polynomial is not multilinear, consider the event that every year parents choose to both screen and vaccinate the newborn and that she got sick in her first year of life, denoted as yT = (Y1(t) = 2, Y2(1) = 1, Y3(t) = 1, t ∈ [3]). Let the parameters for the first time slice be denoted as in Example 1 and denote for t = 2, 3\nθ̂1i2 j = Pr(Y1(t) = i | Y2(t − 1) = j), i = 0, 1, 2, j = 0, 1, θ̂2i2 j3k = Pr(Y2(t) = i | Y2(t − 1) = j, Y3(t − 1) = k), i, j, k = 0, 1, θ̂3i2 j = Pr(Y3(t) = i | Y2(t − 1) = j), i, j = 0, 1.\nThe interpolating polynomial for this event equals cDBN(θ, yT ) = θ312111θ2111θ11 ( θ̂13122 θ̂ 2 1121 (θ̂ 2 212131 + θ̂202131 θ̂212131 ) + θ̂3120 θ̂3121 θ̂1121 θ̂1120 θ̂202131 (θ̂202031 + θ̂212031 ) ) ,\nwhich has indeterminates of degree 2 and therefore is not multilinear.\nNote that in the example above indeterminates can have degree up to to T −1, since this corresponds to the longest length of a path where the visited vertices can have probabilities that are identified in the ‘unrolled’ version of the DBN, i.e. one where the 2-TBN graph for time t is recursively collated to the one of time t − 1. From this observation the following follows.\nProposition 2. A DBN is a parametric model with monomial parametrisation, whose interpolating polynomial is homogeneous and each indeterminate can have degree lower or equal to T − 1.\n2.3.2. Non square-free chain event graphs As noticed in Section 2.2.3, the stage structure of a tree allows for enough flexibility to depict models whose interpolating polynomial is not multilinear, as shown by the following example.\nExample 7. Consider again the situation in Example 1 and suppose now that the parents have the possibility of repeating the screening test up to three times in the first year of life of the newborn if all the previous results are inconclusive. We also assume that the probabilities of acquiring the disease for positive/negative screening results are the same after any screening attempt. For simplicity, we now drop the vaccination decision. The above problem can be depicted by the CEG in Figure 6, where up to three positions in the same stage can be along the same path. Its interpolating polynomial equals\nθ312(θ51 + θ52) + (θ 2 12 + θ12)(θ11θ41 + θ11θ42 + θ13θ61 + θ13θ62) + θ11(θ41 + θ42) + θ13(θ61 + θ62). (4)\nThe interpolating polynomial in equation (4) is not only non-multilinear, but also non-homogeneous, i.e. its monomials do not have all the same degree. This is a typical feature of tree models [22]."

      "heading" : "3. Sensitivity analysis in multilinear models",
      "text" : "We can now formalize sensitivity analysis techniques for multilinear parametric models. We focus mainly on one-way sensitivity methods. Although some preliminary work on multi-way analyses is now available [5, 10], the computational cost of such investigations have limited their use in practice. However, in Section 6 we present some novel results for this type of analyses. We now demonstrate that all the results about one-way sensitivity analysis in BN models straightforwardly extend to multilinear parametric models and therefore hold under much weaker assumptions about the structure of both the sample space and the underlying conditional independences.\n3.1. Covariation In one-way analyses one parameter within a parametrisation of a model is varied. When this is done, then some of the remaining parameters need to be varied as well to respect the sum-to-one condition, so that the resulting measure is a probability measure. In the binary case this is straightforward, since the second parameter will be equal to one minus the other. But in generic discrete finite cases there are various considerations the user needs to take into account, as reviewed below.\nLet θi ∈ Θ be the parameter varied to θ̃i and suppose this is associated to a random variable YC in the random vector Y. Let ΘC = {θ1, . . . , θi, . . . , θr} ⊆ Θ be the subset of the parameter set including θi describing the probability distribution of YC and whose elements need to respect the sum to one condition. For instance ΘC would include the entries of a CPT for a fixed combination of the parent variables in a BN model or the floret parameters in a CEG. Suppose further these parameters are indexed according to their values, i.e. θ1 ≤ · · · ≤ θi ≤ · · · ≤ θr. From [41] we then have the following definition.\nDefinition 14. Let θi ∈ ΘC be varied to θ̃i. A covariation scheme σ(θ j, θ̃i) : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1] is a function that takes as input the value of both θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC and returns an updated value for θ j denoted as θ̃ j.\nDifferent covariation schemes may entertain different properties which, depending on the domain of application, might be more or less desirable. We now list some of these properties from [41].\nDefinition 15. In the notation of Definition 14, we say that a covariation scheme σ(θ j, θ̃i) is • valid, if ∑ j∈[r] σ(θ j, θ̃i) = 1; • impossibility preserving, if for any parameter θ j = 0, j , i, we have that σ(θ j, θ̃i) = 0;\n• order preserving, if σ(θ1, θ̃i) ≤ · · · ≤ σ(θ j, θ̃i) ≤ · · · ≤ σ(θr, θ̃i);\n• identity preserving, if σ(θ j, θi) = θ j, ∀ j ∈ [r];\n• linear, if σ(θ j, θ̃i) = γ jθ̃i + δ j, for γ j ∈ [0, 1] and δ j ∈ (−1, 1). Of course any covariation scheme needs to be valid, otherwise the resulting measure is not a probability measure and any inference from the model would be misleading. Applying a linear scheme is very natural: if for instance γ j = δ j, then σ(θ j, θ̃i) = γ j(1 − θ̃i) and the scheme assigns a proportion γ j of the remaining probability mass 1 − θ̃i to the remaining parameters. Following [41] we now introduce a number of frequently applied covariation schemes.\nDefinition 16. In the notation of Definition 14, we define\n• the proportional covariation scheme, σpro(θ j, θ̃i), as σpro(θ j, θ̃i) =  θ̃i, if j = i,1−θ̃i\n1−θi θ j, otherwise.\n• the uniform covariation scheme, σuni(θ j, θ̃i), for r = #ΘC , as σuni(θ j, θ̃i) = { θ̃i, if j = i, 1−θ̃i r−1 , otherwise.\n• the order preserving covariation scheme, σord(θ j, θ̃i), for i , r, as\nσord(θ j, θ̃i) =  θ̃i, if j = i, θ j θi θ̃i, if j < i and θ̃i ≤ θi, −θ j(1−θsuc) θsucθi θ̃i + θ j θsuc , if j > i and θ̃i ≤ θi, θ j\nθmax−θi (θmax − θ̃i), if j < i and θ̃i > θi, θ j−θmax θmax−θi (θmax − θ̃i) + θmax, if j > i and θ̃i > θi,\nwhere θmax = 1/(1 + r − i) is the upper bound for θ̃i and θsuc = ∑r\nk=i+1 θk is the original mass of the parameters succeeding θi in the ordering.\nTable 1 summarizes which of the properties introduced in Definition 15 the above schemes entertain (see [41] for more details). Under proportional covariation, to all the covarying parameters is assigned the same proportion of the remaining probability mass as these originally had. Although this scheme is not order preserving, it maintains the order among the covarying parameters. The uniform scheme on the other hand gives the same amount of the remaining mass to all covarying parameters. In addition, although the order preserving scheme is the only one that entertains the order preserving property, this limits the possible variations allowed. Furthermore, in this scheme the last and biggest parameter θr cannot be varied: however this is not a very limiting constraint since we can always write one parameter as one minus the sum of the others. Note that this scheme is not only simply linear, but more precisely piece-wise linear, i.e. a function composed of straight-line sections.\nAll the schemes in Definition 16 are domain independent and therefore can be applied with no prior knowledge about the application of interest. Other schemes, for instance domain dependent or non-linear, have been defined, but these are not of interest for the theory we develop here.\n3.2. Sensitivity functions Sensitivity functions describe the effect of varying one parameter on the probability of an event YT ⊆ Y of interest. A sensitivity function fyT (θ̃i) equals the probability Pr(Y ∈ YT ) , pθ(yT ) and is a function in θ̃i, where θi is varied to θ̃i. Our parametric definition of a statistical model enables us to explicitly express these as functions of the covariation scheme for any multilinear model. Recall that A = {αy | y ∈ Y} and let T = {αy | y ∈ YT }. Let AC ,TC ⊂ {0, 1}k be the subsets of A and T respectively including the exponents where the entry associated to an indeterminate in ΘC is not zero, AC j ⊆ AC and TC j ⊆ TC the subsets including the exponents such that the entry relative to θ j is not zero. Formally\nAC = {αy | y ∈ Y,αy, j , 0, j ∈ [r]}, TC = {αy | y ∈ YT ,αy, j , 0, j ∈ [r]}, AC j = {αy | y ∈ Y,αy, j , 0}, TC j = {αy | y ∈ YT ,αy, j , 0}.\nLet AC− j ,TC− j ⊆ {0, 1}k−1 be the sets including the elements in AC j and TC j , respectively, where the entry relative to θ j ∈ ΘC is deleted. Lastly, let θ− j = ∏ θl∈Θ\\{θ j} θl.\nTheorem 1. Let PΨ be a multilinear parametric model, where the parameter θi ∈ ΘC is varied to θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi} is covaried according to a valid scheme σ(θ j, θ̃i), j ∈ [r] \\ {i}. The sensitivity function fyT (θ̃i) can be written as\nfyT (θ̃i) = ∑ α∈TC−i θα−iθ̃i + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jσ(θ j, θ̃i) + ∑ α∈T\\TC θα. (5)\nProof. pθ(yT ) = ∑ α∈T θα = ∑ α∈TC θα + ∑ α∈T\\TC θα = ∑ j∈[r] ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jθ j + ∑ α∈T\\TC θα = ∑ α∈TC−i θα−iθi + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jθ j + ∑ α∈T\\TC θα.\nNoting that fyT (θ̃i) = pθ(yT ) and substituting θi with θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi} with σ(θ j, θ̃i), the result easily follows.\nFrom Theorem 1 we can deduce that for a multilinear model, under a linear covariation scheme, the sensitivity function is linear.\nCorollary 1. Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the sensitivity function, fyT (θ̃i) under a linear covariation scheme σ(θ j, θ̃i) = γ jθ̃i + δ j equals\nfyT (θ̃i) = αθ̃i + β, (6)\nwhere α = ∑ α∈TC−i θα−i + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jγ j, β = ∑ α∈T\\TC θα + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jδ j. (7)\nProof. The result follows by substituting the definition of a linear covariation scheme into equation (5) and then rearranging.\nTherefore, under a linear covariation scheme, the sensitivity function is a linear function of the varying parameter θ̃i. This was long known for BN models [8, 21, 41]. However, we have proven here that this feature is shared amongst all models having a multilinear interpolating polynomial. In BNs the computation of the coefficients α and β is particularly fast since for these models computationally efficient propagation techniques have been established. But these exist, sometimes less efficiently, for other models as well (see e.g. [44] for CEGs and staged trees). Within our symbolic definition, we note however that once the exponent sets TC− j , j ∈ [r], are identified, then one can simply plug-in the values of the indeterminates to compute these coefficients.\nExample 8. Consider a generic BN with m vertices and recall that the sample space of one random variable is Yi = {0, . . . , mi}, i ∈ [m]. Suppose θikπ, the k-th entry of the distribution associated to a vertex Yi given configuration π of its parents, k ≤ mi, is varied to θ̃ikπ and σ(θi jπ, θ̃ikπ) = γi j θ̃ikπ + δi j is the covariation scheme for the parameters in the same CPT, j ≤ mi . Then the sensitivity function of an event (YT = yT ), yT ∈ YT , T ⊆ [m], has been shown in [41] to be equal to\nfyT (θ̃ikπ) = αik + ∑ j∈Yi\\{k} αi jγi j  θ̃ikπ + β + ∑ j∈Yi\\{k} αi jδi j  , (8) where αi j = Pr(YT = yT |Yi = j, YΠi = π), j ∈ {0, . . . , mi}, and β = Pr(YT = yT , YΠi , π). Thus equation (8) is a special case of the sensitivity function of a multilinear model of Theorem 1.\nWe now deduce the sensitivity function when parameters are varied using the popular proportional scheme.\nCorollary 2. Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the sensitivity function, fyT (θ̃i) under a proportional covariation scheme σpro(θ j, θ̃i) = 1−θ̃i1−θi θ j can be written in the linear form of equation (6), where\nα = ∑ α∈TC−i θα−i − ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC j θα 1 − θi , β = ∑ α∈T\\TC θα + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC j θα 1 − θi .\nProof. For a proportional scheme the coefficients in the definition of a linear scheme equals γ j = −θ j/(1 − θi) and δ j = θ j/(1 − θi). By substituting these expressions into equation (7) we have that\nα = ∑ α∈TC−i θα−i − ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− j θ j 1 − θi , β = ∑ α∈T\\TC θα + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− j θ j 1 − θi .\nPlugging in these coefficients in equation (6) then\nfyT (θ̃i) =  ∑ α∈TC−i θα−i − ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jθ j 1 − θi  θ̃i +  ∑ α∈T\\TC θα + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC− j θα− jθ j 1 − θi  =\n ∑ α∈TC−i θα−i − ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC j θα 1 − θi  θ̃i +  ∑ α∈T\\TC θα + ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} ∑ α∈TC j θα 1 − θi  . It is often of interest to investigate the posterior probability of a target event (Y ∈ YT ) given that an event (Y ∈ YO) has been observed, YT ,YO ⊆ Y. This can be represented by the posterior sensitivity function f yOyT (θ̃i) describing the probability Pr(Y ∈ YT |Y ∈ YO) as a function of a varying parameter θ̃i.\nCorollary 3. Under the conditions of Corollary 1, a posterior sensitivity function f yOyT (θ̃i) can be written as the ratio\nf yOyT (θ̃i) = α1θ̃i + β1\nα2θ̃i + β2 , (9)\nwhere α1,α2 ∈ [0, 1] and β1, β2 ∈ (−1, 1).\nProof. The result follows from equation (6) and by noting that Pr(Y ∈ YT |Y ∈ YO) = Pr(Y ∈ {YT ∩ YO})/Pr(Y ∈ YO).\nThe form of the coefficients in Corollary 3 can be deduced by simply adapting the notation of equation (5) to the events Pr(Y ∈ {YT ∩ YO}) and Pr(Y ∈ YO) for the numerator and the denominator, respectively, of equation (9). Sensitivity functions describing posterior probabilities in BNs have been proven to entertain the form in equation (9). Again, Corollary 3 shows that this is so for any model having a multilinear interpolating polynomial.\n3.3. The Chan-Darwiche distance Whilst sensitivity functions study local changes, CD distances describe global changes in distributions [11]. These can be used to study by how much two vectors of atomic probabilities vary in their distributional assumptions if one arises from the other via a covariation scheme. We are then interested in the global impact of that local change. We start by defining the distance.\nDefinition 17. Let pθ, pθ̃ ∈ PΨ two vectors of values of two probability mass functions from the same parametric model PΨ. The CD distance between pθ and pθ̃, CD(pθ, pθ̃), is defined as\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln maxy∈Y pθ̃(y) pθ(y) − ln min y∈Y pθ̃(y) pθ(y) , (10)\nwhere 0/0 is defined as 1.\nAlthough this has not been recognized in the literature yet, we note that the CD distance coincides with the DeRobertis distance, used in robustness studies in Bayesian inference [24, 43]. This has the very convenient property for Bayesian inference of being invariant to Bayesian evidential updating: the distance between two distributions a priori and after both have been updated using some data points does not change. It has also been noted that in sensitivity analysis in BNs, if one parameter of one CPT is varied, then distance between the original and the varied BN equals the distance between the original and the varied CPT [11, 43]. We demonstrate now that this property is more generally entertained by any multilinear model.\nFor a pθ ∈ PΨ, let pCθ = (pCθ (y) | y ∈ YC), where YC is the sample space of YC , and pCθ (y) = θ αy C , for any y ∈ YC , with θC = ∏\nθ j∈ΘC θ j and αy ∈ Nr with |αy| = 1, i.e. the sum of its elements is equal to one. The vector pCθ is therefore the probability mass function of the parametric model whose atomic probabilities are the elements of ΘC .\nTheorem 2. Let pθ, pθ̃ ∈ PΨ, where PΨ is a multilinear parametric model and pθ̃ arises from pθ by varying θi to θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi} to θ̃ j = σ(θ j, θ̃i), where σ(θ j, θ̃i) is a valid covariation scheme, j ∈ [r] \\ {i}. Then the CD distance between pθ and pθ̃ is equal to\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = CD(p C θ , p C θ̃ ) = ln max j∈[r]\nθ̃ j θ j − ln min j∈[r] θ̃ j θ j .\nProof. For a multilinear parametric model the CD distance can be written as\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max α∈A\nθ̃α θα − ln min α∈A θ̃α θα = ln max { max α∈AC θ̃α θα , max α∈A\\AC θ̃α θα } − ln min { min α∈AC θ̃α θα , min α∈A\\AC θ̃α θα } .\nIf α ∈ A \\ AC , then θ̃ = θ and thus θ̃α/θα = 1. Because of the validity of the covariation scheme note that maxα∈AC θ̃ α/θα ≥ 1 and minα∈AC θ̃α/θα ≤ 1. Thus\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max α∈AC\nθ̃α θα − ln min α∈AC θ̃α θα .\nNow note that θ̃ = θ− jθ̃ j, for a θ j ∈ ΘC , and thus θ̃α/θα = θ̃ j/θ j since α ∈ {0, 1}k. Since there is at least one α ∈ AC such that α j , 0, j ∈ [r], then maxα∈AC θ̃α/θα = max j∈[r] θ̃ j/θ j and minα∈AC θ̃α/θα = min j∈[r] θ̃ j/θ j. Consequently CD(pθ, pθ̃) = CD(pCθ , p C θ̃ ).\nExample 9. Suppose the parameter θikπ associated to the vertex Yi of a BN model for a fixed configuration π of the parents is varied to θ̃ikπ. Then, in [11] it is shown that the distance can be written as\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max k∈Yi\nθ̃ikπ θikπ − ln min k∈Yi θ̃ikπ θikπ .\nThis is simply an instance of Theorem 2, since the distance depends only on the parameters of one CPT of one vertex for a specific configuration of the parents.\nJust as [41] we can also express the distance as an explicit function of the covariation scheme. This will be very useful for deducing closed-form expressions for the CD distances under specific covariation schemes.\nCorollary 4. Under the conditions of Theorem 2, we can write CD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max { θ̃i θi , max j∈[r]\\{i} σ(θ j, θ̃i) θ j } − ln min { θ̃i θi , min j∈[r]\\{i} σ(θ j, θ̃i) θ j } .\nProof. This follows by substituting θ̃ j with the covariation scheme in equation (10) to the covaried parameters.\nA key result in sensitivity analysis for BNs shows that the CD distance is minimized when parameters are varied according to a proportional scheme [11]. This is important since a parameter might be varied to change an uncalibrated probability of interest, but a user might want to achieve this by choosing a distribution as close as possible to the original one. This has given a strong theoretical justification to the large use of such a scheme. It is straightforward to show that for generic multilinear models this is also true.\nCorollary 5. Under the conditions of Theorem 2, the CD distance is minimized by a proportional covariation scheme and can be written in closed form as\nCDpro(pθ, pθ̃) = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ln θ̃iθi − ln 1 − θ̃i1 − θi ∣∣∣∣∣∣ . Proof. The optimality result follows by noting that the parameters in ΘC define a discrete probability measure, which can be thought of as a CPT of one vertex of a BN given a configuration of the parent variables. Therefore, since the distance is minimized for BNs it is also the case for multilinear models. More formally let θ̄i = θ̃i and θ̄ j, j ∈ [r] \\ {i}, be values obtained via a valid covariation scheme σ(θ j, θ̄i). We want to prove that CD(pθ, pθ̄) ≥ CD(pθ, pθ̃), where pθ̃ is the mass function for a proportional covariation.\nFirst note that if either θi = 0 or θi = 1 then the distance is infinite under both covariation schemes and the result holds. Consider now θi ∈ (0, 1) and suppose θ̄i = θ̃i > θi. Under a proportional scheme, we have that\nmax j∈[r]\nθ̃ j θ j = θ̃i θi and min j∈[r] θ̃ j θ j = θ j(1 − θ̃i) (θ j(1 − θi)) = (1 − θ̃i) (1 − θi) .\nConversely, for the generic covariation scheme σ(θ j, θ̄i) we have that\n1 − θ̄i 1 − θi\n= ∑\nj∈[r]\\{i}\nθ̄ j θ j = ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} θ j(θ̄ j/θ j) θ j ≥ ∑ j∈[r]\\{i} θ j(mink∈[r] θ̄k/θk) θ j = min k∈[r] θ̄k θk .\nThus since (1 − θ̄i)/(1 − θi) = (1 − θ̃i)/(1 − θi) we have that min j∈[r] θ̃i/θi ≥ min j∈[r] θ̄i/θi. Furthermore,\nmax j∈[r] θ̄i θi ≥ θ̄i θi = θ̃i θi = max j∈[r] θ̃ j θ j .\nIt then follows that CD(pθ, pθ̄) ≥ CD(pθ, pθ̃) when θ̃i > θi. For the case θ̃i < θi the proof mirrors the one presented here. The explicit form of the distance under the proportional scheme follows by noting that the maximum and the minimum can either be θ̃i/θi or (1 − θ̃i)/(1 − θi).\nGiven the explicit expression of the CD distance in terms of the covariation scheme in Corollary 4, it is then possible to write in closed form the distance for the covariation schemes in Definition 16. As an example, for a σ(θ j, θ̃i) = γ j(1 − θ̃ j) we have that\nCD(pθ, p̃θ) = ln max  θ̃iθi , 1 − θ̃i(r − 1) min j∈[r]\\{i} γ−1j θ j  − ln min  θ̃iθi , 1 − θ̃i(r − 1) max j∈[r]\\{i} γ−1j θ j  .\nFor other covariation schemes, closed form formulas can be simply deduced by adapting the notation of [41].\n3.4. Kullback-Leibler divergence Although the CD distance is widely used in sensitivity analyses, comparisons between two distributions are usually performed by computing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence [29].\nDefinition 18. Let pθ, pθ̃ ∈ PΨ two vectors of values of two probability mass functions from the same parametric model PΨ. The KL distance between pθ and pθ̃, KL(pθ, pθ̃), is defined as\nKL(pθ, pθ̃) = − ∑ y∈Y pθ(y) ln ( pθ̃(y) pθ(y) ) . (11)\nRecall that KL is not formally a distance, since it is not symmetric [11]. The following proposition formalizes the form of the KL divergence for multilinear parametric models when one parameter is varied.\nProposition 3. The KL divergence between pθ and pθ̃ for a multilinear parametric model PΨ when the parameter θi is varied to θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi} is covaried according to a valid covariation scheme to θ̃ j, j ∈ [r] \\ {i}, equals\nKL(pθ, pθ̃) = KL(p C θ , p C θ̃ ) ∑ j∈[r] ∑ α∈AC− j θα− j.\nProof. For a multilinear parametric model the KL distance can be written as\nKL(pθ, pθ̃) = − ∑ α∈A θα ln ( θ̃α θα ) = − ∑ α∈AC θα ln ( θ̃α θα ) − ∑ α∈A\\AC θα ln ( θ̃α θα ) Since θ̃α = θα if α ∈ A \\ AC , then ln(θ̃α/θα) = 0. Therefore\nKL(pθ, pθ̃) = − ∑ α∈AC θα ln ( θ̃α θα ) = − ∑ j∈[r] ∑ α∈AC− j θα− jθ j ln ( θ̃ j θ j ) = − ∑ j∈[r] θ j ln ( θ̃ j θ j ) ∑ α∈AC− j θα− j,\nand the result follows from Definition 18 of the KL distance.\nTherefore the KL divergence does not necessarily respect the local separability property of CD distances not only for BN models [11], but also for any multilinear model. This means that one way sensitivity analyses based on KL distances can become computationally infeasible, since the constant term in equation (11) might need to be computed an arbitrary number of times. This observation has lead to a widespread use of CD distances in sensitivity analysis.\nExample 10. Suppose the parameter θikπ associated to the vertex Yi of a BN model for a fixed configuration π of the parents is varied to θ̃ikπ. The KL divergence between the two mass functions can be shown to be equal to\nKL(pθ, pθ̃) = pθ(π)KL(p iπ θ , p iπ θ̃ ),\nwhere piπθ and p iπ θ̃ are, respectively, the original and the varied probability mass function of the CPT including θikπ.\nWhen using KL divergences in sensitivity analyses great care needs to be taken. For instance, [11] showed that two distributions might have KL divergence equal to zero whilst quantities of interest for inferential queries, e.g. odds ratios, can be arbitrarly close to some constant k.\nθ11 = 0.3 θ12 = 0.2 θ21 = 0.4 θ32 = 0.6 θ41 = 0.1 θ51 = 0.6 θ61 = 0.9 θ71 = 0.3\nTable 2: Specification of the probabilities of the CEG in Figure 4."

      "heading" : "4. Sensitivity analysis in square-free CEGs",
      "text" : "The previous section has formalized sensitivity methods in multilinear parametric models and shown that these generalize the results for BN models. As an illustration of these techniques to a different multilinear model we now consider the class of CEGs. Whilst in multilinear models the sum-to-one condition needs to be respected in the sets ΘC and in BNs this needs to hold for CPTs, in CEG models (conditional) probability distributions are associated to its florets: probabilities associated to edges emanating from the same position must sum to one. So when varying one parameter from one floret, not only the parameters associated to emanating edges from the same position needs to covary, but also those of edges from positions in the same stage. Formally, for an edge ei ∈ E(C), let ei be the set of edges whose primitive probabilities are identified with θei and wei the set of positions w such that for every e ∈ ei, e = (w, ·). Suppose each element of wei has si emanating edges labeled e j, j ∈ [si], and let w̄ei be the complement of wei in W.\n4.1. Sensitivity functions for square-free CEGs\nSuppose we are interested in the probability of an event A associated to a set of root-to-leaf paths RA as a function of θ̃ei , the varied version of θei .\nCorollary 6. For a square-free CEG, the sensitivity function fA(θ̃ei ) when θei is varied and the parameters θe j in the same floret F (wei , ·) are covaried according to a valid scheme σ(θe j , θ̃ei ) is\nfA(θ̃ei ) = αθ̃ei + ∑\nj∈[si]\\{i} β jσ(θe j , θ̃ei ) + , (12)\nwhere α = Pr(A | Λ(ei)) Pr(Λ(wei )), β j = Pr(A | Λ(e j)) Pr(Λ(we j )), = Pr(A, Λ(w̄ei )). (13)\nProof. By the law of total probability recall that Pr(A) = Pr(A, Λ(wei )) + Pr(A, Λ(w̄ei )). For the second term, using again the law of total probability together with the chain rule for probabilities, we can deduce that\nPr(A, Λ(w̄ei ))= ∑\nj∈[si]\\{i} Pr(A|Λ(e j), Λ(we j )) Pr(Λ(e j)|Λ(we j )) Pr(Λ(we j )) + Pr(A|Λ(ei), Λ(wei )) Pr(Λ(ei)|Λ(wei )) Pr(Λ(wei )).\nUsing the conditional independence statements implied by the CEG and applying σ(θe j , θei ) we then have\nfA(θ̃ei ) = Pr(A, Λ(w̄ei )) + ∑\nj∈[si]\\{i} Pr(A |Λ(e j)) Pr(Λ(we j ))σ(θe j , θ̃ei ) + Pr(A |Λ(ei)) Pr(Λ(wei ))θ̃ei .\nThe coefficients in equation (13) can be efficiently computed either through propagation techniques [44] or by differentiation of the network polynomial [22]. These probabilities can also be visually deduced from the underlying graph of the CEG since its root-to-leaf paths coincide with the model’s sample space. We illustrate the intuitiveness of these operations in CEGs with the following example.\nExample 11. Suppose the definition of the CEG in Figure 4 is completed with the probability specifications in Table 2. Suppose we are interested in the event that the newborn is healthy as a function of an inconclusive screening test. This event is described by the root-to-leaf paths going through an edge labeled ‘healthy’ and the sets ei and wei include one element only: (w1, w2) and w1 respectively. Furthermore the floret associated to w1 has two other emanating edges (w1, w3) and (w1, w4) whose associated probabilities need to covary.\nTo compute the sensitivity function we need to derive the probabilities in the coefficients in equation (13). Note that = 0 since there are no paths not going through w1, the root of the CEG. This also implies Pr(Λ(wei )) = 1. Lastly, the probabilities Pr(A | Λ(e j)), j ∈ [si], correspond to θkl, k = 2, 3, 4, l = 1, 2, the probability that the newborn is healthy once position wk is reached. Thus\nfA(θ̃12) = θ21θ̃11 + θ41σ(θ12, θ̃11) + θ32σ(θ13, θ̃11).\nThe form of the sensitivity function under different covariation schemes is shown in Figure 7. We can notice that the choice of this scheme has a significant impact on the probability of interest. Whilst the sensitivity function is increasing for a proportional scheme, it is decreasing for the uniform one. Under an order preserving scheme the behavior of the sensitivity function is decreasing in (0, 0.3), the original value of the varied parameter, and then increasing in (0.3, 0.5), where 0.5 is the maximum value θ11 can take for the scheme to be valid. All these functions, because square-free CEGs are multilinear models, are (piece-wise) linear as specified by Theorem 1.\nWhen the covariation scheme is linear then also the sensitivity function of a square-free CEG is linear, as specified in Corollary 1.\nCorollary 7. Under the conditions of Corollary 6, suppose σ(θe j , θ̃ei ) = γ jθ̃ei + δ j, for j ∈ [si] \\ {i}. Then\nfA(x) = α + ∑ j∈[si]\\{i} β jγ j  θ̃ei +  ∑ j∈[si]\\{i} β jδ j +  , where α, β j and are defined in equation (13).\nProof. This follows by substituting the definition of a linear covariation scheme into equation (12).\nInterestingly, for non-squared CEGs the posterior sensitivity function conditional on events of the form Λ(w), indicating that a certain position has been reached, is not rational but again a simple linear function. This is because this conditional probability can be computed from the induced subgraph of the CEG having as root the position w. This subgraph is again a CEG. Since probabilities over this subgraph are multilinear, then sensitivity functions will be linear.\nExample 12. Suppose we are interested in the probability that the newborn is healthy knowing that the screening test result was inconclusive. This probability can be computed from the subgraph of the CEG in Figure 4 having as root w2 and edges along paths between w2 and w∞. This probability is then simply θ21.\n4.2. CD distance for square-free CEGs\nGiven the derivation of the CD distance for multilinear models, it is straightforward to deduce its explicit form for CEGs, where one parameter θei is varied and the floret parameters θe j are covaried with a valid scheme, j ∈ [si] \\ {i}.\nCorollary 8. The CD distance for a square-free CEG when θei is varied to θ̃ei and θe j is covaried to θ̃e j , j ∈ [si] \\ {i}, according to a valid covariation scheme is given by the distance between the versions of the two floret distributions as\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = CD(p wei θ , p wei θ̃\n) = ln max j∈[si]\nθ̃e j θe j − ln min j∈[si] θ̃e j θe j , (14)\nwhere pweiθ and p wei θ̃\nare, respectively, the original and the varied probability mass function of the parametric model defined over the floret with position wei .\nProof. This follows by noting that the set ΘC of Theorem 2 coincides with the set of parameters associated to edges emanating from position wei .\nHaving deduced the generic form of the CD distance for a square-free CEG, we can now explicitly show its dependence on the covariation scheme.\nCorollary 9. Under the conditions of Theorem 8,\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max  θ̃eiθei , maxj∈[si]\\{i} σ(θe j , θ̃ei )θe j  − ln min  θ̃eiθei , minj∈[si]\\{i} σ(θe j , θ̃ei )θe j  .\nProof. This follows by plugging-in the definition of a covariation scheme into equation (14).\nThe CD distance under specific covariation schemes for CEGs can be deduced by adapting the notation of [41] to the one of CEGs. An illustration of the computation of the CD distance in CEG models can be found in Section 5.2 below."

      "text" : "For multilinear models we have been able to provide a unifying framework to perform various sensitivity analyses by deducing closed forms for both sensitivity functions and the CD distance. Unfortunately, this is not possible for non-multilinear parametric models because these will depend on the degree of both the indeterminate to be varied and the covaried parameters, which is not necessarily equal to one. However, representing the model through its interpolating polynomial will enable us to study central properties of both sensitivity functions and CD distances. As in Section 3, we let θi ∈ ΘC be varied to θ̃i, where ΘC = {θ j : j ∈ [r]} is the set of parameters including θi which need to respect the sum-to-one condition.\n5.1. Sensitivity functions\nAs in Section 3 we let fyT denote a sensitivity function and f yO yT a posterior sensitivity function.\nProposition 4. Consider a parametric model PΨ with monomial parametrisation Ψ. Let θi vary to θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC \\{θi} covary according to a linear scheme. The sensitivity function fyT (θ̃i) is then a polynomial with degree lower or equal to d, where d = maxα∈TC , j∈[r]{α j}. The posterior sensitivity function f yO yT (θ̃i) is a rational function whose numerator and denominator are be polynomials again with degree lower or equal to d.\nProof. This follows by noting that under the conditions of the proposition an exponent αi,y in Definition 3 of monomial parametrisation, for any αy ∈ A cannot be larger than d.\nFor CEGs the form of the sensitivity function depends on the underlying graph. This is because each atomic probability in a CEG is associated to a root-to-leaf path and the probability of that atom is equal to the product of the probabilities associated to edges along that path.\nθ13 = 0.5 θ12 = 0.3 θ11 = 0.2 θ41 = 0.1 θ51 = 0.4 θ61 = 0.6\nTable 3: Probability specification for the CEG in Figure 6.\nCorollary 10. For a CEG having at most d positions in the same stage along the same path, the sensitivity function fyT (θ̃i) is a polynomial with degree lower or equal to d when parameters are covaried according to a valid linear covariation scheme.\nProof. This follows directly from Proposition 4 since if there are d positions in the same stage along the same path, then the interpolating polynomial has at least one indeterminate in one monomial with exponent d.\nThe specific form of the sensitivity function in non-multilinear models depends both on the form of the interpolating polynomial, on the parameter to be varied and on the parameters that are consequently covaried. Therefore it is not possible to deduce a unique closed form expression since this will explicitly depend on the degree of all the above indeterminates. However, the interpolating polynomial enables us to identify a straightforward procedure to compute fyT (θ̃i) as follows:\n1. determine the polynomial cPΨ (θ, yT ) for an event YT ; 2. replace θi by θ̃i; 3. replace θ j by σ(θ j, θ̃i) for θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi}.\nExample 13. Consider the non-square-free CEG in Figure 6 and suppose we are interested in the event A that the newborn is healthy. This probability equals\ncC(θ, A) = θ312θ51 + θ 2 12θ11θ41 + θ12θ11θ41 + θ 2 12θ13θ61 + θ12θ13θ16 + θ11θ41 + θ13θ61,\nsince each of these monomials is associated to a root-to-leaf path going through an edge labeled ‘healthy’. Suppose we are interested in the effect the probability θ12 of having an inconclusive screening test has on the likelihood of the individual being healthy. By substituting the varied parameters in the polynomial above we deduce the sensitivity function fA(θ̃12) as\nθ51θ̃ 3 12 + (σ(θ11, θ̃12)θ41 + σ(θ13, θ̃12)θ61)θ̃ 2 12 + (σ(θ11, θ̃12)θ41 + σ(θ13, θ̃12)θ61)θ̃12 + (σ(θ11, θ̃12)θ41 + σ(θ13, θ̃12)θ61).\nThe sensitivity functions for different covariation schemes are reported in Figure 8 when parameters are assigned the numeric specifications in Table 3. These functions, for each covariation scheme behave similarly to the ones of the associated multilinear problem depicted in Figure 7. The main difference is that, as formalized by Proposition 4, these functions are not linear, but polynomial. Whilst between 0 and 0.4 the probability of a healthy newborn is almost constant under uniform and proportional schemes, this then varies in a non-linear fashion between 0.4 and 1. Again, the order preserving scheme seems to have a critical behavior. In particular for values close to 0.5 the probability of a healthy newborn is much higher than in the associated multilinear problem in Figure 7. Thus, in non-multilinear models, just as in multilinear ones, the choice of the covariation scheme can have a huge impact both on the size and on the characteristics of an output probability of interest.\n5.2. CD distance We next introduce a general procedure to compute the CD distance for parametric models with monomial parametrisation.\nProposition 5. Let pθ, pθ̃ ∈ PΨ, where PΨ is a parametric model with monomial parametrisation. The CD distance between pθ and pθ̃ when θi is varied to θ̃i and θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi} is covaried to θ̃ j = σ(θ j, θ̃i), j ∈ [r] \\ {i}, according to a valid covariation scheme can be computed from the interpolating polynomial as follows:\n1. set θα = 0 for all α ∈ A \\ AC; 2. set θk = 1, if k < [r], in any monomial θα, α ∈ AC;\n3. call Φ the set of remaining monomials, φα a generic element of Φ and φ̃α its varied version; 4. set u = maxΦ φ̃α/φα and l = minΦ φ̃α/φα; 5. compute CD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln(u) − ln(l).\nIt then follows that CD(pθ, pθ̃) = CD(pφ, pφ̃), where pφ and pφ̃ denote respectively the original and the varied probability mass function of the parametric model whose atomic probabilities are the elements of Φ.\nProof. In a multilinear parametric model each atom is associated to a monomial θα. For all α ∈ A \\ AC , we have that\npθ̃(y) pθ(y) = θ̃α θα = 1,\nand there will always be ratios smaller or bigger than one because of the validity of the covariation scheme. Therefore, these monomials have no impact on the distance (step 1). For α ∈ AC , we have that\nθ̃α θα = θ̃αCC θαCC , φ̃α φα ,\nwhere θC = ∏\nj∈[r] θ j and αC ∈ Nr0 is the associated exponent vector. Therefore the distance depends only on the monomials computed in steps 2 and 3. The result then follows from the definition of the CD distance.\nExample 14. We illustrate the procedure for computing the CD distance between the original CEG in Figure 6 and the one after the change of θ12 to θ̃12 under a valid covariation scheme. Since all paths go through position w1, i.e. every monomial has an indeterminate from its floret distribution which includes θ12, the first step of the procedure retains all monomials associated to this CEG. At the second step the algorithm sets equal to one the indeterminates θ ji, i = 1, 2 and j = 4, 5, 6, from these monomials. The resulting set Φ is\nΦ = { θ312, θ 2 12θ11, θ 2 12θ13, θ12θ11, θ12θ13, θ11, θ13 } The algorithm selects the maximum ratio and the minimum ratio between any of these monomials and then use these in the standard formula of the CD distance. In Figure 8 we plot the CD distance as a function of θ12 under different covariation schemes. This shows that the distance is the smallest for the proportional covariation scheme. It is wellknown that this is the case for one-way sensitivity analyses in BNs and in Corollary 5 we showed that this is the case for any multilinear model. Unfortunately, this result does not hold for non-multilinear models as shown by the following example.\nExample 15. Consider two random variables Y1 and Y2 and suppose Y1 = Y2 = [3]. Suppose also\nθ1i = Pr(Y1 = i) = Pr(Y2 = i |Y1 = j), i ∈ [3], j ∈ [2].\nSuppose we let θ11 vary and θ12 and θ13 covary according to a valid scheme. The set Φ of Proposition 5 is then equal {θ211, θ11θ12, θ13, θ212, θ11θ13, θ12θ13}. Suppose θ11 = 0.33, θ12 = 0.33, θ13 = 0.34 and let θ11 be varied to 0.4. In this situation the CD distance under a proportional scheme is 2.52, whilst under a uniform scheme the distance equals 2.50. For this parameter variation, the uniform scheme would then be preferred to a proportional one if a user wishes to minimize the CD distance. Conversely, if θ11 is set to 0.2 the distance is smaller under the proportional scheme (2.89) than under the uniform one (2.92).\nTherefore, whilst for multilinear models the choice of updating probabilities with a proportional covariation scheme can be justified in terms of some ‘optimality criterion’ based on the minimization of the CD distance, for nonmultilinear models the choice of the covariation scheme becomes critical. Our examples demonstrated that inference can be greatly affected by the chosen covariation scheme and with no theoretical justification to use one over another when using a model that is not multilinear, any model output can be debatable without a convincing rationale for the choice of the covariation scheme.\nWe next deduce a closed form expression for the CD distance under the proportional covariation scheme.\nProposition 6. Under the condition of Proposition 5 and assuming a proportional covariation scheme the CD distance is\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max α∈A−C ( 1 − θ̃i 1 − θi )|α−i | θ̃iαi θi αi − ln min α∈A−C ( 1 − θ̃i 1 − θi )|α−i | θ̃iαi θi αi , (15)\nwhere A−C ∈ Nr0 is the set including the exponents in AC where the entries relative to indeterminates not in ΘC are deleted, α−i ∈ Nr−10 is an exponent where the entry relative to θi is deleted and |α−i| is the sum of its entries. Proof. From Proposition 5 we can write the CD distance as\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max α∈A−C\nφ̃α φα − ln min α∈A−C φ̃α φα .\nRecall that under a proportional scheme an indeterminate θ j ∈ ΘC \\ {θi} is varied to θ̃ j = θ j(1 − θ̃i)/(1 − θi). We then have that, for any φ ∈ Φ,\nφ̃α = θ̃αii ∏ j∈[r]\\{i} ( 1 − θ̃i 1 − θi θ j )α j = ( 1 − θ̃i 1 − θi )|α−i | θα−i−i θ̃ αi i ,\nand therefore φ̃α\nφα = θ̃αii θαii ( 1 − θ̃i 1 − θi )|α−i | .\nThen, since CD(pθ, pθ̃) = CD(pφ, pφ̃) by Proposition 5, we deduce the closed form in equation (15) by substituting the above expression into the definition of CD distance.\nExample 16. Consider again the monomial set Φ of Example 14 and assume the parameters θ11 and θ13 are covaried according to a proportional scheme. From Proposition 6 we can deduce that the CD distance will then depend on the maximum and minimum value in the set of ratios\nΦ =  θ̃312θ312 , θ̃212 θ212 ( 1 − θ̃12 1 − θ12 ) , θ̃12 θ12 ( 1 − θ̃12 1 − θ12 ) , ( 1 − θ̃12 1 − θ12 ) ."

      "heading" : "6. Multi-way sensitivity analysis in multilinear models",
      "text" : "So far we have concentrated on one-way sensitivity analysis only, the most commonly performed in practice. We now consider multi-way sensitivity methods where more than one parameter is varied contemporaneously. We first focus on a specific type of analysis, usually referred to as fully single CPT analysis. In this type of method one parameter from each probability table given a configuration of parents, θi jπ, is varied in a BN model. So, for instance, if a vertex has n possible configurations of parent variables, then these n parameters are varied.\n6.1. Full single conditional probability table analysis We now generalize the full single CPT methods from BNs to general multilinear models. This type of analysis is simpler than other multi-way methods since the parameters varied/covaried never appear in the same monomial of the BN interpolating polynomial. So we now find an analogous to this CPT analysis in multilinear models which has the same property. Suppose we vary n parameters θ1i , . . . , θni and denote by Θ j = {θ j1 , . . . , θ jr j }, j ∈ [n], the set of parameters including θ ji and associated to the same (conditional) random variable. Assume these sets are such that ∩ j∈[n]Θ j = ∅. Note that a collection of such sets can not only be associated to CPTs of one vertex given different parent configurations, but also, for instance, to positions along the same cut in a CEG [46].\nRecall that T ⊆ A is the exponent set associated to the event described by YT . Let now T j ⊆ {0, 1}k be the subset of T including the exponents where the entry associated to an indeterminate in Θ j is not zero. Let T− j,k ⊆ {0, 1}k−1 be the set including the elements of T j where the entry relative to θ jk is deleted. Lastly, let θ− j,k = ∏ θl∈Θ\\{θ jk } θl.\nProposition 7. Consider a multilinear model PΨ where the parameters θ ji ∈ Θ j are varied to θ̃ ji and θ jk ∈ Θ j \\ {θ ji } is covaried according to a valid scheme σ j(θ jk , θ̃ ji ), j ∈ [n], k ∈ [r j] \\ { ji}. The sensitivity function fyT (θ1i , . . . , θni ) can then be written as\nfyT (θ1i , . . . , θni ) = ∑ j∈[n] ∑ α∈T− j,i θα− j,iθ̃ ji + ∑ j∈[n] ∑ k∈[r j]\\{ ji} ∑ α∈T− j,k θα− j,kσ j(θ jk , θ̃ ji ) + ∑ α∈T\\∪l∈[n]Tl θα.\nProof. The probability of interest can be written as pθ(yT ) = ∑ α∈T θα = ∑ j∈[n] ∑ k∈[r j] ∑ α∈T− j,k θα− j,kθ jk + ∑ α∈T\\∪l∈[n]Tl θα = ∑ j∈[n] ∑ α∈T− j,i θα− j,iθ ji + ∑ j∈[n] ∑ k∈[r j]\\{ ji} ∑ α∈T− j,k θα− j,kθ jk + ∑ α∈T\\∪l∈[n]Tl θα.\nThe result follows by substituting the varying parameters with their varied version.\nProposition 7 specifies that the sensitivity function in full single CPT analyses is still a linear function, though in this case of n indeterminates. Given this observation, the results of Section 3.2 can be generalized straightforwardly to full single CPT analyses by simply adapting the notation and summing over the index j of the spaces Θ j.\nWe next characterize the form of the CD distance for multilinear models in full table CPT analyses, first generalizing its form, again derived in [41] for BN models. Importantly, we then prove that the proportional covariation scheme is optimal for this type of analysis. Several authors have posed this problem without finding a definitive answer [10, 41]. Here, exploiting our polynomial model representation, we can prove the optimality of the proportional scheme not only for BN models, but also for multilinear ones.\nTheorem 3. Consider a multilinear model PΨ. Suppose θ ji is varied to θ̃ ji and that θ jk ∈ Θ j \\ {θ jk } is covaried to θ̃ jk according to a valid covariation scheme, j ∈ [n], k ∈ [r j] \\ { ji}. The CD distance between pθ and pθ̃ is then minimized under a proportional variation scheme and can written in closed form as\nCDpro(pθ, pθ̃) = ln maxj∈[n] { θ̃ ji θ ji , 1 − θ̃ ji 1 − θ ji } − ln min j∈[n] { θ̃ ji θ ji , 1 − θ̃ ji 1 − θ ji } . (16)\nProof. Let now A j be the subset of A including the exponents where the entry associated to an indeterminate in Θ j is not zero. As in the proof of Theorem 2, we can deduce that only monomials whose exponent is in A j, j ∈ [n], have an impact on the distance. Since no two parameters in ∪ j∈[n]Θ j can have exponent non-zero in the same monomial, we can deduce\nCD(pθ, pθ̃) = ln max j∈[n],k∈[r j] θ̃ jk θ jk − ln min j∈[n],k∈[r j] θ̃ jk θ jk\n= ln max {\nmax k∈[r1] θ̃1k θ1k , . . . , max k∈[rn] θ̃nk θnk\n} − ln min { min k∈[r1] θ̃1k θ1k , . . . , min k∈[rn] θ̃nk θnk } .\n(17) Now, as in the proof of Corollary 5, let θ̄ ji = θ̃ ji and suppose θ̄ jk ∈ Θ j \\ {θ ji } is obtained via a valid covariation scheme, j ∈ [n], k ∈ [r j]. Since, by Corollary 5, the proportional scheme is optimal for one-way sensitivity analyses we must have that, for all j ∈ [n],\nmax k∈[r j] θ̄ jk θ jk ≥ max k∈[r j] θ̃ jk θ jk , and min k∈[r j] θ̄ jk θ jk ≤ min k∈[r j] θ̃ jk θ jk .\nTherefore,\nmax {\nmax k∈[r1] θ̄1k θ1k , . . . , max k∈[rn] θ̄nk θnk\n} ≥ max { max k∈[r1] θ̃1k θ1k , . . . , max k∈[rn] θ̃nk θnk } ,\nand\nmin {\nmin k∈[r1] θ̄1k θ1k , . . . , min k∈[rn] θ̄nk θnk\n} ≤ min { min k∈[r1] θ̃1k θ1k , . . . , min k∈[rn] θ̃nk θnk } ,\nfrom which the optimality condition follows. The explicit form of the distance under a proportional covariation schemes in equation (16) follows by replacing θ ji and θ jk with θ̃ ji and θ jk (1 − θ̃ ji )/(1 − θ ji ), respectively, in equation (17), for j ∈ [n], k ∈ [r j] \\ { ji} .\n6.2. Multi-way analysis Our polynomial approach, as shown in the previous section, has proven useful in investigating the full single CPT case. We now discuss how more general multi-way sensitivity analysis methods for multilinear methods can be described within our framework.\nExample 17. Consider the vaccination example described by the CEG in Figure 4 and suppose we are now interested in the probability of vaccination as a function of both the probability of an inconclusive test θ11 and the probability of the newborn being healthy given an inconclusive test θ21. From the interpolating polynomial of this CEG give in equation (3) we can deduce that\nfyT (θ̃11, θ̃21) = αθ̃11θ̃21 + βθ̃11 + γσ(θ12, θ̃11) + δσ(θ13, θ̃11), (18)\nwhere α, β, γ, δ ∈ [0, 1]. Thus, in this case the sensitivity function is not a simple linear function, but has an interaction term αθ̃11θ̃21. The interpolating polynomial however gives a simple tool to identify the form of the sensitivity function in multilinear models. We plot these functions in Figure 9 under the proportional and the uniform scheme. Both exhibit an almost linear behaviour and are increasing in both indeterminates. These graphs can be used in more refined sensitivity analyses to investigate the effects of contemporaneous parameter changes.\nNote that the indeterminates in equation (18) coincide with those monomials φ of Proposition 5 that have an impact on the CD distance. Therefore we can interpret the computation of the CD distance for multilinear models, including BNs, for multi-way analyses as the computation of the distance in one-way analyses for non-multilinear models. Example 15 would therefore suggest that the proportional covariation scheme is not optimal in this context. However, we notice that the monomials from multi-way analyses in multilinear models are a subset of those arising from non-multilinear models: although these can be of an arbitrary degree, each indeterminate of the monomial will have exponent one by construction. Therefore, there is no conclusive proof of the non-optimality of the proportional scheme in multi-way analyses for multilinear models and BNs."

      "heading" : "7. Discussion",
      "text" : "The definition of a parametric model through its interpolating polynomial has proven useful to investigate how changes in the input probabilities affect an output of interest. We have been able to demonstrate that standard results for BN models are valid for a large number of other models, for instance context-specific BNs and square-free CEGs. Then, the flexibility of the interpolating polynomial representation enabled us to investigate an even larger class of models, for instance DBNs and non square-free CEGs, extending sensitivity methods to dynamic settings. In this framework both sensitivity functions and CD distances exhibit different properties than in the simpler multilinear case, with the potential of even more informative sensitivity investigations. We then proved the optimality of the proportional covariation scheme in full conditional CPT analyses not only for BNs but also multilinear models.\nIn this paper we have focused on discrete probabilistic models, but the notion of an interpolating polynomial can be generalized to both continuous and decision-analytic domains. In particular, this could be defined over the polynomial ring whose indeterminates are some of the (conditional) moments of the random variables, the ones that are formally required to compute an expected utility function. Variation of the value of the moments could be implemented to study the robustness of decision making in continuous domains, defining generalizations of the methods in [31].\nLastly, as customary in this type of sensitivity analyses, our approach assumes that the models’ probabilities are known. However, both in machine learned and expert elicited models this will not be the case and uncertainty measures associated to these probabilities are often available. We are starting to investigate methods that take into account the uncertainty about the probability parameters and that explore the effects of treating these numbers as known."

These methods usually focus on the study of sensitivity functions and on the impact of a parameter change to the Chan-Darwiche distance. Although not fully recognized, the majority of these results heavily rely on the multilinear structure of atomic probabilities in terms of the conditional probability parameters associated with this type of network. By defining a statistical model through the polynomial expression of its associated defining conditional probabilities, we develop a unifying approach to sensitivity methods applicable to a large suite of models including extensions of Bayesian networks, for instance context-specific and dynamic ones, and chain event graphs. By then focusing on models whose defining polynomial is multilinear, our algebraic approach enables us to prove that the Chan-Darwiche distance is minimized for a certain class of multi-parameter contemporaneous variations when parameters are proportionally covaried.",
