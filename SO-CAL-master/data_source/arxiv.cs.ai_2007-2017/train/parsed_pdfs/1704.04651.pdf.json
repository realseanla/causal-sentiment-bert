      "text" : "Model free deep reinforcement learning has achieved remarkable success lately in many domains ranging from achieving human and super-human level control in video games (Mnih et al., 2016), (Mnih et al., 2015) to continuous motor control tasks (Lillicrap et al., 2015). However, two of the most popular frameworks, DQN (Mnih et al., 2015) and A3C (Mnih et al., 2016), have several disadvantages: DQN suffers from potentially slow learning caused by single-step temporal difference updates, while A3C has a relatively low data-efficiency (since it does not use a memory buffer) and requires being trained on several copies of the same environment simultaneously. Also A3C is an on-policy algorithm which does not separate the evaluation policy from the behaviour policy, making it difficult to explore safely. Data-efficiency and off-policy learning are arguably impor-\n1DeepMind, London, UK.\ntant for many real-world problems where interactions with the environment is expensive. For this reason we wanted to exploit the off-policy advantage of DQN while also getting the benefits of using multi-step returns and an explicit policy evaluation of A3C framework.\nIn this work we introduce a new agent architecture, called Reactor (for Retrace-actor), which has the following features. The Reactor uses an off-policy multi-step learning algorithm based on an actor-critic architecture. The critic implements the Retrace (Munos et al., 2016) algorithm, while the actor is trained by a new policy gradient algorithm, called β-leave-one-out, which makes use of both the off-policy Retrace-corrected return and the estimated Q-function.\nThe Reactor is sample-efficient thanks to the use of memory replay, and numericaly efficient since it uses multi-step returns which improves the speed of reward propagation backwards in time, while the off-policy nature of the algorithm enables to reuse old data and be sample efficient.\nThe reason we use an actor-critic architecture is to explicitly evaluate behavioural policies which may differ from policies derived from learned Q-values (such as epsilongreedy policies). This can be beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, a policy may be easier to learn than action values or action advantages. A second advantage is that estimating an explicit behavioural policy may reduce the problem of Q-value over-estimation when bootstrapping in the presence of noise, as the best action and the actual action value are evaluated by different functional approximations. Similar reasoning led to the introduction of Double DQN algorithm (Van Hasselt et al., 2016). The third advantage is that evaluating non-deterministic policies can potentially lead to less trace cutting while using Retrace algorithm. For this reason it is beneficial to be stochastic when actions are of equal value and the easiest way to do this is to have an explicit actor which is trained with some entropy reward.\nA main difference compared to DQN is that in order to implement the multi-step Retrace algorithm, we need to replay sequences of (instead of individual) transitions. Since we do so, using a recurrent network architecture comes at no cost. Actually, using a recurrent network architecture avoids complications related to frame-stacking and gives computational gains, as each frame has to be processed by\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n04 65\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 5\nA pr\n2 01\n7\na convolutional network only once in each sequence. While using a recurrent network architecture may not be required in Atari, it may become useful in more complex partially observable domains. And even in Atari domain, recent work (Harb & Precup) showed that using LSTM (combined with Watkins Q(λ) algorithm) can improve learning compared to feed-forward networks.\nLastly, we decoupled acting from learning by allowing the actor and the learner to run in parallel. This does not block the actor during batched learning and does not block the learner while the actor is acting which in turn allows to achieve greater CPU utilization.\nRelated works: Like A3C (Mnih et al., 2016), Reactor is an actor-critic multi-step returns algorithm. Reactor differs from A3C in that it uses a memory buffer and an offpolicy learning algorithm. Compared to DQN, Reactor brings the multi-step returns and the actor-critic architecture. DDPG (Lillicrap et al., 2015) uses an actor-critic architecture but in a continuous control setting making use of the deterministic policy gradient algorithm and does not consider multi-step returns. UNREAL agent (Jaderberg et al., 2016) improved final performance and data efficiency of A3C framework by introducing replay memory and unsupervised auxiliary tasks.\nThe closest work to ours is the ACER algorithm (Wang et al., 2017) which is also an actor-critic based on the Retrace algorithm which makes use of memory replay. The main differences are (1) Reactor use a different policy gradient algorithm for the actor (see discussion in Section 2.2), (2) ACER mixes on-policy (from current run) and offpolicy (from memory) updates whereas Reactor uses offpolicy updates replayed from the memory exclusively, (3) Reactor makes use of an estimated µ̂ behaviour policy instead of storing µ in memory, and (4) Reactor uses an actor and learner that can run in parallel independently from each other."

We first define some notation. We consider a Markov decision process with state space X and finite action space A. A (stochastic) policy is a mapping from X to distributions over actions. We consider a γ-discounted infinite-horizon criterion and define for any policy π, the Q-value of any state-action pair (x, a) as\nQπ(x, a) def = E [∑ t≥0 γtr(xt, at)|x0 = x, a0 = a, π ] ,\nwhere ({xt}t≥0) is a trajectory generated by choosing a in x and following π thereafter, i.e., at ∼ π(·|xt) (for t ≥ 1), and r(xt, at) is a reward function. Our goal is to find an optimal policy π∗, which maximizes Qπ(x, a). Q∗(x, a) = maxπ Q\nπ(x, a) represents the optimal Qvalues.

(2)\nThe Retrace algorithm comes with the theoretical guarantee that in finite state and action spaces, repeatedly updating our current estimate Q according to (1) produces a sequence which converges to Qπ for a fixed π or to Q∗ if we consider a sequence of policies π which become increasing greedy w.r.t. the Q estimates, see (Munos et al., 2016)."

      "heading" : "2.2. The actor: β-LOO policy gradient algorithm",
      "text" : "The Reactor architecture represents both a policy π(a|x) and Q-values Q(x, a). We use a policy gradient algorithm to train the actor π which makes use of our current estimate Q(x, a) of Qπ(x, a). Let V π(x0) be the value function at some initial state x0, the policy gradient theorem (Sutton et al., 2000) says that ∇V π(x0) = E [∑ t γ t ∑ aQ π(xt, a)∇π(a|xt) ] , where ∇ refers to the gradient w.r.t. policy parameters. We now consider several possible ways to estimate this gradient.\nTo simplify notation, we drop the dependence on the state x for now and consider the problem of estimating the quantity\nG = ∑ a Qπ(a)∇π(a). (3)\nSince we consider the off-policy case, consider estimating G using a single action A drawn from a (possibly different from π) behaviour distribution A ∼ µ. Let us assume that\nfor the chosen actionAwe have access to an estimateR(A) of Qπ(A). Then we can use likelihood ratio (LR) method combined with an importance sampling (IS) ratio (which we call ISLR) to build an unbiased estimate of G:\nĜISLR = π(A)\nµ(A) (R(A)− V )∇ log π(A),\nwhere V is a baseline that depend on the state but not on the chosen action. However this estimate suffers from high variance. A possible way for reducing variance is to estimate G directly from (3) by using the return R(A) for the chosen action A and our current estimate Q of Qπ for the other actions, which lead to the so-called leave-one-out (LOO) policy gradient estimate:\nĜLOO = R(A)∇π(A) + ∑ a6=A Q(a)∇π(a). (4)\nThis estimate has low variance but may be biased if the estimated Q values differ from Qπ . A better bias-variance tradeoff may be obtained by considering the more general β-LOO policy gradient estimate:\nĜβ-LOO = β(R(A)−Q(A))∇π(A) + ∑ a Q(a)∇π(a),\n(5) where β = β(µ, π,A) can be a function of both policies π and µ and the selected action A. Notice that when β = 1, (5) reduces to (4), and when β = 1/µ(A), then (5) is\nĜ 1 µ\n-LOO = π(A)\nµ(A) (R(A)−Q(A))∇ log π(A)+ ∑ a Q(a)∇π(a).\n(6) This estimate is unbiased and can be seen as a generalization of ĜISLR where instead of using a state-only dependent baseline, we use a state-and-action-dependent baseline (our current estimate Q) and add the correction term∑ a∇π(a)Q(a) to cancel the bias. We now analyze the bias of the Gβ-LOO estimate.\nProposition 1. Assume A ∼ µ and that E[R(A)] = Qπ(A). Then, the bias of Gβ-LOO is ∣∣∑ a(1 −\nµ(a)β(a))∇π(a)[Q(a)−Qπ(a)] ∣∣.\nProof. We have that E[Ĝ]β-LOO is\n= ∑ a µ(a)[β(a)(E[R(a)]︸ ︷︷ ︸ =Qπ(a) −Q(a))]∇π(a) + ∑ a Q(a)∇π(a)\n= G+ ∑ a (1− µ(a)β(a))[Q(a)−Qπ(a)]∇π(a)\nThus the bias is small when β(a) is close to 1/µ(a) (and unbiased for Ĝ 1\nµ -LOO whatever theQ estimates are) or when\nthe Q-estimates are close to the true Qπ values. Now its variance is low when β is small. So in order to have a good bias-variance tradeoff we recommend using the β-LOO estimate with β defined as: β(A) = min ( c, 1µ(A) ) , for some constant c ≥ 1. Note that β(A) = 1 when c = 1.\nThis truncated 1/µ coefficient shares similarities with the truncated IS gradient estimate introduced in (Wang et al., 2017) (which we call TISLR for truncated-ISLR):\nĜTISLR = min ( c, π(A)\nµ(A)\n) (R(A)− V )∇ log π(A)\n+ ∑ a (π(a) µ(a) − c ) + µ(a)(Qπ(a)− V )∇ log π(a).\nThe differences are: (i) we truncate 1/µ(A) = π(A)/µ(A) × 1/π(A) instead of truncating π(A)/µ(A), which provides an additional variance reduction due to the variance of the LR ∇ log π(A) = ∇π(A)π(A) (since this LR may be large when a low probability action is chosen), and (ii) we use ourQ-baseline instead of a V baseline, reducing further the variance of the LR estimate.\nIn our experiments we compare the different policy gradient estimates ĜISLR, ĜTISLR, and Ĝβ-LOO for β = 1, β = 1/µ, β = min(5, 1/µ).\nRemark: In off-policy learning it is very difficult to produce an unbiased sample R(A) of Qπ(A) when following another policy µ. This would require using full importance sampling correction along the trajectory. Instead, in our implementation we use the off-policy corrected return computed by the Retrace algorithm, which produces a (biased) estimate ofQπ(A) but whose bias vanishes asymptotically, see (Munos et al., 2016)."

As described in Section 2.1, the Retrace algorithm makes use of two policies, the behaviour and target policies. In Reactor, the behaviour policy µ corresponds to the actions {as}s≤t that have been generate by the agent in the past and have been stored in the memory buffer. The target policy corresponds to the current policy πt of the agent, which is the one we wish to evaluate."

      "text" : "The agent’s behaviour is defined by sampling actions from the current policy πt and stores observed states, actions, re-\nwards and selected action probabilities (xt, at, rt, µt) into the replay memory. Retrace uses an off-policy correction which requires the knowledge of the probability under which actions have been generated (i.e. the trace cutting coefficient cs in (2) depends on µ(as|xs)). We can either use stored in the memory the behaviour probabilities µ(as|xs) of the chosen actions or we can construct and estimate µ̂ based on past samples by training to predict previously taken actions P (as|xs). The replay memory contains a mixture of trajectories generated by the sequence of policies π1, π2, ..., πt during the learning process. To see the difference between µ and µ̂, consider that from a state x, actions 1 and 2 have been chosen in a deterministic way with same proportion. Thus the replay memory contains equal amounts of samples for both actions (in that state). From the off-policy batched learning perspective, from that state, the empirical distribution of actions is similar to that of a stochastic policy which would have chosen both actions with equal probabilities of 1/2. Thus the memorized probabilities µ(as|x) are either 1 or 0, whereas a learnt µ̂(as|x) will predict 1/2. It can be beneficial to use µ̂ since the trace cutting coefficients ct would be higher leading to less cutting and faster reward propagation by Retrace algorithm. This might make off-policy corrected returns less biased but at the cost of a higher variance. On the other hand if behavioural probability estimates are inaccurate, Retrace algorithm may produce biased returns.\nIn the experimental section we report experiments for both approaches. Learnt estimate µ̂ may improve performance compared to using the true action probabilities in some circumstances, which is an interesting finding since those probabilities may not always be available (such as when learning from offline log data). Note that some theoretical findings (Li et al., 2015) support that using a regression estimate may indeed improve importance sampling."

      "heading" : "3.3. Network architecture",
      "text" : "The Reactor architecture uses a recurrent neural network architecture which takes an observation xt as input and produces three outputs: current action-value estimates Q(xt, a), current policy π(a|xt) and estimated behavioural policy µ̂(a|xt), for all actions a (Figure 1).\nAction-values use a duelling architecture (Wang et al., 2015) which internally splits Q-value into state-value and advantage estimation, which in turn is connected to an LSTM recurrent network (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). Policy and behaviour policy heads use last softmax layer mixed with a fixed uniform distribution of choosing a random action where this mixing ratio is a hyperparameter. Each policy network µ̂ and π have their own separate LSTM, as this was found to work much better than sharing the same LSTM with action-value head Q.\nAll three LSTMs in turn are connected to a shared linear layer which is connected to a shared convolutional neural network (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).\nGradients coming from both policy LSTMs are blocked and only gradients originating from Q value LSTM is allowed to back-propagate to the convolutional neural network. We block gradients from π head for increasing stability, as this avoids positive feedback loops between π and Q caused by shared representations. Gradients originating from the µ̂ LSTM are also blocked in order to make experiments with memorized µ and estimated µ̂ values more comparable.\nConcatenated rectified linear units are used as nonlinearities in the network (Shang et al., 2016). We did this for two reasons. Firstly, as was shown by (Shang et al., 2016), convolutional neural networks with rectified linear units tend to lead to pairs of opposite features. Using concatenated rectified linear units allows to reduce the size of the filters by half, saving computation. Secondly, neural networks with rectified linear units tend to age, when a given unit gets pushed below zero by a wild gradient and being clamped at zero there is no gradient to ever pull it back up again. Using concatenated rectified linear units helps to solve this problem as if a neuron gets pushed below zero, a value pops up again on the negative side. It is up to the next linearity to learn not to use a value if it is not necessary.\nFinally, although we have chosen a recurrent (LSTM) network, a feed-forward implementation is still possible. However in some problems (such as in the Atari domain) it is often useful to base our decisions on a short history of past observations. We chose a recurrent network architecture instead of frame stacking for the reasons of implementation simplicity and computational efficiency. As Re-\ntrace algorithm requires evaluating Q-values over contiguous sequences of trajectories, using a recurrent architecture allowed each frame to be processed by the convolutional network only once, as opposed to several times if several frame concatenations were used.\nPrecise network specification is given in Table 1. The value of is the minimum probability of choosing a random action and it is hard-coded into the policy network."

In order to avoid converging too quickly to deterministic policies we add a scaled entropy reward to the policy gradient. In order to make entropy reward scale to be more uniform across games with different reward amplitudes and frequencies, during each learning step we evaluated a mean action-gap over a batch of sampled sequences and used it to scale entropy. We defined a mean action-gap as a mean difference between the best action value and a (uniformly) randomly chosen other action. We used 0.1 as a scaling constant for entropy reward.

A notable exception is TISLR algorithm, where estimated behavioural probabilities gave better scores over most training steps and most parameter configurations. Still, a difference in performance was not so huge, as at 200 million steps learning behavioural probabilities had roughly 1/3 chance of giving better results than memorizing values for both beta-LOO algorithms and gave similar performance in the case of TSILR (Figure 5).

We evaluated mean episode rewards for each atari game and human normalized scores. We calculated mean and median human normalized scores across all games. In addition to that, we ranked all algorithms (including random and human scores) for each game and evaluated mean rank of each algorithm across all 57 Atari games. We believe that this is a better metric to compare algorithms across different games with vastly different rewards scales because it is less sensitive to the errors introduced when measuring human play, which otherwise is present in the denominator when calculating human normalized scores. We also evaluated an Elo scores for each algorithm, where algorithm A is considered to win over al-\ngorithm B if it collects more score on a given Atari game when using 30 random human starts.

The algorithms that we compare Reactor to are: DQN (Mnih et al., 2015), Double DQN (Van Hasselt et al., 2016), DQN with prioritized experience replay (Schaul et al., 2015), duelling architecture and prioritized duelling architecture (Wang et al., 2015). Each algorithm was exposed to 200 million frames of experience and the\nsame pre-processing pipeline including 4 action repeats was used as in the original DQN paper (Mnih et al., 2015). We tested the version of Reactor which memorized past behaviour probabilities and used β = 1. Reactor was able to improve over prioritized duelling agent in terms of median human normalized scores, mean rank and Elo, but was slightly worse in terms of mean human normalized scores.\nTable 3 contains a comparison of our algorithm with ACER algorithm (Wang et al., 2017). In the case of Reactor, the table was produced in the following way. While the agent was training on each game, scores were averaged over 200 windows of length 1 million. The maximum value was taken from each curve and it was human-normalized. A median value was evaluated for each algorithm across all games. The best value for ACER was obtained from Figure 1 in (Wang et al., 2017) by reading off the highest learning curve below 200 million steps. As it is seen from the results two versions of Reactor improved over the ACER algorithm in terms of median human normalized scores. On the other hand our evaluation was somewhat more pessimistic than the one used by (Wang et al., 2017), because we averaged rewards over windows of 1 million steps, while in the case of ACER the rewards were averaged over windows of 200 thousand frames. Averaging over longer windows leads to less variance, which in turn introduces less optimistic bias encountered during the maximization process. We were not able to evaluate Rank and Elo scores for ACER because we did not have per-game evaluations. One interesting finding was that our implementation of TISLR algorithm with learnt probabilities achieved better results than the ones reported in the ACER paper when using learn behavioural probabilities."

The agent uses a deep recurrent neural network for function approximation. The network outputs a target policy π (the actor), an action-value Q-function (the critic) evaluating the current policy π, and an estimated behavioural policy μ̂ which we use for off-policy correction. The agent maintains a memory buffer filled with past experiences. The critic is trained by the multi-step off-policy Retrace algorithm and the actor is trained by a novel β-leave-oneout policy gradient estimate (which uses both the off-policy corrected return and the estimated Qfunction). The Reactor is sample-efficient thanks to the use of memory replay, and numerical efficient since it uses multi-step returns. Also both acting and learning can be parallelized. We evaluated our algorithm on 57 Atari 2600 games and demonstrate that it achieves state-of-the-art performance.",
