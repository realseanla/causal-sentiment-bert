    "abstractText" : "In this work we focus on efficient heuristics for solving a class of stochastic planning problems that arise in a variety of business, investment, and industrial applications. The problem is best de­ scribed in terms of future buy and sell contracts. By buying less reliable, but less expensive, buy (supply) contracts, a company or a trader can cover a position of more reliable and more expen­ sive sell contracts. The goal is to maximize the expected net gain (profit) by constructing a close to optimum portfolio out of the available buy and sell contracts. This stochastic planning problem can be formulated as a two-stage stochastic linear programm ing problem with recourse. However, this formalization leads to solutions that are ex­ ponential in the number of possible failure com­ binations. Thus, this approach is not feasible for large scale problems. In this work we investi­ gate heuristic approximation techniques alleviat­ ing the efficiency problem. We primarily focus on the clustering approach and devise heuristics for finding clusterings leading to good approxi­ mations. We illustrate the quality and feasibility of the approach through experimental data.",
