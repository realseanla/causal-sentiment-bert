    "abstractText" : "We consider the problem of approximate belief-state monitoring using particle filtering for the purposes of implementing a policy for a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). While particle fil­ tering has become a widely used tool in AI for monitor­ ing dynamical systems, rather scant attention has been paid to their use in the context of decision making. As­ suming the existence of a value function, we derive er­ ror bounds on decision quality associated with filtering using importance sampling. We also describe an adap­ tive procedure that can be used to dynamically deter­ mine the number of samples required to meet specific error bounds. Empirical evidence is offered supporting this technique as a profitable means of directing sam­ pling effort where it is needed to distinguish policies.",
