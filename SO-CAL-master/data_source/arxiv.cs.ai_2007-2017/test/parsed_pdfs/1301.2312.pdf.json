    "abstractText" : "We propose a new method of discovering causal structures, based on the detection of local, spontaneous changes in the un­ derlying data-generating model. We ana­ lyze the classes of structures that are equiv­ alent relative to a stream of distributions produced by local changes, and devise algo­ rithms that output graphical representations of these equivalence classes. We present ex­ perimental results, using simulated data, and examine the errors associated with detection of changes and recovery of structures.",
