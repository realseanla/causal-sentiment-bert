      "text" : "The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES [5]) is a continuous optimizer which only exploits the ranking of estimated candidate solutions to approach the optimum of an objective function f : Rn → R. CMA-ES is also invariant w.r.t. affine transformations of the decision space, explaining the known robustness of the algorithm. An important practical advantage of CMAES is that all hyper-parameters thereof are defined by default with respect to the problem dimension n. Practically, only the population size λ is suggested to be tuned by the user, e.g. when a parallelization of the algorithm is considered or the problem at hand is known to be multi-modal and/or noisy [1,8]. Other hyperparameters have been provided robust default settings (depending on n and λ), in the sense that their offline tuning allegedly hardly improves the CMA-ES performance for unimodal functions. In the meanwhile, for multi-modal functions it is suggested that the overall performance can be significantly improved by offline tuning of λ and multiple stopping criteria [16,11]. Additionally, it is shown that CMA-ES can be improved by a factor up to 5-10 by the use of surrogate models on unimodal ill-conditioned functions [14]. This suggests that the CMA-ES performance can be improved by better exploiting the information in the evaluated samples (x, f(x)).\nThis paper focuses on the automatic online adjustment of the CMA-ES hyper-parameters. The proposed approach, called self-CMA-ES, relies on a second CMA-ES instance operating on the hyper-parameter space of the first CMAES, and aimed at increasing the likelihood of generating the most successful samples x in the current generation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the original (µ/µw, λ)-CMA-ES. self-CMA-ES is described in Section 3 and its experimental validation is discussed in Section 4 comparatively to related work. Section 5 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy [6,7,5] is acknowledgedly the most popular and the most efficient Evolution Strategy algorithm.\nThe original (µ/µw, λ)-CMA-ES (Algorithm 1) proceeds as follows. At the\nt-th iteration, a Gaussian distribution N ( mt, σt 2 C t ) is used to generate λ candidate solution xk ∈ Rn, for k = 1 . . . λ (line 5):\nxtk = N ( mt, σt 2 C t ) = mt + σtN ( 0,C t ) , (1)\nwhere the mean mt ∈ Rn of the distribution can be interpreted as the current estimate of the optimum of function f , C t ∈ Rn×n is a (positive definite) covariance matrix and σt is a mutation step-size. These λ solutions are evaluated according to f (line 6). The new mean mt+1 of the distribution is computed as a weighted sum of the best µ individuals out of the λ ones (line 7). Weights w1 . . . wµ are used to control the impact of selected individuals, with usually higher weights for top ranked individuals (line 1).\nThe adaptation of the step-size σt, inherited from the Cumulative Step-Size Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CSA-ES [6]), is controlled by the evolution path pt+1σ . Successful mutation steps mt+1−mt σt (line 8) are tracked in the sampling space, i.e., in the isotropic coordinate system defined by the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix C t. To update the evolution path pt+1σ , i) a decay/relaxation factor cσ is used to decrease the importance of previous steps; ii) the stepsize is increased if the length of the evolution path pt+1σ is longer than the expected length of the evolution path under random selection E ‖N (0, I )‖; iii) otherwise it is decreased (line 13). Expectation of ‖N (0, I )‖ is approximated by√ n(1− 1\n4n + 1 21n2 ). A damping parameter dσ controls the change of the step-size. The covariance matrix update consists of two parts (line 12): a rank-one update [7] and a rank-µ update [5]. The rank-one update computes the evolution path pt+1c of successful moves of the mean mt+1−mt σt of the mutation distribution in the given coordinate system (line 10), along the same lines as the evolution path pt+1σ of the step-size. To stall the update of p t+1 c when σ increases rapidly, a hσ trigger is used (line 9). The rank-µ update computes a covariance matrix Cµ as a weighted sum of the covariances of successful steps of the best µ individuals (line 11).

      "heading" : "3 The self-CMA-ES",
      "text" : "The proposed self-CMA-ES approach is based on the intuition that the optimal hyper-parameters of CMA-ES at time t should favor the generation of the best individuals at time t, under the (strong) assumption that an optimal parameterization and performance of CMA-ES in each time t will lead to the overall optimal performance.\nFormally, this intuition leads to the following procedure. Let θtf denote the hyper-parameter vector used for the optimization of objective f at time t (CMAES stores its state variables and internal parameters of iteration t in θt and the ’.’-notation is used to access them). At time t+1, the best individuals generated according to θtf are known to be the top-ranked individuals x t 1:λ . . . x t µ:λ, where xti:λ stands for the i-th best individual w.r.t. f . Hyper-parameter vector θ t f would thus have been all the better, if it had maximized the probability of generating these top individuals.\nAlong this line, the optimization of θtf is conducted using a second CMA-ES algorithm, referred to as auxiliary CMA-ES as opposed to the one concerned with the optimization of f , referred to as primary CMA-ES. The objective of the auxiliary CMA-ES is specified as follows:\nGiven: hyper-parameter vector θif and points (x i 1:λ, f(x i 1:λ)) evaluated by\nprimary CMA-ES at steps i = 1, . . . , t (noted as θi+1f .f(x1:λ) in Algorithm 2),\nFind: θt,∗f such that i) backtracking the primary CMA-ES to its state at time t−1; ii) replacing θtf by θt,∗f , would maximize the likelihood of xti:λ for i = 1 . . . µ. The auxiliary CMA-ES might thus tackle the maximization of gt(θ) computed as the weighed log-likelihood of the top-ranked µsel individuals at time t:\ngt(θ) =\nµsel ∑\ni=1\nwsel,i log ( P (xti:λ|θtf = θ ) ), (2)\nwhere wsel,i ≥ 0, i = 1 . . . µsel, ∑µsel i=1 wsel,i = 1, and by construction\nP (xi|mt,Ct) = 1 √\n(2π)n|Ct| exp (−0.5(mt − xti)Ct −1 (mt − xti)), (3)\nwhere Ct is the covariance matrix multiplied by σt 2 and |Ct| is its determinant.\nWhile the objective function for the auxiliary CMA-ES defined by Eq. (2) is mathematically sound, it yields a difficult optimization problem; firstly the probabilities are scale-sensitive; secondly and overall, in a worst case scenario, a single good but unlikely solution may lead the optimization of θtf astray.\nTherefore, another optimization objective ht(θ) is defined for the auxiliary CMA-ES, where ht(θ) measures the agreement on x t i:λ for i = 1 . . . µ between i) the order defined from f ; ii) the order defined from their likelihood conditioned by θtf = θ (Algorithm 3). Procedure ReproduceGenerationCMA in Algorithm 3 updates the strategy parameters described from line 7 to line 14 in Algorithm 1 using already evaluated solutions stored in θtf .xi:λ. Line 4 computes the Mahalanobis distance, division by step-size is not needed since only ranking will be considered in line 5 (decreasing order of Mahalanobis distances corresponds to increasing order of log-likelihoods). Line 6 computes a weighted sum of ranks of likelihoods of best individuals.\nFinally, the overall scheme of self-CMA-ES (Algorithm 2) involves two interdependent CMA-ES optimization algorithms, where the primary CMA-ES is concerned with optimizing objective f , and the auxiliary CMA-ES is concerned with optimizing objective ht, that is, optimizing the hyper-parameters of the primary CMA-ES4. Note that self-CMA-ES is not per se a “more parameterless“ algorithm than CMA-ES, in the sense that the user is still invited to modify the population size λ. The main purpose of self-CMA-ES is to achieve the online adaptation of the other CMA-ES hyper-parameters.\n4 This scheme is actually inspired from the one proposed for surrogate-assisted optimization [13], where the auxiliary CMA-ES was in charge of optimizing the surrogate learning hyper-parameters.\nAlgorithm 2 The self-CMA-ES 1: t ← 1 2: θtf ← InitializationCMA() { primary CMA-ES aimed at optimizing f } 3: θth ← InitializationCMA() { auxiliary CMA-ES aimed at optimizing ht } 4: fill θtf with corresponding parameters stored in mean of distribution θ t h.m\n5: θt+1f ← GenerationCMA(f , θtf ) 6: t ← t+ 1 7: repeat 8: θt+1f ←GenerationCMA(f, θtf ) 9: θt+1h ←GenerationCMA(ht, θth) 10: fill θt+1f with corresponding parameters stored in mean of distribution θ t+1 h .m 11: t ← t+ 1 12: until stopping criterion is met\nSpecifically, while the primary CMA-ES optimizes f(x) (line 8), the auxiliary CMA-ES maximizes ht(θ) (line 9) by sampling and evaluating λh variants of θ t f . The updated mean of the auxiliary CMA-ES in the hyper-parameter space is used as a local estimate of the optimal hyper-parameter vector for the primary CMA-ES. Note that the auxiliary CMA-ES achieves a single iteration in the hyper-parameter space of the primary CMA-ES, with two motivations: limiting the computational cost of self-CMA-ES (which scales as λh times the time complexity of the CMA-ES), and preventing θtf from overfitting the current sample xti:λ, i = 1 . . . µ.\nAlgorithm 3 Objective function ht(θ)\n1: Input: θ, θt+1f ,θ t−1 f , θ t f , µ, wsel,i for i = 1, . . . , µ 2: θ ′t−1 f ← θ 3: θ ′t f ←ReproduceGenerationCMA(f, θ ′t−1 f ) using already evaluated θ t f .xi:λ 4: di ← ∥ ∥ ∥θ ′t f . √ C−1 · (θt+1f .xti − θ ′t f .m) ∥ ∥ ∥ ; for i = 1, . . . , θt+1f .λ 5: pi ← rank of di, i = 1 . . . λ sorted in decreasing order 6: h(θ) ← ∑µi=1 wsel,ipi:λ { i : λ denotes the rank of θt+1.xi } 7: Output: h(θ)"

Both algorithms are launched in IPOP scenario of restarts when the CMA-ES is restarted with doubled population size once stopping criteria [3] are met5.\n5 For the sake of reproducibility, the source code is available at https://sites.google.com/site/selfcmappsn/\nThe population size λ is chosen to be 100 for both CMA-ES and self-CMAES. We choose this value (about 10 times larger than the default one, see the default parameters of CMA-ES in Algorithm 1) to investigate how sub-optimal the other CMA-ES hyper-parameters, derived from λ, are in such a case, and whether self-CMA-ES can recover from this sub-optimality.\nThe auxiliary CMA-ES is concerned with optimizing hyper-parameters c1, cµ and cc (Algorithm 1), responsible for the adaptation of the covariance matrix of the primary CMA-ES. These parameters range in [0, .9] subject to 0 ≤ c1+ cµ ≤ 0.9; the constraint is meant to enforce a feasible C update for the primary CMA-ES (the decay factor of C should be in [0, 1]). Infeasible hyper-parameter solutions get a very large penalty, multiplied by the sum of distances of infeasible hyper-parameters to the range of feasibility.\nWe set wsel,i = 1/µ for i = 1, . . . , µ and µ = ⌊λ/2⌋ to 50. The internal computational complexity of self-CMA-ES thus is λh = 20 times larger than the one of CMA-ES without lazy update (being reminded that the internal time complexity is usually negligible compared to the cost per objective function evaluation)."

      "text" : "Figures 1 and 2 display the comparative performances of CMA-ES (left) and self-CMA-ES (right) on 10 and 20-dimensional Sphere, Rosenbrock, Rotated Ellipsoid and Sharp ridge functions from the noiseless BBOB testbed [4] (medians out of 15 runs). Each plot shows the value of the hyper-parameters (left y-axis) together with the objective function (in logarithmic scale, right y-axis). Hyperparameters c1, cµ and cc are constant and set to their default values for CMA-ES while they are adapted along evolution for self-CMA-ES.\nIn self-CMA-ES, the hyper-parameters are uniformly initialized in [0, 0.9] (therefore the medians are close to 0.45) and they gradually converge to values which are estimated to provide the best update of the covariance matrix w.r.t. the ability to generate the current best individuals. It is seen that these values are problem and dimension-dependent. The values of c1 are always much smaller than cµ but are comparable to the default c1. The values of cµ and cc and c1 are almost always larger than the default ones; this is not a surprise for c1 and cµ, as their original default values are chosen in a rather conservative way to prevent degeneration of the covariance matrix.\nSeveral interesting observations can be made about the dynamics of the parameter values. The value of cµ is high most of the times on the Rosenbrock functions, but it decreases toward values similar to those of the Sphere functions, when close to the optimum. This effect is observed on most problems; indeed, on most problems fast adaptation of the covariance matrix will improve the performance in the beginning, while the distribution shape should remain stable when the covariance matrix is learned close to the optimum.\nThe overall performance of self-CMA-ES on the considered problems is comparable to that of CMA-ES, with a speed-up of a factor up to 1.5 on Sharp Ridge functions. The main result is the ability of self-CMA-ES to achieve the\nonline adaptation of the hyper-parameters depending on the problem at hand, side-stepping the use of long calibrated default settings6."

      "heading" : "4.2 Discussion",
      "text" : "self-CMA-ES offers a proof of concept for the online adaptation of three CMA-ES hyper-parameters in terms of feasibility and usefulness. Previous studies on parameter settings for CMA-ES mostly considered offline tuning (see, e.g., [16,11]) and theoretical analysis dated back to the first papers on Evolution Strategies. The main limitation of these studies is that the suggested hyper-parameter values are usually specific to the (class of) analyzed problems. Furthermore, the suggested values are fixed, assuming that optimal parameter values remain constant along evolution. However, when optimizing a function whose landscape gradually changes when approaching the optimum, one may expect optimal hyperparameter values to reflect this change as well.\nStudies on the online adaptation of hyper-parameters (apart from σ, m and C) usually consider population size in noisy [2], multi-modal [1,12] or expensive [9] optimization. A more closely related approach was proposed in [15] where the learning rate for step-size adaptation is adapted in a stochastic way similarly to Rprop-updates [10]."

The experimental validation of self-CMA-ES shows that the learning rates involved in the covariance matrix adaptation can be efficiently adapted on-line, with comparable or better results than CMA-ES. It is worth emphasizing that matching the performance of CMA-ES, the default setting of which represent a historical consensus between theoretical analysis and offline tuning, is nothing easy.\nThe main novelty of the paper is to offer an intrinsic assessment of the algorithm internal state, based on retrospective reasoning (given the best current solutions, how could the generation of these solutions have been made easier) and on one assumption (the optimal hyper-parameter values at time t are ”sufficiently good“ at time t + 1). Further work will investigate how this intrinsic assessment can support the self-adaptation of other continuous and discrete hyper-parameters used to deal with noisy, multi-modal and constrained optimization problems.\nAcknowledgments We acknowledge anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

CMA-ES is well known to be almost parameterless, meaning that only one hyper-parameter, the population size, is proposed to be tuned by the user. In this paper, we propose a principled approach called selfCMA-ES to achieve the online adaptation of CMA-ES hyper-parameters in order to improve its overall performance. Experimental results show that for larger-than-default population size, the default settings of hyperparameters of CMA-ES are far from being optimal, and that self-CMAES allows for dynamically approaching optimal settings.",
