This new-coming learning regime has been empirically substantiated to be effective in various computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Recently, it has been proved that the SPL regime has a close relationship to a implicit self-paced objective function. While this implicit objective could provide helpful interpretations to the effectiveness, especially the robustness, insights under the SPL paradigms, there are still no theoretical results strictly proved to verify such relationship. To this issue, in this paper, we provide some convergence results on this implicit objective of SPL. Specifically, we prove that the learning process of SPL always converges to critical points of this implicit objective under some mild conditions. This result verifies the intrinsic relationship between SPL and this implicit objective, and makes the previous robustness analysis on SPL complete and theoretically rational.\nKeywords Self-paced learning, machine learning, non-convex optimization, convergence\nCitation Zilu Ma, Shiqi Liu, Deyu Meng, et al.

      "text" : "Self-paced learning (SPL) is a recently raised methodology designed through simulating the learning principle of humans/animals [3]. A variety of SPL realization schemes have been designed, and empirically substantiated to be effective in different computer vision and pattern recognition tasks, such as object detector adaptation [10], specific-class segmentation learning [2], visual category discovery [4], concept learning [5], long-term tracking [9], graph trimming [14], co-saliency detection [16], matrix factorization [17], face identification [6], and multimedia event detection [13].\nTo explain the underlying effectiveness mechanism inside SPL, [7] firstly provided some new theoretical understandings under the SPL scheme. Specifically, this work proved that the alternative optimization strategy (AOS) on SPL accords with a majorization minimization (MM) algorithm implemented on an implicit objective function. Furthermore, it is found that the loss function contained in this implicit objective has a similar configuration with non-convex regularized penalty (NCRP), leading to a rational interpretation to the robustness insight under SPL.\n*Corresponding author (email: dymeng@mail.xjtu.edu.cn )\nHowever, such understanding is still not theoretically strict. The theory in [7] can only guarantee that during the iterations of SPL solving process (i.e., the MM algorithm), the implicit objective is monotonically decreasing, while cannot prove any convergence results on this implicit objective theoretically. However, this theoretical result regarding this implicit objective is critical to the soundness of the robustness insight explanation of SPL, which guarantees to settle the convergence point of the algorithm down on the expected implicit objective, and intrinsically relate the original SPL model and this implicit objective.\nTo this theoretical issue of SPL, in this paper, we prove that the optimization of the implicit objective actually converges to critical points of original SPL problem under satisfactorily weak conditions. This result provides an affirmative answer to our guess that the SPL intrinsically optimizes a robust implicit objective.\nIn what follows, we will first introduce some related background of this research, and then we provide\nthe main theoretical result of this work."

      "text" : "Given training data set {(xi, yi)} N i=1, many machine learning problems need to minimizing the following form of objective function:\nJ(w) = φλ(w) + N ∑\ni=1\nL(yi, g(xi, w)),\nwhere w ∈ RD is variables to be solved, φλ is a regularizer parameter, L is the loss function and g(·, w) is the parametrized learning machine, like a discriminative or a regression function.\nTo improve the robustness, specially avoiding the negative influence brought by large-noise-outliers, SPL imposes additional importance weights v = (v1, · · · , vn) to loss functions of all samples, adjusted by a self-paced regularizer (SP-regularizer). Here, each vi ∈ [0, 1] represents how much extent the sample (xi, yi) will be trained in the learning process. The self-paced objective can then be designed as [1]:\nE(w, v;λ) = φλ(w) +\nN ∑\ni=1\nviL(yi, g(xi, w)) + fλ(vi), (1)\nwhere f is the SP-regularizer, satisfying the following conditions:\n1. v 7→ fλ(v) is convex on [0, 1];\n2. Let\nv∗λ(l) = arg min v∈[0,1] {vl + fλ(v)} ,\nthen l 7→ v∗λ(l) is non-increasing, and\nlim l→0 v∗λ(l) = 1, lim l→∞ v∗λ(l) = 0;\n3. λ 7→ v∗λ(l) is non-decreasing, and\nlim λ→0 v∗λ(l) = 0, lim λ→∞ v∗λ(l) 6 1.\nThroughout this paper, we shall assume that v∗λ(l) can be uniquely determined and thus can be seen as a real-valued function instead of a set-valued function.\nThe three conditions in the definition above provide basic principles for constructing a SP-regularizer. Condition 2 indicates that the model inclines to select easy samples (with smaller losses) in favor of complex samples (with larger losses). Condition 3 states that when the model “pace” (controlled by the pace parameter λ) gets larger, it tends to incorporate more, probably complex, samples to train a “mature” model. The convexity in Condition 1 further ensures the soundness of this regularizer for optimization.\nThe existence of the SP-regularizer can be illustrated by the following example. Let the SP-regularizer be\nfλ(v) = λv(log v − 1),\nthen it yields\nv∗λ(l) = e −λ−1l.\nIt is easy to verify that v∗λ(l) satisfies the above conditions.\nIn the following, we shall write:\nli(w) = L(yi, g(xi, w)), i = 1, · · · , N\nfor simplicity."

      "text" : "Let\nFλ(l) =\n∫ l\n0\nv∗λ(τ)dτ.\nSince v∗λ is non-increasing, the set of its discontinuous points is countable and consists only of jump discontinuity. Thus v∗λ is integrable and Fλ is absolutely continuous and concave. We now define\nGλ(w) = φλ(w) +\nN ∑\ni=1\n(Fλ ◦ li)(w) (2)\nas the implicit objective, where g ◦ f denotes that g composed with f . An interesting observation is that this implicit SPL objective has a close relationship to NCRP widely investigated in machine learning and statistics, which provides some helpful explanation to the robustness insight under SPL [7].\nThe original utilized AOS algorithm for solving the SPL problem is designed by performing coordinate\ndescent calculation on E(w, v;λ), i.e., iterating through the process as:\n(wk−1, vk−1) → (wk−1, vk) → (wk, vk).\nSpecifically, given (w0, v0), if we have finished (k − 1) steps, then the AOS algorithm need to iteratively calculating the following two subproblems:\nvk = argmin v E(wk−1, v;λ) = argmin v\n{\nN ∑\ni=1\nvili(w k−1) + fλ(vi)\n}\n,\nwk ∈ argmin w E(w, vk;λ) = argmin w\n{\nφλ(w) + N ∑\ni=1\nvki li(w)\n}\n.\nNote that the first subproblem is feasible since we have assumed that v∗λ can be uniquely determined. Indeed, using the notation of v∗λ, we have\nvki = v ∗ λ(li(w k−1)), i = 1, · · · , N.\nWe then set\nQ(w|w∗) =\nN ∑\ni=1\n(Fλ ◦ li)(w ∗) + (v∗λ ◦ li)(w ∗)[li(w)− li(w ∗)].\nIt is easy to deduce that Q(w|w∗) is actually the first-order Taylor series of Fλ at li(w ∗). Based on the concavity of Fλ, we know that\nU(w|w∗) = φλ(w) +Q(w|w ∗)\nconstitutes a upper bound of Gλ(w) (as defined in Eq. (2)), which provides a qualified surrogate function for MM algorithm.\nOne of the key issues in [7] is that if {wk} is produced by AOS algorithm of E(w, v;λ), then it can also be produced by performing MM algorithm on Gλ and vice versa. We prove one side by induction. The other side is totally the same. Suppose we have proved that wk can be produced by performing MM algorithm on Gλ at k th step. When it comes to the (k + 1)th step,\nwk+1 ∈ argmin w E(w, vk+1;λ)\n= argmin w φλ(w) +\nN ∑\ni=1\nvk+1i li(w)\n= argmin w φλ(w) +\nN ∑\ni=1\nv∗λ(li(w k)) · li(w)\n= argmin w\nφλ(w) +Q(w|w k) = argmin w U(w|wk). (3)\nThus we have proved our claim that these two optimization algorithms (AOS/MM) conducting on the two different objective functions (E(w, v;λ)/Gλ(w)) are intrinsically equivalent.\nWe then need to prove whether every convergence point of MM algorithm, or equivalently, that of the\nAOS algorithm on the SPL objective, is at least a critical point of Gλ."

      "text" : "Actually, the proof of the convergence of MM algorithm is basically the same as that of the EM algorithm (see [12]) only with some obvious changes, as discussed in [11]. And the convergence of EM and MM is indeed a corollary of a global convergence theorem of Zangwill (see [15]). We can generalize the proof to the case of variational analysis. Before that, we need to clarify some terminologies which can be referred to in [8].\nA function f : Rd → R is said to be lower semi-continuous or simply lsc if\nlevf6α := {x : f(x) 6 α}\nis closed for any α ∈ R. f is said to be level-bounded if levf6α is bounded for any α. And f is called coercive if lim|x|→∞ f(x) = ∞. Note that coercive functions are level-bounded. A critical point x of f means that 0 ∈ ∂f(x), where ∂ stands for the subdifferential [8].\nThe main theorem of this paper can then be stated as follows.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that the objective function of MM algorithm, G : RD → R, is lsc and levelbounded, and that the surrogate function at w∗ is U(·|w∗), which is lsc as a function on R2D, and satisfies\n∂U(w|w) ⊂ ∂G(w), ∀w ∈ RD,\nwhere ∂U(w|w∗) is the partial subdifferential in w. Then for any initial parameter w0, every cluster point of the produced sequence {wk} of MM algorithm is a critical point of G.\nProof. See the appendix.\nFor our problem, we can give a sufficient condition of convergence, which is easy to verify and satisfied\nby most of the current SPL variations.\nTheorem 2. In the SPL objective as defined in Section 2.1, suppose L is bounded below, w 7→ L(y, g(x,w)) is continuously differentiable, v∗λ(·) is continuous, and φλ is coercive and lsc. Then for any initial parameter w0, every cluster point of the produced sequence {wk}, obtained by the AOS algorithm on solving Eq. (1), is a critical point of the implicit objective Gλ as defined in Eq. (2). Proof. It is obvious that Gλ is lsc and level-bounded and U is lsc as a function on R 2D with these assumptions. And the continuity of v∗λ makes Fλ continuously differentiable. Then we have\n∂Gλ(w ∗) = ∂φλ(w ∗) + N ∑\ni=1\nF ′λ(li(w ∗))∇li(w ∗)\n= ∂φλ(w ∗) +\nN ∑\ni=1\n(v∗λ ◦ li)(w ∗)∇li(w ∗)\n= ∂U(w∗|w∗).\nBased on Theorem 1, for any initial parameter w0, every cluster point of the produced sequence {wk} is a critical point of Gλ. The proof is then completed.\nFrom the theorem, we can see that the AOS algorithm generally used to solving the SPL problem can be guaranteed to convergent to a critical point of the implicit NCRP objective Gλ. The intrinsic relationship between two objectives can then be constructed.\nNote that in the above theorem, it is required that every minimization step in MM algorithm exactly\nattains the minima of the surrogate function U(w|wk), i.e.,\nU(wk+1|wk) = minU(·|wk). (4)\nThis is generally hard to achieve in real applications, especially for those learning models without closedform solution. We thus want to further relax the condition to allow a relatively weaker solution “with errors” in implementing the MM algorithm on the surrogate function. That is, we can weaken the condition (4) as:\nU(wk+1|wk) 6 minU(·|wk) + ǫk,\nwhere ǫ1, ǫ2, · · · is a non-negative sequence satisfying {ǫk} ∈ l 1, i.e.,\n∑\nk ǫk < ∞.\nUnder this relaxed condition, we can still prove the convergence result of SPL in the following algorithm\nTheorem 3. In the SPL objective as defined in Section 2.1, suppose L is bounded below, w 7→ L(y, g(x,w)) is continuously differentiable, v∗λ(·) is continuous, and φλ is coercive and lsc. Let w 0 be an arbitrary initial parameter, and {wk} be the sequence obtained by the AOS algorithm on solving Eq. (1) with errors {ǫk > 0} ∈ l 1, that is,\nE(wk, vk;λ) 6 minE(·, vk;λ) + ǫk, ∀k > 1.\nThen every cluster point of {wk} is a critical point of the implicit objective Gλ as defined in Eq. (2).\nBased on the theorem, we can then confirm the intrinsic relationship between SPL and its implicit\nobjective."

    "abstractText" : "Self-paced learning (SPL) is a new methodology that simulates the learning principle of humans/animals to start learning easier aspects of a learning task, and then gradually take more complex examples into training. This new-coming learning regime has been empirically substantiated to be effective in various computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. Recently, it has been proved that the SPL regime has a close relationship to a implicit self-paced objective function. While this implicit objective could provide helpful interpretations to the effectiveness, especially the robustness, insights under the SPL paradigms, there are still no theoretical results strictly proved to verify such relationship. To this issue, in this paper, we provide some convergence results on this implicit objective of SPL. Specifically, we prove that the learning process of SPL always converges to critical points of this implicit objective under some mild conditions. This result verifies the intrinsic relationship between SPL and this implicit objective, and makes the previous robustness analysis on SPL complete and theoretically rational.",
