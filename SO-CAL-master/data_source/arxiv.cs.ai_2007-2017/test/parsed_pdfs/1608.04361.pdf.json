      "text" : "The Monte Carlo method [18] for solving a linear system uses a random walk to approximate the solution. This method has several advantages over traditional deterministic algorithms (e.g., Gaussian elimination and iterative methods) due to its unique characteristics. First, the Monte Carlo method can be highly effective when only modest accuracy is required, as is common for many problems on data such as PageRank computations [2]. Second, it is well-known that Monte Carlo algorithms are highly parallelizable [13, 5], thus they are ideal for modern paralleled computers or clusters. Third, Monte Carlo methods can identify only on a single component or a linear form of the solution, which is often all that is required in many applications [17]. Last but not least, Monte Carlo methods have advantages when dealing with large linear systems [11, 7] because they do not always require a full solution vector."

      "text" : "Consider the following linear system: x = Hx + b\nwhere H ∈ Rn×n and x,b ∈ Rn and where our goal is to evaluate the functional 〈h,x〉 = ∑n\ni=1 hixi. We could then use this primitive to compute the solution by evaluating the functional for each standard basis vector to get each single component of the solution.\nIt is known that if the spectral radius ρ(H) < 1, then the Neumann Series ∑∞\n`=0H `b will\nconverge to the solution vector x. The Monte Carlo method uses this observation to create a Markov random walk Xt on the state space S = {1, 2, · · · , n} with initial probability Pr(X0 = i) = pi and transition probability Pr(X`+1 = j | X` = i) = Pi,j , s.t.hi 6= 0⇒ pi 6= 0 and Hi,j 6= 0⇒ Pi,j 6= 0.\nLet ν be a realization of the random walk: k0 → k1 → k2 → · · · → k` → · · ·. A walk related weight and random variable can be calculated as\nW` = hk0Hk0,k1Hk1,k2 · · ·Hk`−1,k` pk0Pk0,k1Pk1,k2 · · ·Pk`−1,k` for ` = 0, 1, 2, · · · and X(ν) = ∞∑ `=0 W`bk` .\nThen it can be shown (for instance [7]) that E[X] = 〈h,x〉, and more specifically E[W`fk` ] = 〈h,H `f〉.\nHowever the random walk model does not guarantee convergence [12, 18]. According to the law of large numbers, a necessary and sufficient condition to estimate E[X] using the empirical mean value of X is Var[X] <∞. Empirical studies [12, 3] show that it is easy to have Var[X] =∞ even when the Neumann Series converges (i.e., ρ(H) < 1)."

      "text" : "In order to apply the Monte Carlo method, existing work [8, 16, 17] assumes ‖H‖ < 1 (for the infinity norm ‖H‖ = maxi ∑ j |Hi,j |), which suffices to show Var[X] <∞, but which is a stronger condition than ρ(H) < 1. Although it is possible Var[X] <∞ when ‖H‖ ≥ 1, there is no easy way to check. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-way Markov random walk which uses multiple transition matrices. At each step of the random walk, the transition matrix is constructed in a way akin to the Monte Carlo Almost Optimal (MAO) framework [8, 12]. We prove that under this type of random walk, the new method always converges when ρ(H+) < 1, where H+ is the nonnegative matrix as H+ij = |Hij |. In addition, our new framework has the tendency to get the result faster than the standard method. One downside to our approach is that is cannot be implemented in a purely local fashion akin to the standard Monte Carlo method as it requires global work to build the multi-way walk."

Direct methods study the various techniques of using the Monte Carlo solvers themselves, for instances non-diagonal splitting [16] and relaxation parameters [7]. Hybrid methods [11, 10, 1] use Monte Carlo as a black box combined with iterative techniques. Examples of these works are Sequential Monte Carlo method [11] and synthetic-acceleration method [10]. Also there are a variety of studies of the parallel implementation [6, 14, 1], real world application [17, 2], convergence analysis [12], and spectral analysis [15].\nIn this paper, we focus on the direct Monte Carlo procedure.

      "text" : "In order to statistically estimate E[Z], we need to ensure Var[Z] <∞. The following theorem reveals the explicit form of Var[Z] determined by h,b,H and the m−way random walk (p,P ). Theorem 2.2. For the linear system x = Hx + b, if H and b are nonnegative, Z defined from (2) has variance\nVar[Z] = 〈ĥ, ∞∑ i=0 H̃ i GDiag(b)(2Hx + b)〉 − 〈h,x〉2 (3)\nwhere Diag(b) is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries equal to b, and ĥ, H̃,G are defined as:\nĥi = { h2i /pi if hi 6= 0 0 if hi = 0\nĤ (`) i,j =\n{ H2i,j/P (`) i,j if Hi,j 6= 0\n0 if Hi,j = 0\nH̃ = Ĥ (1) Ĥ (2) · · · Ĥ(m) G = I + Ĥ(1) + Ĥ(1)Ĥ(2) + · · ·+ Ĥ(1)Ĥ(2) · · · Ĥ(m−1)\nProof.

Now, combining the results from (5) and (6) we have:\nVar[Z] = 〈 ĥ, ∞∑ i=0 H̃ i GDiag(b)b 〉 + 2 〈 ĥ, ∞∑ i=0 H̃ i GDiag(b)Hx 〉 − 〈h,x〉2\n= 〈ĥ, ∞∑ i=0 H̃ i GDiag(b)(2Hx + b)〉 − 〈h,x〉2\nFor the general cases of H,b without the assumption of nonnegativity, if ρ(H̃) < 1, the above conclusion (i.e., equation (3)) still holds according to Fubini’s Theorem.\nCombining both of these results, the following corollary is straightforward from the conclusion of Theorem 2.2.\nCorollary 2.3. For the linear system x = Hx + b, if the spectral radius ρ(H̃) < 1, then Var[Z] = 〈ĥ, (I − H̃)−1GDiag(b)(2Hx + b)〉 − 〈h,x〉2 <∞\nThe above analysis of Var[Z] shows that with the condition ρ(H̃) < 1, and by the law of large numbers we can estimate the value of 〈h,x〉 from the variable Z. For the cases when ρ(H̃) ≥ 1, the following corollary shows that it is possible to have Var[Z] =∞. The essence of the idea and proof is just that we can construct a vector to touch the dominant eigenvector with eigenvalue ≥ 1.\nCorollary 2.4. Under the same assumptions with Theorem 2.2, if the spectral radius ρ(H̃) ≥ 1, and if G is full-rank, then there always exists some b,h ∈ Rn such that Var[Z] =∞. (Note that for the standard Monte Carlo method (i.e., m = 1), since G = I, the method diverges for certain b,h.)\nProof. Let J denote the Jordan canonical form for matrix Ĥ s.t. Ĥ = PJP−1, where P = [p1,p2, · · · ,pn] and pi for i = 1, 2, · · · , n are the generalized eigenvectors. The diagonal entries of J are eigenvalues of Ĥ, and J is composed with Jordan blocks:\nJ =  J1 J2 . . .\nJp\n where J i =  λi 1 λi . . . . . . 1\nλi\n for i = 1, 2, · · · , p. (7)\nThe power of J has the form: J j = Diag(J j1,J j 2, · · · ,J j p), where each individual block J j i with\nsize s is:\nJ ji =  λji ( j 1 ) λj−1i · · · ( j s−1 ) λj−s−1i 0 λji · · · ( j s−2 ) λj−si\n0 . . . . . . 0 · · · · · · λji  for j > s. (8) So the upper right element ( j s−1 ) λj−s−1i has the largest asymptotic value as j →∞. Without a loss of generality, we can assume that J1,J2, · · · ,Jp are sorted in the decending order of eigenvalues, and for the case of the equal eigenvalues, they are sorted in the decending order of block sizes. So let J1, · · · ,Jk be the blocks with largestest eigenvalues (i.e., λ1 = · · · = λk ≥ λk+1 ≥ · · · ≥ λp) and they have the same size s.\nDenote y = P−1GDiag(b)(2Hx+b), and z(i) = J iy for i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , n. Given ys, y2s · · · , yks 6= 0, we have z(i)s = λi1ys(1 + o(1)), z (i) 2s = λ i 1y2s(1 + o(1)), · · · z (i) ks = λ i 1yks(1 + o(1)), and z (i) r /z (i) 1 = o(1) for r 6= s, 2s, · · · , ks as i → ∞. If we select h s.t. 〈h, ysps + y2sp2s + · · · + ykspks〉 6= 0, then we have:\n〈h, ∞∑ i=0 H̃ i GDiag(b)(2Hx + b)〉 = 〈h, ∞∑ i=0 P z(i)〉\n= ∞∑ i=0 z (i) 1 〈h,p1〉+ ∞∑ i=0 z (i) 2 〈h,p2〉+ · · ·+ ∞∑ i=0 z(i)n 〈h,pn〉\n= ( ∞∑ i=0 λi1〈h, ysps + y2sp2s + · · ·+ ykspks〉 )( 1 + o(1) ) =∞\nSince ps,p2s, · · · ,pks are linear independent, there always exists a vector h, s.t. 〈h, ysps + y2sp2s + · · ·+ ykspks〉 6= 0, given ys, y2s, · · · , yks are not all zero. Next we prove that there always exists a vector x s.t. ys 6= 0. Let uT denote the s−th row of P−1G, then ys can be calculated as:\nys = u T Diag(b)(2Hx + b)\n=uT Diag(x−Hx)(x +Hx) = uT Diag(x)x− uT Diag(Hx)Hx (9)\nSo ys is a polynomial of x with coefficients coming from uT and H. If ys = 0 for all x ∈ Rn, then all the coefficients from equation 9 are zero. Denote hi for i = 1, 2, · · · , n are the columns of matrix H, then the coefficients of terms x21, x1x2, x1x3, · · · , x1xn equaling zero gives us: u1 − ∑n i=1 uiHi,1Hi,1 = 0 − ∑n i=1 uiHi,1Hi,2 = 0 − ∑n i=1 uiHi,1Hi,3 = 0 ... ... ... − ∑n\ni=1 uiHi,1Hi,n = 0\n=⇒ HT Diag(u)h1 = (u1, 0, 0, · · · , 0)T\nSimilarly by setting the coefficients of terms xix1, xix2, · · · , xixn to zero, we have equation:\nHT Diag(u)hi = (0, · · · , 0, ui, 0, · · · , 0)T .\nAnd combining all together will get us HT Diag(u)H = Diag(u). Since uT is the first row of a full-rank matrix, it cannot be a vector of all zeros, and the spectral radius ρ(Diag(u)) ≤ ρ(HT )ρ(Diag(u))ρ(H) < ρ(Diag(u)) gives us the contradiction. So ys cannot always be zero.\nIn this section we have seen that E[Z] = 〈h,x〉, which provides us the potential to estimate the value of 〈h,x〉 by simulating the value of Z. However whether it is feasible to apply Monte Carlo simulation depends on H̃ . If ρ(H̃) < 1, then Var[Z] <∞, so the simulation is guaranteed to converge. And if ρ(H̃) ≥ 1, the simulation tends to fail."

      "text" : "In section 2 Corollary 2.3 and 2.4 indicate that the spectral radius of matrix H̃ is crucial to the variance Var[Z]. The matrix H̃ is determined by the transition hypermatrix P . Since it is usually computationally inefficient to directly compute the spectral radius of a matrix, the common practice is to find an upper-bound of ρ(H̃). The spectral radius of a matrix is bounded by any sub-multiplicative matrix norm. As before, we use the infinity norm ‖ · ‖def= ‖ · ‖∞ in this paper. We first consider the case for the standard Markov random walk (i.e., m = 1), where H̃i,j = H2i,j/P (1) i,j . The following lemma [12] provides insight on how to assign the probability in terms of minimizing the norm.\nLemma 3.1. Let h = (h1, h2, · · · , hn)T be a vector where at least one of its elements is non-zero: hk 6= 0 for some k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}. Let p = (p1, p2, · · · , pn)T be a probability distribution vector. Then ∑n i=1 h 2 i /pi ≥ (∑n i=1 |hi| )2 , and the lower-bound is attained when pi = |hi|/ ∑n r=1 |hr|.\nAccording to Lemma 3.1, the infinity norm:\n‖H̃‖ = max 1≤i≤n n∑ j=1 |H̃i,j | = max 1≤i≤n n∑ j=1 H2i,j P (1) i,j ≥ max 1≤i≤n ( n∑ j=1 |Hi,j | )2 = (‖H‖)2.\nWhen P (1)i,j = |Hi,j |∑n\nk=1 |Hi,k| for all i, j = 1, 2, · · · , n, the above lower-bound (‖H‖)2 is reached, making\nthis choice in some sense optimal. However, for a variety of problems, this choice is unlikely to result in a method that will have ρ(H̃) < 1. For a linear system Ax = b, we can rewrite it into x = Hx + b as H = I −A. It is common to have ρ(H) be very close to 1 even with the help of preconditioners [3]. Since the infinity norm is generally a loose upper-bound for the spectral radius, ‖H‖ > 1 is likely [3]. This inability of upper-bounding the spectral radius ρ(H̃) for the standard Markov random walk encourages us to explore the multi-way generality.\nWe describe the method for computing P for an m−way Markov random walk in Algorithm 1, then we prove in Theorem 3.2 that it minimizes ‖H̃‖.\nData: matrix H Result: transition hypermatrix P initialization ωi = 1 for i = 1, 2, · · · , n; for k = m : 1 do\nηi = ∑n\n`=1 ω`|Hi,`| for i = 1, 2, · · · , n; P\n(k) i,j = ωj |Hi,j |/ηi for i, j = 1, 2, · · · , n; ωi = ηi for i = 1, 2, · · · , n\nend Algorithm 1: Compute transition hypermatrix\nIt is worth noting that Algorithm 1 only takes linear time in the number of non-zeros in the matrix H in each iteration. Also the output result of the transition hypermatrix is compatible with different values of m, which means that m does not need to be pre-selected to run the algorithm. In other words, we can stop the iteration anytime we want and still get the output hypermatrix for some smaller m. This is useful when we later discuss how to choose the value of m, as it turns out that we can set a criterion to stop the iteration. Lastly we see that the output transition hypermatrix P is only determined by H . So the procedure of computing P is similar to loading the matrix into the memory as they both only need to be done once for different problems (i.e., different h and b). On the other hand, this means that we need global computation to compute this sequence and this choice prohibits a purely local algorithm.\nTheorem 3.2. Let P be the output of Algorithm 1, then H̃ defined in Theorem 2.2 has reached its minimal infinity norm.\nProof. We use matrices P (i) for i = 1, 2, · · · ,m to denote matrix slices of hypermatrices P from the output of Algorithm 1, and η(k)i for the value of ηi at the kth iteration.\nWe first prove that the value of ‖H̃‖ cannot be further decreased by changing P (m). Since H̃ is a nonnegative matrix, ‖H̃‖ = ‖H̃e‖ holds, where e ∈ Rn and ei = 1 for all i = 1, 2, · · · , n. The kth element of Ĥ (m) e is ∑n j=1H 2 k,j/P (m) k,j , and according to Lemma 3.1, this value is minimized\nwhen P (m)k,i = |Hk,i|/ ∑n j=1 |Hk,j |, which is exactly the kth row of P (m) from the algorithm. Thus by changing P (m), we cannot decrease any elements of vector Ĥ (m)\ne, and ‖H̃e‖ will not decrease. Second we prove that ( (η\n(m) 1 ) 2, (η (m) 2 ) 2, · · · , (η(m)n )2 )T = Ĥ (m) e. Because P (m) is constructed as\nP (m) k,i = |Hk,i|/ ∑n j=1 |Hk,j |, which means the kth element of Ĥ (m) e is ( ∑n j=1 |Hk,j |)2 = (η (m) k )\n2. Lastly we use mathematical induction and assume that we cannot decrease ‖H̃‖ by changing\nP (`), and ( (η\n(`) 1 ) 2, (η (`) 2 ) 2, · · · , (η(`)n )2 )T = Ĥ (`) · · · Ĥ(m)e for r + 1 ≤ ` ≤ m. Then similarly we\nprove that the statement holds for P (r). We notice that the kth element of Ĥ (r) Ĥ (r+1) · · · Ĥ(m)e is\n∑n j=1(Hk,jη (r+1) j ) 2/P rk,j and it is minimized because P (r) is computed as\nP (r) i,j = η (r+1) j |Hi,j |/ n∑ k=1 η (r+1) k |Hi,k|. (10)\nSo no elements of the vector Ĥ (r) Ĥ (r+1) · · · Ĥ(m)e will decrease in value and neither will norm ‖H̃‖ if we change P (r). From formula (10) we can compute the kth element of Ĥ (r) Ĥ\n(r+1) · · · Ĥ(m)e as ( ∑n\nj=1 η (r+1) j |Hk,j |)2 = (η (r) k ) 2. So we have proved that this induction statement also holds for ` = r. In conclusion the output hypermatrix P from Algorithm 1 will ensure ‖H̃‖ to be minimized.\nThe standard 1−way method can also be viewed as a special case of m−way random walk, with the m transition matrices being the same. However the 1−way method generally does not minimize ‖H̃‖ in the m−way setting as Algorithm 1 minimizes ‖H̃‖. Formula (3) from Theorem 2.2 indicates the connection between the variance and the power series of H̃. Since ‖H̃‖ is an upper-bound of ρ(H̃) and ρ(H̃) affects how big this power series will grow, we can see that the m−way random walk with transition hypermatrix defined from Algorithm 1 has the tendency to decrease the variance compared to the standard 1−way method. Although the above analysis does not ensure a smaller variance for the m−way method, numerical experiments in both synthetic matrices and matrices in real applications support this conjecture. (See Section 4).\nNext we move to see how the spectral radius ρ(H̃) is related to the matrix H . In order to bound ρ(H̃), the standard Markov random walk requires ‖H‖ < 1, which does not happen often from our early analysis. The following theorem states the necessary and sufficient condition for a m−way Markov random walk to have ρ(H̃) < 1.\nTheorem 3.3. Let H+ denote the nonnegative matrix where H+i,j = |Hi,j |. There exists a m−way Markov random walk transition hypermatrix P such ‖H̃‖ < 1 if and only if ρ(H+) < 1.\nProof. If there exists a m−way Markov random walk transition hypermatrix P such that ‖H̃‖ < 1, without a loss of generality we assume P is the output from Algorithm 1 since Theorem 3.2 states that it minimize ‖H̃‖. From the proof of Theorem 3.2 we have:\n‖H̃‖ = ‖H̃e‖ = ‖Ĥ(1)Ĥ(2) · · · Ĥ(m)e‖ = ‖ ( (η\n(1) 1 ) 2, (η (1) 2 ) 2, · · · , (η(1)n )2 )T ‖. (11)\nAccording to the computing procedure of Algorithm 1 we have (η(`)1 , η (`) 2 , · · · , η (`) n )T = (H +)me. So ‖H̃‖ < 1 =⇒ ‖(H+)me‖ < 1 =⇒ ‖(H+)m‖ < 1 =⇒ ρ(H+) < 1.\nIf we have ρ(H+) < 1, from Gelfand’s Formula, we have ρ(H+) = limk→∞ ‖(H+)k‖ 1/k. Then we can find a sufficient large number m s.t. for any k ≥ m the inequality ‖(H+)k‖1/k < 1 holds. Let H̃ be the matrix based on the transition hypermatrix output from Algorithm 1. Based on the observation of (11), we have ρ(H+) < 1 =⇒ ‖(H+)m‖ < 1 =⇒ η(1)i < 1, i = 1, 2, · · · , n =⇒ ‖H̃‖ < 1\nTheorem 3.3 creates an equivalent link between ρ(H+) < 1 and existence of m−way Markov random walk such that ‖H̃‖ < 1. However it does not guarantee the size of m. In another words one can always cook up some matrix H with ρ(H+) < 1 but make m arbitrarily large. Although these extreme cases are not our primary focus in this paper, we point it out for the discussion of the practical implementation of Algorithm 1. In order to find the transition hypermatrix P with ‖H̃‖ < 1, we can set a threshold number φmax, and let m grow until we have ηi < 1 for all i = 1, 2, · · · , n or m = φmax. As stated before, we do not need to re-run the algorithm for different value of m, because the way Algorithm 1 computes the transition hypermatrix is compatible with different values of m."

      "text" : "To practically estimate the value 〈h,x〉 from simulating the value of Z, we need to truncate the multi-way Markov random walk in order for it to end after some large number of steps N . The practical solution [7, 3] to determine N is through the criterion: |WN | ≤ |W0| where > 0 denotes some small number. For the case that the initial probability pi = |hi|/ ∑n j=1 |hj |, we have W0 = ‖h‖.\nWe notice thatWN is a random variable, and follow the similar analysis with that in Theorem 2.1, it is easy to see its expected value is 〈h, (H+)Ne〉. So ρ(H+) < 1 is a necessary condition in order to determine the truncation number N . Here we can see that our m−way Markov random walk has the minimal requirements on H , because ρ(H+) < 1 is required for all the Monte Carlo frameworks to be able to truncate the random walk, and yet we show that under this condition, our algorithm can always find a m−way transition Hypermatrix to ensure ‖H̃‖ < 1.\nThe following theorem justifies that the truncation procedure has little effect on the estimation result or the variance of the variable.\nTheorem 3.4. Let ZN denote the truncation value of Z after N steps of the random walk. Formally ZN = ∑N `=0W`bk` with W`, ` = 0, 1, 2, · · · , N defined in equation (2). If ‖H̃‖ < 1 then ZN converges in probability to Z: ZN p−→ Z, and Var[ZN ] converges to Var[Z] as N →∞.\nProof. From the definition of the variable Z = limN→∞ ZN , the conclusions can be easily verified.\nIn addition to the truncation, another error comes from the simulation procedure when using the empirical mean value of Z to estimate E[Z], formally we define the probable error as:\nr = sup { s : Pr ( |Z̄ − E[Z]| ≥ s ) > 1\n2 } where Z̄ = ∑M i=1 Z\n(i)/M denotes the mean value of M simulations Z(1), Z(2), · · · , Z(M). There is a close link between the probable error and the variance of the random variable.\nAccording to Central Limit Theorem\n√ M ( |Z̄ − Z| ) d−→ N (0,Var[Z]) where N ( 0,Var[Z] ) denotes the normal distribution with zero mean and variance Var[Z], and the\nsymbol d−→ means convergence in distribution. When M is sufficiently large, r ≈ 0.6745 √\nVar[Z]/M . The probable error is determined by the ratio of the variance to the number of simulations. If the variance is decreased by ξ times, then it only require ξ times fewer number of simulations to get to the same precision (i.e., probable error).\nBased on the above observations we can conduct numerical experiments to compare the variance between the standard Monte Carlo method and our multi-way Monte Carlo method, and the ratio between the variance can demonstrate how many times faster our new method can get."

In both experiments, synthetic matrices and real-world matrices are used.\nFor synthetic data, we generate the matrix H via Matlab command sprand(1000, 1000, 0.2), which outputs a 1, 000 by 1, 000 matrix with 0.2 of its entries being non-zeros, and each non-zero is a random number following uniform distribution between (0, 1). The synthetic matrices are rescaled to reach certain spectral radius required during experiments. Formally to get a spectral radius 0 < r < 1: H ← rH/ρ(H). Each result is the average over 100 trials for the related problems.\nFor real world matrices, we focus on the Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection [9, 4]. The matrix H is constructed by a simple diagonal precondition on the original matrix A from the collection: H = I−Diag(A)−1A. And for the test problems we only consider the matrices that have ρ(H+) < 1. In the interest of simplicity, we only use problems with fewer than 5,000 dimensions.\nIn both synthetic and real world experiments, vectors b,h are randomly generated with elements following uniform distribution between (0, 1)."

The\n2http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices/Hamm/index.html\nspeed-up times is an indicator for how much times faster our multi-way methods can get compared to the standard 1−way method. Table 1 shows that we have considerable speed-up when applying our multi-way methods. Note that we only consider the problems with ρ(H̃) < 1 in order for Var[Z] <∞. In the Harwell-Boeing collection there are a few problems having H+e equal for each element, we exclude these matrices because the multi-way method is equivalent to the standard method, as we now show.\nWhen H+e is a vector with its elements being the same number, that is, H+e = γe, the multi-way method is equivalent to the standard method. This occurs because, as in Algorithm 1, the vectors η = (H+)ke and ω = (H+)k−1e will have their elements be the same. So the transition matrices P (i) for i = 1, 2, · · · ,m will also be the same. In our experiments on the Harwell-Boeing collection, we do find several matrices that have this property, so in this case our multi-way method is equivalent to the standard method.\nAmong our testing problems, there is only one 3 that our multi-way method can have a larger variance than that of the standard method. Actually we find the matrix H for this problem is outside our assumptions in this paper. We assume that H does not have zero row in order to assign transition probabilities for each state. For the corner case that H does have zero rows, the linear system can be easily adjusted by deleting the zero rows of H . For this testing problem H, the row sums of H+ distribute in a drastic way. Over half of the rows have sum values between 10−17 to 10−6, and quite a few “big” rows have sums larger than 103. So this matrix have many rows that are nearly zero. For all the other testing problems, our multi-way method can achieve smaller variances than the standard method, and the speed-up times in shown in Table 1."

      "text" : "In this paper we studied a generalization of Monte Carlo methods for linear systems. The generalization allows the Markov random walk to transition using a set of matrices. We derived the variance of the resulting estimator and construct the matrices in a way to attempt to produce a finite variance. The advantages of this new random walk procedures are two-fold. First it can solve more problems that the standard method fails to solve. Second our new method has the tendency to decrease the variance thus decrease the computations needed for estimate the solution. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world matrices confirm the superiority of our method in the above two aspects when comparing to the standard Monte Carlo method. An open problem suggested by our work is to get a purely local method that avoids the global work in building the sequence of adjacency matrices.\nAcknowledgements.

    "abstractText" : "We study the Monte Carlo method for solving a linear system of the form x = Hx + b. A sufficient condition for the method to work is ‖H‖ < 1, which greatly limits the usability of this method. We improve this condition by proposing a new multi-way Markov random walk, which is a generalization of the standard Markov random walk. Under our new framework we prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for our method to work is the spectral radius ρ(H) < 1, which is a weaker requirement than ‖H‖ < 1. In addition to solving more problems, our new method can work faster than the standard algorithm. In numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world matrices, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new method. ar X iv :1 60 8. 04 36 1v 1 [ cs .N A ] 1 5 A ug 2 01 6",
