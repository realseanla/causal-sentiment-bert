      "text" : "How should data or knowledge be represented and published so it can most easily be retrieved, re-used and managed? Then, how to compare or evaluate knowledge statements, knowledge bases (KBs), knowledge management techniques, KB management systems (KBMSs) and knowledge providers? Many complementary or alternative “knowledge sharing supporting elements” – and kinds of elements – have been proposed to provide partial answers to these research questions. For example: Semantic Web approaches [1-2], knowledge sharing languages (e.g., those provided by the W3C and more general ones [3-6]), ontologies [7-13], methodologies [14-15], best practices or design patterns [16-18], categories of evaluation criteria or measures [19-22], knowledge quality evaluation queries [23-25], benchmarks [26-27], techniques [28-29], software, etc. (these references are given to illustrate each “kind of element”; many of them will also later be referred to in this article; giving them now permits to group them by “kind” in the “references” section of this article).\nHowever, it is difficult for a knowledge provider or a KBMS developer to know about all these elements or their sub-elements, to compare them, choose between them, combine them and have a synthetic organized view of what can or should be done for knowledge sharing purposes. Indeed, these elements often do not use similar terminologies or categorizations, and no ontology or library has been proposed to compare, index, organize and generalize these elements (which are at various levels of abstraction and may\nbe contradictory). The top-level ontology presented in this article is a step in that direction. Thus, the goal of this article is to show how the problem cited at the beginning of this paragraph can be addressed. This article refers to this ontology or library as “this knowledge criteria/quality ontology” or simply “this (top-level) ontology”. It is currently focused on elements related to Linked Data [2].\nAs with any other ontology, the bigger and more organized it will become, the more useful it will be for the above cited knowledge sharing and retrieval tasks. (For the knowledge operationalization tasks, bigger is no longer better but eases the selection of knowledge for modules of relevant sizes and content for an application; this article and its top-level ontology only address knowledge sharing and retrieval tasks). This ontology is part of a KB published on-line via the WebKB knowledge server (usable at http://www.webkb.org). This KB – and hence the ontology presented in this article – can be cooperatively extended by any Web user via this server. To enable this, WebKB uses an abstract model and editing protocols [29] allowing its KB to be consistent and organized even though knowledge statements come from different sources and hence can contradict each other. Because of space restrictions this model is only quickly introduced in this article (it is not described) but this knowledge quality ontology exploits it and categorizes some of its features.\nThis ontology is only about information objects. Indeed, once information objects can be evaluated, knowledge management tools and techniques can be compared or evaluated with respect to (w.r.t.) the qualities of the information objects that they allow as input and output, or lead their users to produce. Similarly, knowledge providers can be evaluated w.r.t. the information objects they have provided. Thus, unlike the “Semantic Web (SW) Topics Ontology” [10], this ontology does not attempt to semantically organize – i.e., does not attempt to use specialization relations, “part of” relations or other relations to organize – knowledge management tools, techniques or processes (e.g., tools and techniques for knowledge extraction, retrieval, matching, merging, representation, inferencing, validation, edition, annotation, modularization and publishing). This would be a huge task and, as for example illustrated by the “SW Topics Ontology”, these processes are so intertwined that they are difficult to distinguish and organize in a scalable way, i.e., in a systematic and non-arbitrary way within a specialization hierarchy and a part-of hierarchy. Here, “nonarbitrary” implies the use of conceptual distinctions – and especially, partitions – that are clear enough to lead different persons to categorize a same thing at a same place in a specialization/part-of hierarchy (note: a hierarchy does not have to be a tree). Such distinctions and hierarchies significantly reduce implicit redundancies [14].\nThe uppermost conceptual distinction used by this ontology to permit non-arbitrary categorizations of information objects is the clear partition of information objects into either descriptioncontent, description-medium or description-container objects. In this article, description-content objects are conceptual categories, as well as formal/informal terms or statements referring to or defining these categories. They are interpretations or abstractions of a (real or imaginary) situation or object. E.g.: abstract models, ontologies, terminologies, languages and any of their subelements (e.g., the concept/relation types of RDF and OWL). Description-medium objects are concrete model objects permitting to visually/orally/... present description-content objects. E.g.: graphical interface objects and syntax/style objects such as those specified by XML, CSS and XSLT. Descriptioncontainer objects are the other information objects, i.e., nonphysical objects permitting to store and manage descriptioncontent and description-medium objects. E.g.: files, file repositories, distributed databases and file servers.\nThe sections 2, 3 and 4 are respectively about the evaluation of description-content, description-medium and descriptioncontainer objects. These sections relate, organize and generalize knowledge sharing best practices and quality criteria/measures from various sources. Some categories from each of the above referred articles are included in this quality ontology. [17-22] include the most complete lists of high-level categories that seemed to exist so far for Linked Data. All their categories are integrated in the quality ontology. The top-level of this ontology may be seen as validated by the fact it correctly organizes and generalizes all the quality-related categories that the author has found so far (this is a kind of “validation by usage”). On the other hand, this was obvious given the way this ontology was designed. The difficult part was to find this design. This ontology may also be seen as validated by the fact it follows the strongest best practices it categorizes (the ones that include or imply the weaker or more elementary best practices, e.g., the fact that a KB should at least be consistent). In [17-22], elements are only slightly categorized. This is shown by Section 5 which gives the four most organized quality related categorizations that seemed to exist for Linked Data so far. These categorizations are essentially only two levels deep and not always intuitive. Additional conceptual distinctions would be interesting, especially if they are “nonarbitrary” (under this condition, the more categories, the better)."

      "heading" : "2 Description content quality",
      "text" : "This article cannot present the whole “quality ontology”. It can only show its top-level and its principles, i.e., the way this ontology manages to organize the main kinds of methodological elements, best practices, quality characteristics (e.g., evaluation criteria, quality dimensions, the “data quality indicators” of [22], ...) and quality measures (e.g., the “scoring functions” and “assessment metrics” of [22], ...) that have been proposed for knowledge sharing purposes. This article only shows important elements of a subtype hierarchy of quality measuring functions on information objects, with the function result being a value (typically, numerical or boolean). Indeed, all quality related categories and subtype hierarchies can be automatically derived from the above subtype hierarchy. E.g., relations can be derived from boolean functions (Figures 3 includes an example) and, from the above subtype hierarchy, it is\npossible to derive the one for quality characteristics and the one for “statements that have a certain (kind of) quality measure” (alias, “statements that follow a certain (kind of) best practice”).\nThere are many ways to categorize quality evaluations, e.g., according to the kind of objects they evaluate, and whether or not they take into account certain lexical, structural or semantic best practices. Figure 1 shows one intuitive uppermost categorization. In this article, indented lists show subtype hierarchies. In all such indented lists below, the XML namespace shortcut can be used but the prefix “pm:” is left implicit. “LDpattern:” is for [18], “LD:” for [20], “SF:” for [21] and “PD:” for [22-23]. C++/Java-like comments are used. Relation identifiers use nominal expressions and follow the common “graph reading convention”, i.e., the last argument is the destination of the relation. Thus, a binary relation R(X,Y) can be read “<X> has for <R> <Y>” (notes: <X> and <Y> may include quantifiers; furthermore, a relation “X has for subtype Y” may also be read “any instance of Y is also an instance of X”). For functional relations, the last argument is the function result.\nFigure 2 gives subtypes to pm:description_content_quality. Two points explain those subtypes. First, one handy partition for description-content_semantic-quality functions is the distinction between those that give “correctness” values for the evaluated object and those checking that it includes certain things. Second, for each kind of evaluated source object, there are various ways to categorize i) functions that evaluate certain aspects of this kind of objects (e.g., the “correctness” and “conformity” aspects), ii) functions that evaluate “related objects”, and iii) functions that differently aggregate the values returned by these functions. In this article, within the names of the last two kinds of functions, “description” is abbreviated by “descr” in order to make the hierarchy more readable. The adjective “related” refers to actual or potential/allowed relations. E.g., RDF (a description content) allows various kinds of textual or graphical notations (description media) – some being standards, some not – even if most RDF-based tools (description containers) only work with RDF/XML. Some evaluation functions may for example better rate an RDF-based tool that can handle more notations (e.g., by calling external translation tools).\nFigure 3. Important types of functions to evaluate correctness\nFigure 3 gives some specializations for the first subtype of pm:description_content_quality. So far, all current quality measures related to Linked Data seemed to use the whole KB (data set) as implicit argument. They may thus be simpler to call or to understand but this is a loss of generality. Furthermore, most of these measures only work on “frames” (“objects” in objectoriented approaches), i.e, on the set of relations from a term. They do not work on any kind of statement. The hierarchy in Figure 3 shows how different but related evaluation functions and relations can be organized and generalized. Concept types can be derived too. An important one is pm:Statement_consistent_and_nonredundant_with_any_other_one_in_the_KB. Indeed, if a KBMS checks that each statement is of this type before allowing its insertion it into the KB, every statement has a place in the specialization hierarchy of this KB and can thus be automatically compared to other statements. This is enforced by the KB editing/sharing protocols of WebKB.\nFigure 4. Full definition of one of the above functions, in KIF\n[23] and [25] implement some quality measures (for whole RDF-based KBs) via SPARQL queries and SPIN rules. As noted in Figure 3, some of these measures are about consistency. They permit to check some aspects that KB building tools already verify or some complementary aspects. More classic and powerful consistency checking or other quality measurement cannot be done – or would be too complex and long to be done – via SPARQL queries. They require inference engines and definitions in expressive languages such as KIF [5]. The Common Logic ISO standard and its CLIF notation [6] are adaptations of the model and syntax of KIF but without features for specifying meta-statements, definitions and (monotonic or not) inference rules. This is why the data model (alias, meta-ontology) of WebKB is defined in KIF and why some definitions of its quality related ontology are in KIF. As illustrated by Figure 4, the functions referred to in this article are relatively easy to write in KIF. This figure shows the use of “pm%def_fct”, one of the primitive definition operators of the data model of WebKB, fully defined in KIF. These operators also permit to check and handle lexical/namespace and semantic contextualizations in a KB. “%” is used instead of “:” for XMLlike namespace shortcuts because “%” and “#” have other meanings in KIF. “Semantic contextualization” refers to the embedding of a statement within a meta-statement for specifying information without which the statement may be false, e.g., information about the time, place and source of the content of the statement. Every statement must have at least one source (author, source document, etc.). This permits to consider “every assertion that is not a definition” as a belief. This is the main reason the KB can stay consistent while still allowing contradictory beliefs.\nThe KB editing/sharing protocols of WebKB also enforce the statement of relations – such a pm:corrective_refinement – between contradictory beliefs. This avoids implicit partial/total redundancies and permits people or applications to choose between these contradictory beliefs when choices have to be made. Thus, no arbitrary selections has to be made a priori by the KB owners. E.g., a user may specify that “when browsing the KB or within the results of his knowledge extraction queries” he wants to see only the most specialized corrections from certain kinds of sources. Furthermore, WebKB allows “default beliefs” and provides some default beliefs. E.g., a default belief for any user in WebKB is that, among contradictory statements, he believes the ones that correct the others without being contradictory between themselves. Since quality related measures can be specified as definitions or as beliefs, by creating or overriding some defaults beliefs, a user can easily specify which measures he believes in and wants to use, and how they should be combined. For more details on semantic/lexical contextualizations, default beliefs, and how to combine them, see the KIF formalization of the WebKB data model at http://www.webkb.org/kb/it/KSmodel.html\n(pm%def_fct ;;one of the operators for defining term, here a function pm%consistency_ratio_of_such_a_statement_in_this_statement (?s1 ?s2) ;; parameters; “?” is a KIF prefix for variable names; ;;as in all evaluation functions, the first argument ;; is the evaluated object; ?s2 may be a whole KB (div (pm%cardinality ;;size of the set returned by “setofall” (setofall ?s (and (pm%substatement ?s2 ?s) (=> ?s ?s1) (not (=> ?s2 (not ?s))) )))\n(pm%cardinality (pm%substatements ?s2)) )) correctness //of the evaluated object (statement or term // referring to a statement) LD:accuracy //factual correctness of a statement (which // should be a belief) w.r.t. the world consistency //reports all or some inconsistencies and // implicit contradictions consistency_of_this_statement_wrt_this_one (ST,ST -> boolean) //this signature states that this function is boolean // and has exactly 2 statements as arguments; //one relation derivable from this function is:\n// pm:statement_consistent_with_this_one (ST,ST) consistency_and_non-redundancy_of_this_statement_wrt_this_one //signatures are inherited when there is no ambiguity consistency_of_this_KB (ST -> boolean) consistency_of_the_RDF_KB //the KB must be an RDF KB consistency_of_SKOS_relations //the measures of [24] are // subtypes of this type consistency_of_a_RDF_KB_tested_via_a_SPARQL_query // as in [23] and [25] LD:internal_consistency_fct //SF:consistency_fct seems to // be an alias of this type LD:modeling_correctness_fct //tests the correctness of the // “logical structure of the data”; LD and SF do not // precise if these last 2 types are dimensions or // functions; this is why “_fct” is a suffix here; // other relations and dimensions can be derived substatements_of_this_1st_statement_that_are_inconsistent_\\ with_this_2nd_statement (ST,ST -> set) consistency_ratio //no restriction on the arguments but the // result is a number (a ratio)\nconsistency_ratio_of_such_a_statement_in_this_statement (ST,ST -> number) //”such a statement”: the 1st argument consistency_ratio_of_all_substatements_in_this_statement (ST -> number) //contextualized substatements\nconsistency_ratio_of_this_KB (ST -> number) consistency_ratio_of_relations_on_this_term_in_this_statement (term -> number) consistency_ratio_of_this_relation_on_this_term_in_this_statement\n(ST,term -> number) PD:consistency //”number of non-conflicting frames”\n// divided by the “number of frames”\nFigure 5 – and, its continuation, Figure 6 – show subtype relations between types of functions checking that within an object certain elements exist and are conform to a certain pattern. The various subtypes are semantically close. The first listed subtype can be re-used to write the other ones. This subtype hierarchy shows that the “current categorizations for Linked Data quality criteria and measures” (LD, PD, SF, ...) only cover particular cases. Thus, the current implementations of (some of) these measures also only cover particular cases. To save space, there is no repetition of types in this hierarchy (this applies to the next hierarchies too). Some of the types could clearly also appear at other places. The comments give some explanations for each of the types. The ones in bold and/or italics are the most important for categorization or re-use purposes."

      "heading" : "3 Description medium quality",
      "text" : "Description-medium quality functions evaluate the textual/graphic/... presentation that some (kinds of) descriptionmedium objects permit for some (kinds of) description content objects in some (kinds of) description containers. The more the “presentation is distinguished from content” and the more structured (fine-grained) the content, the more the presentation can be finely adapted for different kinds of users and by the end-users. To that end, the W3C advocates the use of XML-based languages (e.g., RDF/XML) as well as CSS, XSLT and GRDDL. This last language indicates which XSLT scripts can be used to translate some knowledge published in some XML-based KRLs into other knowledge representation languages (KRLs). Fresnel [28] may be seen as a kind of advanced CSS for RDF-based KRLs.\nPresentation evaluation functions may for example give high values to graphical/textual/audio/... interfaces composed of finegrained objects with “rich contextual menus”. For each object, such menus would list i) presentation attributes/commands for this object, and ii) semantic relations/commands from/to/about this object to ease navigation, querying or updates. Although a syntax is clearly a presentation object, neither XML nor any current KRL seem to allow people to adapt their syntaxes, e.g., via the setting of some variables or the use of a notation ontology. Yet, this approach would be more flexible and easier to use than GRDDL, and hence can be used as one criteria by description-medium quality evaluating functions. Figure 7 gives a top-level specialization hierarchy for such functions. The general comments on the previous hierarchies also apply here: conventions, abbreviations, rationale for the specialization relations, etc."

Compared to the independent and direct use of static files (e.g., RDF files), the use of knowledge servers eases knowledge modeling and reduces the implicit inconsistencies and redundancies between their knowledge statements. A KB server can also use static input/output files and offers much more flexibility than static files. It can also provide more services than those of a description-container (e.g., it can forward queries). This can be taken into account for evaluating its quality.

The first two sources are about quality criteria, the last two are about best practices. Their categories – the ones shown below – seem to be concept types.

      "heading" : "6 Conclusions",
      "text" : "This article has presented the top-level of an ontology organizing knowledge sharing best practices, design patterns, evaluation criteria and evaluation measures in a systematic, nonredundant and scalable way (e.g., by being based on distinctions on information objects rather than on processes). Some other research works on this subject mainly proposed lists of categories with, sometimes, some implementations (e.g., via SPARQL). The integration of these categories into this quality ontology shows that the results of these works cover only particular cases, which could sometimes be easily generalized. This ontology also permits to have a more synthetic view of the kinds of things that could or should be evaluated or done during knowledge sharing, or proposed by knowledge engineering tools. This ontology can be extended by Web users via the server which hosts it [29]. It could then be used as an index for elements of other libraries or ontologies. To that end, the bigger it will become, the more useful it will be. The presented ontology is, in some senses, validated by the fact it includes – or can be specialized to include – any quality related measures or criteria that the author has come across and by the fact it follows the strongest best practices it categorizes. Such an ontology is clearly application-independent. No particular use case would further validate it.\nSection 2 also quickly introduced the data model of WebKB which enables i) loss integration of knowledge from various sources, and ii) the use of “default beliefs/rules/measures” to allow the combination of simple evaluation functions into complex ones and the re-use of other agents' functions. The fact that knowledge on the Semantic Web is full of implicit contradictions and redundancies, very hard to evaluate, and often incorrect even with respect to the OWL primitives that it re-uses [27], may be an indication that KBMS developers and knowledge providers to the Semantic Web would benefit from such a data model and such an ontology of best practices and quality measures."

Since they permit to evaluate information objects and create better ones, these elements also permit knowledgebased tools and techniques – as well as knowledge providers – to be evaluated and categorized based on their input/output information objects.

Various structural, ontological, syntactical and lexical distinctions are then used.",
