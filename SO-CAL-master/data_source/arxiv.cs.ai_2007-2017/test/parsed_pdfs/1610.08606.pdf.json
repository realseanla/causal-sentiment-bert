INTRODUCTION\nSparse representations have emerged as a powerful tool for a range of signal processing applications. Applications include compressed sensing [1], signal denoising, sparse signal recovery [2], image inpainting [3], image segmentation [4], and more recently, signal classification. In such representations, most of signals can be expressed by a linear combination of few bases taken from a “dictionary”. Based on this theory, a sparse representation-based classifier (SRC) [5] was initially developed for robust face recognition. Thereafter, SRC was adapted to numerous signal/image classification problems, ranging from medical image classification [6]–[8], hyperspectral image classification [9]–[11], synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification [12], recaptured image recognition [13], video anomaly detection [14], and several others [15]–[20].\nThe authors are with the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA (e-mail: thv102@psu.edu).\nThis work has been supported partially by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) under Grant 0401531 UP719Z0 and NSF CAREER award to (V.M.).\nThe central idea in SRC is to represent a test sample (e.g. a face) as a linear combination of samples from the available training set. Sparsity manifests because most of non-zeros correspond to bases whose memberships are the same as the test sample. Therefore, in the ideal case, each object is expected to lie in its own class subspace and all class subspaces are non-overlapping. Concretely, given C classes and a dictionary D = [D1, . . . ,DC ] with Dc comprising training samples from class c, c = 1, . . . , C, a new sample y from class c can be represented as y ≈ Dcxc. Therefore, if we express y using the dictionary D : y ≈ Dx = D1x1 + · · ·+ Dcx\nc+ · · ·+DCxC , then most of active elements of x should be located in xc and hence, the coefficient vector x is expected to be sparse. In matrix form, let Y = [Y1, . . . ,Yc, . . . ,YC ] be the set of all samples where Yc comprises those in class c, the coefficient matrix X would be sparse. In the ideal case, X is block diagonal (see Figure 1).\nIt has been shown that learning a dictionary from the training samples instead of using all of them as a dictionary can further enhance the performance of SRC. Most existing classification-oriented dictionary learning methods try to learn discriminative class-specific dictionaries by either imposing block-diagonal constraints on X or encouraging the incoherence between class-specific dictionaries. Based on the K-SVD [3] model for general sparse representations, Discriminative K-SVD (D-KSVD) [21] and Label-Consistent K-SVD (LC-KSVD) [22], [23] learn the discriminative dictionaries by encouraging a projection of sparse codes X to be close to a sparse matrix with all non-zeros being one while satisfying a block diagonal structure as in Figure 1. Vu et al. [6], [7] with DFDL and Yang et al. [24], [25] with FDDL apply Fisher-based ideas on dictionaries and sparse coefficients, respectively. Recently, Li et al. [26] with D2L2R2 combined the Fisher-based idea and introduced a low-rank constraint on each sub-dictionary. They claim that such a model would reduce the negative effect of noise contained in training samples.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n08 60\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n7 O\nct 2\n01 6"

      "text" : "The assumption made by most discriminative dictionary learning methods, i.e. non-overlapping subspaces, is unrealistic in practice. Often objects from different classes share some common features, e.g. background in scene classification. This problem has been partially addressed by recent efforts, namely DLSI [27], COPAR [28] and CSDL [29]. However, DLSI does not explicitly learn shared features since they are still hidden in the sub-dictionaries. COPAR and CSDL explicitly learn a shared dictionary D0 but suffer from the following drawbacks. First, we contend that the subspace spanned by columns of the shared dictionary must have low rank. Otherwise, class-specific features may also get represented by the shared dictionary. In the worst case, the shared dictionary span may include all classes, greatly diminishing the classification ability. Second, the coefficients (in each column of the sparse coefficient matrix) corresponding to the shared dictionary should be similar. This implies that features are shared between training samples from different classes via the “shared dictionary”. In this paper, we develop a new low-rank shared dictionary learning framework (LRSDL) which satisfies the aforementioned properties. Our framework is basically a generalized version of the well-known FDDL [24], [25] with the additional capability of capturing shared features, resulting in better performance. We also show practical merits of enforcing these constraints are significant.\nThe typical strategy in optimizing general dictionary learning problems is to alternatively solve their subproblems where sparse coefficients X are found while fixing dictionary D or vice versa. In discriminative dictionary learning models, both X and D matrices furthermore comprise of several small classspecific blocks constrained by complicated structures, usually resulting in high computational complexity. Traditionally, X, and D are solved block-by-block until convergence. Particularly, each block Xc (or Dc in dictionary update ) is solved by again fixing all other blocks Xi, i 6= c (or Di, i 6= c). Although this greedy process leads to a simple algorithm, it not only produces inaccurate solutions but also requires huge computation. In this paper, we aim to mitigate these drawbacks by proposing efficient and accurate algorithms which allows to directly solve X and D in two fundamental discriminative dictionary learning methods: FDDL [25] and DLSI [27]. These algorithms can also be applied to speed-up our proposed LRSDL, COPAR [28], D2L2R2 [26] and other related works."

      "text" : "The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n1) A new low-rank shared dictionary learning framework1 (LRSDL) for automatically extracting both discriminative and shared bases in several widely used image datasets is presented to enhance the classification performance of dictionary learning methods. Our framework simultaneously learns each class-dictionary\n1The preliminary version of this work was presented in IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, 2016 [30].\nper class to extract discriminative features and the shared features that all classes contain. For the shared part, we impose two intuitive constraints. First, the shared dictionary must have a low-rank structure. Otherwise, the shared dictionary may also expand to contain discriminative features. Second, we contend that the sparse coefficients corresponding to the shared dictionary should be almost similar. In other words, the contribution of the shared dictionary to reconstruct every signal should be close together. We will experimentally show that both of these constraints are crucial for the shared dictionary. 2) New accurate and efficient algorithms for selected existing and proposed dictionary learning methods. We present three effective algorithms for dictionary learning: i) sparse coefficient update in FDDL [25] by using FISTA [31]. We address the main challenge in this algorithm – how to calculate the gradient of a complicated function effectively – by introducing a new simple function M(•) on block matrices and a lemma to support the result. ii) Dictionary update in FDDL [25] by a simple ODL [32] procedure using M(•) and another lemma. Because it is an extension of FDDL, the proposed LRSDL also benefits from the aforementioned efficient procedures. iii) Dictionary update in DLSI [27] by a simple ADMM [33] procedure which requires only one matrix inversion instead of several matrix inversions as originally proposed in [27]. We subsequently show the proposed algorithms have both performance and computational benefits. 3) Complexity analysis. We derive the computational complexity of numerous dictionary learning methods in terms of approximate number of operations (multiplications) needed. We also report complexities and experimental running time of aforementioned efficient algorithms and their original counterparts. 4) Reproducibility. Numerous sparse coding and dictionary learning algorithms in the manuscript are reproducible via a user-friendly toolbox. The toolbox includes implementations of SRC [5], ODL [32], LC-KSVD [23]2, efficient DLSI [27], efficient COPAR [28], efficient FDDL [25], D2L2R2 [26] and the proposed LRSDL. The toolbox (a MATLAB version and a Python version) is provided3 with the hope of usage in future research and comparisons via peer researchers.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents our proposed dictionary learning framework, the efficient algorithms for its subproblems and one efficient procedure for updating dictionaries in DLSI and COPAR. The complexity analysis of several well-known dictionary learning methods are included in Section III. In Section IV, we show classification accuracies of LRSDL on widely used datasets in comparisons with existing methods in the literature to reveal merits of the proposed LRSDL. Section V concludes the paper.\n2Source code for LC-KSVD is directly taken from the paper at: http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/ zhuolin/projectlcksvd.html.\n3The toolbox can be downloaded at: http://signal.ee.psu.edu/lrsdl.html."

Let D = [ D D0 ] be the total dictionary, X = [XT , (X0)T ]T and Xc = [(Xc)T , (X0c) T ]T . For every dictionary learning problem, we implicitly constrain each basis to have its Euclidean norm no greater than 1. These variables are visualized in Figure 2a).\nLet m,m0, and mc be the mean of X,X0, and Xc columns, respectively. Let Mc = [mc, . . . ,mc] ∈ RK×nc ,M0 = [m0, . . . ,m0] ∈ Rk0×N , and M = [m, . . . ,m] be the mean matrices.

Concretely, C = 100, n = 20, k = 10, q = 50, d = 500. We also assume that in (50), q2 = 50. Table I shows that all three proposed efficient algorithms require less computation than original versions with most significant improvements for speeding up DLSI-D. Table II demonstrates an interesting fact. LRSDL is the least expensive computationally when compared with other original dictionary learning algorithms, and only E-FDDL has lower complexity, which is to be expected since the FDDL cost function is a special case of the LRSDL cost function.

      "text" : "We present the experimental results of applying these methods to five diverse datasets: the Extended YaleB face dataset [36], the AR face dataset [37], the AR gender dataset, the Oxford Flower dataset [38], and one multi-class object category dataset – the Caltech 101 [39]. Example images from these datasets are shown in Figure 3. We compare our results with those using SRC [5] and other state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods: LC-KSVD [23], DLSI [27], FDDL [25], COPAR [28], and D2L2R2 [26]. Regularization parameters in all methods are chosen using cross-validation [40].\nFor two face datasets, feature descriptors are random faces, which are made by projecting a face image onto a random vector using a random projection matrix. As in [21], the dimension of a random-face feature in the Extended YaleB is d = 504, while the dimension in AR face is d = 540. Samples of these two datasets are shown in Figure 3a) and b).\nFor the AR gender dataset, we first choose a non-occluded subset (14 images per person) from the AR face dataset, which consists of 50 males and 50 females, to conduct experiment of gender classification. Training images are taken from the first 25 males and 25 females, while test images comprises all samples from the remaining 25 males and 25 females. PCA was used to reduce the dimension of each image to 300. Samples of this dataset are shown in Figure 3c).\nThe Oxford Flower dataset is a collection of images of flowers drawn from 17 species with 80 images per class, totaling 1360 images. For feature extraction, based on the impressive results presented in [25], we choose the Frequent Local Histogram feature extractor [41] to obtain feature vectors of dimension 10,000. The test set consists of 20 images per class, the remaining 60 images per class are used for training. Samples of this dataset are shown in Figure 3d).\nFor the Caltech 101 dataset, we use a dense SIFT (DSIFT)\ndescriptor. The DSIFT descriptor is extracted from 25 × 25 patch which is densely sampled on a dense grid with 8 pixels. We then extract the sparse coding spatial pyramid matching (ScSPM) feature [42], which is the concatenation of vectors pooled from words of the extracted DSIFT descriptor. Dimension of words is 1024 and max pooling technique is used with pooling grid of 1×1, 2×2, and 4×4. With this setup, the dimension of ScSPM feature is 21,504; this is followed by dimension reduction to d = 3000 using PCA. Samples of this dataset are shown in Figure 3e).\nB. Validation of efficient algorithms\nTo evaluate the improvement of three efficient algorithms proposed in section II, we apply these efficient algorithms and their original versions on training samples from the AR face dataset to verify the convergence speed of those algorithms. In this example, number of classes C = 100, the randomface feature dimension d = 300, number of training samples per class nc = n = 7, number of atoms in each particular dictionary kc = 7.\n1) E-FDDL-D and E-FDDL-X: Figure 4 shows the cost functions and running time after each of 100 iterations of 4 different versions of FDDL: the original FDDL (O-FDDL), combination of O-FDDL-X and E-FDDL-D, combination of E-FDDL-X and O-FDDL-D, and the efficient FDDL (EFDDL). The first observation is that O-FDDL converges quickly to a suboptimal solution, which is far from the best cost obtained by E-FDDL. In addition, while O-FDDL requires more than 12,000 seconds (around 3 hours and 20 minutes) to run 100 iterations, it takes E-FDDL only half an hour to do\nthe same task.\n2) E-DLSI-D and E-COPAR-D: Figure 5 and 6 compare convergence rates of DLSI and COPAR algorithms. As we can see, while the cost function value improves slightly, the run time of efficient algorithms reduces significantly. Based on benefits in both cost function value and computation, in the rest of this paper, we use efficient optimization algorithms instead of original versions for obtaining classification results.\nC. Visualization of learned shared bases\nTo demonstrate the behavior of dictionary learning methods on a dataset in the presence of shared features, we create a toy example in Figure 7. This is a classification problem with 4 classes whose basic class-specific elements and shared elements are visualized in Figure 7a). Each basis element has dimension 20 pixel ×20 pixel. From these elements, we generate 1000 samples per class by linearly combining class-specific elements and shared elements followed by noise added; 200 samples per class are used for training, 800 remaining images are used for testing. Samples of each class are shown in Figure 7b).\nFigure 7c) show sample learned bases using DLSI [27] where shared features are still hidden in class-specific bases. In LCKSVD bases (Figure 7e) and f)), shared features (the squared in the middle of a patch) are found but they are classified as bases of class 1 or class 2, diminishing classification accuracy since most of test samples are classified as class 1 or 2. The same phenomenon happens in FDDL bases (Figure 7g)).\nThe best classification results happen in two shared dictionary learnings (COPAR in Figure 7d) and the proposed LRSDL in Figure 7h)) where the shared bases are extracted and gathered in the shared dictionary. However, in COPAR, shared features still appear in class-specific dictionaries and the shared dictionary also includes features of class 1 and 2. In LRSDL, class-specific elements and shared elements are nearly perfectly decomposed into appropriate sub dictionaries. The reason behind this phenomenon is the low-rank constraint on the shared dictionary of LRSDL. Thanks to this constraint, LRSDL produces perfect results on this simulated data."

      "text" : "We perform an experiment to study the effect of the shared dictionary size on the overall classification results of two dictionary methods: COPAR [28] and LRSDL in the AR gender dataset. In this experiment, 40 images of each class are used for training. The number of shared dictionary bases varies from 10 to 80. In LRSDL, because there is a regularization parameter η which is attached to the low-rank term (see equation (6)), we further consider three values of η: η = 0, i.e. no low-rank constraint, η = 0.01 and η = 0.1 for two different degrees of emphasis. Results are shown in Figure 8.\nWe observe that the performance of COPAR heavily depends on the choice of k0 and its results worsen as the size of the shared dictionary increases. The reason is that when k0 is large, COPAR tends to absorb class-specific features into the shared dictionary. This trend is not associated with LRSDL\neven when the low-rank constraint is ignored (η = 0), because LRSDL has another constraint (‖X0 −M0‖2F small) which forces the coefficients corresponding to the shared dictionary to be similar. Additionally, when we increase η, the overall classification of LRSDL also gets better. These observations confirm that our two proposed constraints on the shared dictionary are important, and the LRSDL exhibits robustness to parameter choices."

      "heading" : "V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "In this paper, our primary contribution is the development of a discriminative dictionary learning framework via the introduction of a shared dictionary with two crucial constraints. First, the shared dictionary is constrained to be low-rank. Second, the sparse coefficients corresponding to the shared dictionary obey a similarity constraint. In conjunction with discriminative model as proposed in [24], [25], this leads to a more flexible model where shared features are excluded before doing classification. An important benefit of this model is the robustness of the framework to size (k0) and the regularization parameter (η) of the shared dictionary. In comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms developed specifically for these tasks, our LRSDL approach offers better classification performance on average.\nIn Section II-D and II-E, we discuss the efficient algorithms for FDDL [25], DLSI [27], then flexibly apply them into more sophisticated models. Thereafter in Section III and IV-B, we both theoretically and practically show that the proposed algorithms indeed significantly improve cost functions and run time speeds of different dictionary learning algorithms. The complexity analysis also shows that the proposed LRSDL requires less computation than competing models.\nAs proposed, the LRSDL model learns a dictionary shared by every class. In some practical problems, a feature may belong to more than one but not all classes. Very recently, researchers have begun to address this issue [43], [44]. In future work, we will investigate the design of hierarchical models for extracting common features among classes.\nAPPENDIX"

This observation has been exploited partially in a recently proposed dictionary learning framework by separating the particularity and the commonality (COPAR). Inspired by this, we propose a novel method to explicitly and simultaneously learn a set of common patterns as well as class-specific features for classification with more intuitive constraints. Our dictionary learning framework is hence characterized by both a shared dictionary and particular (class-specific) dictionaries. For the shared dictionary, we enforce a low-rank constraint, i.e. claim that its spanning subspace should have low dimension and the coefficients corresponding to this dictionary should be similar. For the particular dictionaries, we impose on them the well-known constraints stated in the Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL). Further, we develop new fast and accurate algorithms to solve the subproblems in the learning step, accelerating its convergence. The said algorithms could also be applied to FDDL and its extensions. The efficiencies of these algorithms are theoretically and experimentally verified by comparing their complexities and running time with those of other well-known dictionary learning methods. Experimental results on widely used image datasets establish the advantages of our method over state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods.",
