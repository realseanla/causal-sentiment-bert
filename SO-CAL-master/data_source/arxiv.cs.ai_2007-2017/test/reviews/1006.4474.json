Originally sTeX had been created as an invasive, semantic frontend for authoring XML documents. Here, we used sTeX in a Software Engineering case study as a formalization tool. In order to deal with modular pre-semantic vocabularies and relations, we upgraded it to sTeX+ in a participatory design process. We present a tool chain that starts with an sTeX+ editor and ultimately serves the generated documents as XHTML+RDFa Linked Data via an OMDoc-enabled, versioned XML database. In the final output, all structural annotations are preserved in order to enable semantic information retrieval services.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 11:27:19 GMT  (484kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4474v1", "I-SEMANTICS 2010, September 1-3, 2010, Graz, Austria"]], "COMMENTS": "I-SEMANTICS 2010, September 1-3, 2010, Graz, Austria", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI", "authors": ["andrea kohlhase", "michael kohlhase", "christoph lange"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.4474"}
