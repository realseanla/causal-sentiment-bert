Initially, the shadow free images are obtained by background modelling followed by foreground modeling to extract the blobs of our object of interest. Subsequently, we train a cubic SVM with human body datasets in accordance with our domain of interest for recognition and tracking. During training, using the principle of Bag of Words we extract necessary features of certain domains and objects for classification. Subsequently, matching these feature sets with those of the extracted object blobs that are obtained by subtracting the shadow free background from the foreground, we detect successfully our object of interest from the test domain. The performance of the classification by cubic SVM is satisfactorily represented by confusion matrix and ROC curve reflecting the accuracy of each module. After classification, our object of interest is tracked in the test domain using species inspired PSO. By combining the adaptive learning tools with the efficient classification of description, we achieve optimum accuracy in recognition of the moving objects. We evaluate our algorithm benchmark datasets: iLIDS, VIVID, Walking2, Woman. Comparative analysis of our algorithm against the existing state-of-the-art trackers shows very satisfactory and competitive results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 11:09:10 GMT  (1572kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05224v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["kumar s ray", "anit chakraborty", "sayandip dutta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1707.05224"}
