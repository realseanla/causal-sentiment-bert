Despite the use of logical formulas, Markov logic networks (MLNs) can be difficult to interpret, due to the often counter-intuitive meaning of their weights. To address this issue, we propose a method to construct a possibilistic logic theory that exactly captures what can be derived from a given MLN using maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference. Unfortunately, the size of this theory is exponential in general. We therefore also propose two methods which can derive compact theories that still capture MAP inference, but only for specific types of evidence. These theories can be used, among others, to make explicit the hidden assumptions underlying an MLN or to explain the predictions it makes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 23:20:28 GMT  (26kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01432v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 19:58:03 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01432v2", "Extended version of a paper appearing in UAI 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["ondrej kuzelka", "jesse davis", "steven schockaert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01432"}
