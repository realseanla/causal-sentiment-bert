A hopefully comprehensive set of principles that clarifies what it means for a formal logic to do plausible reasoning is presented. A new propositional logic, called Propositional Plausible Logic (PPL), is defined and applied to some important examples. PPL is the only non-numeric non-monotonic logic we know of that satisfies all the principles and correctly reasons with all the examples. Some important results about PPL are proved.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 00:53:04 GMT  (65kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01697v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 23:42:12 GMT  (65kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01697v2", "58 pages.
