However, this theory only applies to simple directed graphical models. We introduce relational d-separation, a theory for deriving conditional independence in relational models. We provide a sound, complete, and computationally efficient method for relational d-separation, and we present empirical results that demonstrate effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jun 2012 18:23:56 GMT  (753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3536v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 18:21:10 GMT  (753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3536v2", "acknowledgments added"], ["v3", "Mon, 15 Apr 2013 13:42:19 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3536v3", "This paper has been revised and expanded.
