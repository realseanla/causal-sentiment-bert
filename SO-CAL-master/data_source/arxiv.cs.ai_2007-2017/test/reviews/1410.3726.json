Variation in decisions is a norm in this situation when the same problem is posed to different subjects. Psychological and metaphysical research had proven that decision making by human is subjective. It is influenced by many factors such as experience, age, background, etc. Scene understanding is one of the computer vision problems that fall into this category. Conventional methods relax this problem by assuming scene images are mutually exclusive; and therefore, focus on developing different approaches to perform the binary classification tasks. In this paper, we show that scene images are non-mutually exclusive, and propose the Fuzzy Qualitative Rank Classifier (FQRC) to tackle the aforementioned problems. The proposed FQRC provides a ranking interpretation instead of binary decision. Evaluations in term of qualitative and quantitative using large numbers and challenging public scene datasets have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method in modeling the non-mutually exclusive scene images.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Oct 2014 15:19:43 GMT  (2896kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3726v1", "Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["chern hong lim", "anhar risnumawan", "chee seng chan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.3726"}
