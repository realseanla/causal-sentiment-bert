The delivery of information in such multi-agent systems is typically implemented through routing protocols that determine how information flows through the network. Different routing protocols exist each with its own benefits, but it is generally unclear which properties can be successfully combined within a given algorithm. We approach this problem from the axiomatic point of view, i.e., we try to establish what are the properties we would seek to see in such a system, and examine the different properties which uniquely define common routing algorithms used today.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:32:22 GMT  (1567kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07523v1", "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings TARK 2015,arXiv:1606.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.NI cs.SI", "authors": ["omer lev", "moshe tennenholtz", "aviv zohar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07523"}
