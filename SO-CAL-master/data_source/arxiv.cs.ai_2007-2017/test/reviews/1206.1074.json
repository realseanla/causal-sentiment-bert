On the other hand, artificial bees colony (ABC) algorithms demonstrate good performances when solving continuous and combinatorial optimization problems. This study tries to use these technologies under the same roof. As a result, a memetic ABC (MABC) algorithm has been developed that is hybridized with two local search heuristics: the Nelder-Mead algorithm (NMA) and the random walk with direction exploitation (RWDE). The former is attended more towards exploration, while the latter more towards exploitation of the search space. The stochastic adaptation rule was employed in order to control the balancing between exploration and exploitation. This MABC algorithm was applied to a Special suite on Large Scale Continuous Global Optimization at the 2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. The obtained results the MABC are comparable with the results of DECC-G, DECC-G*, and MLCC.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jun 2012 21:04:10 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1074v1", "CONFERENCE: IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, Brisbane, Australia, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "CONFERENCE: IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation, Brisbane, Australia, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["iztok fister", "iztok fister jr", "janez brest", "viljem \\v{z}umer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1074"}
