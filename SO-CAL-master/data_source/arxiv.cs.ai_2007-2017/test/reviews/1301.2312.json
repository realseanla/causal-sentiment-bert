We analyze the classes of structures that are equivalent relative to a stream of distributions produced by local changes, and devise algorithms that output graphical representations of these equivalence classes. We present experimental results, using simulated data, and examine the errors associated with detection of changes and recovery of structures.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:39 GMT  (1372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2312v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jin tian", "judea pearl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2312"}
