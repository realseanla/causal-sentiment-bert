In particular, we show that many global constraints which are intractable to propagate completely have natural parameters which make them fixed-parameter tractable and which are easy to compute. This tractability tends either to be the result of a simple dynamic program or of a decomposition which has a strong backdoor of bounded size. This strong backdoor is often a cycle cutset. We also show that parameterized complexity can be used to study other aspects of constraint programming like symmetry breaking. For instance, we prove that value symmetry is fixed-parameter tractable to break in the number of symmetries. Finally, we argue that parameterized complexity can be used to derive results about the approximability of constraint propagation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Mar 2009 08:44:47 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0467v1", "Proceedings of the Twenty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the Twenty-Third AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["christian bessiere", "emmanuel hebrard", "brahim hnich", "zeynep kiziltan", "claude-guy quimper", "toby walsh"], "accepted": true, "id": "0903.0467"}
