This paper proposes a solution to this problem as a multi-agent system modeled according to the Vowel approach and using the Q-learning algorithm to optimize its choice. An implementation is given to test and validate this method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 23 Nov 2013 21:25:13 GMT  (688kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6054v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["issam qaffou", "mohamed sadgal", "abdelaziz elfazziki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.6054"}
