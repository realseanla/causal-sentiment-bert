Epistemic Specifications, which adds modal operators K and M to the language of ASP, is one such extension. We call a program in this language an epistemic logic program (ELP). Solvers have thus far been practical for only the simplest ELPs due to exponential growth of the memory required. We describe a solver that is able to solve harder problems better (without exponentially-growing memory needs w.r.t. K and M occurrences) and faster than any other known ELP solver.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 18:18:08 GMT  (332kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06910v1", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 16:25:52 GMT  (332kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06910v2", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick thor kahl", "anthony p leclerc", "tran cao son"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06910"}
