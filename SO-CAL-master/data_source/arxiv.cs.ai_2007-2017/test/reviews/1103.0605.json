The proposed approach is applicable to a wide class of models including multinomial and Gaussian types. The connection derives a number of new theoretical results on LBP and BFE. This paper focuses two of such topics. One is the analysis of the region where the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive definite, which derives the non-convexity of BFE for graphs with multiple cycles, and a condition of convexity on a restricted set. This analysis also gives a new condition for the uniqueness of the LBP fixed point. The other result is to clarify the relation between the local stability of a fixed point of LBP and local minima of the BFE, which implies, for example, that a locally stable fixed point of the Gaussian LBP is a local minimum of the Gaussian Bethe free energy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 04:40:19 GMT  (476kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0605v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM", "authors": ["yusuke watanabe", "kenji fukumizu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.0605"}
