We consider an intermediate alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conflicts are unlikely and if conflicts do arise a conflict-resolution protocol is invoked. We view this \"optimistic concurrency control\" paradigm as particularly appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 17:07:58 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8049v1", "25 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "25 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC", "authors": ["xinghao pan", "joseph e gonzalez", "stefanie jegelka", "tamara broderick", "michael i jordan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.8049"}
