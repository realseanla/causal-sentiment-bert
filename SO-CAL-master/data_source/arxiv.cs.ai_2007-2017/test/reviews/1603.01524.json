In this work, we model an extreme case of incomplete information, which we term games with type ambiguity, where a participant lacks even information enabling him to form a belief on the preferences of others. Under type ambiguity, one cannot analyze the scenario using the commonly used Bayesian framework, and therefore he needs to model the participants using a different decision model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 16:29:02 GMT  (36kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01524v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 19:00:58 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01524v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 18:51:47 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01524v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["ilan nehama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01524"}
