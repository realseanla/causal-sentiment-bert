This work uses an freely available data set of traffic accident records that took place in the city of Porto Alegre/RS (Brazil) during the year of 2013. This study also provides an analysis of the most important attributes of a traffic accident that could produce an outcome of injury to the people involved in the accident.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 1 Feb 2015 12:57:40 GMT  (1443kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00245v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["christian s perone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.00245"}
