This prospect is a real concern e.g. in an industrial setting, where users typically expect consistent performance. To overcome this problem, we propose a framework that allows learning and using domain-specific heuristics in solvers based on the DPLL procedure. The learning is done off-line, on representative instances from the target domain, and the learned heuristics are then used for choice-point selection. In this paper we focus on Answer Set Programming (ASP) solvers. In our experiments, the introduction of domain-specific heuristics improved performance on hard instances by up to 3 orders of magnitude (and 2 on average), nearly completely eliminating the cases in which the solver had to be terminated because the wait for an answer had become unacceptable.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 14:21:57 GMT  (93kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2125v1", "Presented at the ASPOCP10 workshop of ICLP10"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the ASPOCP10 workshop of ICLP10", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["marcello balduccini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2125"}
