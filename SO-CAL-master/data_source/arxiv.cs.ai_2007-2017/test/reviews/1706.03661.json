The framework, based on a biologically-grounded theory of the brain and mind, integrates a reactive interaction engine, a number of state-of-the art perceptual and motor learning algorithms, as well as planning abilities and an autobiographical memory. The architecture as a whole drives the robot behavior to solve the symbol grounding problem, acquire language capabilities, execute goal-oriented behavior, and express a verbal narrative of its own experience in the world. We validate our approach in a human-robot interaction experiment with the iCub humanoid robot, showing that the proposed cognitive architecture can be applied in real time within a realistic scenario.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 14:39:43 GMT  (6780kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03661v1", "In revision in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems"], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 22:22:15 GMT  (3899kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03661v2", "Preprint version; final version available atthis http URLIEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (Accepted) DOI: 10.1109/TCDS.2017.2754143"]], "COMMENTS": "In revision in IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["cl\\'ement moulin-frier", "tobias fischer", "maxime petit", "gr\\'egoire pointeau", "jordi-ysard puigbo", "ugo pattacini", "sock ching low", "daniel camilleri", "phuong nguyen", "matej hoffmann", "hyung jin chang", "martina zambelli", "anne-laure mealier", "reas damianou", "giorgio metta", "tony j prescott", "yiannis demiris", "peter ford dominey", "paul f m j verschure"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03661"}
