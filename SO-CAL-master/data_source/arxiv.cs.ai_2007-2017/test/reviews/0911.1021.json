We show that while individually learned models can be shown to improve the playing performance of the computer, their straightforward composition results in diluting what was earlier learned. This observation suggests that interaction cannot be easily distributed when one hopes to harness multiple human experts to develop a quality computer player. This is related to similar approaches in robot task learning and to classic approaches to human learning and reinforces the need to develop tools that facilitate the mix of human-based tuition and computer self-learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Nov 2009 12:58:46 GMT  (193kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.1021v1", "15 pages, 1 figure, 13 tables, submitted to a journal"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 1 figure, 13 tables, submitted to a journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["dimitris kalles", "ilias fykouras"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.1021"}
