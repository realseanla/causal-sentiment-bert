It has been recently shown that reasoning in most FDLs using truth values from the interval [0,1] becomes undecidable in the presence of a negation constructor and general concept inclusion axioms. One exception to this negative result are FDLs whose semantics is based on the infinitely valued G\\\"odel t-norm (G). In this paper, we extend previous decidability results for G-IALC to deal also with qualified number restrictions. Our novel approach is based on a combination of the known crispification technique for finitely valued FDLs and the automata-based procedure originally developed for reasoning in G-IALC. The proposed approach combines the advantages of these two methods, while removing their respective drawbacks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 14:18:09 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08761v1", "Workshop on Weighted Logics for Artificial Intelligence, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Workshop on Weighted Logics for Artificial Intelligence, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["stefan borgwardt", "rafael pe\\~naloza"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08761"}
