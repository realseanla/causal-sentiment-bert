The basic question in Quasi-Bayesian networks is, How can irrelevance/independence relations in Quasi-Bayesian networks be detected, enforced and exploited? This paper addresses these questions through Walley's definitions of irrelevance and independence. Novel algorithms and results are presented for inferences with the so-called natural extensions using fractional linear programming, and the properties of the so-called type-1 extensions are clarified through a new generalization of d-separation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:03:11 GMT  (286kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7368v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fabio gagliardi cozman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7368"}
