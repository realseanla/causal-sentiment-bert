This work proposes a model which decides the strategy that should be applied regarding a particular opponent team. This task can be realized by applying preliminary a learning phase where the model determines the most effective strategies against clusters of opponent teams. The model determines the best strategies by using sequential Bayes' estimators. As a first trial of the system, the proposed model is used to determine the association of player formations against opponent teams in the particular situation of corner-kick. The implemented model shows satisfying abilities to compare player formations that are similar to each other in terms of performance and determines the right ranking even by running a decent number of simulation games.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 09:31:13 GMT  (2350kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01015v1", "12 pages, 7 figures, RoboCup Symposium 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 7 figures, RoboCup Symposium 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jordan henrio", "thomas henn", "tomoharu nakashima", "hidehisa akiyama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01015"}
