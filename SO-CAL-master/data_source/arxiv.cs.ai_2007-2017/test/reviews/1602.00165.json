HEALER's sequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth) choose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread, while reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work presents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants, they do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale up to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of intervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an expensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions: (i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it using a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world sizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and updates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER constructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook application. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER solves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is currently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 21:59:27 GMT  (3663kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00165v1", "This is an extended version of our AAMAS 2016 paper (with the same name) with full proofs of all our theorems included"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version of our AAMAS 2016 paper (with the same name) with full proofs of all our theorems included", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["amulya yadav", "hau chan", "albert jiang", "haifeng xu", "eric rice", "milind tambe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00165"}
