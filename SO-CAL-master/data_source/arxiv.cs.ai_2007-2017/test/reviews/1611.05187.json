In dial-a-ride problems patients need to be transported from pre-specified pickup locations to pre-specified delivery locations, under different considerations. The addressed problem presents several constraints and features, such as heterogeneous vehicles, distributed in different depots, and heterogeneous patients. The aim is of minimizing the total routing cost, while respecting time-window, ride-time, capacity and route duration constraints. The objective of the study is of determining the best algorithm configuration in terms of initial solution, neighborhood and local search procedures. At this aim, two different procedures for the computation of an initial solution, six different type of neighborhoods and five local search procedures, where only intra-route changes are made, have been considered and compared.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 09:05:54 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05187v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DM cs.AI", "authors": ["paolo detti", "garazi zabalo manrique de lara"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05187"}
