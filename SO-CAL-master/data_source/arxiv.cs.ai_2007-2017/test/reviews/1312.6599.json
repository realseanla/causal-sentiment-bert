For this machines need to recognize the coins very fast and accurately, as further transaction processing depends on this recognition. Three types of systems are available in the market: Mechanical method based systems, Electromagnetic method based systems and Image processing based systems. This paper presents an overview of available systems and techniques based on image processing to recognize ancient and modern coins.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 17:00:02 GMT  (257kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6599v1", "5 pages, 1 table, Published with International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA)"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 table, Published with International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["shatrughan modi", "dr seema bawa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6599"}
