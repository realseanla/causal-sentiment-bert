Coupling is directly linked with other dimensions, such as co-presence, engagement, and believability, and was measured in an experiment that allowed users to describe their subjective feelings about those dimensions of interest. The experiment was based on a theatrical game involving the imitation of slow upper-body movements and the proposal of new movements by the user and virtual agent. The agent's behaviour varied in autonomy: the agent could limit itself to imitating the user's movements only, initiate new movements, or combine both behaviours. After the game, each participant completed a questionnaire regarding their engagement in the interaction, their subjective feeling about the co-presence of the agent, etc. Based on four main dimensions of interest, we tested several hypotheses against our experimental results, which are discussed here.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 18:49:11 GMT  (369kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5758v1", "appears in Intelligent Virtual Agents, 14th International Conference, IVA 2014, Boston : \\'Etats-Unis (2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "appears in Intelligent Virtual Agents, 14th International Conference, IVA 2014, Boston : \\'Etats-Unis (2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.GR", "authors": ["elisabetta bevacqua", "sankovic igor", "maatalaoui ayoub", "a n\\'ed\\'elec", "pierre de loor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5758"}
