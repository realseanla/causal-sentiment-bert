We propose an extension of CDCL-based SAT solvers to deal with this fundamental problem. Then, we provide an experimental evaluation of our proposed SAT model enumeration algorithms on both satisfiable SAT instances taken from the last SAT challenge and on instances from the SAT-based encoding of sequence mining problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 May 2013 20:37:29 GMT  (161kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0574v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 6 May 2013 20:45:25 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0574v2", "This paper is withdrawn by the authors due to a missing reference.
