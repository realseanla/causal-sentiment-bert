The framework is able to extract users comments from Online Social Networks (OSN), to process and analyze text through information extraction and sentiment analysis techniques to obtain relevant information about product reception on the market. A use case was developed using the mobile application Uber, which is today one of the fastest growing technology companies in the world. We measured how a controversial, highly diffused event influences the volume of tweets about Uber and the perception of its users. While there is no change in the image of Uber, a large increase in the number of tweets mentioning the company is observed, which meant a free and important diffusion of its product.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 12:25:57 GMT  (433kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09894v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.SI", "authors": ["daniela ulloa", "pedro saleiro", "rosaldo j f rossetti", "elis regina silva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09894"}
