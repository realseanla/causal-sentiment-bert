We assume that the rate matrix of the system can be compactly represented and that the belief distribution is to be approximated as a product of marginals. The essential computation is the matrix exponential. We look at two different methods for its computation: ODE integration and uniformization of the Taylor expansion. For both we consider approximations in which only a factored belief state is maintained. For factored uniformization we demonstrate that the KL-divergence of the filtering is bounded. Our experimental results confirm our factored uniformization performs better than previously suggested uniformization methods and the mean field algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3703v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI", "authors": ["e busra celikkaya", "christian r shelton", "william lam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3703"}
