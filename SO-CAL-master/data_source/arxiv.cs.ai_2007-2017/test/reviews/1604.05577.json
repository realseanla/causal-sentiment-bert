As these systems have concurrency, and often have dynamic environment, the formal specification and verification of these systems along with step-wise refinement from abstract to concrete concepts play a major role in system correctness. Formal verification is used for exhaustive investigation of the system space thus ensuring that undetected failures in the behavior are excluded. We construct the system incrementally from subcomponents, based on software architecture. The challenge is to develop a safe multi-agent robotic system, more specifically to ensure the correctness properties of safety and liveness. Formal specifications based on model-checking are flexible, have a concrete syntax, and play vital role in correctness of a multi-agent robotic system. To formally verify safety and liveness of such systems is important because they have high concurrency and in most of the cases have dynamic environment. We have considered a case-study of a multi-agent robotic system for the transport of stock between storehouses to exemplify our formal approach. Our proposed development approach allows for formal verification during specification definition. The development process has been classified in to four major phases of requirement specifications, verification specifications, architecture specifications and implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 13:53:35 GMT  (1020kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05577v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1501.05120"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1501.05120", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["nadeem akhtar", "malik m saad missen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.05577"}
