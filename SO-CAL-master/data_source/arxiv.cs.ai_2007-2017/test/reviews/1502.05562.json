FP5 represents imprecise properties whose accomplished degree is undefined, contradictory or indeterminate for some objects. Basic operations of conjunction, disjunction and negation are introduced. Relations to other representation models like fuzzy sets, intuitionistic, paraconsistent and bipolar fuzzy sets are discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 13:23:06 GMT  (423kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05562v1", "The 12th International Conference Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems, June 22-27, 2008, Malaga, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "The 12th International Conference Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems, June 22-27, 2008, Malaga, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vasile patrascu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05562"}
