Often not enough statistical data is available to allow for reliable probability estimation. Available information may not be directly amenable for encoding in the network. Finally, domain experts may be reluctant to provide numerical probabilities. In this paper, we propose a method for elicitation of probabilities from a domain expert that is non-invasive and accommodates whatever probabilistic information the expert is willing to state. We express all available information, whether qualitative or quantitative in nature, in a canonical form consisting of (in) equalities expressing constraints on the hyperspace of possible joint probability distributions. We then use this canonical form to derive second-order probability distributions over the desired probabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:20:07 GMT  (276kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4943v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marek j druzdzel", "linda c van der gaag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4943"}
