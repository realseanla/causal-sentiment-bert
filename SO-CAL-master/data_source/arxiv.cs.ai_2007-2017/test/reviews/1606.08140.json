However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform link prediction, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This paper combines insights from several previous link prediction models into a new embedding model STransE that represents each entity as a low-dimensional vector, and each relation by two matrices and a translation vector. STransE is a simple combination of the SE and TransE models, but it obtains better link prediction performance on two benchmark datasets than previous embedding models. Thus, STransE can serve as a new baseline for the more complex models in the link prediction task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 06:50:10 GMT  (27kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08140v1", "Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2016, pages 460-466. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1606.06461"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 16:24:49 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08140v2", "V1: In Proceedings of NAACL-HLT 2016.
