We define the FDGs, their features and two distance measures between AGs (unclassified patterns) and FDGs (models or classes) and we also explain an efficient matching algorithm. Two applications of FDGs are presented: in the former, FDGs are used for modelling and matching 3D-objects described by multiple views, whereas in the latter, they are used for representing and recognising human faces, described also by several views.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 May 2016 10:30:06 GMT  (1183kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02929v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["francesc serratosa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02929"}
