This work investigates a solution to this problem that combines Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) in a method we call ASP(RL). In this method, Answer Set Programming is used to find the possible trajectories of an MDP, from where Reinforcement Learning is applied to learn the optimal policy of the problem. Results show that ASP(RL) is capable of efficiently finding the optimal solution of an MDP representing non-stationary domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 May 2017 13:13:51 GMT  (1704kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01399v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["leonardo a ferreira", "reinaldo a c bianchi", "paulo e santos", "ramon lopez de mantaras"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01399"}
