However, because knowledge bases are typically incomplete, it is useful to be able to perform knowledge base completion, i.e., predict whether a relationship not in the knowledge base is likely to be true. This article presents an overview of embedding models of entities and relationships for knowledge base completion, with up-to-date experimental results on two standard evaluation tasks of link prediction (i.e. entity prediction) and triple classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 15:15:26 GMT  (26kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08098v1", "8 pages, 4 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.06461,arXiv:1606.08140"], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 15:28:08 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08098v2", "v1: 8 pages, 4 tables; v2: Update results for RESCAL (Nickel et al., 2011) and ComplEx (Trouillon et al., 2016). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.08140; text overlap witharXiv:1606.06461"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.06461,arXiv:1606.08140", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["dat quoc nguyen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08098"}
