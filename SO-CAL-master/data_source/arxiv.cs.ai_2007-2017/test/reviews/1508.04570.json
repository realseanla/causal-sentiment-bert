{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Aug-2015", "title": "Proposal for the creation of a research facility for the development of the SP machine", "abstract": "This is a proposal to create a research facility for the development of a high-parallel version of the \"SP machine\", based on the \"SP theory of intelligence\". We envisage that the new version of the SP machine will be an open-source software virtual machine, derived from the existing \"SP computer model\", and hosted on an existing high-performance computer. It will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system and to create new versions of it. The SP system is a unique attempt to simplify and integrate observations and concepts across artificial intelligence, mainstream computing, mathematics, and human perception and cognition, with information compression as a unifying theme. Potential benefits and applications include helping to solve problems associated with big data; facilitating the development of autonomous robots; unsupervised learning, natural language processing, several kinds of reasoning, fuzzy pattern recognition at multiple levels of abstraction, computer vision, best-match and semantic forms of information retrieval, software engineering, medical diagnosis, simplification of computing systems, and the seamless integration of diverse kinds of knowledge and diverse aspects of intelligence. Additional motivations include the potential of the SP system to help solve problems in defence, security, and the detection and prevention of crime; potential in terms of economic, social, environmental, and academic criteria, and in terms of publicity; and the potential for international influence in research. The main elements of the proposed facility are described, including support for the development of \"SP-neural\", a neural version of the SP machine. The facility should be permanent in the sense that it should be available for the foreseeable future, and it should be designed to facilitate its use by researchers anywhere in the world.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 09:03:18 GMT  (366kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04570v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1508.04087. substantial text overlap witharXiv:1409.8027"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1508.04087. substantial text overlap witharXiv:1409.8027", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j gerard wolff", "vasile palade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04570"}
