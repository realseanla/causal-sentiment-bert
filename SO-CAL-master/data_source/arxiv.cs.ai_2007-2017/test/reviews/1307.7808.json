Doing so automatically allows for regular and systematic testing. A key question then is how to automatically generate the attacks. A natural way to address this issue is as an attack planning problem. In this thesis, we are concerned with the specific context of regular automated pentesting, and use the term \"attack planning\" in that sense. The following three research directions are investigated.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 04:19:25 GMT  (1987kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7808v1", "PhD Thesis. 171 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "PhD Thesis. 171 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR", "authors": ["carlos sarraute"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7808"}
