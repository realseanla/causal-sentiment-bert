{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Feb-2013", "title": "Learning Bayesian Networks: A Unification for Discrete and Gaussian Domains", "abstract": "We examine Bayesian methods for learning Bayesian networks from a combination of prior knowledge and statistical data. In particular, we unify the approaches we presented at last year's conference for discrete and Gaussian domains. We derive a general Bayesian scoring metric, appropriate for both domains. We then use this metric in combination with well-known statistical facts about the Dirichlet and normal--Wishart distributions to derive our metrics for discrete and Gaussian domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:21:23 GMT  (515kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4957v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david heckerman", "dan geiger"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4957"}
