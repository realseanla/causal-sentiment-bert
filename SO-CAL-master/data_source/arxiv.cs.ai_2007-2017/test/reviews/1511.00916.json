In this paper, we present an API that integrates the IDP Knowledge Base system into the Python programming language. IDP is a state-of-the-art logical system, which uses SAT, SMT, Logic Programming and Answer Set Programming technology. Python is currently one of the most widely used (teaching) languages for programming. The first goal of our API is to allow a Python programmer to use the declarative power of IDP, without needing to learn any new syntax or semantics. The second goal is allow IDP to be added to/removed from an existing code base with minimal changes.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:21:23 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00916v1", "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 83-98, August 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), co-located with the 31st International Conference on Logic Programming (ICLP 2015), Proceedings of the International Workshop on User-Oriented Logic Programming (IULP 2015), Editors: Stefan Ellmauthaler and Claudia Schulz, pages 83-98, August 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI", "authors": ["joost vennekens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00916"}
