In this paper, we provide full proofs regarding the local search topology of the gap heuristic for the pancake puzzle. First, we show that in any non-goal state in which there is no move that will decrease the number of gaps, there is a move that will keep the number of gaps constant. We then classify any state in which the number of gaps cannot be decreased in a single action into two groups: those requiring 2 actions to decrease the number of gaps, and those which require 3 actions to decrease the number of gaps.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 May 2017 17:28:43 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04665v1", "Technical report providing proofs of statements appearing in a \"An Analysis and Enhancement of the Gap Heuristic for the Pancake Puzzle\" by Richard Anthony Valenzano and Danniel Yang.
