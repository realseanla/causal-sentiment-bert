Causal models are intuitive for human users and, more importantly, support the prediction of the effect of manipulation. We describe an implementation of the proposed framework as an interactive model construction module, ImaGeNIe, in SMILE (Structural Modeling, Inference, and Learning Engine) and in GeNIe (SMILE's Windows user interface).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:18 GMT  (402kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3872v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tsai-ching lu", "marek j druzdzel", "tze-yun leong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3872"}
