The method aims at represent uncertain, qualitative knowledge that is essential for the moving blocks task's execution. The attempt to formalize the commonsense knowledge is performed with the Situation Calculus language for reasoning and robot's beliefs representation. The method is implemented in the Prolog programming language and tested for a specific simulated scenario. In most cases the implementation enables us to solve a given task, i.e., move blocks to desired positions. The example of robot's reasoning and main parts of the implemented program's code are presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jul 2013 21:14:29 GMT  (138kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7405v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI", "authors": ["p a wa{\\l}\\c{e}ga"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7405"}
