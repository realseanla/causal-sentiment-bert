Compared with existing methods, our approach is naturally parallelizable and allows for incorporating different cost functionals with only minor adjustments. We apply our method to classical challenging instances and observe that its computational requirements scale well with $p$ for several cost functionals. We also show that a specialization of our algorithm can be used for {\\em local} motion planning by solving the problem of joint optimization in velocity space.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Nov 2013 20:38:57 GMT  (754kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4527v1", "In Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2013.
