Contextual integrity is a privacy theory that conceptualises the appropriateness of information sharing based on the contexts in which this information is to be shared. Computational models of Contextual Integrity assume the existence of well-defined contexts, in which individuals enact pre-defined roles and information sharing is governed by an explicit set of norms. However, contexts in Online Social Networks are known to be implicit, unknown a priori and ever changing; users relationships are constantly evolving; and the information sharing norms are implicit. This makes current Contextual Integrity models not suitable for Online Social Networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 14:25:44 GMT  (447kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02493v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 09:35:32 GMT  (478kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02493v2", "Authors Version of the paper accepted for publication in the Information Sciences journal (this http URL)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.CR cs.CY", "authors": ["natalia criado", "jose m such"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02493"}
