The procedure for forecasting SFR are rigid and most often times require data scaling or conversion into binary form such as is the case of the logistic model which may lead to lose of information and effect size attenuation. Also, the high number of factors, incomplete and unbalanced dataset, and black boxing issues as in Artificial Neural Networks and Fuzzy logic systems exposes the need for more efficient tools. Currently the application of Genetic Programming (GP) holds great promises and has produced tremendous positive results in different sectors. In this regard, this study developed GPSFARPS, a software application to provide a robust solution to the prediction of SFR using an evolutionary algorithm known as multi-gene genetic programming. The approach is validated by feeding a testing data set to the evolved GP models. Result obtained from GPSFARPS simulations show its unique ability to evolve a suitable failure rate expression with a fast convergence at 30 generations from a maximum specified generation of 500. The multi-gene system was also able to minimize the evolved model expression and accurately predict student failure rate using a subset of the original expression", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 08:17:11 GMT  (434kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03211v1", "14 pages, 9 figures, Journal paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1403.0623by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 9 figures, Journal paper. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1403.0623by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["j o orove", "n e osegi", "b o eke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03211"}
