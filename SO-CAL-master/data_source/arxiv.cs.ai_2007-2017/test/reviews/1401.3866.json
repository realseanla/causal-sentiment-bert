The key question in this area, which has important applications in social choice theory and decision making under uncertainty, is how to extend an agents preferences over a number of objects to a preference relation over nonempty sets of such objects. Certain combinations of seemingly natural principles for this kind of preference extension can result in logical inconsistencies, which has led to a number of important impossibility theorems. We first prove a general result that shows that for a wide range of such principles, characterised by their syntactic form when expressed in a many-sorted first-order logic, any impossibility exhibited at a fixed (small) domain size will necessarily extend to the general case. We then show how to formulate candidates for impossibility theorems at a fixed domain size in propositional logic, which in turn enables us to automatically search for (general) impossibility theorems using a SAT solver. When applied to a space of 20 principles for preference extension familiar from the literature, this method yields a total of 84 impossibility theorems, including both known and nontrivial new results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:06:28 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3866v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO cs.MA", "authors": ["christian geist", "ulle endriss"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3866"}
