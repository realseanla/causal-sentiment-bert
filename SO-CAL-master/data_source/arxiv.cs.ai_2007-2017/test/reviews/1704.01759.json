{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Apr-2017", "title": "A Multi-view Context-aware Approach to Android Malware Detection and Malicious Code Localization", "abstract": "Existing Android malware detection approaches use a variety of features such as security sensitive APIs, system calls, control-flow structures and information flows in conjunction with Machine Learning classifiers to achieve accurate detection. Each of these feature sets provides a unique semantic perspective (or view) of apps' behaviours with inherent strengths and limitations. Meaning, some views are more amenable to detect certain attacks but may not be suitable to characterise several other attacks. Most of the existing malware detection approaches use only one (or a selected few) of the aforementioned feature sets which prevent them from detecting a vast majority of attacks. Addressing this limitation, we propose MKLDroid, a unified framework that systematically integrates multiple views of apps for performing comprehensive malware detection and malicious code localisation. The rationale is that, while a malware app can disguise itself in some views, disguising in every view while maintaining malicious intent will be much harder.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 09:44:08 GMT  (4931kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01759v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 8 Apr 2017 13:10:50 GMT  (4931kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01759v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["annamalai narayanan", "mahinthan chandramohan", "lihui chen", "yang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01759"}
