This combination is usually followed by a decision making which can be handled by a range of decision rules. Some rules help to choose the most likely hypothesis. Others allow that a decision is made on a set of hypotheses. In [6], we proposed a decision rule based on a distance measure. First, in this paper, we aim to demonstrate that our proposed decision rule is a particular case of the rule proposed in [4]. Second, we give experiments showing that our rule is able to decide on a set of hypotheses. Some experiments are handled on a set of mass functions generated randomly, others on real databases.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 07:24:12 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07008v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["amira essaid", "arnaud martin", "gr\\'egory smits", "boutheina ben yaghlane"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07008"}
