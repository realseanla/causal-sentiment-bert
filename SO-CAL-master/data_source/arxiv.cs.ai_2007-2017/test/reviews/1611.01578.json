Despite their success, neural networks are still hard to design. In this paper, we use a recurrent network to generate the model descriptions of neural networks and train this RNN with reinforcement learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the generated architectures on a validation set. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, our method, starting from scratch, can design a novel network architecture that rivals the best human-invented architecture in terms of test set accuracy. Our CIFAR-10 model achieves a test error rate of 3.84, which is only 0.1 percent worse and 1.2x faster than the current state-of-the-art model. On the Penn Treebank dataset, our model can compose a novel recurrent cell that outperforms the widely-used LSTM cell, and other state-of-the-art baselines. Our cell achieves a test set perplexity of 62.4 on the Penn Treebank, which is 3.6 perplexity better than the previous state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 00:41:37 GMT  (583kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 05:28:05 GMT  (585kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["barret zoph", "quoc v le"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.01578"}
