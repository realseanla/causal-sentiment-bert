This paper describes the Allen AI Science Challenge---an approach towards that goal which led to a unique Kaggle Competition, its results, the lessons learned, and our next steps.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Apr 2016 22:43:30 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04315v1", "6 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 May 2016 18:47:00 GMT  (79kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04315v2", "6 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 20:02:46 GMT  (233kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04315v3", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["carissa schoenick", "peter clark", "oyvind tafjord", "peter turney", "oren etzioni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04315"}
