We first show NP-hardness in three-level trees by a reduction from maximum independent set; this implies non-approximability within a sublinear factor. We show that this is a tight bound, as we can find an approximation within a linear factor in three-level networks. We then show that in four-level trees it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor $2^{f(n)}$ for any sublinear function $f$ of the size of the input $n$. Again, this is bound is tight, as we prove that the usual max-product algorithm finds (in any network) approximations within factor $2^{c n}$ from some constant $c &lt; 1$. Last, we present a simple algorithm, and show that it provably produces solutions at least as good as, and potentially much better than, the max-product algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 15:00:03 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06045v1", "14 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:52:38 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06045v2", "18 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 17:30:18 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06045v3", "18 pages"], ["v4", "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 16:44:28 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06045v4", "18 pages"], ["v5", "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 14:15:44 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06045v5", "18 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["diarmaid conaty", "denis d mau\\'a", "cassio p de campos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06045"}
