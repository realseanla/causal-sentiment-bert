We propose a context-based parsing approach that combines efficient statistical learning of deep parse trees with their semantic pruning by type checking and large-theory automated theorem proving. We show that the methods very significantly improve on previous results in parsing theorems from the Flyspeck corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 16:20:24 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09703v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI", "authors": ["cezary kaliszyk", "josef urban", "ji\\v{r}\\'i vysko\\v{c}il"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09703"}
