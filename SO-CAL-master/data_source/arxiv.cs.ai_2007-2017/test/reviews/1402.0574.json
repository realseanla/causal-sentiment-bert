We present a new methodology for modeling and predicting such future news events using machine learning and data mining techniques. Our Pundit algorithm generalizes examples of causality pairs to infer a causality predictor. To obtain precisely labeled causality examples, we mine 150 years of news articles and apply semantic natural language modeling techniques to headlines containing certain predefined causality patterns. For generalization, the model uses a vast number of world knowledge ontologies. Empirical evaluation on real news articles shows that our Pundit algorithm performs as well as non-expert humans.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 01:39:12 GMT  (1391kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0574v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["kira radinsky", "sagie davidovich", "shaul markovitch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0574"}
