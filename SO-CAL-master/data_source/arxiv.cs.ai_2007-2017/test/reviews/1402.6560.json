Many of these formalisms provide some notions of solutions. Typical examples are satisfying assignments in constraint systems, models in logics or solutions to linear equation systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Feb 2014 14:51:57 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6560v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jordi roca-lacostena", "jesus cerquides"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.6560"}
