A generalized functional model is a pair (f, P) where f is a function describing the interactions between a parameter variable, an observation variable and a random source, and P is a probability distribution for the random source. Unlike traditional functional models, generalized functional models do not require that there is only one value of the parameter variable that is compatible with an observation and a realization of the random source. As a consequence, the results of the analysis of a generalized functional model are not expressed in terms of probability distributions but rather by support and plausibility functions. The analysis of a generalized functional model is very logical and is inspired from ideas already put forward by R.A. Fisher in his theory of fiducial probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:30 GMT  (770kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1562v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paul-andre monney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1562"}
