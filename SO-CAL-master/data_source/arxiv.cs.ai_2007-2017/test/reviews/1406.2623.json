CMA-ES is well known to be almost parameterless, meaning that only one hyper-parameter, the population size, is proposed to be tuned by the user. In this paper, we propose a principled approach called self-CMA-ES to achieve the online adaptation of CMA-ES hyper-parameters in order to improve its overall performance. Experimental results show that for larger-than-default population size, the default settings of hyper-parameters of CMA-ES are far from being optimal, and that self-CMA-ES allows for dynamically approaching optimal settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 16:44:32 GMT  (578kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2623v1", "13th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN 2014) (2014)"], ["v2", "Wed, 11 Jun 2014 09:54:27 GMT  (1304kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2623v2", "13th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN 2014) (2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "13th International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN 2014) (2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["ilya loshchilov", "marc schoenauer", "mich\\`ele sebag", "nikolaus hansen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.2623"}
