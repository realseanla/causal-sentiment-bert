Grouping problems cover a large class of important combinatorial optimization problems that are generally computationally difficult. In this paper, we propose a general solution approach for grouping problems, i.e., reinforcement learning based local search (RLS), which combines reinforcement learning techniques with descent-based local search. The viability of the proposed approach is verified on a well-known representative grouping problem (graph coloring) where a very simple descent-based coloring algorithm is applied. Experimental studies on popular DIMACS and COLOR02 benchmark graphs indicate that RLS achieves competitive performances compared to a number of well-known coloring algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 19:38:35 GMT  (340kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00377v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["yangming zhou", "jin-kao hao", "b\\'eatrice duval"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.00377"}
