In this paper we show how we can extend inference algorithms, particularly Bucket Elimination, a special case of cluster (join) tree decomposition, to utilize disk memory. We provide the underlying ideas and show promising empirical results of exactly solving large problems not solvable before.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (441kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3487v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["kalev kask", "rina dechter", "rew e gelfand"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3487"}
