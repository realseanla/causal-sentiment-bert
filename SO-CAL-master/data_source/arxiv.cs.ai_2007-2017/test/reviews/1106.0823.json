{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jun-2011", "title": "Recovering Epipolar Geometry from Images of Smooth Surfaces", "abstract": "We present four methods for recovering the epipolar geometry from images of smooth surfaces. Existing methods for recovering epipolar geometry use corresponding feature points that cannot be found in such images. The first method is based on finding corresponding characteristic points created by illumination (ICPM - illumination characteristic points method). The second method is based on correspondent tangency points created by tangents from epipoles to outline of smooth bodies (OTPM - outline tangent points method). These two methods are exact and give correct results for real images, because positions of the corresponding illumination characteristic points and corresponding outline are known with small errors. But the second method is limited either to special type of scenes or to restricted camera motion. We also consider two else methods, termed CCPM (curve characteristic points method) and CTPM (curve tangent points method), for search epipolar geometry for images of smooth bodies based on a set of level curves with a constant illumination intensity. The CCPM method is based on search correspondent points on isophoto curves with the help of correlation of curvatures between these lines. The CTPM method is based on property of the tangential to isophoto curve epipolarline to map into the tangential to correspondent isophoto curves epipolar line. Unfortunately these two methods give us only finite subset of solution, which usually include \"good\" solution, but don't allow us to find this \"good\" solution among this subset. Exception is the case of epipoles in infinity. The main reason for such result is inexactness of constant brightness assumption for smooth bodies. But outline and illumination characteristic points are not influenced this inexactness. So the first pair of methods gives exact result.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jun 2011 13:48:21 GMT  (1570kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v1", "33 pages, 19 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Oct 2011 12:33:21 GMT  (1568kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v2", "33 pages, 19 figures"], ["v3", "Wed, 19 Oct 2011 09:27:20 GMT  (1568kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v3", "33 pages, 19 figures"], ["v4", "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 12:38:37 GMT  (1568kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0823v4", "accepted to \"Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis\" for publishing in 2013, 33 pages, 19 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "33 pages, 19 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["oleg kupervasser"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0823"}
