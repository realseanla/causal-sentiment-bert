While particle filtering has become a widely-used tool in AI for monitoring dynamical systems, rather scant attention has been paid to their use in the context of decision making. Assuming the existence of a value function, we derive error bounds on decision quality associated with filtering using importance sampling. We also describe an adaptive procedure that can be used to dynamically determine the number of samples required to meet specific error bounds. Empirical evidence is offered supporting this technique as a profitable means of directing sampling effort where it is needed to distinguish policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:26:08 GMT  (1196kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2305v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["pascal poupart", "luis e ortiz", "craig boutilier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2305"}
