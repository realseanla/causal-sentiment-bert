For lower previsions that are essentially defined on some finite set of gambles on a finite possibility space, we present a reformulation of this criterion that only uses a finite number of constraints. Any such lower prevision is coherent if it lies within the convex polytope defined by these constraints. The vertices of this polytope are the extreme coherent lower previsions for the given set of gambles. Our reformulation makes it possible to compute them. We show how this is done and illustrate the procedure and its results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 11:17:56 GMT  (1710kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3509v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2010)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["erik quaeghebeur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3509"}
