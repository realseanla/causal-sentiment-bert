While this variety is useful to widen the application potential, each variant requires a new algorithm for finding the stable matchings. To address this issue, we propose an encoding of the SMP using answer set programming (ASP), which can straightforwardly be adapted and extended to suit the needs of specific applications. The use of ASP also means that we can take advantage of highly efficient off-the-shelf solvers. To illustrate the flexibility of our approach, we show how our ASP encoding naturally allows us to select optimal stable matchings, i.e. matchings that are optimal according to some user-specified criterion. To the best of our knowledge, our encoding offers the first exact implementation to find sex-equal, minimum regret, egalitarian or maximum cardinality stable matchings for SMP instances in which individuals may designate unacceptable partners and ties between preferences are allowed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 16:59:14 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05247v1", "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1302.7251"]], "COMMENTS": "Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1302.7251", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sofie de clercq", "steven schockaert", "martine de cock", "ann now\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05247"}
