It permits to compare these techniques and have a synthetic organized view of what can or should be done for knowledge sharing purposes. This ontology is part of a general knowledge base that can be accessed and complemented by any Web user. Thus, it can be seen as a cooperatively built library for the above cited elements. Since they permit to evaluate information objects and create better ones, these elements also permit knowledge-based tools and techniques - as well as knowledge providers - to be evaluated and categorized based on their input/output information objects. One top-level distinction permitting to organize this ontology is the one between content, medium and containers of descriptions. Various structural, ontological, syntactical and lexical distinctions are then used.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 18:40:30 GMT  (138kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7200v1", "7 pages, 10 tables, conference"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 10 tables, conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DL cs.AI cs.IR", "authors": ["philippe a martin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7200"}
