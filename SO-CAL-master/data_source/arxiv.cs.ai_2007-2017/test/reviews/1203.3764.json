The approach, implemented in the Abzooba Smart Health Informatics Platform (SHIP),is to distill concepts of facts and expressions from conversations and discussions in health social media forums, and use those distilled concepts in connecting patients to experiences and insights that are highly relevant to them in particular. We envision our work, in progress, to provide new and effective tools to exploit the richness of content in social media in health for outcomes research.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 16:59:03 GMT  (285kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3764v1", "3 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["naveen ashish", "antarip biswas", "sumit das", "saurav nag", "rajiv pratap"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3764"}
