In this case, an agent can postpone the execution of a particular action, if this punctually solves the conflict, or it can resort to execute a different plan if the agent's payoff significantly diminishes due to the action deferral. In this paper, we present a game-theoretic approach to non-cooperative planning that helps predict before execution what plan schedules agents will adopt so that the set of strategies of all agents constitute a Nash equilibrium. We perform some experiments and discuss the solutions obtained with our game-theoretical approach, analyzing how the conflicts between the plans determine the strategic behavior of the agents.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Mar 2015 11:46:33 GMT  (145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01288v1", "Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15) 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Twenty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-15) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT", "authors": ["jaume jord\u00e1n", "eva onaindia"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.01288"}
