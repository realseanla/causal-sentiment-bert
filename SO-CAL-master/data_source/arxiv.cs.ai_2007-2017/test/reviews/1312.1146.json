Although comparative worst-case complexity analyses of plan generation and reuse techniques reveal that it is not possible to achieve provable efficiency gain of reuse over generation, we show that the case-based planning approach can be an effective alternative to plan generation when similar reuse candidates can be chosen.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Dec 2013 13:10:45 GMT  (342kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1146v1", "preliminary version"]], "COMMENTS": "preliminary version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anna roub\\'i\\v{c}kov\\'a", "ivan serina"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.1146"}
