{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Mar-2013", "title": "Constraint Propagation with Imprecise Conditional Probabilities", "abstract": "An approach to reasoning with default rules where the proportion of exceptions, or more generally the probability of encountering an exception, can be at least roughly assessed is presented. It is based on local uncertainty propagation rules which provide the best bracketing of a conditional probability of interest from the knowledge of the bracketing of some other conditional probabilities. A procedure that uses two such propagation rules repeatedly is proposed in order to estimate any simple conditional probability of interest from the available knowledge. The iterative procedure, that does not require independence assumptions, looks promising with respect to the linear programming method. Improved bounds for conditional probabilities are given when independence assumptions hold.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:29:40 GMT  (448kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5706v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["stephane amarger", "didier dubois", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5706"}
