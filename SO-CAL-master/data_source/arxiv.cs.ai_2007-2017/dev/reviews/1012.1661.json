At its core is a data model based on two main principles: first, all information can be represented as a graph and, second, all elements of the graph can be annotated with ontologies. This data model is conformant to the Semantic Web framework, in particular to RDF, and therefore Ondex is ideally positioned as a platform that can exploit the semantic web.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Dec 2010 00:54:27 GMT  (220kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1661v1", "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.
