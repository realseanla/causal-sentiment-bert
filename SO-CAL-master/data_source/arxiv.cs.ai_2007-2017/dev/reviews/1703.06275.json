The space of possible parameter settings can be seen as a search space, and we can therefore use a Random Mutation Hill Climbing algorithm or other search methods to find the parameter settings that induce the best games. One of the hardest parts of this approach is defining a suitable fitness function. In this paper we explore the possibility of using one of a growing set of General Video Game AI agents to perform automatic play-testing. This enables a very general approach to game evaluation based on estimating the skill-depth of a game. Agent-based play-testing is computationally expensive, so we compare two simple but efficient optimisation algorithms: the Random Mutation Hill-Climber and the Multi-Armed Bandit Random Mutation Hill-Climber. For the test game we use a space-battle game in order to provide a suitable balance between simulation speed and potential skill-depth. Results show that both algorithms are able to rapidly evolve game versions with significant skill-depth, but that choosing a suitable resampling number is essential in order to combat the effects of noise.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Mar 2017 09:04:05 GMT  (1417kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06275v1", "9 pages, 17 figures, CEC2017"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 17 figures, CEC2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jialin liu", "julian togelius", "diego perez-liebana", "simon m lucas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06275"}
