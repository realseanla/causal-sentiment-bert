{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Feb-2013", "title": "RIO: Minimizing User Interaction in Debugging of Knowledge Bases", "abstract": "The best currently known interactive debugging systems rely upon some meta-information in terms of fault probabilities in order to improve their efficiency. However, misleading meta information might result in a dramatic decrease of the performance and its assessment is only possible a-posteriori. Consequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk of suboptimal interactions. In this work we present a reinforcement learning strategy that continuously adapts its behavior depending on the performance achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta information. Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where reliable prior fault estimates are difficult to obtain. Using diverse real-world knowledge bases, we show that the proposed interactive query strategy is scalable, features decent reaction time, and outperforms both entropy-based and no-risk strategies on average w.r.t. required amount of user interaction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 12:53:47 GMT  (645kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2465v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1209.3734"], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Mar 2013 14:46:03 GMT  (643kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2465v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1209.3734"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1209.3734", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["patrick rodler", "kostyantyn shchekotykhin", "philipp fleiss", "gerhard friedrich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.2465"}
