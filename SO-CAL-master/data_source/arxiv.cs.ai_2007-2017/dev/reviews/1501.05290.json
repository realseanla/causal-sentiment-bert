In the form of mathematical equations, hypotheses symmetrically relate aspects of the studied phenomena. For computing predictions, however, deterministic hypotheses are used asymmetrically as functions. We build upon Simon's notion of structural equations in order to extract the (so-called) causal ordering embedded in a hypothesis structure (set of mathematical equations).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 20:46:23 GMT  (1504kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05290v1", "139 pages, 58 figures, 1 table.
