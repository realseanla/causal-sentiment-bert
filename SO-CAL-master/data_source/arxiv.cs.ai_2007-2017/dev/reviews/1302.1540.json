We find that many problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. Of these, the probabilistic classes PP and NP^PP are likely to be of special interest in the field of uncertainty in artificial intelligence and are deserving of additional study. These results suggest a fruitful direction of future algorithmic development.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:55:32 GMT  (797kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1540v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["judy goldsmith", "michael l littman", "martin mundhenk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1540"}
