In this paper, we compare three architectures - Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter, Hugin, and Shenoy-Shafer - from the perspective of graphical structure for message propagation, message-passing scheme, computational efficiency, and storage efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:05:20 GMT  (336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7394v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vasilica lepar", "prakash p shenoy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7394"}
