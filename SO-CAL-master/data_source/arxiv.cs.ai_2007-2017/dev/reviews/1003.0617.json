These provide powerful tools for engineering real time systems that adapt to changes in the environment but are limited when the controller itself needs to be adapted.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 15:38:48 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0617v1", "3 pages, 1 Figure, Formal Methods in Aerospace"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 1 Figure, Formal Methods in Aerospace", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.AI", "authors": ["louise a dennis", "michael fisher", "nicholas lincoln", "alexei lisitsa", "sandor m veres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0617"}
