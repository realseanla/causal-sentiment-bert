The architecture contrasts with the monolithic nature of many implementations. Experimental results indicate that the software engineering benefits are not incompatible with runtime efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 14:56:14 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5334v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.PL", "authors": ["laurent michel", "pascal van hentenryck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.5334"}
