Specifically, we propose to use the Bash terminal as a simulator of the Ubuntu environment for a learning-based agent and demonstrate the usefulness of adopting reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for basic problem solving and troubleshooting in this environment. We provide a plug-and-play interface to the simulator as a python package where different types of agents can be plugged in and evaluated, and provide pathways for integrating data from online support forums like Ask Ubuntu into an automated agent's learning process. Finally, we show that the use of this data significantly improves the agent's learning efficiency. We believe that this platform can be adopted as a real-world test bed for research on automated technical support.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 16:42:30 GMT  (4966kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08524v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 12 Aug 2017 21:31:02 GMT  (4956kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08524v2", "Appeared (under the same title) in AAAI/IAAI 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tathagata chakraborti", "kartik talamadupula", "kshitij p fadnis", "murray campbell", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.08524"}
