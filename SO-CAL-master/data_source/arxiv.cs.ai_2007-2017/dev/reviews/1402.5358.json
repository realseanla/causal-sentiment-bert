A widespread and elaborated model is state-space representation, which, however, has some shortcomings. Classical search algorithms are not applicable in practice when the state space contains even only a few tens of thousands of states. We can give remedy to this problem by defining some kind of heuristic knowledge. In case of classical state-space representation, heuristic must be defined so that it qualifies an arbitrary state based on its \"goodness,\" which is obviously not trivial. In our paper, we introduce an algorithm that gives us the ability to handle huge state spaces and to use a heuristic concept which is easier to embed into search algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 17:21:52 GMT  (474kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5358v1", "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tam\\'as k\\'adek", "j\\'anos p\\'anovics"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.5358"}
