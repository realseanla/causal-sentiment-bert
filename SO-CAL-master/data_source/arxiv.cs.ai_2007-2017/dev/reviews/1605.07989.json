The contribution of this abstract is thus threefold, we (1) propose an efficient closed form approximation to the operator count heuristic; (2) leverage compressed sensing techniques to obtain an integer approximation in polynomial time; and (3) discuss the relationship of the proposed formulation to existing heuristics and investigate properties of domains where such approaches are useful.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 18:10:48 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07989v1", "3 page"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Jul 2016 02:10:11 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07989v2", "Published at the International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "3 page", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["tathagata chakraborti", "sarath sreedharan", "sailik sengupta", "t k satish kumar", "subbarao kambhampati"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07989"}
