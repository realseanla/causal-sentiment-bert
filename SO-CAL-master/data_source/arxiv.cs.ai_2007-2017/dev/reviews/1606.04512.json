They compile a relational probability model into a target circuit on which many inference queries can be answered efficiently. Early methods used data structures as their target circuit. In our KR-2016 paper, we showed that compiling to a low-level program instead of a data structure offers orders of magnitude speedup, resulting in the state-of-the-art lifted inference technique. In this paper, we conduct experiments to address two questions regarding our KR-2016 results: 1- does the speedup come from more efficient compilation or more efficient reasoning with the target circuit?, and 2- why are low-level programs more efficient target circuits than data structures?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:13:30 GMT  (440kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04512v1", "6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at IJCAI-16 Statistical Relational AI (StaRAI) workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 figures, accepted at IJCAI-16 Statistical Relational AI (StaRAI) workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["seyed mehran kazemi", "david poole"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04512"}
