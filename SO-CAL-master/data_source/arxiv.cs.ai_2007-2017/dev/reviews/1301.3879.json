We present a formal framework, termed asymmetric influence diagrams, that is based on the influence diagram and allows an efficient representation of asymmetric decision problems. As opposed to existing frameworks, the asymmetric influece diagram primarily encodes asymmetry at the qualitative level and it can therefore be read directly from the model. We give an algorithm for solving asymmetric influence diagrams. The algorithm initially decomposes the asymmetric decision problem into a structure of symmetric subproblems organized as a tree. A solution to the decision problem can then be found by propagating from the leaves toward the root using existing evaluation methods to solve the sub-problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:46 GMT  (353kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3879v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas d nielsen", "finn verner jensen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3879"}
