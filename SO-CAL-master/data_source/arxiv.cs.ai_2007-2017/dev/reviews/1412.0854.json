In this work we present a new vision to derive Value from Big Data using a Semantic Hierarchical Multi-label Classification called Semantic HMC based in a non-supervised Ontology learning process. We also proposea Semantic HMC process, using scalable Machine-Learning techniques and Rule-based reasoning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 10:44:24 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0854v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["thomas hassan", "rafael peixoto", "christophe cruz", "aurlie bertaux", "nuno silva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.0854"}
