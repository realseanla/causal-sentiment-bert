For any given covering, both intersection and union of covering blocks containing an element are exploited as granules to form granular worlds at different abstraction levels, respectively, and transformations among these different granular worlds are also discussed. As an application of the presented multi-granular perspective on covering, relational interpretation and axiomization of four types of covering based rough upper approximation operators are investigated, which can be dually applied to lower ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 07:11:56 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1489v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["wan-li chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.1489"}
