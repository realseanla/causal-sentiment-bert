Prior work has developed teaching protocols that enable agents to learn efficiently in complex environments; many of these methods tailor the teacher's guidance to agents with a particular representation or underlying learning scheme, offering effective but specialized teaching procedures. In this work, we explore protocol programs, an agent-agnostic schema for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning. Our goal is to incorporate the beneficial properties of a human teacher into Reinforcement Learning without making strong assumptions about the inner workings of the agent. We show how to represent existing approaches such as action pruning, reward shaping, and training in simulation as special cases of our schema and conduct preliminary experiments on simple domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 17:14:40 GMT  (2091kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04079v1", "Presented at the NIPS Workshop on the Future of Interactive Learning Machines, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at the NIPS Workshop on the Future of Interactive Learning Machines, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["david abel", "john salvatier", "reas stuhlm\\\"uller", "owain evans"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04079"}
