{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Apr-2017", "title": "Kiwi - A Minimalist CP Solver", "abstract": "Kiwi is a minimalist and extendable Constraint Programming (CP) solver specifically designed for education. The particularities of Kiwi stand in its generic trailing state restoration mechanism and its modulable use of variables. By developing Kiwi, the author does not aim to provide an alternative to full featured constraint solvers but rather to provide readers with a basic architecture that will (hopefully) help them to understand the core mechanisms hidden under the hood of constraint solvers, to develop their own extended constraint solver, or to test innovative ideas.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 19:34:19 GMT  (6239kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00047v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 2 May 2017 01:18:47 GMT  (6239kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00047v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SE", "authors": ["renaud hartert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00047"}
