KB_Bio_101 contains knowledge from a biology textbook, has been developed as part of Project Halo, and has recently become available for research use. KB_Bio_101 is one of the largest KBs available in ASP and the reasoning with it is undecidable in general. We give a description of this KB and ASP programs for a suite of queries that have been of practical interest. We explain why these queries pose significant practical challenges for the current ASP solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:13:10 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6138v1", "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2013), 6th International Workshop, August 25, 2013, Istanbul, Turkey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vinay k chaudhri", "stijn heymans", "michael wessel", "tran cao son"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6138"}
