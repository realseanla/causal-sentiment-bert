With current network moving towards the Future Internet model, the problem is further intensified as network traffic demanding far from exceeds network bandwidth capability. Maintaining a certain user satisfaction degree therefore becomes a challenge research topic. In this paper, we deal with the problem by proposing BASMIN, a novel bandwidth allocation scheme that aims to maximize network user's happiness. We also defined a new metric for evaluating network user satisfaction degree: network worth. A three-step evaluation process is then conducted to compare BASMIN efficiency with other three popular bandwidth allocation schemes. Throughout the tests, we experienced BASMIN's advantages over the others; we even found out that one of the most widely used bandwidth allocation schemes, in fact, is not effective at all.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jul 2010 00:47:16 GMT  (517kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1007.1270v1", "Presented at The First Asia Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems April, 1-3, 2009, Dong Hoi City, Quang Binh province, Vietnam"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at The First Asia Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems April, 1-3, 2009, Dong Hoi City, Quang Binh province, Vietnam", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.AI", "authors": ["huy nguyen", "tam van nguyen", "deokjai choi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1007.1270"}
