ICI allows one to factorize a conditional probability table into smaller pieces. We describe a method for exploiting the factorization in clique tree propagation (CTP) - the state-of-the-art exact inference algorithm for Bayesian networks. We also present empirical results showing that the resulting algorithm is significantly more efficient than the combination of CTP and previous techniques for exploiting ICI.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:59:36 GMT  (1177kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1574v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nevin lianwen zhang", "li yan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1574"}
