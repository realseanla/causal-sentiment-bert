Based on the concepts of regular models, our previous research work has developed a system of a regular ontology that models learning structures in a multiagent system for uniform pre-assessments in a learning environment. This regular ontology has led to the modelling of a classified rules learning algorithm that predicts the actual number of rules needed for inductive learning processes and decision making in a multiagent system. But not all processes or models are regular. Thus this paper presents a system of polynomial equation that can estimate and predict the required number of rules of a non-regular ontology model given some defined parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 12:12:17 GMT  (254kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02323v1", "13 pages, 15 figures, International Journal article, PhD research work"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 15 figures, International Journal article, PhD research work", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["kennedy e ehimwenma", "paul crowther", "martin beer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02323"}
