In this paper, we expand PIMT to a lifted version that also processes random functions and relations. This enhancement is achieved by adapting Inversion, a method from Lifted First-Order Probabilistic Inference literature, to also be modulo theories. This results in the first algorithm for exact probabilistic inference that efficiently and simultaneously exploits random relations and functions, arithmetic, equalities and inequalities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 19:08:37 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01122v1", "Appeared in the Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence Conference, August 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in the Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence Conference, August 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SC", "authors": ["rodrigo de salvo braz", "ciaran o'reilly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01122"}
