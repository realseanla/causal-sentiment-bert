Researchers interested in better understanding these models have studied the changes in hidden state representations over time and noticed some interpretable patterns but also significant noise. In this work, we present LSTMVis a visual analysis tool for recurrent neural networks with a focus on understanding these hidden state dynamics. The tool allows a user to select a hypothesis input range to focus on local state changes, to match these states changes to similar patterns in a large data set, and to align these results with domain specific structural annotations. We further show several use cases of the tool for analyzing specific hidden state properties on datasets containing nesting, phrase structure, and chord progressions, and demonstrate how the tool can be used to isolate patterns for further statistical analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 20:20:39 GMT  (4883kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07461v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:11:54 GMT  (6434kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07461v2", "InfoVis 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["hendrik strobelt", "sebastian gehrmann", "bernd huber", "hanspeter pfister", "alexander m rush"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07461"}
