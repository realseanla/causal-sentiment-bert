Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics", "abstract": "Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Set and -Logic were defined by the author in 1995 and published for the first time in 2007. We extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is over 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is below 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component over 1 and other neutrosophic component below 0}. This is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/logic, or classical/imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components. For example, person working overtime deserves a membership degree over 1, while a person producing more damage than benefit to a company deserves a membership below 0. Then, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic/Measure/Probability/Statistics etc. were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Logic, -Measure, -Probability, -Statistics etc. [Smarandache, 2007].", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 02:17:59 GMT  (2293kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00234v1", "170 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "170 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["florentin smarandache"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00234"}
