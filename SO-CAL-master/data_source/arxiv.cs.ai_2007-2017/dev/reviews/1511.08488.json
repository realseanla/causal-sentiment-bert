In our research we use Bayesian networks to create a model of tested humans. We collected data from paper tests performed with grammar school students. In this article we first provide the summary of data used for our experiments. We propose several different Bayesian networks, which we tested and compared by cross-validation. Interesting results were obtained and are discussed in the paper. The analysis has brought a clearer view on the model selection problem. Future research is outlined in the concluding part of the paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 19:45:03 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08488v1", "12th Annual Bayesian Modelling Applications Workshop, Amsterdam, Netherlands, (July 2015). 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12th Annual Bayesian Modelling Applications Workshop, Amsterdam, Netherlands, (July 2015). 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["martin plajner", "ji\\v{r}\\'i vomlel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08488"}
