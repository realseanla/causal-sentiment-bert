{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Feb-2016", "title": "Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems and Applications: A Survey", "abstract": "The field of Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an active area of research within Artificial Intelligence, with an increasingly important impact in industrial and other real-world applications. Within a MAS, autonomous agents interact to pursue personal interests and/or to achieve common objectives. Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) have emerged as one of the prominent agent architectures to govern the agents' autonomous behavior, where both algorithms and communication models are driven by the structure of the specific problem. During the last decade, several extensions to the DCOP model have enabled them to support MAS in complex, real-time, and uncertain environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 00:23:10 GMT  (748kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06347v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 14:59:14 GMT  (898kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06347v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 11 May 2017 03:00:42 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06347v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["ferdinando fioretto", "enrico pontelli", "william yeoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06347"}
