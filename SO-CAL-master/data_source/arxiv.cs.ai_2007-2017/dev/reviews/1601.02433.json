The complexity of this process is increased with the number of involved people, the variety of the systems to be integrated and the dynamics of their domain. In this paper we advocate that the realization of a powerful version control system is the heart of the problem. Driven by this idea and the success of Git in the context of software development, we investigate the applicability of Git for collaborative vocabulary development. Even though vocabulary development and software development have much more similarities than differences there are still important differences. These need to be considered within the development of a successful versioning and collaboration system for vocabulary development. Therefore, this paper starts by presenting the challenges we were faced with during the creation of vocabularies collaboratively and discusses its distinction to software development. Based on these insights we propose Git4Voc which comprises guidelines how Git can be adopted to vocabulary development. Finally, we demonstrate how Git hooks can be implemented to go beyond the plain functionality of Git by realizing vocabulary-specific features like syntactic validation and semantic diffs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 13:11:51 GMT  (452kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02433v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DB cs.HC", "authors": ["lavdim halilaj", "irl\\'an grangel-gonz\\'alez", "g\\\"okhan coskun", "s\\\"oren auer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02433"}
