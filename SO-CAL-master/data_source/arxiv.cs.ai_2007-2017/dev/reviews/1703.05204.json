Since human judgments are often inconsistent, many studies focused on the ways how to express and measure this inconsistency, and several inconsistency indices were proposed as an alternative to Saaty inconsistency index and inconsistency ratio for reciprocal pairwise comparisons matrices. This paper aims to: firstly, introduce a new measure of inconsistency of pairwise comparisons and to prove its basic properties; secondly, to postulate an additional axiom, an upper boundary axiom, to an existing set of axioms; and the last, but not least, the paper provides proofs of satisfaction of this additional axiom by selected inconsistency indices as well as it provides their numerical comparison.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 15:19:28 GMT  (107kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05204v1", "13 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 07:46:02 GMT  (107kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05204v2", "13 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jiri mazurek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05204"}
