This system is basically used for time series forecasting. This system may be considered as a pool of elements that process data in a parallel manner. The proposed evolving system may provide online processing data streams.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:28:43 GMT  (394kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06486v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["zhengbing hu", "yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "olena o boiko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06486"}
