We approach the problem of learning synthetic driving using generative neural networks. The main idea is to make a controller trainer network using images plus key press data to mimic human learning. We used the architecture of a stable GAN to make predictions between driving scenes using key presses. We train our model on one video game (Road Rash) and tested the accuracy and compared it by running the model on other maps in Road Rash to determine the extent of learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 05:01:39 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08788v1", "5 pages; 4 figures; Accepted at the Deep Learning for Action and Interaction Workshop, 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain; All authors have equal contribution"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages; 4 figures; Accepted at the Deep Learning for Action and Interaction Workshop, 30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain; All authors have equal contribution", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["arna ghosh", "biswarup bhattacharya", "somnath basu roy chowdhury"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08788"}
