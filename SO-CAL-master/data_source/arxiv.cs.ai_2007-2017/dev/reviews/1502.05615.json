In particular, there are two characteristic features of intelligence that are essential for knowledge development: forgetting and consolidation. Both plays an important role in knowledge bases and learning systems to avoid possible information overflow and redundancy, and in order to preserve and strengthen important or frequently used rules and remove (or forget) useless ones. We present an incremental, long-life view of knowledge acquisition which tries to improve task after task by determining what to keep, what to consolidate and what to forget, overcoming The Stability-Plasticity dilemma. In order to do that, we rate rules by introducing several metrics through the first adaptation, to our knowledge, of the Minimum Message Length (MML) principle to a coverage graph, a hierarchical assessment structure which treats evidence and rules in a unified way. The metrics are not only used to forget some of the worst rules, but also to set a consolidation process to promote those selected rules to the knowledge base, which is also mirrored by a demotion system. We evaluate the framework with a series of tasks in a chess rule learning domain.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 16:25:49 GMT  (5384kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05615v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fernando mart\\'inez-plumed", "c\\`esar ferri", "jos\\'e hern\\'andez-orallo", "mar\\'ia jos\\'e ram\\'irez-quintana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05615"}
