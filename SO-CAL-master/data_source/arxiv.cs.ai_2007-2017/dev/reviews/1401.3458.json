{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Jan-2014", "title": "Solving #SAT and Bayesian Inference with Backtracking Search", "abstract": "Inference in Bayes Nets (BAYES) is an important problem with numerous applications in probabilistic reasoning. Counting the number of satisfying assignments of a propositional formula (#SAT) is a closely related problem of fundamental theoretical importance. Both these problems, and others, are members of the class of sum-of-products (SUMPROD) problems. In this paper we show that standard backtracking search when augmented with a simple memoization scheme (caching) can solve any sum-of-products problem with time complexity that is at least as good any other state-of-the-art exact algorithm, and that it can also achieve the best known time-space tradeoff. Furthermore, backtracking's ability to utilize more flexible variable orderings allows us to prove that it can achieve an exponential speedup over other standard algorithms for SUMPROD on some instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:17:49 GMT  (474kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3458v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fahiem bacchus", "shannon dalmao", "toniann pitassi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3458"}
