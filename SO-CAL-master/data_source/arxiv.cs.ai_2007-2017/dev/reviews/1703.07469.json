Recently, two competing approaches for automatic program learning have received significant attention: (1) neural program synthesis, where a neural network is conditioned on input/output (I/O) examples and learns to generate a program, and (2) neural program induction, where a neural network generates new outputs directly using a latent program representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 23:29:47 GMT  (1571kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07469v1", "8 pages + 9 pages of supplementary material"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages + 9 pages of supplementary material", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["jacob devlin", "jonathan uesato", "surya bhupatiraju", "rishabh singh", "abdel-rahman mohamed", "pushmeet kohli"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.07469"}
