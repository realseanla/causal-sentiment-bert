They become an efficient tool for knowledge representation in a structured manner. There is always more than one ontology for the same domain. Furthermore, there is no standard method for building ontologies, and there are many ontology building tools using different ontology languages. Because of these reasons, interoperability between the ontologies is very low. Current ontology tools mostly use functions to build, edit and inference the ontology. Methods for merging heterogeneous domain ontologies are not included in most tools. This paper presents ontology merging methodology for building a single global ontology from heterogeneous eXtensible Markup Language (XML) data sources to capture and maintain all the knowledge which XML data sources can contain", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 May 2013 10:53:07 GMT  (261kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.7058v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["nora y ibrahim", "sahar a mokhtar", "hany m harb"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.7058"}
