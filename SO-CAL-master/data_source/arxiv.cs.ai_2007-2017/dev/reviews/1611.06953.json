Generative adversarial network (GAN) framework has a discriminator and a generator network. The generator (G) maps white noise (z) to data samples while the discriminator (D) maps data samples to a single scalar. To do so, G learns how to map from high-level representation space to data space, and D learns to do the opposite. We argue that higher-level representation spaces need not necessarily follow a uniform probability distribution. In this work, we use Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) as a higher-level associative memory and learn the probability distribution for the high-level features generated by D. The associative memory samples its underlying probability distribution and G learns how to map these samples to data space. The proposed associative adversarial networks (AANs) are generative models in the higher-levels of the learning, and use adversarial non-stochastic models D and G for learning the mapping between data and higher-level representation spaces. Experiments show the potential of the proposed networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 02:11:40 GMT  (1388kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06953v1", "NIPS 2016 Workshop on Adversarial Training"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2016 Workshop on Adversarial Training", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["tarik arici", "asli celikyilmaz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06953"}
