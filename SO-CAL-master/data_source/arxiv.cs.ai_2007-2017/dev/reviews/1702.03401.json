It solves all the perceived drawbacks of SSS*, finally transforming it into a practical algorithm. In effect, we show that SSS* = alpha-beta + ransposition tables. The crucial step is the realization that transposition tables contain so-called solution trees, structures that are used in best-first search algorithms like SSS*. Having created a practical version, we present performance measurements with tournament game-playing programs for three different minimax games, yielding results that contradict a number of publications. (B) Based on the insights gained in our attempts at understanding SSS*, we present a framework that facilitates the construction of several best-first fixed- depth game-tree search algorithms, known and new. The framework is based on depth-first null-window Alpha-Beta search, enhanced with storage to allow for the refining of previous search results. It focuses attention on the essential differences between algorithms. (C) We present a new instance of the framework, MTD(f). It is well-suited for use with iterative deepening, and performs better than algorithms that are currently used in most state-of-the-art game-playing programs. We provide experimental evidence to explain why MTD(f) performs better than the other fixed-depth minimax algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 11 Feb 2017 09:48:12 GMT  (672kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03401v1", "Report version of AI Journal article Best-first fixed-depth minimax algorithms 1996. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1404.1517"]], "COMMENTS": "Report version of AI Journal article Best-first fixed-depth minimax algorithms 1996. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1404.1517", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["aske plaat", "jonathan schaeffer", "wim pijls", "arie de bruin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03401"}
