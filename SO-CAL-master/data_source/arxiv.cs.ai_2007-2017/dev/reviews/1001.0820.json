We design a similar framework for several algorithms that generate answer sets for logic programs: Smodels, Smodels-cc, Asp-Sat with Learning (Cmodels), and a newly designed and implemented algorithm Sup. This approach to describing answer set solvers makes it easier to prove their correctness, to compare them, and to design new systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 05:53:29 GMT  (191kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0820v1", "Long version of the paper that will appear in special issue of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming"]], "COMMENTS": "Long version of the paper that will appear in special issue of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["yuliya lierler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.0820"}
