An evolutionary algorithm is used to form a diverse ensemble of base learners, which are then aggregated by a stacking ensemble. This methodology allows for an efficient prediction of different attributes of Go players from sets of their games. These attributes can be fairly general, in this work, we used the strength and style of the players.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 10:37:04 GMT  (96kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09254v1", "Published in 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in 2015 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["josef moud\\v{r}\\'ik", "roman neruda"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.09254"}
