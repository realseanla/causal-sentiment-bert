{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Mar-2015", "title": "Interpolating Convex and Non-Convex Tensor Decompositions via the Subspace Norm", "abstract": "We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank tensor from a noisy observation. Previous work has shown $O(n^{\\lceil K/2\\rceil/2})$ recovery guarantee for recovering a $K$th order rank one tensor of size $n\\times ...\\times n$ by an algorithm called recursive unfolding. In this paper, we first improve this to $O(n^{K/4})$ by a much simpler approach but with a more careful analysis. Then we propose a new norm based on the Kronecker products of factors obtained by the proposed simple estimator. The imposed Kronecker structure of the new norm allows us to show a nearly ideal $O(\\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{m})$ bound for the proposed subspace norm, in which the parameter $m$ controls the blend from the non-convex estimator to mode-wise nuclear norm minimization. Furthermore we empirically demonstrate that with $m=O(1)$, the proposed norm achieves near ideal denoising performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 16:45:04 GMT  (70kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05479v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 01:44:23 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05479v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML", "authors": ["qinqing zheng", "ryota tomioka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.05479"}
