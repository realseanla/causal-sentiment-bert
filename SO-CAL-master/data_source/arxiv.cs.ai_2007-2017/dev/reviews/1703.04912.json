In this study here, we present two new sets of belief change operators for logic programs. They focus on preserving the explicit relationships expressed in the rules of a program, a feature that is missing in purely semantic approaches that consider programs only in their entirety. In particular, operators of the latter class fail to satisfy preservation and support, two important properties for belief change in logic programs required to ensure intuitive results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 03:53:25 GMT  (93kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04912v1", "44 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Computational Logic"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 00:56:18 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04912v2", "44 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Computational Logic"]], "COMMENTS": "44 pages, submitted to ACM Transactions on Computational Logic", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["sebastian binnewies", "zhiqiang zhuang", "kewen wang", "bela stantic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.04912"}
