In this paper, we study the complexity of planning in the class C_n of planning problems, characterized by unary operators and directed path causal graphs. Although this is one of the simplest forms of causal graphs a planning problem can have, we show that planning is intractable for C_n (unless P = NP), even if the domains of state variables have bounded size. In particular, we show that plan existence for C_n^k is NP-hard for k&gt;=5 by reduction from CNFSAT. Here, k denotes the upper bound on the size of the state variable domains. Our result reduces the complexity gap for the class C_n^k to cases k=3 and k=4 only, since C_n^2 is known to be tractable.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 05:25:29 GMT  (592kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3467v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["omer gim\\'enez", "ers jonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3467"}
