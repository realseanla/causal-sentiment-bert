The combination sheds new light on the question of how artificial agents can act in a dynamically consistent manner. The notion of sequential consistency is formalized by adapting the law of iterated expectation for plausibility measures. The necessary and sufficient condition for a certainty equivalence operator for Nehring-Puppe's preference to be sequentially consistent is given. This result sheds light on the models of decision making under uncertainty.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 16:41:17 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3721v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["phan h giang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3721"}
