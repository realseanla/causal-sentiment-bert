The significance of the characterization is twofold. First, we are able to easily prove several new invariant properties of theoretical interest for equivalent structures. Second, we use the characterization to derive an efficient algorithm that identifies all of the compelled edges in a structure. Compelled edge identification is of particular importance for learning Bayesian network structures from data because these edges indicate causal relationships when certain assumptions hold.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 15:19:42 GMT  (391kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4938v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Eleventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1995)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["david maxwell chickering"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4938"}
