We first relate CRFs and structured SVMs and show that in CRFs a variant of the log-partition function, known as soft-max, smoothly approximates the hinge loss function of structured SVMs. We then propose an intuitive approximation for the structured prediction problem, using duality, based on local entropy approximations and derive an efficient message-passing algorithm that is guaranteed to converge to the optimum for concave entropy approximations. Unlike existing approaches, this allows us to learn efficiently graphical models with cycles and very large number of parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in an image denoising task. This task was previously solved by sharing parameters across cliques. In contrast, our algorithm is able to efficiently learn large number of parameters resulting in orders of magnitude better prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jun 2010 06:55:03 GMT  (968kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2899v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Jul 2012 18:22:27 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2899v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["tamir hazan", "raquel urtasun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.2899"}
