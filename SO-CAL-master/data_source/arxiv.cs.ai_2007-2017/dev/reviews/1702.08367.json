Unfortunately this learning problem is difficult, since determining the structure of the theory normally requires solving a discrete optimization problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach: a completely differentiable model for learning sets of first-order rules. The approach is inspired by a recently-developed differentiable logic, i.e. a subset of first-order logic for which inference tasks can be compiled into sequences of differentiable operations. Here we describe a neural controller system which learns how to sequentially compose the these primitive differentiable operations to solve reasoning tasks, and in particular, to perform knowledge base completion. The long-term goal of this work is to develop integrated, end-to-end systems that can learn to perform high-level logical reasoning as well as lower-level perceptual tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 16:44:38 GMT  (156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08367v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Jun 2017 04:17:58 GMT  (419kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08367v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["fan yang", "zhilin yang", "william w cohen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.08367"}
