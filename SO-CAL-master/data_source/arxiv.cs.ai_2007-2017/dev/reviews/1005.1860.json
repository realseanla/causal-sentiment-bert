Large and rich sets of features can cause existing algorithms to overfit because of a limited number of samples. We address this shortcoming using $L_1$ regularization in approximate linear programming. Because the proposed method can automatically select the appropriate richness of features, its performance does not degrade with an increasing number of features. These results rely on new and stronger sampling bounds for regularized approximate linear programs. We also propose a computationally efficient homotopy method. The empirical evaluation of the approach shows that the proposed method performs well on simple MDPs and standard benchmark problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 May 2010 15:24:36 GMT  (281kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1860v1", "Technical report corresponding to the ICML2010 submission of the same name"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 May 2010 14:19:17 GMT  (281kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1860v2", "Technical report corresponding to the ICML2010 submission of the same name"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical report corresponding to the ICML2010 submission of the same name", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marek petrik", "gavin taylor", "ronald parr", "shlomo zilberstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1005.1860"}
