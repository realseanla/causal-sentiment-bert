To do it some methods of structure learning from data and simulation of Bayesian networks are inserted inside Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDA). EDA are a new tool for evolutionary computation in which populations of individuals are created by estimation and simulation of the joint probability distribution of the selected individuals. We propose new approaches to EDA for combinatorial optimization based on the theory of probabilistic graphical models. Experimental results are also presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 15:51:14 GMT  (414kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3871v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Sixteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2000)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS", "authors": ["pedro larra\\~naga", "ramon etxeberria", "jose a lozano", "jose m pena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3871"}
