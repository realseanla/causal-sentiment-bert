These semantic similarities constitute acausal connections according to the Synchronicity principle and provide new relationships to quantum like probabilistic graphical models. As a consequence, beliefs (or any other event) can be represented in vector spaces, in which quantum parameters are determined by the similarities that these vectors share between them. Events attached by a semantic meaning do not need to have an explanation in terms of cause and effect.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 17:37:01 GMT  (564kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06973v1", "In proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Quantum Interactions, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "In proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Quantum Interactions, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["catarina moreira", "andreas wichert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06973"}
