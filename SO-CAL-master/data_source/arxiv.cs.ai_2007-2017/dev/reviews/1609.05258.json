However, such challenge events occur only occasionally, are limited to a small number of contestants, and the test conditions are very difficult to replicate after the main event. We present a new physical benchmark challenge for robotic picking. The ACRV Picking Benchmark is designed to be reproducible by using a set of 42 common objects, a widely available shelf, and exact guidelines for object arrangement using stencils. A well-defined evaluation protocol enables the comparability of complete robotic systems -- including perception and manipulation -- instead of sub-systems only. Our paper describes this new benchmark challenge and presents results acquired by a baseline system based on a Baxter robot.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 00:07:54 GMT  (9167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05258v1", "7 pages, submitted to RA:Letters"], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Dec 2016 09:06:49 GMT  (9158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05258v2", "8 pages, submitted to RA:Letters"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, submitted to RA:Letters", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.SY", "authors": ["j\\\"urgen leitner", "adam w tow", "jake e dean", "niko suenderhauf", "joseph w durham", "matthew cooper", "markus eich", "christopher lehnert", "ruben mangels", "christopher mccool", "peter kujala", "lachlan nicholson", "trung pham", "james sergeant", "liao wu", "fangyi zhang", "ben upcroft", "peter corke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05258"}
