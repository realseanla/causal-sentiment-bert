Applying ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve this problem is rarely reported. The method of applying ACO to solve extremum problem is explored in this paper. Experiment shows that the solution error of the method presented in this paper is less than 10^-8. keywords: Extremum Problem; Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2009 03:34:19 GMT  (704kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3209v1", "23 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["chao-yang pang", "hui liu", "xia li", "yun-fei wang", "ben-qiong hu"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.3209"}
