The proposed semantics is based on fuzzy sets of interpretations. It is tolerant to partial inconsistency. Satisfiability is extended from interpretations to fuzzy sets of interpretations, each fuzzy set representing a possibility distribution describing what is known about the state of the world. A possibilistic knowledge base is then viewed as a set of possibility distributions that satisfy it. The refutation method of automated deduction in possibilistic logic, based on previously introduced generalized resolution principle is proved to be sound and complete with respect to the proposed semantics, including the case of partial inconsistency.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:31:26 GMT  (516kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5727v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventh Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["jerome lang", "didier dubois", "henri prade"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5727"}
