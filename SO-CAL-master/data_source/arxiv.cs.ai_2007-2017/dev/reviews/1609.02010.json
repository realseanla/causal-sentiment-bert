Using this formalisation, logical connectives are replaced by encircled regions (circles and squares) and quantified variables are represented as \"identity\" lines. Although the expressive power is equivalent to that of QEL, the new representation can be useful for illustrative or educational purposes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 15:07:21 GMT  (212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02010v1", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LO", "authors": ["pedro cabalar", "carlos p\\'erez", "gilberto p\\'erez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02010"}
