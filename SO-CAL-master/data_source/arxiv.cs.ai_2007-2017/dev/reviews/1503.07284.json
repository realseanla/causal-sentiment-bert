In an SMS based search system, one of the key problems is to identify a domain (broad topic) associated with the user query; so that a more comprehensive search can be carried out by the domain specific search engine. In this paper we use a rule based approach, to identify the domain, called Short Query Intent Identification System (SQIIS). We construct two different rule-bases using different strategies to suit query intent identification. We evaluate the two rule-bases experimentally.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Mar 2015 05:35:05 GMT  (488kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07284v1", "5 pages, 2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP)"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2010 International Conference on Signal and Image Processing (ICSIP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI", "authors": ["arijit de", "sunil kumar kopparapu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07284"}
