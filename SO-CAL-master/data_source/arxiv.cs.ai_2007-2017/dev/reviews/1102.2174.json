We prove that LTL is equivalent to a particular class of schemata in the sense that polynomial-time translation algorithms exist from one logic to the other. Not only does this result shed new light on the expressive power of propositional schemata, but it also entails the new result that the satisfiability of the considered class of schemata is PSPACE-complete. We informally compare the resulting proof procedures for each logic (opposing the direct approaches to the translation-based ones). The encoding from schemata to LTL makes the Wolper procedure for LTL very close to the standard tableaux procedure for schemata. The reverse encoding surprisingly makes the latter procedure very close to the one-pass Schwendimann algorithm for LTL.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 17:08:41 GMT  (49kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2174v1", "Extended version of a paper submitted at CADE 2011: contains proofs, additional examples and figures; 34 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 19 Apr 2011 13:15:36 GMT  (47kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2174v2", "Extended version of a paper submitted at TIME 2011: contains proofs, additional examples &amp; figures, additional comparison between classical LTL/schemata algorithms up to the provided translations, and an example of how to do model checking with schemata; 36 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper submitted at CADE 2011: contains proofs, additional examples and figures; 34 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI", "authors": ["vincent aravantinos", "ricardo caferra", "nicolas peltier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2174"}
