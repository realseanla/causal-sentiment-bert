One of the most interesting recent open-ended question answering challenges is Visual Question Answering (VQA) which attempts to evaluate a system's visual understanding through its answers to natural language questions about images. There exist many approaches to VQA, the majority of which do not exhibit deeper semantic understanding of the candidate answers they produce. We study the importance of generating plausible answers to a given question by introducing the novel task of `Answer Proposal': for a given open-ended question, a system should generate a ranked list of candidate answers informed by the semantics of the question. We experiment with various models including a neural generative model as well as a semantic graph matching one. We provide both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations for the task of Answer Proposal, showing that our best model learns to propose plausible answers with a high recall and performs competitively with some other solutions to VQA.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 22:01:36 GMT  (3332kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06620v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 00:12:29 GMT  (3332kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06620v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV", "authors": ["omid bakhshandeh", "trung bui", "zhe lin", "walter chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06620"}
