In addition there are other problems that vary from one institution to another. This paper is intended to solve the problem of satisfying the teachers preferred schedule in a way that regards the importance of the teacher to the supervising institute, i.e. his score according to some criteria. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been presented as an elegant method in solving timetable problem (TTP) in order to produce solutions with no conflict. In this paper, we consider the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to efficiently obtain a score for each teacher, and consequently produce a GA-based TTP solution that satisfies most of the teachers preferences.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Sep 2014 09:30:48 GMT  (146kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2650v1", "International Journal of Software Engineering &amp; Applications (IJSEA), Vol.5, No.4, July 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Software Engineering &amp; Applications (IJSEA), Vol.5, No.4, July 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["ihab sbeity", "mohamed dbouk", "habib kobeissi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.2650"}
