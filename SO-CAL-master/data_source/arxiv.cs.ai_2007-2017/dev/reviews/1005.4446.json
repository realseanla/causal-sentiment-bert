We describe the game in detail, before presenting a suitable encoding scheme and fitness function for candidate solutions. We then compare the performance of the genetic algorithm with that of the A* algorithm. Our results show that the GA is competitive with informed search in terms of solution quality, and significantly out-performs it in terms of computational resource requirements. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our findings for game solving and other \"real world\" problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 May 2010 22:15:57 GMT  (2609kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4446v1", "Submitted"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI", "authors": ["jack coldridge", "martyn amos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.4446"}
