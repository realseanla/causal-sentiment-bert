These conditions are grouped into shapes, which validate whether particular RDF terms each meet the constraints of the shape. Shapes are themselves expressed as RDF triples in an RDF graph, called a shapes graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 21:13:43 GMT  (11kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01795v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 13:10:02 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01795v2", "18 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["peter f patel-schneider"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01795"}
