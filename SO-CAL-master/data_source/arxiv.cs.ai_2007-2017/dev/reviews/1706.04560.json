First, we estimate the probability of \"interesting\" answers in a document using a neural model trained on a question-answering corpus. The predicted key phrases are then used as answers to condition a sequence-to-sequence question generation model. Empirically, our neural key phrase detection models significantly outperform an entity-tagging baseline system. We demonstrate that the question generator formulates good quality natural language questions from extracted key phrases. The resulting questions and answers can be used to assess reading comprehension in educational settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 16:06:18 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04560v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 17:43:48 GMT  (371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04560v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["sandeep subramanian", "tong wang", "xingdi yuan", "saizheng zhang", "adam trischler", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04560"}
