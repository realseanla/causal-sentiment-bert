Our model breaks the traditional symmetry of rational zero-sum games where players have exactly opposed goals (min vs. max), is more widely applicable than min-max and also supports a form of pruning, despite it being less effective than alpha-beta. Actually, min-max games may be seen as particular cases where both the game and its dual are tropical: when the dual of a tropical game is also tropical, the power of alpha-beta is completely recovered. We formally develop the model and prove that the tropical pruning strategy is correct, then conclude by showing how the problem of approximated parsing can be modeled as a tropical game, profiting from pruning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 May 2010 09:06:26 GMT  (65kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1475v1", "To appear in \"Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, 2010\"."], ["v2", "Tue, 11 May 2010 06:35:47 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1475v2", "To appear in \"Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, 2010\"."]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in \"Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation, 2010\".", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DM cs.GT cs.SC", "authors": ["jean-vincent loddo", "luca saiu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.1475"}
