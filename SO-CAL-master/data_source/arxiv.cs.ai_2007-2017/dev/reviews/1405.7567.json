In this paper we review these two processes and we give some real world examples with emphasis to the field of Medicine, where one can find some of the most common and useful CBR applications. We also underline the differences between CBR and the classical rule-induction algorithms, we discuss the criticism for CBR methods and we focus on the future trends of research in the area of CBR.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 May 2014 14:38:52 GMT  (1695kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7567v1", "47 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 124 references"]], "COMMENTS": "47 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 124 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["michael gr voskoglou", "abdel-badeeh m salem"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7567"}
