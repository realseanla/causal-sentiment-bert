The GLOH feature descriptor, one of the state-of-the-art feature descriptor, is used to capture the age-related local and spatial information of face image. As the exacted GLOH features are often redundant, MTL is designed to select the most informative feature bins for age estimation problem, while the corresponding weights are determined by ridge regression. This approach largely reduces the dimensions of feature, which can not only improve performance but also decrease the computational burden. Experiments on the public available FG-NET database show that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance over previous approaches while using much fewer features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 12:12:56 GMT  (68kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2749v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 6 May 2011 17:19:24 GMT  (116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.2749v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["yixiong liang", "lingbo liu", "ying xu", "yao xiang", "beiji zou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.2749"}
