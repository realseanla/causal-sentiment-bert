We argue that the problem lies in the mix-up of two interpretations of the extensive form game structures: game rules or game runs which do not always coincide. In this paper, we try to separate and connect these two views by proposing a dynamic epistemic framework in which we can compute the runs step by step from the game rules plus the given assumptions of the players. We propose a modal logic to describe players' knowledge and its change during the plays, and provide a complete axiomatization. We also show that, under certain conditions, the mix-up of the rules and the runs is not harmful due to the structural similarity of the two.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 15:01:18 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02078v1", "draft of a paper accepted by Studies in Logic (published by Sun Yat-Sen University)"]], "COMMENTS": "draft of a paper accepted by Studies in Logic (published by Sun Yat-Sen University)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LO", "authors": ["kai li", "yanjing wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.02078"}
