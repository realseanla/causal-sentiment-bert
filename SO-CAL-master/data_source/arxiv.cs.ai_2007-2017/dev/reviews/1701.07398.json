However, receptor density in the retina is not uniform: a small central region called the fovea is very dense and exhibits high resolution, whereas a peripheral region around it has much lower spatial resolution. Thus, contrary to our perception, we are only able to observe a very small region around the line of sight with high resolution. The perception of a complete and stable view is aided by an attention mechanism that directs the eyes to the numerous points of interest within the scene. The eyes move between these targets in quick, unconscious movements, known as \"saccades\". Once a target is centered at the fovea, the eyes fixate for a fraction of a second while the visual system extracts the necessary information. An artificial visual system was built based on a fully recurrent neural network set within a reinforcement learning protocol, and learned to attend to regions of interest while solving a classification task. The model is consistent with several experimentally observed phenomena, and suggests novel predictions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 09:07:59 GMT  (3394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07398v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["alon hazan", "yuval harel", "ron meir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07398"}
