To illustrate how these mechanisms can be harnessed to solve real-world problems, we present the blueprint of a T-cell inspired algorithm for computer security worm detection. We show how the three central T-cell processes, namely T-cell maturation, differentiation and proliferation, naturally map into this domain and further illustrate how such an algorithm fits into a complete immune inspired computer security system and framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 14:30:09 GMT  (248kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.2155v1", "14 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 4th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS)"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, 4th International Conference on Artificial Immune Systems (ICARIS)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.NE", "authors": ["jungwon kim", "william wilson", "uwe aickelin", "julie mcleod"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.2155"}
