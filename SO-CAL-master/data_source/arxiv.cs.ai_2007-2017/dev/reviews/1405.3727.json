Therefore, it becomes essential to develop efficient methods for prediction of the students at risk of dropping out, enabling the adoption of proactive process to minimize the situation. Thus, this research work propose a prototype machine learning tool which can automatically recognize whether the student will continue their study or drop their study using classification technique based on decision tree and extract hidden information from large data about what factors are responsible for dropout student. Further the contribution of factors responsible for dropout risk was studied using discriminant analysis and to extract interesting correlations, frequent patterns, associations or casual structures among significant datasets, Association rule mining was applied. In this study, the descriptive statistics analysis was carried out to measure the quality of data using SPSS 20.0 statistical software and application of decision tree and association rule were carried out by using WEKA data mining tool.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 May 2014 02:35:41 GMT  (1005kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3727v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1202.4815,arXiv:1203.3832,arXiv:1002.1144by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1202.4815,arXiv:1203.3832,arXiv:1002.1144by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI", "authors": ["sweta rai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3727"}
