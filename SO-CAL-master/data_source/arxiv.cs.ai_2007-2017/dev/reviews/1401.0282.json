Objective: This paper proposes GICoordinator. It is a GIS-based assistant software agent that assists and collaborates with the human planner in strategic planning and macro tasks assignment for centralized multi-agent coordination. Method: Our approach to design GICoordinator was to: analyze the problem, design a complete data model, design an architecture of GICoordinator, specify required capabilities of human and system in coordination problem solving, specify development tools, and deploy. Result: The result was an architecture/design of GICoordinator that contains system requirements. Findings: GICoordinator efficiently integrates geoinformatics with artifice intelligent techniques in order to provide a spatial intelligent coordinator system for an IC to efficiently coordinate and control agents by making macro/strategic decisions. Results define a framework for future works to develop this system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jan 2014 13:35:06 GMT  (226kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0282v1", "3 pages, 1 figure, In Workshop on Robots and Sensors integration in future rescue INformation system (ROSIN' 13).
