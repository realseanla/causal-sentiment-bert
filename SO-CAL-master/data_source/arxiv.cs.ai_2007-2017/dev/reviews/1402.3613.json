We focus on the problem of finding continuous coordinated paths for multiple mobile disc agents in a 2-d environment with polygonal obstacles. The problem is PSPACE-hard, with the state space growing exponentially in the number of agents. Therefore, the state of the art methods include mainly reactive techniques and sampling-based iterative algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Feb 2014 22:09:44 GMT  (1451kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3613v1", "Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2014)"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2014)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.RO", "authors": ["pavel janovsk\\'y", "michal \\v{c}\\'ap", "ji\\v{r}\\'i vok\\v{r}\\'inek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.3613"}
