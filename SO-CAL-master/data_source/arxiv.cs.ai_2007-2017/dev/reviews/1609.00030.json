In this paper we present a new approach to PDDL+ planning based on Constraint Answer Set Programming (CASP), i.e. ASP rules plus numerical constraints. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first attempt to link PDDL+ planning and logic programming. We provide an encoding of PDDL+ models into CASP problems. The encoding can handle non-linear hybrid domains, and represents a solid basis for applying logic programming to PDDL+ planning. As a case study, we consider the EZCSP CASP solver and obtain promising results on a set of PDDL+ benchmark problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 20:38:30 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00030v1", "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper presented at the 9th Workshop on Answer Set Programming and Other Computing Paradigms (ASPOCP 2016), New York City, USA, 16 October 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["marcello balduccini", "daniele magazzeni", "marco maratea"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00030"}
