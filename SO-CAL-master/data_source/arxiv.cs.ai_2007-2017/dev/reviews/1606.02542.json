Five datasets are provided, one of which is from a newly collected corpus of 20K midi files. We describe our preprocessing and cleaning pipeline, which includes the exclusion of a number of files based on scores from a previously developed probabilistic machine learning model. We also define training, testing and validation splits for the new dataset, based on a clustering scheme which we also describe. Some simple histograms are included.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 13:19:01 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02542v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.01368"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1606.01368", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI", "authors": ["christian walder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02542"}
