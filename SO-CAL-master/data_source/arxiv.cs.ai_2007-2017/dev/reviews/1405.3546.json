This task is computationally very hard, and there are programs for which computing cautious consequences is not viable in reasonable time. However, current ASP solvers produce the (whole) set of cautious consequences only at the end of their computation. This paper reports on strategies for computing cautious consequences, also introducing anytime algorithms able to produce sound answers during the computation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 15:46:33 GMT  (268kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3546v1", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 May 2014 09:27:38 GMT  (268kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3546v2", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming"], ["v3", "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 12:29:17 GMT  (268kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3546v3", "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["mario alviano", "carmine dodaro", "francesco ricca"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3546"}
