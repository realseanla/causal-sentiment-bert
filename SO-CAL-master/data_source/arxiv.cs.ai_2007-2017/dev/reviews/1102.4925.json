(1, 2)-QSAT, first introduced in SAT'08, can be seen as quantified extended 2-CNF formulas. Until now, within our knowledge, there exists no algorithm presenting the worst upper bound for (1, 2)-QSAT. Therefore in this paper, we present an exact algorithm to solve (1, 2)-QSAT. By analyzing the algorithms, we obtain a worst-case upper bound O(1.4142m), where m is the number of clauses.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 08:24:04 GMT  (467kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4925v1", "submitted to SAT11"], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Mar 2011 03:20:14 GMT  (467kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4925v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to SAT11", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC", "authors": ["minghao yin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.4925"}
