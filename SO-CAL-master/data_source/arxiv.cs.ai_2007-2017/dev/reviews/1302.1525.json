We examine variations of the \"incremental pruning\" method for solving this problem and compare them to earlier algorithms from theoretical and empirical perspectives. We find that incremental pruning is presently the most efficient exact method for solving POMDPs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:54:07 GMT  (982kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1525v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["anthony r cassandra", "michael l littman", "nevin lianwen zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1525"}
