This paper describes BayesDB, a probabilistic programming platform that aims to enable users to query the probable implications of their data as directly as SQL databases enable them to query the data itself. This paper focuses on four aspects of BayesDB: (i) BQL, an SQL-like query language for Bayesian data analysis, that answers queries by averaging over an implicit space of probabilistic models; (ii) techniques for implementing BQL using a broad class of multivariate probabilistic models; (iii) a semi-parametric Bayesian model-builder that auomatically builds ensembles of factorial mixture models to serve as baselines; and (iv) MML, a \"meta-modeling\" language for imposing qualitative constraints on the model-builder and combining baseline models with custom algorithmic and statistical models that can be implemented in external software. BayesDB is illustrated using three applications: cleaning and exploring a public database of Earth satellites; assessing the evidence for temporal dependence between macroeconomic indicators; and analyzing a salary survey.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 23:09:41 GMT  (8163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05006v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["vikash mansinghka", "richard tibbetts", "jay baxter", "pat shafto", "baxter eaves"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05006"}
