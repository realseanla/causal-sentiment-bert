Neurons in the output space are connected with each other but this structure remains fixed throughout training and learning is achieved through the updating of neuron reference vectors in feature space. Despite the fact that growing variants of SOM overcome the fixed structure limitation they increase computational cost and also do not allow the removal of a neuron after its introduction. In this paper, a variant of SOM is proposed called AMSOM (Adaptive Moving Self-Organizing Map) that on the one hand creates a more flexible structure where neuron positions are dynamically altered during training and on the other hand tackles the drawback of having a predefined grid by allowing neuron addition and/or removal during training. Experiments using multiple literature datasets show that the proposed method improves training performance of SOM, leads to a better visualization of the input dataset and provides a framework for determining the optimal number and structure of neurons.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 May 2016 16:41:00 GMT  (1370kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06047v1", "ICAART 2016 accepted full paper"]], "COMMENTS": "ICAART 2016 accepted full paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["gerasimos spanakis", "gerhard weiss"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06047"}
