The proposed model assumes that optimal transitions between tracks can be modelled and predicted by internal transitions within music tracks. We introduce modelling sequences of high-level music descriptors using RNNs and discuss an experiment involving different similarity functions, where the sequences are provided by a musical structural analysis algorithm. Qualitative observations show that the proposed approach can effectively model transitions of music tracks in playlists.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 11:07:56 GMT  (253kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02096v1", "4 pages, 2 figures, accepted to Workshop on Surprise, Opposition, and Obstruction in Adaptive and Personalized Systems (SOAP) 2016, Halifax, Canada"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 2 figures, accepted to Workshop on Surprise, Opposition, and Obstruction in Adaptive and Personalized Systems (SOAP) 2016, Halifax, Canada", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.MM cs.SD", "authors": ["keunwoo choi", "george fazekas", "mark sandler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02096"}
