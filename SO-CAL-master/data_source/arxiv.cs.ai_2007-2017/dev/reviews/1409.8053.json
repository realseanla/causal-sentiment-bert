The main attractions of this approach are: a format for representing diseases that is simple and intuitive; an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties in diagnostic information; the simplicity of storing statistical information as frequencies of occurrence of diseases; a method for evaluating alternative diagnostic hypotheses that yields true probabilities; and a framework that should facilitate unsupervised learning of medical knowledge and the integration of medical diagnosis with other AI applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 10:11:31 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8053v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["j gerard wolff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8053"}
