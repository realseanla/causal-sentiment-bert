The following basic system bottlenecks detection problems are examined: (1) traditional quality management approaches (Pareto chart based method, multicriteria analysis as selection of Pareto-efficient points, and/or multicriteria ranking), (2) selection of critical system elements (critical components/modules, critical component interconnection), (3) selection of interconnected system components as composite system faults (via clique-based fusion), (4) critical elements (e.g., nodes) in networks, and (5) predictive detection of system bottlenecks (detection of system components based on forecasting of their parameters). Here, heuristic solving schemes are used. Numerical examples illustrate the approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Jun 2013 17:22:00 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0128v1", "12 pp., tables 4, figures 15"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pp., tables 4, figures 15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SY", "authors": ["mark sh levin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.0128"}
