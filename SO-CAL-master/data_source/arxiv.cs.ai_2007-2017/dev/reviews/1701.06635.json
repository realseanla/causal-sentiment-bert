We introduce a graph model that captures the spatial and temporal variability of ride requests and the potentials for ride pooling. We discover these ride request graphs exhibit a well known property called densification power law often found in real graphs modelling human behaviors. We show the pattern of ride requests and the potential of ride pooling for a city can be characterized by the densification factor of the ride request graphs. Previous works have shown that it is possible to automatically generate synthetic versions of these graphs that exhibit a given densification factor. We present an algorithm for automatic generation of synthetic ride request graphs that match quite well the densification factor of ride request graphs from actual ride request data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 21:18:33 GMT  (9956kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06635v1", "Accepted at AAAI-17 Workshop on AI and OR for Social Good (AIORSocGood-17)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at AAAI-17 Workshop on AI and OR for Social Good (AIORSocGood-17)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["abhinav jauhri", "brian foo", "jerome berclaz", "chih chi hu", "radek grzeszczuk", "vasu parameswaran", "john paul shen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.06635"}
