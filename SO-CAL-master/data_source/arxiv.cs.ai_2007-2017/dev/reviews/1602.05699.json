However, some rules in ontologies might be unreliable if they are extracted from ontology learning or written by unskillful knowledge engineers. In this paper we present a framework of handling inconsistent existential rules under stable model semantics, which is defined by a notion called rule repairs to select maximal components of the existential rules. Surprisingly, for R-acyclic existential rules with R-stratified or guarded existential rules with stratified negations, both the data complexity and combined complexity of query answering under the rule {repair semantics} remain the same as that under the conventional query answering semantics. This leads us to propose several approaches to handle the rule {repair semantics} by calling answer set programming solvers. An experimental evaluation shows that these approaches have good scalability of query answering under rule repairs on realistic cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Feb 2016 07:23:28 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05699v1", "Accepted by AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["hai wan", "heng zhang", "peng xiao", "haoran huang", "yan zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.05699"}
