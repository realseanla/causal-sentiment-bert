Know-how available on the Web, such as step-by-step instructions, is largely unstructured and isolated from other sources of online knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we propose extending to procedural knowledge the benefits that Linked Data has already brought to representing, retrieving and reusing declarative knowledge. We describe a framework for representing generic know-how as Linked Data and for automatically acquiring this representation from existing resources on the Web. This system also allows the automatic generation of links between different know-how resources, and between those resources and other online knowledge bases, such as DBpedia. We discuss the results of applying this framework to a real-world scenario and we show how it outperforms existing manual community-driven integration efforts.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 13:52:12 GMT  (230kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04506v1", "The 19th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW 2014), 24-28 November 2014, Link\\\"oping, Sweden"]], "COMMENTS": "The 19th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW 2014), 24-28 November 2014, Link\\\"oping, Sweden", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["paolo pareti", "benoit testu", "ryutaro ichise", "ewan klein", "adam barker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04506"}
