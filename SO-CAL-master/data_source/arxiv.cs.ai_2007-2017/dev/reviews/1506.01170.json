We conceptualise this problem formally using a game-theoretic model, called the stochastic Bayesian game, in which the behaviour of a player is determined by its private information, or type. Based on this model, we derive a solution, called Harsanyi-Bellman Ad Hoc Coordination (HBA), which utilises the concept of Bayesian Nash equilibrium in a planning procedure to find optimal actions in the sense of Bellman optimal control. We evaluate HBA in a multiagent logistics domain called level-based foraging, showing that it achieves higher flexibility and efficiency than several alternative algorithms. We also report on a human-machine experiment at a public science exhibition in which the human participants played repeated Prisoner's Dilemma and Rock-Paper-Scissors against HBA and alternative algorithms, showing that HBA achieves equal efficiency and a significantly higher welfare and winning rate.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 09:12:58 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01170v1", "Technical Report, The University of Edinburgh, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report, The University of Edinburgh, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.MA", "authors": ["stefano v albrecht", "subramanian ramamoorthy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01170"}
