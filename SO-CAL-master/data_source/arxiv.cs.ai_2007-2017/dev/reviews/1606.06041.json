{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Jun-2016", "title": "Bandit-Based Random Mutation Hill-Climbing", "abstract": "The Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm is a direct search technique mostly used in discrete domains. It repeats the process of randomly selecting a neighbour of a best-so-far solution and accepts the neighbour if it is better than or equal to it. In this work, we propose to use a novel method to select the neighbour solution using a set of independent multi- armed bandit-style selection units which results in a bandit-based Random Mutation Hill-Climbing algorithm. The new algorithm significantly outperforms Random Mutation Hill-Climbing in both OneMax (in noise-free and noisy cases) and Royal Road problems (in the noise-free case). The algorithm shows particular promise for discrete optimisation problems where each fitness evaluation is expensive.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 09:53:29 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06041v1", "7 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.NE", "authors": ["jialin liu", "diego pe\\'rez-lie\\'bana", "simon m lucas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06041"}
