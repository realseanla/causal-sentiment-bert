We obtain many formal results that generalize the case where possibility and necessity functions are based on classical logic. We show how useful such an approach is by applying it to reasoning under uncertain and inconsistent information.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 14:14:08 GMT  (1029kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6788v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1994)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["philippe besnard", "jerome lang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6788"}
