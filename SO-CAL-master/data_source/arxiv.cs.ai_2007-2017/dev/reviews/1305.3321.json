We consider n-ary extensional constraints (table constraints). Our approach aims to reduce the size of the CSP by exploiting the structure of the constraints graph and of its associated microstructure. More precisely, we apply itemset mining techniques to search for closed frequent itemsets on these two representation. Using Tseitin extension, we rewrite the whole CSP to another compressed CSP equivalent with respect to satisfiability. Our approach contrast with previous proposed approach by Katsirelos and Walsh, as we do not change the structure of the constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 May 2013 23:17:49 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3321v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1304.4415"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1304.4415", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["said jabbour", "lakhdar sais", "yakoub salhi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.3321"}
