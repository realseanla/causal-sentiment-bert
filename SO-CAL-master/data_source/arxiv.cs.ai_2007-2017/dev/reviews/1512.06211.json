The verification of the newly added axiom is still one of trying and seeing what the reasoner says, because a systematic testbed for ontology authoring is missing. We sought to address this by introducing the approach of test-driven development for ontology authoring. We specify 36 generic tests, as TBox queries and TBox axioms tested through individuals, and structure their inner workings in an `open box'-way, which cover the OWL 2 DL language features. This is implemented as a Protege plugin so that one can perform a TDD test as a black box test. We evaluated the two test approaches on their performance. The TBox queries were faster, and that effect is more pronounced the larger the ontology is. We provide a general sequence of a TDD process for ontology engineering as a foundation for a TDD methodology.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Dec 2015 09:15:24 GMT  (308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06211v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["c maria keet", "agnieszka lawrynowicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06211"}
