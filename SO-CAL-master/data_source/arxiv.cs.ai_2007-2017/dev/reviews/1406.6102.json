It is mathematically shown that the average number of answer sets for a random program converges to a constant when the number of atoms approaches infinity. Several experimental results are also reported, which justify the suitability of the linear model. It is also experimentally shown that, under this model, the size distribution of answer sets for random programs tends to a normal distribution when the number of atoms is sufficiently large.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 22:23:11 GMT  (371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6102v1", "33 pages.
