The feature set developed for representing handwritten characters of Bangla alphabet includes 24 shadow features, 16 centroid features and 36 longest-run features. Recognition performances of the MLP designed to work with this feature set are experimentally observed as 86.46% and 75.05% on the samples of the training and the test sets respectively. The work has useful application in the development of a complete OCR system for handwritten Bangla text.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Mar 2012 12:22:23 GMT  (202kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0882v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI", "authors": ["subhadip basu", "nibaran das", "ram sarkar", "mahantapas kundu", "mita nasipuri", "dipak kumar basu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.0882"}
