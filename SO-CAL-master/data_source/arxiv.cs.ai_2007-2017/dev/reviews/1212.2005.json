{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Dec-2012", "title": "The Dynamic Controllability of Conditional STNs with Uncertainty", "abstract": "Recent attempts to automate business processes and medical-treatment processes have uncovered the need for a formal framework that can accommodate not only temporal constraints, but also observations and actions with uncontrollable durations. To meet this need, this paper defines a Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) that combines the simple temporal constraints from a Simple Temporal Network (STN) with the conditional nodes from a Conditional Simple Temporal Problem (CSTP) and the contingent links from a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU). A notion of dynamic controllability for a CSTNU is defined that generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CTP and the dynamic controllability of an STNU. The paper also presents some sound constraint-propagation rules for dynamic controllability that are expected to form the backbone of a dynamic-controllability-checking algorithm for CSTNUs.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 09:37:31 GMT  (42kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2005v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.SY", "authors": ["luke hunsberger", "roberto posenato", "carlo combi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.2005"}
