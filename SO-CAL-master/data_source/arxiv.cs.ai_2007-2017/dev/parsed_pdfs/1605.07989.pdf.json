A state is given by the particular assignment of values to these variables: S = {f = v | v ∈ D(f) ∀f ∈ F}. The value of variable f in state S is referred to as S(f). The action model A consists of operators a = 〈Ca, Ea〉 where Ca is the cost of the action, and Ea = {〈f, vo, vn〉 | f ∈ F ; vo, vn ∈ {−1} ∪D(f)} is the set of effects. The transition function δ(·) determines the next state after the application of action a to state S as -\nδ(a,S) = ⊥ if ∃〈f, vo, vn〉 ∈ Ea s.t. vo 6= −1 ∧ vo 6= S(f);\n= {f = vn∀〈f, vo, vn〉 ∈ Ea; else f = S(f)} otherwise."

The solution to the planning problem is a plan π = 〈a1, a2, . . .〉, π(i) = ai ∈ A such that δ(π, I) |= G, where the cumulative transition function is given by δ(π, S) = δ(〈a2, a3, . . .〉, δ(a1, S)). The cost of the plan is given by C(π) = ∑\na∈π Ca and an optimal plan π∗ is such that C(π∗) ≤ C(π) ∀π. The operator count for an action a given a plan π is given by λ(a, π) = |{i | a = π(i)}| and the total operator count of the plan λ(π) = |π|.\n1\nCompliant Variables.\nWe define compliant variables as those that whenever they occur as a precondition of an action, they must also be an effect, and vice versa. Thus, f ∈ F is compliant iff ∀a ∈ A, 〈f, vo, vn〉 ∈ Ea =⇒ vo 6= −1 ∧ vn 6= −1; f is referred to as rogue otherwise. Let Φ ⊆ F be the set of all compliant variables, and the set of compliant variables whose values are specified in the goal be φ ⊆ Φ, henceforth referred to as goal compliant conditions."

Also, let D be a vector of size m whose ith entry di is the change in a goal compliant f ∈ φ from the current state to the final state, i.e. di = vg − vc; vg = fi ∈ G, vc = fi ∈ S; and let x be a vector of size n, whose ith element is xi ∈ N. Then the following equality holds:\nMx = D (1)\nThe integer solution x∗ to this system of linear equations with the least |x∗| gives a lower bound on the operator counts required to solve the planning problem, i.e. |x∗| ≤ |π∗|. We can compute a real-valued approximation in closed-form, by\nmin ||Qx||2 2\n(2)\ns.t. Mx = D (3)\nusing the Lagrangian multiplier method for this optimization problem as follows -\nL(x) = 1\n2 ||Qx||2 + λT (D−Mx) (4)\n=⇒ x∗ = Q−2MT (MQ−2MT )−1D (5)\nHere Q is a n × n matrix of action costs whose ijth entry Qij = Cai if i = j; 0 otherwise (for unit cost domains) Q is an identity matrix and x∗ = MT (MMT )−1D The most costly operation here is the calculation of the pseudo inverse, which can be done in ≈ O(n2.3) time. Further, M is problem independent, and hence the factor Z = Q−2MT (MQ−2MT )−1 can be precomputed given an action model. Thus it follows that we can readily use ||QZD|| as a heuristic for state-space search.\nNote that this formulation can also determine infeasibility of goal reachability immediately (in domains where actions are not reversible this is extremely useful) when the system is unsolvable, as shown in Algorithm 1. Unfortunately, the use of the l2-norm, that helps us in obtaining the closed-form polynomial bound heuristic, also makes the heuristic inadmissible."

      "text" : "Since operator counts are integers, we would ideally want an integer solution to Eqn 4 (which makes the problem computationally intractable). Unfortunately, the polynomial bound Lagrangian method described above does not address this aspect giving rise to bad heuristic values for certain section of problems. To describe this problem geometrically, we consider a planning domain with two compliant operators (of unit cost), such that x =< x1, x2 >. If the plane inscribed by Mx = D in the two dimensional space is close two either of the axis, the l2 norm calculated above results in small fractional values, and hence a less informed heuristic. As can\nAlgorithm 1 Using OP-COUNT Heuristic for State-Space Search\nprocedure PRE-COMPUTE(Π) Compute M,Q Convert M to row echelon form → T is the transformation matrix, r is the rank Y ← M[1 : r, :], Z ← Q−2YT (YQ−2YT )−1\nprocedure h(S) = OP-COUNT(S,G) Compute D = G− S Compute T d = T×D and τ = Td[1 : r] if tdi 6= 0 ∀i ≥ r + 1 then No solution! else return ⌈Q× Z× τ⌉\nbe seen in the figure 1, the actual operator counts for the given example (with M = ( 15 4 ) and D = ( 12 )\n) should have been x1 = 0 and x2 = 3. But the l2 minimization results in small fractional values with x1 = 0.77 and x2 = 0.77, and the heuristic values of hl2 = 1.54 instead of |π∗| = 3.\nThus, we propose a different approximation method to obtain integer values for individual operator counts, remaining within the polynomial time bound.\nWe notice that in most cases n ≫ m and also n ≫ |x∗| due to the combinatorial explosion during grounding of domains. Thus, we propose an operator count heuristic that exploits this knowledge about the sparsity of x∗. Ideally, we would like to solve the following problem,\nmin |x|l0 s.t. Mx = D\nx 0\nsince minimizing the l0 norm results in the sparsest solution. But, we encounter two problems. Firstly, the optimal operator counts (x∗), although sparse, might not be the sparsest solution. Secondly, minimizing the l0 norm is NP-hard [5].\nThus, we draw upon compressed sensing techniques to enforce a level of sparsity when computing the vector x. To this end, we suggest minimization of l1-norm (l1-LP) or weighted l1-norm (ω-l1-LP) [4] to enforce positive integer solutions.\nGeometrically, as can be seen in figure 2 these norms produce a more informed heuristic (hl1 = 1.60 and hω−l1 = 3.4) for the aforementioned problem. This method tries to compress (minimize) the norm ball (or box for that matter) as much as possible till it fits in the plane Mx = D. The operator (dimension) that induces a tighter constraint (x1 in our case), limits the expansion of the norm ball, producing a less informed heuristic (hl1 = 1.60). The weighted l1-norm method addresses this problem by minimizing the l1-norm and iteratively penalizing the increase along the tightest dimension till convergence is reached or maximum number of iterations are achieved, resulting in a more informed heuristic (hω−l1 = 3.4).\nFor ω-l1-LP, we empirically observe that rounding up the individual operator counts produce a more informed heuristic. Thus, we arrive at a polynomial time proxy for integer solutions."

Each entry in the table represents the percentage difference in the initial state heuristic value and the optimal plan length averaged across the problems in each domain. The %-compliance column shows the average number of goal compliant predicates in the problems. Rows 1-3 show the performance of our heuristic on the original domains (‘-’ indicates that the heuristics could not be computed due to absence of any goal complaint variables). Rows 3-6 show the performance in domains where the %-compliance was increased (this was done by identifying instances in the action model where variables assume a don’t care condition, i.e. a value of -1, and replacing it with appropriate values as entailed by domain axioms). Finally, rows 6-9 show the performance of our heuristics in problems with more completely specified goals (which results in higher percentage compliance). As expected, our heuristic performs better as %-compliance increases across a particular domain.

We discussed the simplest version of this formulation here, but it can be easily extended to incorporate more informative features like landmarks [9]. A landmark constraint is added by simply subtracting the corresponding net change from D: di ← di − ka × (xn − xo) if 〈di, xo, xn〉 ∈ Ea and a ∈ A is an action landmark with cardinality ka; and the closed form solution remains valid. In fact in terms of plan recognition with operator counts, observations are landmarks and the same approach applies. This demonstrates the flexibility of our approach."

      "heading" : "Resource Constrained Interaction.",
      "text" : "The approach is especially relevant in the context of multi-agent interactions constrained by usage πα(η) of a shared resource η by a plan πα of an agent α. For example, in an adversarial setting, if an agent α2 wanted to stop α1 from executing its plan, all it needs to do is to ensure that ∃η s.t. πα1(η) + πα2(η) > |η|. Similarly, in a cooperative setting, if agent α2 wanted to ensure that α1’s plan succeeds, it would need to make sure that ∀η πα1(η) + πα2(η) ≤ |η|.\nIn fact, as resource variables are compliant, our approach may provide quick estimates of an agent’s intent without computing the entire plan.\nAcknowledgment.
