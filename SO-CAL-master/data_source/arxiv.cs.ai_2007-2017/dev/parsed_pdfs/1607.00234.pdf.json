They are totally different from other sets/logics/probabilities/statistics.\nWe extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is > 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is < 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component > 1 and other neutrosophic component < 0}.\nThis is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/ logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/ logic, or classical/ imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components.\nFlorentin Smarandache\n12"

      "text" : "In a given company a full-time employer works 40\nhours per week. Letâs consider the last week period.\nHelen worked part-time, only 30 hours, and the other 10 hours she was absent without payment; hence, her membership degree was 30/40 = 0.75 < 1.\nJohn worked full-time, 40 hours, so he had the membership degree 40/40 = 1, with respect to this company.\nBut George worked overtime 5 hours, so his membership degree was (40+5)/40 = 45/40 = 1.125 > 1. Thus, we need to make distinction between employees who work overtime, and those who work full-time or parttime. Thatâs why we need to associate a degree of membership strictly greater than 1 to the overtime workers.\nNow, another employee, Jane, was absent without pay for the whole week, so her degree of membership was 0/40 = 0.\nYet, Richard, who was also hired as a full-time, not only didnât come to work last week at all (0 worked hours), but he produced, by accidentally starting a devastating fire, much damage to the company, which was estimated at a value half of his salary (i.e. as he would have gotten for working 20 hours that week). Therefore, his membership degree has to be less that Janeâs (since Jane produced no damage). Whence, Richardâs degree of membership, with respect to this company, was - 20/40 = - 0.50 < 0. Thus, we need to make distinction between employees who produce damage, and those who produce profit, or produce neither damage no profit to the company.\nNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics\n13\nTherefore, the membership degrees > 1 and < 0 are real\nin our world, so we have to take them into consideration.\nThen, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic / Measure / Probability / Statistics etc. were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over- / Under- / Off -Logic, -Measure, - Probability, -Statistics etc. [Smarandache, 2007].\nMany practical obvious examples are presented in this book, in order to show that in our everyday life we continuously deal with neutrosophic over-/under-/offtheory and applications.\nFlorentin Smarandache\n14\nFeedback from the readers about this very new neutrosophic over- / under- / off- (âset, âlogic, âmeasure, â probability, âstatistics) and their applications is very welcomed by the author.\nProf. Florentin Smarandache, Ph D University of New Mexico Mathematics & Science Department 705 Gurley Ave., Gallup, NM 87301, USA E-mail: smarand@unm.edu http://fs.gallup.unm.edu/FlorentinSmarandache.htm\nNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics\n15"

      "heading" : "Introduction",
      "text" : "The idea of membership degree >1, for an element with respect to a set, came to my mind when I started teaching and doing scientific presentations at several Colleges and Universities in The United States since 1995.\nA student was considered full-time for a semester if he or she enrolled in five classes. Therefore, his/her membership was 1 or T(student) = 1.\nBut there were students enrolled in six classes as well (overloaded). Then a twinkle sparked in my mind: I thought it was normal to consider such studentâs membership degree greater than 1, or T(overload student) = 6\n5 = 1.2 > 1.\nSurely, this was in contradiction with the orthodoxy that the crisp membership degree of an element with respect to a set has to be â¤ 1.\nI dug more into the problem and looked for other examples and applications from our everyday life. I did not want to stick with the abstractness of the mathematics, but to be inspired from our concrete reality.\nI was even more shocked when I discovered examples of membership degree < 0 of an element with respect to a set.\nFor example, letâs consider the set of spy agents of a\ncountry against an enemy country.\nA full-time spy, working only for his country, has the degree of membership equals to 1 with respect to the set of spy agents in his country. He is productive.\nBut a double-agent, that leaks highly classified information to the enemy country, while to his country he provides false information about the enemy country,\nFlorentin Smarandache\n20\nproduces much damage to his country (he is counterproductive), hence he has a negative membership degree with respect to the set of spy agents of his country, since he actually belongs to the set of spy agents of the enemy country, thus T(double-agent) < 0. He is counter-productive.\nAt that time, I was also struggling to convince people about the viability of neutrosophic set and neutrosophic logic, i.e. that the sum of the crisp neutrosophic components\n\uD835\uDC47 + \uD835\uDC3C + \uD835\uDC39 can exceed 1,\neven more, that the sum\n\uD835\uDC47 + \uD835\uDC3C + \uD835\uDC39 can be extended to 3\nwhen the three sources that provide us information about T (degree of membership / truth), I (degree of indeterminacy regarding the membership / truth), and respectively F (degree of nonmembership / falsehood) are independent, while fuzzy set and fuzzy logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set and intuitionistic fuzzy logic, in addition of classical probability did not allow this.\nIt took me about three years (1995-1998) to little by little move the thinking out from the routine of upper bound = 1.\nI was criticized that I âignored the elementary things about probability,â i.e. that the sum of space probabilities is equal to 1. But this is true for objective classical probability, not for subjective probability.\nâNeutrosophicâ means based on three components T, I, and F; and âoffsetâ means behind/beside the set on both sides of the interval [0, 1], over and under, more and less, supra and below, out of, off the set. Similarly, for âofflogicâ, âoffmeasureâ, âoffprobabilityâ, âoffstatisticsâ etc.\nNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics\n21\nIt is like a pot with boiling liquid, on a gas stove, when the liquid swells up and leaks out of pot. The pot (the interval [0, 1]) can no longer contain all liquid (i.e., all neutrosophic truth / indeterminate / falsehood values), and therefore some of them fall out of the pot (i.e., one gets neutrosophic truth / indeterminate / falsehood values which are > 1), or the pot cracks on the bottom and the liquid pours down (i.e., one gets neutrosophic truth / indeterminate / falsehood values which are < 0).\nMathematically, they mean getting values off the interval\n[0, 1].\nThe American aphorism âthink outside the boxâ has a perfect resonance to the neutrosophic offset, where the box is the interval [0, 1], yet values outside of this interval are permitted.\nNeutrosophic Overset, Neutrosophic Underset, and Neutrosophic Offset Similarly for Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off- Logic, Probability, and Statistics\n23"

The norm for a full-time worker is 20 electronic devices\nper week.\nThe companyâs policy is the following: - for each electronic device constructed correctly, the employee gets 1 point (at 20 points the employee gets a fullsalary);\n- for an electronic device not constructed, the\nemployee gets no points;\n- for each electronic device constructed wrongly, the employee loses 2 points (1 point for the wasted material, and 1 point for the labor/time used in building a wrong device);\n- the employee also loses points for other damages\ndone to the company;\nFlorentin Smarandache\n80\n- the employee gains points for other benefits\n(besides electronic devices) brought to the company.\nThe neutrosophic overset is: \uD835\uDC42 = {all Inventica employees}. The attribute â\uD835\uDC4Eâ = working (\uD835\uDC64). The set of all attributeâs values is \uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC4E = \uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC64 = [\uD835\uDC4F, \uD835\uDC50], with \uD835\uDC4F â¤ â40 and \uD835\uDC50 â¥ 20, which is numerical and continuous. We also considered the case when an electronic device was not finished at the end of the week, so only a part of it done. Otherwise weâd take a discrete set.\nTherefore, the minimum underlimit is â¤ â40, i.e. in the\nsituation when a worker produces wrong electronic devices, but the damage can be done even at a higher proportion (destroying tools, etc.).\nIn the history of the company, the worst damage has been done two years ago by Jack (-45) who has produced defected electronic devices and destroyed several tools.\nThe maximum overlimit is > 20, for employees working\nfaster, or doing overtime.\nOne studies record in the history of the company. Suppose an employee, Thom, has produced 30 electronic\ndevices last year in the first week of February.\nWe readjust the set of attributeâs values: \uD835\uDC49\uD835\uDC64 = [\uD835\uDC4F, \uD835\uDC50], with \uD835\uDC4F â¤ â45 and \uD835\uDC50 â¥ 30.

In this example, the thresholds are the same for the indeterminate-value function, as indeterminate lowerthreshold one has\n\uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC3C \uD835\uDC3F = 0, such that \uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC3C \uD835\uDC3F) = \uD835\uDC56(0) = 0, and as indeterminate upper-threshold one has \uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC3C \uD835\uDC48 = 20, such that \uD835\uDC56(\uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC3C \uD835\uDC48) = \uD835\uDC56(20) = 1. And for the false-value function: there exists a false\nlower-threshold\n\uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC39 \uD835\uDC3F = 0, such that \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC39 \uD835\uDC3F) = \uD835\uDC53(0) = 0, and a false upper-threshold \uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC39 \uD835\uDC48 = 20, such that \uD835\uDC53(\uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC39 \uD835\uDC48) = \uD835\uDC53(20) = 1.

This is the most general definition of the complex neutrosophic set. The nonstandard subsets are used only to make distinction between âabsoluteâ and ârelativeâ truth, indeterminacy or falsehood in philosophy. A truth (or indeterminacy, or falsehood) is absolute if it occurs in all possible worlds (Leinitz), and relative if it occurs in at least one world. Since in science and technology we do not need âabsoluteâ or ârelativeâ, weâll be working only with standard real subsets, and with the standard real interval [0,1].

Paradoxist Mathematics, Department of Mathematics and\nComputer Sciences, Bloomsburg University, PA, USA, November 13, 1995, 11:00 a.m. - 12:30 p.m.\nNeutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Set and -Logic were defined for the first time by Smarandache in 1995 and published in 2007. They are totally different from other sets/logics/probabilities.\nHe extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is > 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is < 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e. some neutrosophic component > 1 and other neutrosophic component < 0}.\nThis is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/logic, or classical/imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components.\nExample of Neutrosophic Offset. In a given company a full-time employer works 40 hours per week. Letâs consider the last week period. Helen worked part-time, only 30 hours, and the other 10 hours she was absent without payment; hence, her membership degree was 30/40 = 0.75 < 1. John worked full-time, 40 hours, so he had the membership degree 40/40 = 1, with respect to this company. But George worked overtime 5 hours, so his membership degree was (40+5)/40 = 45/40 = 1.125 > 1. Thus, we need to make distinction between employees who work overtime, and those who work full-time or part-time. Thatâs why we need to associate a degree of membership strictly greater than 1 to the overtime workers.\nNow, another employee, Jane, was absent without pay for the whole week, so her degree of membership was 0/40 = 0.\nYet, Richard, who was also hired as a full-time, not only didnât come to work last week at all (0 worked hours), but he produced, by accidentally starting a devastating fire, much damage to the company, which was estimated at a value half of his salary (i.e. as he would have gotten for working 20 hours that week). Therefore, his membership degree has to be less that Janeâs (since Jane produced no damage). Whence, Richardâs degree of membership, with respect to this company, was - 20/40 = - 0.50 < 0.\nConsequently, we need to make distinction between employees who produce damage, and those who produce profit, or produce neither damage no profit to the company.\nTherefore, the membership degrees > 1 and < 0 are real in our world, so we have to take them into consideration.\nThen, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic/Measure/Probability/Statistics etc. were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Logic, -Measure, -Probability, -Statistics etc. [Smarandache, 2007]."
