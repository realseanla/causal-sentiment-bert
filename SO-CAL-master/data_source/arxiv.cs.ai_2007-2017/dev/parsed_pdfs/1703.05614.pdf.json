      "text" : "Knowledge graph is widely used for representing knowledge in artificial intelligence. A knowledge graph contains a set of entities denoted as E , and a set of relations denoted as R. Each knowledge in a knowledge graph is represented in a triple form (head, label, tail), which is typically denoted as (h, r, t), with h, t ∈ E and r ∈ R, meaning that h has a relation r to t.\nKnowledge graph usually suffers from incompleteness. A main task of knowledge graph research is to complete it by predicting potential relations based on existing observed triples. Traditional methods based on logic and symbols are neither tractable nor robust to deal with large-scale knowledge graphs. Recently, knowledge graph embedding is introduced to solve this problem by encoding entities and relations into continuous low-dimensional vectors, and to perform reasoning in a simple linear algebra way. Some representative knowledge graph embedding methods include TransE [1], TransH [5], TransR [3], TransD [2] and ManifoldE [6].\nAlthough these methods have achieved promising performance on knowledge graph completion, the existing single-thread implementations of them are time-consuming for large-scale knowledge graphs. Here, we design a unified parallel framework to parallelize these methods, which achieves a significant time reduction without influencing the accuracy. We name our framework as ParaGraphE, which provides a library for parallel knowledge graph embedding.

Here, we implement some representative knowledge graph embedding methods include TransE [1], TransH [5], TransR [3], TransD [2] and ManifoldE [6]. All these methods can be formulated with the loss in (1). The differences between these methods only lie in the score functions and constraints.\n• TransE [1]:\n– embeddings: k-dimensional vectors for both entities and relations. Let us denote the embeddings for h, r, t as h, r, t.\n– score function: s(h, r, t) = ‖h+ r− t‖.

Subscript p denotes the projection vectors. – score function: s(h, r, t) = ‖(h + hp>hrp) + r− (t + tp>trp))‖ – constraints: ‖h‖2 = 1, ‖t‖2 = 1, ‖r‖2 = 1, ‖h + hp>hrp‖2 ≤ 1, ‖t +\ntp >trp‖2 ≤ 1\n• SphereE [6]:\n– embeddings: k-dimensional vectors for both entities and relations, i.e., h, r, t ∈ Rk for h, r, t.\n– score function: s(h, r, t) = ‖M(h, r, t) − Dr2‖. M(h, r, t) = ‖h + r − t‖. Dr is a relation-specific parameter.\n– constraints: ‖h‖2 = 1, ‖t‖2 = 1, ‖r‖2 = 1.\nNote that SphereE is an implementation for the method “sphere” of the ManifoldE [6].

      "heading" : "3 Experiment Results",
      "text" : "We use 10 threads to run the experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets WN18 and FB15k. Table 1 lists the statistics of these two datasets.\nThe metrics for evaluation contain those popular metrics adopted in existing knowledge graph embedding papers. They are:\n• mr: the value of mean rank.\nThe experiment results are shown in Table 2 and Table 3. Here, “raw” denotes the metrics calculated on all corrupted triples, “filter” denotes the metrics calculated on corrupted triples without those already existing in knowledge graph.\nWe can find that all the accuracy is very close to the accuracy reported in the original papers, except for SphereE on FB15k where the original paper only reports a result using a polynomial kernel. We can also find that our implementations are much faster than those in the original papers.\nFigure 1 shows the change of epoch loss when running TransR on dataset FB15k with ParaGraphE by setting #threads = 1, 2, 5, 8, 10. Here, the epoch loss is the sum of rank-based hinge loss on the sampled triples in an epoch. We can find that adopting multi-thread learning does not change the convergence of the training procedure. Other embedding methods have similar phenomenon.\nFigure 2 shows the speedup of training TransR on both datasets with ParaGraphE by running 500 epoches. We can find that ParaGraphE achieves around 8x speedup with 10 threads (cores) on both datasets."

Our implementations of several existing methods can achieve a significant time reduction without influencing the accuracy.
