These outputs\ncomplement the explanation of tagging and evaluation of triplets. \n\n- Weaknesses:\n\nOne of the main contributions of this paper is a new tagging scheme described\nin Section 3.1, however there are already other schemes for NER and RE being\nused, such as IO, BIO and BILOU. \nDid the authors perform any experiment using other tagging scheme for this\nmethod?\nRegarding the dataset, in line 14, page 5, the authors cite the number of\nrelations (24), but they do not mention the number or the type of named\nentities.\nIn Section 4.1, the evaluation criteria of triplets are presented. These\ncriteria were based on previous work? As I see it, the stage of entity\nidentification is not complete if you consider only the head of the entity.\nRegarding example S3, shown in Table 3, the output of the LSTM-LSTM-Bias was\nconsidered correct? The text states that the relation role is wrong, although\nit is not clear if the relation role is considered in the evaluation. \n\n- General Discussion:\n\nThis paper proposes a novel tagging scheme and investigates the end-to-end\nmodels to jointly extract entities and relations. \nThe article is organized in a clear way and it is well written, which makes it\neasy to understand the proposed method.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "5", "CLARITY": "5", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "5"}], "abstract": "Joint extraction of entities and relations is an important task in information extraction. To tackle this problem, we firstly propose a novel tagging scheme that can convert the joint extraction task to a tagging problem.. Then, based on our tagging scheme, we study different end-to-end models to extract entities and their relations directly, without identifying entities and relations separately. We conduct experiments on a public dataset produced by distant supervision method and the experimental results show that the tagging based methods are better than most of the existing pipelined and joint learning methods. What\u2019s more, the end-to-end model proposed in this paper, achieves the best results on the public dataset.", "histories": [], "id": 222, "title": "Joint Extraction of Entities and Relations Based on a Novel Tagging Scheme"}
