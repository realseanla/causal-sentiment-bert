Method might be applicable for other\ndomains.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n\nNot much novelty in method.  Not quite clear if data set is general enough for\nother domains.\n\n- General Discussion:\n\nThis paper describes a rule-based method for generating additional\nweakly labeled data for event extraction.  The method has three main\nstages.  First, it uses Freebase to find important slot fillers\nfor matching sentences in Wikipedia (using all slot fillers is too\nstringent resulting in too few matches).  Next, it uses FrameNet to\nto improve reliability of labeling trigger verbs and to find nominal\ntriggers.  Lastly, it uses a multi-instance learning to deal with\nthe noisily generated training data.\n\nWhat I like about this paper is that it improves over the\nstate-of-the-art on a non-trival benchmark.  The rules involved\ndon't seem too obfuscated, so I think it might be useful for the\npractitioner who is interested to improve IE systems for other domains.  On\nthe other hand, some some manual effort is still needed, for example for\nmapping Freebase\nevent types to ACE event types (as written in Section 5.3 line 578).  This also\nmakes it difficult for future work to calibrate apple-to-apple against this\npaper.              Apart\nfrom this, the method also doesn't seem too novel.\n\nOther comments:\n\n- I'm also concern with the generalizability of this method to other\n  domains.  Section 2 line 262 says that 21 event types are selected\n  from Freebase.  How are they selected?  What is the coverage on the 33 event\ntypes\nin the ACE data.\n\n- The paper is generally well-written although I have some\n  suggestions for improvement.              Section 3.1 line 316 uses \"arguments\nliked time, location...\".  If you mean roles or arguments, or maybe\nyou want to use actual realizations of time and location as\nexamples.  There are minor typos, for e.g. line 357 is missing a\n\"that\", but this is not a major concern I have for this paper.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "5", "ORIGINALITY": "5", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "3", "CLARITY": "4", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}], "abstract": "Modern models of event extraction for tasks like ACE are based on supervised learning of events from small hand-labeled data. However, hand-labeled training data is expensive to produce, in low coverage of event types, and limited in size, which makes supervised methods hard to extract large scale of events for knowledge base population. To solve the data labeling problem, we propose to automatically label training data for event extraction via world knowledge and linguistic knowledge, which can detect key arguments and trigger words for each event type and employ them to label events in texts automatically. The experimental results show that the quality of our large scale automatically labeled data is competitive with elaborately human-labeled data. And our automatically labeled data can incorporate with human-labeled data, then improve the performance of models learned from these data.", "histories": [], "id": "350", "title": "Automatically Labeled Data Generation for Large Scale Event Extraction"}
