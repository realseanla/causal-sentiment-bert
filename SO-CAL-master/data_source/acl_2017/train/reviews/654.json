The paper is well written and has a\nclear structure. The authors provide a comprehensive overview of related work\nand compare results to a representative set of other SRL models that hace been\napplied on the same data sets.\n\nI found the paper to be interesting and convincing. It is a welcome research\ncontribution that not only shows that NNs work well, but also analyzes merits\nand shortcomings of an end-to-end learning approach.\n\n- Strengths:\n\nStrong model, insightful discussion/error analysis.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n\nLittle to no insights regarding the SRL task itself.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "4", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "4", "CLARITY": "4", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "5"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "5", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "5", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Oral Presentation", "comments": "This paper presents a new state-of-the-art deep learning model for semantic\nrole labeling (SRL) that is a natural extension of the previous\nstate-of-the-art system (Zhou and Xu, 2015) with recent best practices for\ninitialization and regularization in the deep learning literature.\nThe model gives a 10% relative error reduction which is a big gain on this\ntask. The paper also gives in-depth empirical analyses to reveal the strengths\nand the remaining issues, that give a quite valuable information to the\nresearchers in this field. \n\nEven though I understand that the improvement of 3 point in F1 measure is a\nquite meaningful result from the engineering point of view, I think the main\ncontribution of the paper is on the extensive analysis in the experiment\nsection and a further in-depth investigation on analysis section. The detailed\nanalyses shown in Section 4 are performed in a quite reasonable way and give\nboth comparable results in SRL literature and novel information such as\nrelation between accuracies in syntactic parsing and SRL. This type of analysis\nhad often been omitted in recent papers. However, it is definitely important\nfor further improvement.\n\nThe paper is well-written and well-structured. \nI really enjoyed the paper and would like to see it accepted.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "4", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "4", "CLARITY": "5", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "5"}], "abstract": "We introduce a new deep learning model for semantic role labeling (SRL) that significantly improves the state of the art, along with detailed analyses to reveal its strengths and limitations. We use a deep highway BiLSTM architecture with constrained decoding, while observing a number of recent best practices for initialization and regularization. Our 8-layer ensemble model achieves 83.2 F1 on theCoNLL 2005 test set and 83.4 F1 on CoNLL 2012, roughly a 10% relative error reduction over the previous state of the art. Extensive empirical analysis of these gains show that (1) deep models excel at recovering long-distance dependencies but can still make surprisingly obvious errors, and (2) that there is still room for syntactic parsers to improve these results.", "histories": [], "id": "654", "title": "Deep Semantic Role Labeling: What Works and What\u2019s Next"}
