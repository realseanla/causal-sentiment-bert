I liked this paper a lot. I believe there is a lot of\nvalue simply in the introduction of UCCA (not new, but I believe relatively new\nto this community), which has the potential to spark new thinking about\nsemantic representations of text. I also think the model was well thought out.\nWhile the model itself was fairly derivative of existing transition-based\nschemes, the extensions the authors introduced to make the model applicable in\nthis domain were reasonable and well-explained, at what I believe to be an\nappropriate level of detail.\n\nThe empirical evaluation was pretty convincing -- the results were good, as\ncompared to several credible baselines, and the authors demonstrated this\nperformance in multiple domains. My biggest complaint about this paper is the\nlack of multilingual evaluation, especially given\nthat the formalism being experimented with is exactly one that is supposed to\nbe fairly universal. I'm reasonably sure multilingual UCCA corpora exist (in\nfact, I think the \"20k leagues\" corpus used in this paper is one such), so it\nwould be good to see results in a language other than English.\n\nOne minor point: in section 6, the authors refer to their model as\n\"grammarless\", which strikes me as not quite correct. It's true that the UCCA\nrepresentation isn't derived from linguistic notions of syntax, but it still\ndefines a way to construct a compositional abstract symbolic representation of\ntext, which to me, is precisely a grammar. (This is clearly a quibble, and I\ndon't know why it irked me enough that I feel compelled to address it, but it\ndid.)\n\nEdited to add: Thanks to the authors for their response.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "5", "CLARITY": "5", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "4", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Oral Presentation", "comments": "This paper presents the first parser to UCCA, a recently proposed meaning\nrepresentation.

The transition set is a\nmix of already proposed transitions\n(The key aspects are the swap transition to cope with discontinuities, and\ntransitions not popping the stack to allow multiple parents for a node.).\nThe best performance is obtained using as transition classifier a MLP with\nfeatures based on bidirectional LSTMs.\n\nThe authors compare the obtained performance with other state-of-the art\nparsers, using conversion schemes (to bilexical graphs, and to tree\napproximations): the parsers are trained on converted data, used to predict\ngraphs (or trees), and the predicted structures are converted ack to UCCA and\nconfronted with gold UCCA representations.\n\n=========================\n- Strengths:\n=========================\n\nThe paper presents quite solid work, with state-of-the art transition-based\ntechniques, and machine learning for parsing techniques.\n\nIt is very well written, formal and experimental aspects are described in a\nvery precise way, and the authors demonstrate a very good knowledge of the\nrelated work, both for parsing techniques and for shallow semantic\nrepresentations.\n\n=========================\n- Weaknesses:\n=========================\n\nMaybe the weakness of the paper is that the originality lies mainly in the\ntargeted representations (UCCA), not really in the proposed parser.\n\n=========================\n- More detailed comments and clarification questions:\n=========================\n\nIntroduction\n\nLines 46-49: Note that \"discontinuous nodes\" could be linked to\nnon-projectivity in the dependency framework. So maybe rather state that the\ndifference is with phrase-structure syntax not dependency syntax.\n\nSection 2:\n\nIn the UCCA scheme's description, the alternative \"a node (or unit) corresponds\nto a terminal or to several sub-units\" is not very clear. Do you mean something\nelse than a node is either a terminal or a non terminal? Can't a non terminal\nnode have one child only (and thus neither be a terminal nor have several\nsub-units) ?\n\nNote that \"movement, action or state\" is not totally appropriate, since there\nare processes which are neither movements nor actions (e.g. agentless\ntransformations).\n(the UCCA guidelines use these three terms, but later state the state/process\ndichotomy, with processes being an \"action, movement or some other relation\nthat evolves in time\").\n\nlines 178-181: Note that the contrast between \"John and Mary's trip\" and \"John\nand Mary's children\" is not very felicitous. The relational noun \"children\"\nevokes an underlying relation between two participants (the children and\nJohn+Mary), that has to be accounted for in UCCA too.\n\nSection 4:\n\nConcerning the conversion procedures:\n- While it is very complete to provide the precise description of the\nconversion procedure in the supplementary material, it would ease reading to\ndescribe it informally in the paper (as a variant of the\nconstituent-to-dependency conversion procedure \u00e0 la Manning, 95). Also, it\nwould be interesting to motivate the priority order used to define the head of\nan edge.\n\n- How l(u) is chosen in case of several children with same label should be made\nexplicit (leftmost ?).\n\n- In the converted graphs in figure 4, some edges seem inverted (e.g. the\ndirection between \"John\" and \"moved\" and between \"John\" and \"gave\" should be\nthe same).\n\n- Further, I am confused as to why the upper bound for remote edges in\nbilexical approximations is so low. The current description of the conversions\ndo not allow to get an quick idea of which kind of remote edges cannot be\nhandled.\n\nConcerning the comparison to other parsers:\nIt does not seem completely fair to tune the proposed parser, but to use\ndefault settings for the other parsers.\n\nSection 5\n\nLine 595: please better motivate the claim \"using better input encoding\"\n\nSection 6\n\nI am not convinced by the alledged superiority of representations with\nnon-terminal nodes. Although it can be considered more elegant not to choose a\nhead for some constructions, it can be noted that formally co-head labels can\nbe used in bilexical dependencies to recover the same information.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "4", "CLARITY": "5", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}], "abstract": "We present the first parser for UCCA, a cross-linguistically applicable framework for semantic representation, which builds on extensive typological work and supports rapid annotation. UCCA poses a challenge for existing parsing techniques, as it exhibits reentrancy (resulting in DAG structures), discontinuous structures and non-terminal nodes corresponding to complex semantic units. To our knowledge, the conjunction of these formal properties is not supported by any existing parser.
