More\nliterature search is needed to compare with the related works would be better.\n\nThe approach generally improved performance by feature-based methods without\nmuch novelty in model or proposal of new features.\n\n- General Discussion:\nThe manuscript described an approach in sentimental analysis. The method used a\nrelatively new method of using word embeddings to define the weight of each\nlexicon term.

We investigate the sentiment of annual disclosures of companies in stock markets to forecast volatility. We specifically explore the use of recent Information Retrieval (IR) term weighting models that are effectively extended by related terms using word embeddings. In parallel to textual information, factual market data have been widely used as the mainstream approach to forecast market risk. We therefore study different fusion methods to combine text and market data resources. Our word embedding-based approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we investigate the characteristics of the reports of the companies in different financial sectors.", "histories": [], "id": "462", "title": "Volatility Prediction using Financial Disclosures Sentiments with Word Embedding-based IR Models"}
