I am very interested in how much data-driven techniques\ncan be used for dialogue management.  However, I am concerned that the approach\nthat this paper proposes, is actually not specific to symmetric collaborative\ntasks, but to tasks that can be represented as graph operations, such as\nfinding an intersection between objects that the two people know about.\n\nIn Section 2.1, the authors introduce symmetric collaborative dialogue setting.\n However, such dialogs have been studied before, such as Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs\nexplored (Cognition '86), and Walker's furniture layout task (Journal of\nArtificial Research '00).\n\nOn line 229, the authors say that this domain is too rich for slot-value\nsemantics.  However, their domain is based on attribute value pairs, so their\ndomain could use a semantics represenation based on attribute value-pairs, such\nas first order logic.\n\nSection 3.2 is hard to follow.        The authors often refer to Figure 2, but I\ndidn't find this example that helpful.        For example, for section 3.1, at what\npoint of the dialogue does this represent?

The task\nis rather simple: two dialogue agents (bot-bot, human-human or human-bot) talk\nabout their mutual friends. There is an underlying knowledge base for each\nparty in the dialogue and an associated knowledge graph. Items in the knowledge\ngraph have embeddings that are dynamically updated during the conversation and\nused to generate the answers.\n\n- Strengths: This model is very novel for both goal-directed and open ended\ndialogue. The presented evaluation metrics show clear advantage for the\npresented model.\n\n- Weaknesses: In terms of the presentation, mathematical details of how the\nembeddings are computed are not sufficiently clear. While the authors have done\nan extensive evaluation, they haven't actually compared the system with an\nRL-based dialogue manager which is current state-of-the-art in goal-oriented\nsystems. Finally, it is not clear how this approach scales to more complex\nproblems. The authors say that the KB is 3K, but actually what the agent\noperates is about 10 (judging from Table 6).\n\n- General Discussion: Overall, I think this is a good paper.

The open-ended dialogue state in this setting poses new challenges for existing dialogue systems. We collected a dataset of 11K human-human dialogues, which exhibits interesting lexical, semantic, and strategic elements. To model both structured knowledge and unstructured language, we propose a neural model with dynamic knowledge graph embeddings that evolve as the dialogue progresses. Automatic and human evaluations show that our model is both more effective at achieving the goal and more human-like than baseline neural and rule-based models.", "histories": [], "id": 769, "title": "Learning Symmetric Collaborative Dialogue Agents with Dynamic Knowledge Graph Embeddings"}
