The paper is \nclearly written and organized, and the authors provided a lot of useful detail\nand informative example and plots. Most of the results are convincing, and the\nauthors did a good job comparing their approach and results with previous work.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n\n1. Just from the reading abstract, I expected that the authors' approach would\nsignificantly outperform previous methods, and that using both the eye-gaze and\ntextual features consistently yields the best results. Upon reading the actual\nresults section, however, it seems like the findings were more mixed. I think\nit would be helpful to update the abstract and introduction to reflect this. \n2. When evaluating the model on dataset 1 for sentiment analysis, were the\nsarcastic utterances included? Did the model do better on classifying the\nnon-sarcastic utterances than the sarcastic ones?\n3. I understand why the eye-movement data would be useful for sarcasm\ndetection, but it wasn't as obvious to me why it would be helpful for\n(non-sarcastic) sentiment classification beyond the textual features. \n\n- General Discussion:\n\nThis paper contains a lot of interesting content, and the approach seems solid\nand novel to me. The results were a little weaker than I had anticipated from\nthe abstract, but I believe would still be interesting to the larger community\nand merits publication.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "5", "ORIGINALITY": "5", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "4", "CLARITY": "5", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "4", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Oral Presentation", "comments": "- Strengths:\n\n(1) A deep CNN framework is proposed to extract and combine cognitive features\nwith textual features for sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection. \n\n(2) The ideas is interesting and novelty.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n\n(1) Replicability would be an important concern.

We contend that manual extraction of features may not be the best way to tackle text subtleties that characteristically prevail in complex classification tasks like Sentiment Analysis and Sarcasm Detection, and that even the extraction and choice of features should be delegated to the learning system.  We introduce a framework to automatically extract cognitive features from the eye-movement/gaze data of human readers reading the text and use them as features along with textual features for the tasks of sentiment polarity and sarcasm detection. Our proposed framework is based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The CNN learns features from both gaze and text and uses them to classify the input text. We test our technique on published sentiment and sarcasm labeled datasets, enriched with gaze information, to show that using a combination of automatically learned text and gaze features often yields better classification performance over (i)  CNN based systems that rely on text input alone and (ii) existing systems that rely on handcrafted gaze and textual features.", "histories": [], "id": "387", "title": "Learning Cognitive Features from Gaze Data for Sentiment and Sarcasm Classification using Convolutional Neural Network"}
