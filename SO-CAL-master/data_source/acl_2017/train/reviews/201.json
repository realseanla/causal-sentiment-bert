The goal of the study itself\nis interesting for the ACL community and similar papers have appeared\nbefore as workshop papers and have been well cited, such as Nayak et al.'s\npaper mentioned below.\n\n- Weaknesses:\nSince this paper essentially presents the effect of systematically changing the\n\ncontext types and position sensitivity, I will focus on the execution of the\ninvestigation and the analysis of the results, which I am afraid is not \nsatisfactory.\n\nA) The lack of hyper-parameter tuning is worrisome. E.g.\n   - 395 Unless otherwise notes, the number of word embedding dimension is set\nto 500.\n   - 232 It still enlarges the context vocabulary about 5 times in practice.\n   - 385 Most hyper-parameters are the same as Levy et al' best configuration.\n\n  This is worrisome because lack of hyperparameter tuning makes it difficult to\nmake statements like method A is better than method B. E.g. bound methods may\nperform better with a lower dimensionality than unbound models, since their\neffective context vocabulary size is larger.\n\nB) The paper sometimes presents strange explanations for its results. E.g.\n   - 115 \"Experimental results suggest that although it's hard to find any \nuniversal insight, the characteristics of different contexts on different\nmodels are concluded according to specific tasks.\"\n\n   What does this sentence even mean? \n\n   - 580 Sequence labeling tasks tend to classify words with the same syntax \nto the same category. The ignorance of syntax for word embeddings which  are\nlearned by bound representation becomes beneficial. \n\n   These two sentences are contradictory, if a sequence labeling task\n   classified words with \"same syntax\" to same category then syntx becomes\n   a ver valuable feature. Bound representation's ignorance of syntax\n   should cause a drop in performance just like other tasks which does not\n   happen.\n\nC) It is not enough to merely mention Lai et. al. 2016 who have also done a\n   systematic study of the word embeddings, and similarly the paper \n   \"Evaluating Word Embeddings Using a Representative Suite of Practical\n   Tasks\", Nayak, Angeli, Manning. appeared at the repeval workshop at \n   ACL 2016. should have been cited. I understand that the focus of Nayak\n   et al's paper is not exactly the same as this paper, however they\n   provide recommendations about hyperparameter tuning and experiment\n   design and even provide a web interface for automatically running\n   tagging experiments using neural networks instead of the \"simple linear\n   classifiers\" used in the current paper.\n\nD) The paper uses a neural BOW words classifier for the text classification\ntasks\n   but a simple linear classifier for the sequence labeling tasks. What is\n   the justification for this choice of classifiers? Why not use a simple\n   neural classifier for the tagging tasks as well? I raise this point,\n   since the tagging task seems to be the only task where bound\n   representations are consistently beating the unbound representations,\n   which makes this task the odd one out. \n\n- General Discussion:\nFinally, I will make one speculative suggestion to the authors regarding\nthe analysis of the data. As I said earlier, this paper's main contribution is\nan\nanalysis of the following table.\n(context type, position sensitive, embedding model, task, accuracy)\nSo essentially there are 120 accuracy values that we want to explain in\nterms of the aspects of the model. It may be beneficial to perform\nfactor analysis or some other pattern mining technique on this 120 sample data.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "2", "CLARITY": "3", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "5", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Oral Presentation", "comments": "- Strengths: \nEvaluating bag of words and \"bound\" contexts from either dependencies or\nsentence ordering is important, and will be a useful reference to the\ncommunity. The experiments were relatively thorough (though some choices could\nuse further justification), and the authors used downstream tasks instead of\njust intrinsic evaluations.\n\n- Weaknesses: \nThe authors change the objective function of GBOW from p(c|\\sum w_i) to\np(w|\\sum c_i). This is somewhat justified as dependency-based context with a\nbound representation only has one word available for predicting the context,\nbut it's unclear exactly why that is the case and deserves more discussion.\nPresumably the\nnon-dependency context with a bound representation would also suffer from this\ndrawback? If so, how did Ling et al., 2015 do it? Unfortunately, the authors\ndon't compare any results against the original objective, which is a definite\nweakness. In addition, the authors change GSG to match GBOW, again without\ncomparing to the original objective. Adding results from word vectors trained\nusing the original GBOW and GSG objective functions would justify these changes\n(assuming the results don't show large changes).\nThe hyperparameter settings should be discussed further. This played a large\nrole in Levy et al. (2015), so you should consider trying different\nhyperparameter values. These depend pretty heavily on the task, so simply\ntaking good values from another task may not work well.\n\nIn addition, the authors are unclear on exactly what model is trained in\nsection 3.4. They say only that it is a \"simple linear classifier\". In section\n3.5, they use logistic regression with the average of the word vectors as\ninput, but call it  a Neural Bag-of-Words model. Technically previous work also\nused this name, but I find it misleading, since it's just logistic regression\n(and hence a linear model, which is not something I would call \"Neural\"). It is\nimportant to know if the model trained in section 3.4 is the same as the model\ntrained in 3.5, so we know if the different conclusions are the result of the\ntask or the model changing. \n\n- General Discussion: This paper evaluates context taken from dependency parses\nvs context taken from word position in a given sentence, and bag-of-words vs\ntokens with relative position indicators. This paper is useful to the\ncommunity, as they show when and where researchers should use word vectors\ntrained using these different decisions. \n\n- Emphasis to improve:\nThe main takeaway from this paper that future researchers will use is given at\nthe end of 3.4 and 3.5, but really should be summarized at the start of the\npaper. Specifically, the authors should put in the abstract that for POS,\nchunking, and NER, bound representations outperform bag-of-words\nrepresentations, and that dependency contexts work better than linear contexts\nin most cases. In addition, for a simple text classification model, bound\nrepresentations perform worse than bag-of-words representations, and there\nseemed to be no major difference between the different models or context types.\n\n- Small points of improvement: \nShould call \"unbounded\" context \"bag of words\". This may lead to some confusion\nas one of the techniques you use is Generalized Bag-Of-Words, but this can be\nclarified easily.\n043: it's the \"distributional hypothesis\", not the \"Distributed Hypothesis\". \n069: citations should have a comma instead of semicolon separating them.\n074: \"DEPS\" should be capitalized consistently throughout the paper (usually it\nappears as \"Deps\"). Also should be introduced as something like dependency\nparse tree context (Deps).\n085: typo: \"How different contexts affect model's performances...\" Should have\nthe word \"do\".", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "4", "CLARITY": "5", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "4", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "comments": "- Strengths:\n\nThis paper systematically investigated how context types (linear vs\ndependency-based) and representations (bound word vs unbound word) affect word\nembedding learning.
