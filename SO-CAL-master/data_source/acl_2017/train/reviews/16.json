The framework is clear and simple. With the help of the supervised\nattention mechanism, an important method that has been used in many tasks such\nas machine translation, the performance of their system outperforms the\nbaseline significantly.\n\n- Weaknesses:\n The attention vector is simply the summation of two attention vectors of each\npart. Maybe the attention vector could be calculated in a more appropriate\napproach. For the supervised attention mechanism, two strategies are proposed.\nBoth of them are quite straightforward. Some more complicated strategies can\nwork better and can be tried.\n\n- General Discussion:\n Although there are some places that can be improved, this paper proposed a\nquite effective framework, and the performance is good. The experiment is\nsolid. It can be considered to be accepted.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "5", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "4", "CLARITY": "4", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "3"}], "abstract": "This paper tackles the task of event detection (ED), which involves identifying and categorizing events. We argue that arguments provide significant clues to this task, but they are either completely ignored or exploited in an indirect manner in existing detection approaches. In this work, we propose to exploit argument information explicitly for ED via supervised attention mechanisms. In specific, we systematically investigate the proposed model under the supervision of different attention strategies. Experimental results show that our approach advances state-of-the-arts and achieves the best F1 score on ACE 2005 dataset.", "histories": [], "id": "16", "title": "Exploiting Argument Information to Improve Event Detection via Supervised Attention Mechanisms"}
