This is definitely an interesting\nresearch question. To do so, the authors want to rely on approaches that have\nare standard in experimental psychology. Furthermore, the authors also aim at\nvalidating sociological assumptions via this study.\n\n- Weaknesses: one of the main weaknesses of the paper lies in the fact that the\ngoals are not clear enough. One overall, ambitious goal put forward by the\nauthors is to use approaches from experimental psychology to interpret LSTMs.\nHowever, no clear methodology to do so is presented in the paper. On the other\nhand, if the goal is to validate sociological assumptions, then one should do\nso by studying the relationships between gender markers and the written\njustifications, independently on any model. The claim that \"expected gender\ndifferences (are) a function of theories of gendered self-construal\" is not\nproven in the study.\n\n- General Discussion: if the study is interesting, it suffers from several weak\narguments. First of all, the fact that the probability shift of a token in the\nLSTM network are correlated with the corresponding SVM coefficients is no proof\nthat \"these probabilities are valid ways to interpret the model\". Indeed, (a)\nSVM coefficients only reveal part of what is happening in the decision function\nof an SVM classifie and (b) it is not because one coefficient provides an\ninterpretation in one model that a correlated coefficient provides an\nexplanation in another model. Furthermore, the correlation coefficients are not\nthat high, so that the point put forward is not really backed up.\n\nAs mentioned before, another problem lies in the fact that the authors seem to\nhesitate between two goals. It would be better to clearly state one goal and\ndevelop it. Concerning the relation to experimental psychology, which is a\npriori an important part of the paper, it would be interesting to develop and\nbetter explain the multilevel bayesian models used to quantify the gender-based\nself-construal assumptions. It is very difficult to assess whether the\nmethodology used here is really appropriate without more details. As this is an\nimportant aspect of the method, it should be further detailed.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "4", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "2", "CLARITY": "4", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "4", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "5", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "comments": "- Strengths:\nThe paper is thoroughly written and discusses its approach compared to\nother approaches. The authors are aware that their findings are somewhat\nlimited regarding the mean F values.\n\n- Weaknesses:\nSome minor orthographical mistakes and some repetive clauses. In general the\npaper would benefit if the sections 1 and 2 would be shortened to allow the\nextension of sections 3 and 4.\nThe main goal is not laid out clearly enough, which may be a result of the\nambivalence of the paper's goals.\n\n- General Discussion:\nTable 1 should only be one column wide, while the figures, especially 3, 5, and\n6 would greatly benefit from a two column width.\nThe paper was not very easy to understand during first read.
