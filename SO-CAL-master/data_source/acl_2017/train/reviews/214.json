{"reviews": [{"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "2", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "comments": "This paper proposed a macro discourse structure scheme. The authors carried out\na pilot study annotating a corpus consisting of 97 news articles from Chinese\ntreebank 8.0. They then built a model to recognize the primary-secondary\nrelations and 5 discourse relations (joint, elaboration, sequence, background,\ncause-result) in this corpus.\n\nThe paper is poorly written and I have difficulties to follow it. I strongly\nsuggest that the authors should find a native English speaker to carefully\nproofread the paper. Regarding the content, I have several concerns: \n\n1 The logic of the paper is not clear and justifiable: \n1) what are \"logical semantics\" and \"pragmatic function\"(line 115-116)? I'd\nprefer the authors to define them properly.\n\n2) macro discourse structure: there are some conflicts of the definition\nbetween macro structure and micro structure. Figure 4 demonstrates the\ncombination of macro discourse structure and micro discourse structure. There,\nthe micro discourse structure is presented *within paragraphs*. However, in the\nspecific example of micro discourse structure shown in Figure 6, the\nmicro-level discourse structure is *beyond the paragraph boundary* and captures\nthe discourse relations across paragraphs. This kind of micro-level discourse\nstructure is indeed similar to the macro structure proposed by the authors in\nFigure 5, and it's also genre independent. So, why can't we just use the\nstructure in Figure 6? What's the advantage of macro discourse structure\nproposed in Figure 5? For me, it's genre dependent and doesn't provide richer\ninformation compared to Figure 6.\n\nBy the way, why sentence 6 and sentence 15 are missing in Figure 5? Is it\nbecause they are subtitles? But sentence 12 which is a subtitle is present\nthere.\n\n2 Corpus construction (section 4) is not informative enough: without a\ndetailed example, it's hard to know the meaning of \"discourse topic, lead,\nabstract, paragraph topics (line 627-629)\". And you were saying you \"explore\nthe relationships between micro-structure and macro-structure\", but I can't\nfind the correspondent part.\n\nTable 4 is about agreement study The authors claimed \"Its very difficult to\nachieve high consistence because the judgments of relation and structure are\nvery subjective. Our measurement data is only taken on the layer of leaf\nnodes.\"--------> First, what are the leaf nodes? In the macro-level, they are\nparagraphs; in the micro-level, they are EDUs. Should we report the agreement\nstudy for macro-level and micro-level separately? Second, it seems for me that\nthe authors only take a subset of data to measure the agreement. This doesn't\nreflect the overall quality of the whole corpus, i.e., high agreement on the\nleaf nodes annotation doesn't ensure that we will get high agreement on the\nnon-leaf nodes annotation.\n\nSome other unclear parts in section 4:\n\nTable 4: \"discourse structure, discourse relation\" are not clear, what is\ndiscourse structure and what is discourse relation? \nTable 5: \"amount of macro discourse relations\", still not clear to me, you mean\nthe discourse relations between paragraphs? But in Figure 6, these relations\ncan exist both between sentences and between paragraphs.\n\n3 Experiments: since the main purpose of the paper is to provide richer\ndiscourse structure (both on macro and micro level), I would expect to see some\ninitial results in this direction. The current experiment is not very\nconvincing: a) no strong baselines; b) features are not clearly described and\nmotivated; c) I don't understand why only a sub set of discourse relations from\nTable 6 is chosen to perform the experiment of discourse relation recognition.\n\nIn general, I think the paper needs major improvement and currently it is not\nready for acceptance.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "2", "CLARITY": "1", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "1", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "comments": "This paper presents a unified annotation that combines macrostructures and RST\nstructure in Chinese news articles. Essentially, RST structure is adopted for\neach paragraph and macrostructure is adopted on top of the paragraphs. \nWhile the view that nuclearity should not depend on the relation label itself\nbut also on the context is appealing, I find the paper having major issues in\nthe annotation and the experiments, detailed below:\n\n- The notion of \u201cprimary-secondary\u201d relationship is advocated much in the\npaper, but later in the paper that it became clear this is essentially the\nnotion of nuclearity, extended to macrostructure and making it\ncontext-dependent instead of relation-dependent. Even then, the status\nnuclear-nuclear, nuclear-satellite, satellite-nuclear are \u201credefined\u201d as\nnew concepts.\n\n- Descriptions of established theories in discourse are often incorrect. For\nexample, there is rich existing work on pragmatic functions of text but it is\nclaimed to be something little studied. There are errors in the related work\nsection, e.g., treating RST and the Chinese Dependency Discourse Treebank as\ndifferent as coherence and cohesion; the computational approach subsection\nlacking any reference to work after 2013; the performance table of nuclearity\nclassification confusing prior work for sentence-level and document-level\nparsing.\n\n- For the annotation, I find the macro structure annotation description\nconfusing; furthermore, statistics for the macro labels are not\nlisted/reported. The agreement calculation is also problematic; the paper\nstated that \"Our measurement data is only taken on the layer of leaf nodes\". I\ndon't think this can verify the validity of the annotation. There are multiple\nmentions in the annotation procedure that says \u201cprelim experiments show this\nis a good approach\u201d, but how? Finally it is unclear how the kappa values are\ncalculated since this is a structured task; is this the same calculation as RST\ndiscourse treebank?\n\n- It is said in the paper that nuclearity status closely associates with the\nrelation label itself. So what is the baseline performance that just uses the\nrelation label? Note that some features are not explained at all (e.g., what\nare \u201chierarchical characteristics\u201d?)\n\n- The main contribution of the paper is the combination of macro and micro\nstructure. However, in the experiments only relations at the micro level are\nevaluated; even so, only among 5 handpicked ones. I don't see how this\nevaluation can be used to verify the macro side hence supporting the paper.\n\n- The paper contains numerous grammatical errors. Also, there is no text\ndisplayed in Figure 7 to illustrate the example.", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "1", "CLARITY": "3", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "4"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "4", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "comments": "- Strengths:\nThe macro discourse structure is a useful complement to micro structures like\nRST.
