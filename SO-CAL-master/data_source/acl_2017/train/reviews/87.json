Targeted answering of research questions, based on \ndifferent experiments.\n\n- Weaknesses:\nMinimal novelty. The \"first sentence\" heuristic has been in the summarization\nliterature for many years. This work essentially applies this heuristic\n(evolved) in the keyword extraction setting. This is NOT to say that the work\nis trivial: it is just not really novel.\n\nLack of state-of-the-art/very recent methods. The experiment on the system\nevaluation vs state-of-the-art systems simply uses strong baselines. Even\nthough the experiment answers the question \"does it perform better than\nbaselines?\", I am not confident it illustrates that the system performs better\nthan the current state-of-the-art. This somewhat reduces the value of the\npaper.\n\n- General Discussion:\nOverall the paper is good and I propose that it be published and presented. \n\nOn the other hand, I would propose that the authors position themselves (and\nthe system performance) with respect to:\nMartinez\u2010Romo, Juan, Lourdes Araujo, and Andres Duque Fernandez. \"SemGraph:\nExtracting keyphrases following a novel semantic graph\u2010based approach.\"\nJournal of the Association for Information Science and Technology 67.1 (2016):\n71-82.\n(with which the work holds remarkable resemblance in some points)\n\nLe, Tho Thi Ngoc, Minh Le Nguyen, and Akira Shimazu. \"Unsupervised Keyphrase\nExtraction: Introducing New Kinds of Words to Keyphrases.\" Australasian Joint\nConference on Artificial Intelligence.

One such challenge is to automatically extract a small set of keyphrases from a document that can accurately describe the document's content and can facilitate fast information processing. In this paper, we propose PositionRank, an unsupervised  model for keyphrase extraction from scholarly documents that incorporates information from all positions of a word's occurrences into a biased PageRank. Our model obtains remarkable improvements in performance over PageRank models that do not take into account word positions as well as over strong baselines for this task.  Specifically, on several datasets of research papers, PositionRank achieves improvements as high as $29.09\\%$.", "histories": [], "id": "87", "title": "PositionRank: An Unsupervised Approach to Keyphrase Extraction from Scholarly Documents"}
