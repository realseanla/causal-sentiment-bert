I would recommend also\nmeasuring F1 performance and expanding the number of techniques compared.\n\n W2) The methodology description needs more organisation and elaboration. The\nideas tested are itemised, but insufficiently justified. \n\n W3) The results are quite weak in terms of the reported accuracy and depth of\nanalysis. Perhaps this work needs more development, particularly with\nvalidating the central assumption that the Distributional Hypothesis implies\nthat opposite words, although semantically similar, are separated well in the\nvector space?", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": "3", "ORIGINALITY": "3", "is_meta_review": null, "RECOMMENDATION": "1", "CLARITY": "3", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": "2"}, {"IMPACT": "3", "SUBSTANCE": "2", "APPROPRIATENESS": "5", "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": "3", "PRESENTATION_FORMAT": "Poster", "comments": "- Strengths\nThis paper deals with the issue of finding word polarity orientation in an\nunsupervised manner, using word embeddings.\n\n- Weaknesses\nThe paper presents an interesting and useful idea, however, at this moment, it\nis not applied to any test case. The ideas on which it is based are explained\nin an \"intuitive\" manner and not thoroughly justified. \n\n- General Discussion\nThis is definitely interesting work. The paper would benefit from more\nexperiments being carried out, comparison with other methods (for example, the\nuse of the Normalized Google Distance by authors such as (Balahur and Montoyo,\n2008) - http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4906796/) and the\napplication of the knowledge obtained to a real sentiment analysis scenario.

Two representative vectors for positive/negative polarity are constructed using high-dimensional vec-tor space in both an unsupervised and a semi-supervised manner. A sentiment ori-entation value per word is determined by taking the difference between the cosine distances against the two reference vec-tors. These two conditions (unsupervised and semi-supervised) are compared against an existing unsupervised method (Turney, 2002). As a result of our experi-ment, we demonstrate that this novel ap-proach significantly outperforms the pre-vious unsupervised approach and is more practical and data efficient as well.", "histories": [], "id": 237, "title": "A New Approach for Measuring Sentiment Orientation based on Multi-Dimensional Vector Space"}
