The proposed approach, dubbed MinOIE,\nis designed to actually \"minimize\" extractions by removing overly specific\nportions and turning them into structured annotations of various types\n(similarly to OLLIE). The authors put MinIE on top of a state-of-the-art OIE\nsystem (ClausIE) and test it on two publicly available datasets, showing that\nit effectively leads to more concise extractions compared to standard OIE\napproaches, while at the same time retaining accuracy.\n\nOverall, this work focuses on an interesting (and perhaps underinvestigated)\naspect of OIE in a sound and principled way. The paper is clearly written,\nsufficiently detailed, and accompanied by supplementary material and a neat\nJava implementation.\nMy main concern is, however, with the entirely static, deterministic and\nrule-based structure of MinIE. Even though I understand that a handful of\nmanually engineered rules is technically the best strategy when precision is\nkey, these approaches are typically very hard to scale, e.g. in terms of\nlanguages (a recent trend of OIE, see Faruqui and Kumar, 2015; Falke et al.,\n2016). In other words, I think that this contribution somehow falls short of\nnovelty and substance in proposing a pipeline of engineered rules that are\nmostly inspired by other OIE systems (such as ClausIE or ReVerb); for instance,\nI would have really appreciated an attempt to learn these minimization rules\ninstead of hard-coding them.\n\nFurthermore, the authors completely ignore a recent research thread on\n\u201csemantically-informed\u201d OIE (Nakashole et al., 2012; Moro and Navigli,\n2012; 2013; Delli Bovi et al., 2015) where traditional extractions are\naugmented with links to underlying knowledge bases and sense inventories\n(Wikipedia, Wikidata, Yago, BabelNet). These contributions are not only\nrelevant in terms of related literature: in fact, having text fragments (or\nconstituents) explicitly linked to a knowledge base would reduce the need for\nad-hoc minimization rules such as those in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. In the example\nwith \"Bill of Rights\" provided by the authors (line 554), an OIE pipeline with\na proper Entity Linking module would recognize automatically the phrase as\nmention of a registered entity, regardless of the shape of its subconstituents.\nAlso, an underlying sense inventory would seamlessly incorporate the external\ninformation about collocations and multi-word expressions used in Section 6.2:\nnot by chance, the authors rely on WordNet and Wiktionary to compile their\ndictionary of collocations.\n\nFinally, some remarks on the experimental evaluation:\n\n- Despite the claim of generality of MinIE, the authors choose to experiment\nonly with ClausIE as underlying OIE system (most likely the optimal match). It\nwould have been very interesting to see if the improvement brought by MinIE is\nconsistent also with other OIE systems, in order to actually assess its\nflexibility as a post-processing tool.\n\n- Among the test datasets used in Section 7, I would have included the recent\nOIE benchmark of Stanovsky and Dagan (2016), where results are reported also\nfor comparison systems not included in this paper (TextRunner, WOIE, KrakeN).\n\nReferences:\n\n- Manaal Faruqui and Shankar Kumar.

In this paper, we explore how overly-specific extractions can be reduced in OIE systems without producing uninformative or inaccurate results. We propose MinIE, an OIE system that produces minimized, annotated extractions. At its heart, MinIE rewrites OIE extractions by (1) identifying and removing parts that are considered overly specific; (2) representing information about polarity, modality, attribution, and quantities with suitable annotations instead of in the actual extraction. We conducted an experimental study with several real-world datasets and found that MinIE achieves competitive or higher precision and recall than most prior systems, while at the same time producing much shorter extractions.", "histories": [], "id": 579, "title": "MinIE: Minimizing Facts in Open Information Extraction"}
