Embedding and visualizing large-scale high-dimensional data in a two-dimensional space is an important problem since such visualization can reveal deep insights out of complex data.
Most of the existing embedding approaches, however, run on an excessively high precision, ignoring the fact that at the end, embedding outputs are converted into coarse-grained discrete pixel coordinates in a screen space.
Motivated by such an observation and directly considering pixel coordinates in an embedding optimization process, we accelerate Barnes-Hut tree-based t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (BH-SNE), known as a state-of-the-art 2D embedding method, and propose a novel method called PixelSNE, a highly-efficient, screen resolution-driven 2D embedding method with a linear computational complexity in terms of the number of data items.
Our experimental results show the significantly fast running time of PixelSNE by a large margin against BH-SNE, while maintaining the minimal degradation in the embedding quality.
Finally, the source code of our method is publicly available at
