This paper presents an idea of inductive learning use for rule generation from ontologies.
The main purpose of the paper is to evaluate the possibility of inductive learning use in rule generation from ontologies and to develop the way how this can be done.
Generated rules are necessary to supplement or even to develop the Semantic Web Expert System (SWES) knowledge base.
The SWES emerges as the result of evolution of expert system concept toward the Web, and the SWES is based on the Semantic Web technologies.
Available publications show that the problem of rule generation from ontologies based on inductive learning is not investigated deeply enough.
