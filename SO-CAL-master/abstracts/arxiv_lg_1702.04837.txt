We address the statistical and optimization impacts of using classical or Hessian sketch to approximately solve the Matrix Ridge Regression (MRR) problem.
Prior research has considered the effects of classical sketch on least squares regression (LSR), a strictly simpler problem.
We establish that classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR as it does on those of LSR -- namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions.
In contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee; instead, the approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the "mass" in the responses and the optimal objective value.
