An orthogonal Haar scattering transform is a deep network, computed with a hierarchy of additions, subtractions and absolute values, over pairs of coefficients.
It provides a simple mathematical model for unsupervised deep network learning.
It implements non-linear contractions, which are optimized for classification, with an unsupervised pair matching algorithm, of polynomial complexity.
A structured Haar scattering over graph data computes permutation invariant representations of groups of connected points in the graph.
If the graph connectivity is unknown, unsupervised Haar pair learning can provide a consistent estimation of connected dyadic groups of points.
Classification results are given on image data bases, defined on regular grids or graphs, with a connectivity which may be known or unknown.
