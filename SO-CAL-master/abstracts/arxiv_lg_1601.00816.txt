This article discusses open scientific challenges for understanding development and evolution of speech forms, as a commentary to Moulin-Frier et al.
(Moulin-Frier et al., 2015).
Based on the analysis of mathematical models of the origins of speech forms, with a focus on their assumptions , we study the fundamental question of how speech can be formed out of non--speech, at both developmental and evolutionary scales.
In particular, we emphasize the importance of embodied self-organization , as well as the role of mechanisms of motivation and active curiosity-driven exploration in speech formation.
Finally , we discuss an evolutionary-developmental perspective of the origins of speech.
