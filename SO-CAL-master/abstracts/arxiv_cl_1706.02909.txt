Selecting a representative vector for a set of vectors is a very common requirement in many algorithmic tasks.
Traditionally, the mean or median vector is selected.
Ontology classes are sets of homogeneous instance objects that can be converted to a vector space by word vector embeddings.
This study proposes a methodology to derive a representative vector for ontology classes whose instances were converted to the vector space.
We start by deriving five candidate vectors which are then used to train a machine learning model that would calculate a representative vector for the class.
We show that our methodology out-performs the traditional mean and median vector representations.
