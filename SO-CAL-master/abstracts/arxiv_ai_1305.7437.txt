In this paper, we develop an agent-based model which integrates four important elements, i.e.
organisational energy management policies/regulations, energy management technologies, electric appliances and equipment, and human behaviour, to simulate the electricity consumption in office buildings.
Based on a case study, we use this model to test the effectiveness of different electricity management strategies, and solve practical office electricity consumption problems.
This paper theoretically contributes to an integration of the four elements involved in the complex organisational issue of office electricity consumption, and practically contributes to an application of an agent-based approach for office building electricity consumption study.
