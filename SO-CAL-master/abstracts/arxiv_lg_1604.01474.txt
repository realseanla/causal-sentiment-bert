In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework, called Self-Paced Multi-Task Learning (SPMTL).
Different from previous works treating all tasks and instances equally when training, SPMTL attempts to jointly learn the tasks by taking into consideration the complexities of both tasks and instances.
This is inspired by the cognitive process of human brain that often learns from the easy to the hard.
We construct a compact SPMTL formulation by proposing a new task-oriented regularizer that can jointly prioritize the tasks and the instances.
Thus it can be interpreted as a self-paced learner for MTL.
A simple yet effective algorithm is designed for optimizing the proposed objective function.
An error bound for a simplified formulation is also analyzed theoretically.
Experimental results on toy and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
