We derive a novel norm that corresponds to the tightest convex relaxation of sparsity combined with an L2 penalty and can also be interpreted as a group Lasso norm with overlaps.
We show that this new norm provides a tighter relaxation than the elastic net and suggest using it as a replacement for the Lasso or the elastic net in sparse prediction problems.
