In the literature on graphical models, there has been increased attention paid to the problems of learning hidden structure (see Heckerman [H96] for survey) and causal mechanisms from sample data [H96, P88, S93, P95, F98].
In most settings we should expect the former to be difficult, and the latter potentially impossible without experimental intervention.
In this work, we examine some restricted settings in which perfectly reconstruct the hidden structure solely on the basis of observed sample data.
