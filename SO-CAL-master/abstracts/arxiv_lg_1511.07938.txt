Early diagnosis of treatable diseases is essential for improving healthcare, and many diseases' onsets are predictable from annual lab tests and their temporal trends.
We introduce a multi-resolution convolutional neural network for early detection of multiple diseases from irregularly measured sparse lab values.
Our novel architecture takes as input both an imputed version of the data and a binary observation matrix.
For imputing the temporal sparse observations, we develop a flexible, fast to train method for differentiable multivariate kernel regression.
Our experiments on data from 300K individuals over 8 years, 18 common lab measurements, and 170 diseases show that the temporal signatures learned via convolution are significantly more predictive than baselines commonly used for early disease diagnosis.
