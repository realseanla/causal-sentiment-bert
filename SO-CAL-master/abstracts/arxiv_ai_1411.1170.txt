Recent development in developing humanoid robot poses new challenges to human-machine interaction communication.
A major challenge is to develop robots that can behave like and interact with human in the most natural way possible.
This paper proposes a system to develop a robot that can receive command, and talk to people in natural language.
In addition, the robot can also be "trained" to become an expert in sepcific areas to provide expert advice to human-beings.
Most important of all, the robot can display emotions through facial expression, speech and gesture so that the interaction process will become more comprehensive and compelling.
