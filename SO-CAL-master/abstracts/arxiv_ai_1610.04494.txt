As Wireless Sensor Networks are penetrating into the industrial domain, many research opportunities are emerging.
One such essential and challenging application is that of node localization.
A feed-forward neural network based methodology is adopted in this paper.
The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) values of the anchor node beacons are used.
The number of anchor nodes and their configurations has an impact on the accuracy of the localization system, which is also addressed in this paper.
Five different training algorithms are evaluated to find the training algorithm that gives the best result.
The multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network model was trained using Matlab.
In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method in real time, the model obtained was then implemented on the Arduino microcontroller.
With four anchor nodes, an average 2D localization error of 0.2953 m has been achieved with a 12-12-2 neural network structure.
The proposed method can also be implemented on any other embedded microcontroller system.
