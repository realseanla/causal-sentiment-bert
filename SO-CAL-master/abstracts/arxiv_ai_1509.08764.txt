Once known to be used exclusively in military domain, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) have stepped up to become a part of new logistic method in commercial sector called "last-mile delivery".
In this novel approach, small UAVs, also known as drones, are deployed in tandem with the trucks to deliver goods to customers.
Under research context, it gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), of which we call TSP with drone (TSP-D).
In this paper, we propose two heuristics: route first - cluster second, and cluster first - route second, to solve the problem efficiently.
A new mixed integer programming formulation is also introduced to handle the cluster step in both heuristics.
We conduct an experiment, adapting different profit functions of the MIP model, in both heuristics, to many instances with different sizes and characteristics.
The numerical analysis shows not only a significant savings compare to truck-only delivery but also a superior performance against the previous work.
