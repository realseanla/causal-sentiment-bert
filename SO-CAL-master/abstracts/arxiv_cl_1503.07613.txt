We describe a technique for attributing parts of a written text to a set of unknown authors.
Nothing is assumed to be known a priori about the writing styles of potential authors.
We use multiple independent clusterings of an input text to identify parts that are similar and dissimilar to one another.
We describe algorithms necessary to combine the multiple clusterings into a meaningful output.
We show results of the application of the technique on texts having multiple writing styles.
