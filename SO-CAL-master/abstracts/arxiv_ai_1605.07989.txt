In this brief abstract, we develop a computationally simpler version of the operator count heuristic for a particular class of domains.
The contribution of this abstract is thus threefold, we (1) propose an efficient closed form approximation to the operator count heuristic; (2) leverage compressed sensing techniques to obtain an integer approximation in polynomial time; and (3) discuss the relationship of the proposed formulation to existing heuristics and investigate properties of domains where such approaches are useful.
