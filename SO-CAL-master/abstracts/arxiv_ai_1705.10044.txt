The act of persuasion, a key component in rhetoric argumentation, may be viewed as a dynamics modifier.
Such modifiers are well-known in other research fields: recall dynamic epistemic logic where operators modify possible world accessibilities, or recall side effects and concurrency in programming languages.
We consider persuasion in abstract argumentation as undertaking a similar role.
We extend Dung's frameworks with acts of persuasion among agents into Abstract Persuasion Argumentation (APA), and set forth properties related to arguments' admissibilities.
We show a way of enriching our basic notion of admissibility through CTL (computation tree logic) encoding, which also permits importation of the theoretical results known to the logic into our argumentation frameworks.
