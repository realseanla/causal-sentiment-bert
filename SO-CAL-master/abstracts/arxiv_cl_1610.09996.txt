This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer candidates from a given document to answer questions.
DCR is able to predict answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily focused on predicting single tokens or entities.
DCR encodes a document and an input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document, followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer.
Experimental results show that DCR achieves state-of-the-art exact match and F1 scores on the SQuAD dataset.
