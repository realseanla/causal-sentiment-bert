\emph{Discrimination discovery} from data is an important task aiming at identifying patterns of illegal and unethical discriminatory activities against protected-by-law groups, e.g.,~ethnic minorities.
While any legally-valid proof of discrimination requires evidence of causality, the state-of-the-art methods are essentially correlation-based, albeit, as it is well known, correlation does not imply causation.
