Long short-term memory (LSTM) Hochreiter et al.
is a powerful type of neural network that can capture long range dependencies and nonlinear dynamics.
Frequency modulation FM is a nonlinear encoding of information in a carrier wave.
In this paper we present a novel application of software defined radio (SDR) based on LSTM recurrent neural networks to decode audio signal from its noisy frequency demodulated version.
