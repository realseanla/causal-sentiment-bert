In this paper, we defined the viseme (visual speech element) and described about the method of extracting visual feature vector.
We defined the 10 visemes based on vowel by analyzing of Korean utterance and proposed the method of extracting the 20-dimensional visual feature vector, combination of static features and dynamic features.
Lastly, we took an experiment in recognizing words based on 3-viseme HMM and evaluated the efficiency.
