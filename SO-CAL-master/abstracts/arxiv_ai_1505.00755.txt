The project of the Ontology Web Search Engine is presented in this paper.
The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a project that can be easily implemented.
Ontology Web Search Engine is software to look for and index ontologies in the Web.
OWL (Web Ontology Languages) ontologies are meant, and they are necessary for the functioning of the SWES (Semantic Web Expert System).
SWES is an expert system that will use found ontologies from the Web, generating rules from them, and will supplement its knowledge base with these generated rules.
It is expected that the SWES will serve as a universal expert system for the average user.
