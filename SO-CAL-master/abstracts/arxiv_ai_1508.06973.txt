We analyse a quantum-like Bayesian Network that puts together cause/effect relationships and semantic similarities between events.
These semantic similarities constitute acausal connections according to the Synchronicity principle and provide new relationships to quantum like probabilistic graphical models.
As a consequence, beliefs (or any other event) can be represented in vector spaces, in which quantum parameters are determined by the similarities that these vectors share between them.
Events attached by a semantic meaning do not need to have an explanation in terms of cause and effect.
