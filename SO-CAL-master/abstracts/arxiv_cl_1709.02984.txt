The role of sentiment analysis is increasingly emerging to study software developers' emotions by mining crowd-generated content within social software engineering tools.
However, off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tools have been trained on non-technical domains and general-purpose social media, thus resulting in misclassifications of technical jargon and problem reports.
Here, we present Senti4SD, a classifier specifically trained to support sentiment analysis in developers' communication channels.
Senti4SD is trained and validated using a gold standard of Stack Overflow questions, answers, and comments manually annotated for sentiment polarity.
It exploits a suite of both lexicon- and keyword-based features, as well as semantic features based on word embedding.
With respect to a mainstream off-the-shelf tool, which we use as a baseline, Senti4SD reduces the misclassifications of neutral and positive posts as emotionally negative.
To encourage replications, we release a lab package including the classifier, the word embedding space, and the gold standard with annotation guidelines.
