In this paper we describe a deep learning system that has been designed and built for the WASSA 2017 Emotion Intensity Shared Task.
We introduce a representation learning approach based on inner attention on top of an RNN.
Results show that our model offers good capabilities and is able to successfully identify emotion-bearing words to predict intensity without leveraging on lexicons, obtaining the 13th place among 22 shared task competitors.
