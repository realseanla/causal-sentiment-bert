Municipal solid waste management (MSWM) is a challenging issue of urban development in developing countries.
Each country having different socio-economic-environmental background, might not accept a particular disposal method as the optimal choice.
Selection of suitable disposal method in MSWM, under vague and imprecise information can be considered as multi criteria decision making problem (MCDM).
In the present paper, TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) methodology is extended based on credibility theory for evaluating the performances of MSW disposal methods under some criteria fixed by experts.
The proposed model helps decision makers to choose a preferable alternative for their municipal area.
A sensitivity analysis by our proposed model confirms this fact.
