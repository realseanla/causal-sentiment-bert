The performance of a Statistical Machine Translation System (SMT) system is proportionally directed to the quality and length of the parallel corpus it uses.
However for some pair of languages there is a considerable lack of them.
The long term goal is to construct a Japanese-Spanish parallel corpus to be used for SMT, whereas, there are a lack of useful Japanese-Spanish parallel Corpus.
To address this problem, In this study we proposed a method for extracting Japanese-Spanish Parallel Sentences from Wikipedia using POS tagging and Rule-Based approach.
The main focus of this approach is the syntactic features of both languages.
Human evaluation was performed over a sample and shows promising results, in comparison with the baseline.
