Vehicle Routing Problem is a well-known problem in logistics and transportation, and the variety of such problems is explained by the fact that it occurs in many real-life situations.
It is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem and finding an exact optimal solution is practically impossible.
In this work, Site-Dependent Truck and Trailer Routing Problem with hard and soft Time Windows and Split Deliveries is considered (SDTTRPTWSD).
In this article, we develop a heuristic with the elements of Tabu Search for solving SDTTRPTWSD.
The heuristic uses the concept of neighborhoods and visits infeasible solutions during the search.
A greedy heuristic is applied to construct an initial solution.
