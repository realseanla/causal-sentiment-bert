Two distinct algorithms are presented to extract (schemata of) resolution proofs from closed tableaux for propositional schemata.
The first one handles the most efficient version of the tableau calculus but generates very complex derivations (denoted by rather elaborate rewrite systems).
The second one has the advantage that much simpler systems can be obtained, however the considered proof procedure is less efficient.
