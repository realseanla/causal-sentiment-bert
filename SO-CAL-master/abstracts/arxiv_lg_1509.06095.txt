We apply multilayer bootstrap network (MBN), a recent proposed unsupervised learning method, to unsupervised speaker recognition.
The proposed method first extracts supervectors from an unsupervised universal background model, then reduces the dimension of the high-dimensional supervectors by multilayer bootstrap network, and finally conducts unsupervised speaker recognition by clustering the low-dimensional data.
The comparison results with 2 unsupervised and 1 supervised speaker recognition techniques demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.
