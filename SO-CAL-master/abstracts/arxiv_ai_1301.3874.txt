We propose a formal framework for intelligent systems which can reason about scientific domains, in particular about the carcinogenicity of chemicals, and we study its properties.
Our framework is grounded in a philosophy of scientific enquiry and discourse, and uses a model of dialectical argumentation.
The formalism enables representation of scientific uncertainty and conflict in a manner suitable for qualitative reasoning about the domain.
