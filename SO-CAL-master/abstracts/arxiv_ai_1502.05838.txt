Deontic logic is a very well researched branch of mathematical logic and philosophy.
Various kinds of deontic logics are considered for different application domains like argumentation theory, legal reasoning, and acts in multi-agent systems.
In this paper, we show how standard deontic logic can be used to model ethical codes for multi-agent systems.
Furthermore we show how Hyper, a high performance theorem prover, can be used to prove properties of these ethical codes.
