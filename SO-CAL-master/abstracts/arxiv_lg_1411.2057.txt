A common phenomena in modern recommendation systems is the use of feedback from one user to infer the `value' of an item to other users.
This results in an exploration vs. exploitation trade-off, in which items of possibly low value have to be presented to users in order to ascertain their value.
Existing approaches to solving this problem focus on the case where the number of items are small, or admit some underlying structure -- it is unclear, however, if good recommendation is possible when dealing with content-rich settings with unstructured content.
