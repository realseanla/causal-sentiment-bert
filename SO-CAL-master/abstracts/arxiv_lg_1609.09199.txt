In this paper, we propose a supervised dictionary learning algorithm that aims to preserve the local geometry in both dimensions of the data.
A graph-based regularization explicitly takes into account the local manifold structure of the data points.
A second graph regularization gives similar treatment to the feature domain and helps in learning a more robust dictionary.
Both graphs can be constructed from the training data or learned and adapted along the dictionary learning process.
The combination of these two terms promotes the discriminative power of the learned sparse representations and leads to improved classification accuracy.
The proposed method was evaluated on several different datasets, representing both single-label and multi-label classification problems, and demonstrated better performance compared with other dictionary based approaches.
