Influence diagrams serve as a powerful tool for modelling symmetric decision problems.
When solving an influence diagram we determine a set of strategies for the decisions involved.
A strategy for a decision variable is in principle a function over its past.
However, some of the past may be irrelevant for the decision, and for computational reasons it is important not to deal with redundant variables in the strategies.
We show that current methods (e.g.
the "Decision Bayes-ball" algorithm by Shachter UAI98) do not determine the relevant past, and we present a complete algorithm.
