We propose a novel module, the reviewer module, to improve the encoder-decoder learning framework.
The reviewer module is generic, and can be plugged into an existing encoder-decoder model.
The reviewer module performs a number of review steps with attention mechanism on the encoder hidden states, and outputs a fact vector after each review step; the fact vectors are used as the input of the attention mechanism in the decoder.
We show that the conventional encoder-decoders are a special case of our framework.
Empirically, we show that our framework can improve over state-of-the-art encoder-decoder systems on the tasks of image captioning and source code captioning.
