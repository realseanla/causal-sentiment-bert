We formulate problems of statistical recognition and learning in a common framework of complex hypothesis testing.
Based on arguments from multi-criteria optimization, we identify strategies that are improper for solving these problems and derive a common form of the remaining strategies.
We show that some widely used approaches to recognition and learning are improper in this sense.
We then propose a generalized formulation of the recognition and learning problem which embraces the whole range of sizes of the learning sample, including the zero size.
Learning becomes a special case of recognition without learning.
We define the concept of closest to optimal strategy, being a solution to the formulated problem, and describe a technique for finding such a strategy.
On several illustrative cases, the strategy is shown to be superior to the widely used learning methods based on maximal likelihood estimation.
