We study mechanisms for candidate selection that seek to minimize the social cost, where voters and candidates are associated with points in some underlying metric space.
The social cost of a candidate is the sum of its distances to each voter.
Some of our work assumes that these points can be modeled on a real line, but other results of ours are more general.
