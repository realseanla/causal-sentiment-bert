We address a problem of area protection in graph-based scenarios with multiple mobile agents where connectivity is maintained among agents to ensure they can communicate.
The problem consists of two adversarial teams of agents that move in an undirected graph shared by both teams.
Agents are placed in vertices of the graph; at most one agent can occupy a vertex; and they can move into adjacent vertices in a conflict free way.
Teams have asymmetric goals: the aim of one team - attackers - is to invade into given area while the aim of the opponent team - defenders - is to protect the area from being entered by attackers by occupying selected vertices.
The team of defenders need to maintain connectivity of vertices occupied by its own agents in a visibility graph.
The visibility graph models possibility of communication between pairs of vertices.
