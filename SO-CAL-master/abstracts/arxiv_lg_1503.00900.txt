K-means is an effective clustering technique used to separate similar data into groups based on initial centroids of clusters.
In this paper, Normalization based K-means clustering algorithm(N-K means) is proposed.
Proposed N-K means clustering algorithm applies normalization prior to clustering on the available data as well as the proposed approach calculates initial centroids based on weights.
Experimental results prove the betterment of proposed N-K means clustering algorithm over existing K-means clustering algorithm in terms of complexity and overall performance.
