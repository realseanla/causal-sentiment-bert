Accessing Web archives raises a number of issues caused by their temporal characteristics.
Additional knowledge is needed to find and understand older texts.
Especially entities mentioned in texts are subject to change.
Most severe in terms of information retrieval are name changes.
In order to find entities that have changed their name over time, search engines need to be aware of this evolution.
We tackle this problem by analyzing Wikipedia in terms of entity evolutions mentioned in articles.
We present statistical data on excerpts covering name changes, which will be used to discover similar text passages and extract evolution knowledge in future work.
