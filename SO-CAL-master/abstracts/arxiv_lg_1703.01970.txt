A new line of work [Dwork et al.
STOC 2015], [Hardt and Ullman FOCS 2014], [Steinke and Ullman COLT 2015], [Bassily et al.
STOC 2016] demonstrates how differential privacy [Dwork et al.
TCC 2006] can be used as a mathematical tool for guaranteeing generalization in adaptive data analysis.
Specifically, if a differentially private analysis is applied on a sample S of i.i.d.
examples to select a low-sensitivity function f, then w.h.p.
f(S) is close to its expectation, although f is being chosen based on the data.
