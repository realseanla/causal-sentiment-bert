The objective of machine learning is to extract useful information from data, while privacy is preserved by concealing information.
Thus it seems hard to reconcile these competing interests.

For example, medical research represents an important application where it is necessary both to extract useful information and protect patient privacy.
One way to resolve the conflict is to extract general characteristics of whole populations without disclosing the private information of individuals.
