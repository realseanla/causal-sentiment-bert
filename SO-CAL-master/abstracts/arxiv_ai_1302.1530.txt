This paper introduces a new algorithm for the induction if complex finite state automata from samples of behavior.
The algorithm is based on information theoretic principles.
The algorithm reduces the search space by many orders of magnitude over what was previously thought possible.
We compare the algorithm with some existing induction techniques for finite state automata and show that the algorithm is much superior in both run time and quality of inductions.
