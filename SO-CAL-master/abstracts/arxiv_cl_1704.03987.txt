We propose a finite-state transducer (FST) representation for the models used to decode keyboard inputs on mobile devices.
Drawing from learnings from the field of speech recognition, we describe a decoding framework that can satisfy the strict memory and latency constraints of keyboard input.
We extend this framework to support functionalities typically not present in speech recognition, such as literal decoding, autocorrections, word completions, and next word predictions.
