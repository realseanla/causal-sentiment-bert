This paper examines the interdependence generated between two parent nodes with a common instantiated child node, such as two hypotheses sharing common evidence.
The relation so generated has been termed "intercausal."
It is shown by construction that inter-causal independence is possible for binary distributions at one state of evidence.
For such "CICI" distributions, the two measures of inter-causal effect, "multiplicative synergy" and "additive synergy" are equal.
The well known "noisy-or" model is an example of such a distribution.
This introduces novel semantics for the noisy-or, as a model of the degree of conflict among competing hypotheses of a common observation.
