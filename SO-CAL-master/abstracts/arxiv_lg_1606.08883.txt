This paper addresses the problem of non-Bayesian learning over multi-agent networks, where agents repeatedly collect partially informative observations about an unknown state of the world, and try to collaboratively learn the true state.
We focus on the impact of the adversarial agents on the performance of consensus-based non-Bayesian learning, where non-faulty agents combine local learning updates with consensus primitives.
In particular, we consider the scenario where an unknown subset of agents suffer Byzantine faults -- agents suffering Byzantine faults behave arbitrarily.
Two different learning rules are proposed.
