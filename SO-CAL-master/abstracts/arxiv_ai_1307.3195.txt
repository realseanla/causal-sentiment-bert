In this paper we propose an architecture for specifying the interaction of non-player characters (NPCs) in the game-world in a way that abstracts common tasks in four main conceptual components, namely perception, deliberation, control, action.
We argue that this architecture, inspired by AI research on autonomous agents and robots, can offer a number of benefits in the form of abstraction, modularity, re-usability and higher degrees of personalization for the behavior of each NPC.
We also show how this architecture can be used to tackle a simple scenario related to the navigation of NPCs under incomplete information about the obstacles that may obstruct the various way-points in the game, in a simple and effective way.
