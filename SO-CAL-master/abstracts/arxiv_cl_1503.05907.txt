This paper discusses the structure of Syntagma's Lexical Database (focused on Italian).
The basic database consists in four tables.
Table Forms contains word inflections, used by the POS-tagger for the identification of input-words.
Forms is related to Lemma.
Table Lemma stores all kinds of grammatical features of words, word-level semantic data and restrictions.
In the table Meanings meaning-related data are stored: definition, examples, domain, and semantic information.
Table Valency contains the argument structure of each meaning, with syntactic and semantic features for each argument.
The extended version of SLD contains the links to Syntagma's Semantic Net and to the WordNet synsets of other languages.
