The effect of inaccuracies in the parameters of a dynamic Bayesian network can be investigated by subjecting the network to a sensitivity analysis.
Having detailed the resulting sensitivity functions in our previous work, we now study the effect of parameter inaccuracies on a recommended decision in view of a threshold decision-making model.
We detail the effect of varying a single and multiple parameters from a conditional probability table and present a computational procedure for establishing bounds between which assessments for these parameters can be varied without inducing a change in the recommended decision.
We illustrate the various concepts involved by means of a real-life dynamic network in the field of infectious disease.
