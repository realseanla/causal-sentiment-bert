In this work we extend to the interval-valued setting the notion of an overlap functions and we discuss a method which makes use of interval-valued overlap functions for constructing OWA operators with interval-valued weights.
.
Some properties of interval-valued overlap functions and the derived interval-valued OWA operators are analysed.
We specially focus on the homogeneity and migrativity properties.
