BADREX uses dynamically generated regular expressions to annotate term definition-term abbreviation pairs, and corefers unpaired acronyms and abbreviations back to their initial definition in the text.
Against the Medstract corpus BADREX achieves precision and recall of 98 percent and 97 percent, and against a much larger corpus, 90 percent and 85 percent, respectively.
BADREX yields improved performance over previous approaches, requires no training data and allows runtime customisation of its input parameters.
