In this paper $\ast$--compatible extensions of fuzzy relations are studied, generalizing some results obtained by Duggan in case of crisp relations.
From this general result are obtained as particular cases fuzzy versions of some important extension theorems for crisp relations (Szpilrajn, Hansson, Suzumura).
Two notions of consistent closure of a fuzzy relation are introduced.
