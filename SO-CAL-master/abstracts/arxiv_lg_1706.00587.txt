A modern operating room (OR) provides a plethora of advanced medical devices.
In order to better facilitate the information offered by them, they need to automatically react to the intra-operative context.
To this end, the progress of the surgical workflow must be detected and interpreted, so that the current status can be given in machine-readable form.
In this work, Random Forests (RF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are compared and combined to detect the surgical workflow phase of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Various combinations of data were tested, from using only raw sensor data to filtered and augmented datasets.
Achieved accuracies ranged from 64 percent to 72 percent for the RF approach, and from 80 percent to 82 percent for the combination of RF and HMM.
