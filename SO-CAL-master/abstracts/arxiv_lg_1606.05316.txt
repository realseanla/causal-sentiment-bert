Infinite--Layer Networks (ILN) have recently been proposed as an architecture that mimics neural networks while enjoying some of the advantages of kernel methods.
ILN are networks that integrate over infinitely many nodes within a single hidden layer.
It has been demonstrated by several authors that the problem of learning ILN can be reduced to the kernel trick, implying that whenever a certain integral can be computed analytically they are efficiently learnable.
