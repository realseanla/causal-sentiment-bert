In this note, we discuss and analyse a shortest path finding approach using strong spatial cognition.
It is compared with a symbolic graph-based algorithm and it is shown that both approaches are similar with respect to structure and complexity.
Nevertheless, the strong spatial cognition solution is easy to understand and even pops up immediately when one has to solve the problem.
