We present our submitted systems for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) Track 4 at SemEval-2017.
Given a pair of Spanish-English sentences, each system must estimate their semantic similarity by a score between 0 and 5.
In our submission, we use syntax-based, dictionary-based, context-based, and MT-based methods.
We also combine these methods in unsupervised and supervised way.
Our best run ranked 1st on track 4a with a correlation of 83.02 percent with human annotations.
