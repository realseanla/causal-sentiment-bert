This works handles the inverse reinforcement learning problem in high-dimensional state spaces, which relies on an efficient solution of model-based high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems.
To solve the computationally expensive reinforcement learning problems, we propose a function approximation method to ensure that the Bellman Optimality Equation always holds, and then estimate a function based on the observed human actions for inverse reinforcement learning problems.
The time complexity of the proposed method is linearly proportional to the cardinality of the action set, thus it can handle high-dimensional even continuous state spaces efficiently.
We test the proposed method in a simulated environment to show its accuracy, and three clinical tasks to show how it can be used to evaluate a doctor's proficiency.
