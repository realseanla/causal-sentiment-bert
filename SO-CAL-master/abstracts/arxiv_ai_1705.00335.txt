Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population worldwide.
However, the methods traditionally used for estimating and characterizing the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming and expensive.
Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence of mental health conditions are often years out of date.
Automated approaches to supplement these survey methods with broad, aggregated information derived from social media content provides a potential means for near real-time estimates at scale.
These may, in turn, provide grist for supporting, evaluating and iteratively improving upon public health programs and interventions.
