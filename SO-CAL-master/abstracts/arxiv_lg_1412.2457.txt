Polynomial approximations to boolean functions have led to many positive results in computer science.
In particular, polynomial approximations to the sign function underly algorithms for agnostically learning halfspaces, as well as pseudorandom generators for halfspaces.
In this work, we investigate the limits of these techniques by proving inapproximability results for the sign function.
