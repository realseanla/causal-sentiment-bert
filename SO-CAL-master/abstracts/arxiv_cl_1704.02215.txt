This paper describes our approach to the SemEval 2017 Task 10: "Extracting Keyphrases and Relations from Scientific Publications", specifically to Subtask (B): "Classification of identified keyphrases".
We explored three different deep learning approaches: a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN), a stacked learner with an MLP meta-classifier, and an attention based Bi-LSTM.
From these approaches, we created an ensemble of differently hyper-parameterized systems, achieving a micro-F 1 -score of 0.63 on the test data.
Our approach ranks 2nd (score of 1st placed system: 0.64) out of four according to this official score.
However, we erroneously trained 2 out of 3 neural nets (the stacker and the CNN) on only roughly 15 percent of the full data, namely, the original development set.
When trained on the full data (training+development), our ensemble has a micro-F 1 -score of 0.69.
