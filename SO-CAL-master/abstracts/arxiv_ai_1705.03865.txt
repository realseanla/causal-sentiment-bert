Visual question answering (or VQA) is a new and exciting problem that combines natural language processing and computer vision techniques.
We present a survey of the various datasets and models that have been used to tackle this task.
The first part of the survey details the various datasets for VQA and compares them along some common factors.
The second part of this survey details the different approaches for VQA, classified into four types: non-deep learning models, deep learning models without attention, deep learning models with attention, and other models which do not fit into the first three.
Finally, we compare the performances of these approaches and provide some directions for future work.
