We present an approach to automatically classify clinical text at a sentence level.
We are using deep convolutional neural networks to represent complex features.
We train the network on a dataset providing a broad categorization of health information.
Through a detailed evaluation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms several approaches widely used in natural language processing tasks by about 15 percent.
