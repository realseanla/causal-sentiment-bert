Modern robotics applications that involve human-robot interaction require robots to be able to communicate with humans seamlessly and effectively.
Natural language provides a flexible and efficient medium through which robots can exchange information with their human partners.
Significant advancements have been made in developing robots capable of interpreting free-form instructions, but less attention has been devoted to endowing robots with the ability to generate natural language.
We propose a navigational guide model that enables robots to generate natural language instructions that allow humans to navigate a priori unknown environments.
We first decide which information to share with the user according to their preferences, using a policy trained from human demonstrations via inverse reinforcement learning.
We then "translate" this information into a natural language instruction using a neural sequence-to-sequence model that learns to generate free-form instructions from natural language corpora.
We evaluate our method on a benchmark route instruction dataset and achieve a BLEU score of 72.18 percent when compared to human-generated reference instructions.
We additionally conduct navigation experiments with human participants that demonstrate that our method generates instructions that people follow as accurately and easily as those produced by humans.
