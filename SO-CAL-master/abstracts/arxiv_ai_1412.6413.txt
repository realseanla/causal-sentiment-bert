Knowledge is only good if it is sound, consistent and complete.
The same holds true for conceptual knowledge, which holds knowledge about concepts and its association.

This paper discusses consistency, soundness and completeness in the ambit of conceptual knowledge and the need to consider these factors as fundamental to the development of conceptual knowledge.
