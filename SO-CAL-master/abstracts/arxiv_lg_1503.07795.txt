Automated learning of patients demographics can be seen as multi-label problem where a patient model is based on different race and gender groups.
The resulting model can be further integrated into Privacy-Preserving Data Mining, where it can be used to assess risk of identification of different patient groups.
Our project considers relations between diabetes and demographics of patients as a multi-labelled problem.
Most research in this area has been done as binary classification, where the target class is finding if a person has diabetes or not.
But very few, and maybe no work has been done in multi-labeled analysis of the demographics of patients who are likely to be diagnosed with diabetes.
To identify such groups, we applied ensembles of several multi-label learning algorithms.
