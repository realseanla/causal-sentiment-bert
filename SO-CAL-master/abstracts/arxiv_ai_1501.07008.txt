Belief function theory provides a flexible way to combine information provided by different sources.
This combination is usually followed by a decision making which can be handled by a range of decision rules.
Some rules help to choose the most likely hypothesis.
Others allow that a decision is made on a set of hypotheses.
In [6], we proposed a decision rule based on a distance measure.
First, in this paper, we aim to demonstrate that our proposed decision rule is a particular case of the rule proposed in [4].
Second, we give experiments showing that our rule is able to decide on a set of hypotheses.
Some experiments are handled on a set of mass functions generated randomly, others on real databases.
