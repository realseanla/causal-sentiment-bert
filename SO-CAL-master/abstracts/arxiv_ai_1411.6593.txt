Recent advances in metareasoning for search has shown its usefulness in improving numerous search algorithms.
This paper applies rational metareasoning to IDA* when several admissible heuristics are available.
The obvious basic approach of taking the maximum of the heuristics is improved upon by lazy evaluation of the heuristics, resulting in a variant known as Lazy IDA*.
We introduce a rational version of lazy IDA* that decides whether to compute the more expensive heuristics or to bypass it, based on a myopic expected regret estimate.
Empirical evaluation in several domains supports the theoretical results, and shows that rational lazy IDA* is a state-of-the-art heuristic combination method.
