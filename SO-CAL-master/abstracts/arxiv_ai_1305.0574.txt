In this paper, we address the problem of enumerating all models of a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF).
We propose an extension of CDCL-based SAT solvers to deal with this fundamental problem.
Then, we provide an experimental evaluation of our proposed SAT model enumeration algorithms on both satisfiable SAT instances taken from the last SAT challenge and on instances from the SAT-based encoding of sequence mining problems.
