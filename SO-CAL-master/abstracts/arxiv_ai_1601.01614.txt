The developpment of the Internet of Things (IoT) concept revives Responsive Environments (RE) technologies.
Nowadays, the idea of a permanent connection between physical and digital world is technologically possible.
The capillar Internet relates to the Internet extension into daily appliances such as they become actors of Internet like any hu-man.
The parallel development of Machine-to-Machine communications and Arti cial Intelligence (AI) technics start a new area of cybernetic.
This paper presents an approach for Cybernetic Organism (Cyborg) for RE based on Organic Computing (OC).
In such approach, each appli-ance is a part of an autonomic system in order to control a physical environment.
The underlying idea is that such systems must have self-x properties in order to adapt their behavior to external disturbances with a high-degree of autonomy.
