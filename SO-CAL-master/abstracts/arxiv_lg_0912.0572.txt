Isometric feature mapping (Isomap) is a promising manifold learning method.
However, Isomap fails to work on data which distribute on clusters in a single manifold or manifolds.
Many works have been done on extending Isomap to multi-manifolds learning.
In this paper, we first proposed a new multi-manifolds learning algorithm (M-Isomap) with help of a general procedure.
The new algorithm preserves intra-manifold geodesics and multiple inter-manifolds edges precisely.
Compared with previous methods, this algorithm can isometrically learn data distributed on several manifolds.
Secondly, the original multi-cluster manifold learning algorithm first proposed in  and called D-C Isomap has been revised so that the revised D-C Isomap can learn multi-manifolds data.
Finally, the features and effectiveness of the proposed multi-manifolds learning algorithms are demonstrated and compared through experiments.
