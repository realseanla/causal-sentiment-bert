Existing works for extracting navigation objects from webpages focus on navigation menus, so as to reveal the information architecture of the site.
However, web 2.0 sites such as social networks, e-commerce portals etc.
are making the understanding of the content structure in a web site increasingly difficult.
Dynamic and personalized elements such as top stories, recommended list in a webpage are vital to the understanding of the dynamic nature of web 2.0 sites.
To better understand the content structure in web 2.0 sites, in this paper we propose a new extraction method for navigation objects in a webpage.
Our method will extract not only the static navigation menus, but also the dynamic and personalized page-specific navigation lists.
Since the navigation objects in a webpage naturally come in blocks, we first cluster hyperlinks into different blocks by exploiting spatial locations of hyperlinks, the hierarchical structure of the DOM-tree and the hyperlink density.
Then we identify navigation objects from those blocks using the SVM classifier with novel features such as anchor text lengths etc.
Experiments on real-world data sets with webpages from various domains and styles verified the effectiveness of our method.
