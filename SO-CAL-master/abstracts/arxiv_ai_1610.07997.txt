In this work, we present and analyze reported failures of artificially intelligent systems and extrapolate our analysis to future AIs.
We suggest that both the frequency and the seriousness of future AI failures will steadily increase.
AI Safety can be improved based on ideas developed by cybersecurity experts.
For narrow AIs safety failures are at the same, moderate, level of criticality as in cybersecurity, however for general AI, failures have a fundamentally different impact.
A single failure of a superintelligent system may cause a catastrophic event without a chance for recovery.
The goal of cybersecurity is to reduce the number of successful attacks on the system; the goal of AI Safety is to make sure zero attacks succeed in bypassing the safety mechanisms.
Unfortunately, such a level of performance is unachievable.
Every security system will eventually fail; there is no such thing as a 100 percent secure system.
