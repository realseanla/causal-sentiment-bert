In economics and psychology, delay discounting is often used to characterize how individuals choose between a smaller immediate reward and a larger delayed reward.
People with higher delay discounting rate (DDR) often choose smaller but more immediate rewards (a "today person").
In contrast, people with a lower discounting rate often choose a larger future rewards (a "tomorrow person").
Since the ability to modulate the desire of immediate gratification for long term rewards plays an important role in our decision-making, the lower discounting rate often predicts better social, academic and health outcomes.
In contrast, the higher discounting rate is often associated with problematic behaviors such as alcohol/drug abuse, pathological gambling and credit card default.
Thus, research on understanding and moderating delay discounting has the potential to produce substantial societal benefits.
