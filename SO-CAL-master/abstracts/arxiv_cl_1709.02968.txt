Biographical databases contain diverse information about individuals.
Person names, birth information, career, friends, family and special achievements are some possible items in the record for an individual.
The relationships between individuals, such as kinship and friendship, provide invaluable insights about hidden communities which are not directly recorded in databases.
We show that some simple matrix and graph-based operations are effective for inferring relationships among individuals, and illustrate the main ideas with the China Biographical Database (CBDB).
