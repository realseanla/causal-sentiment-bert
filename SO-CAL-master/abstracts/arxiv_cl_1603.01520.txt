In this paper we discuss how semantic annotations can be used to introduce mathematical algorithmic information of the underlying imperative code to enable compilers to produce code transformations that will enable better performance.
By using this approaches not only good performance is achieved, but also better programmability, maintainability and portability across different hardware architectures.
To exemplify this we will use polynomial equations of different degrees.
