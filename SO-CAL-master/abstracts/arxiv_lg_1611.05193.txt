We describe a method for searching the optimal hyper-parameters in reservoir computing, which consists of a Gaussian process with Bayesian optimization.
It provides an alternative to other frequently used optimization methods such as grid, random, or manual search.
In addition to a set of optimal hyper-parameters, the method also provides a probability distribution of the cost function as a function of the hyper-parameters.
We apply this method to two types of reservoirs: nonlinear delay nodes and echo state networks.
It shows excellent performance on all considered benchmarks, either matching or significantly surpassing expert human optimization.
We find that some values for hyper-parameters that have become standard in the research community, are in fact suboptimal for most of the problems we considered.
In general, the algorithm achieves optimal results in fewer iterations when compared to other optimization methods, and scales well with increasing dimensionality of the hyper-parameter space.
Due to its automated nature, this method significantly reduces the need for expert knowledge when optimizing the hyper-parameters in reservoir computing.
Existing software libraries for Bayesian optimization make the implementation of the algorithm straightforward.
