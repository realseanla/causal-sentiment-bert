A stable joint plan should guarantee the achievement of a designer's goal in a multi-agent environment, while ensuring that deviations from the prescribed plan would be detected.
We present a computational framework where stable joint plans can be studied, as well as several basic results about the representation, verification and synthesis of stable joint plans.
