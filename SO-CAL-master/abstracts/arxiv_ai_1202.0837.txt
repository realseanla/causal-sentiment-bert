This paper analyses the influence of including agents of different degrees of intelligence in a multiagent system.
The goal is to better understand how we can develop intelligence tests that can evaluate social intelligence.
We analyse several reinforcement algorithms in several contexts of cooperation and competition.
Our experimental setting is inspired by the recently developed Darwin-Wallace distribution.
