The paper summarizes the development of the LVCSR system built as a part of the Pashto speech-translation system at the SCALE (Summer Camp for Applied Language Exploration) 2015 workshop on "Speech-to-text-translation for low-resource languages".
The Pashto language was chosen as a good "proxy" low-resource language, exhibiting multiple phenomena which make the speech-recognition and and speech-to-text-translation systems development hard.
