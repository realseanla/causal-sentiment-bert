System Z+ [Goldszmidt and Pearl, 1991, Goldszmidt, 1992] is a formalism for reasoning with normality defaults of the form "typically if phi then + (with strength cf)" where 6 is a positive integer.
The system has a critical shortcoming in that it does not sanction inheritance across exceptional subclasses.
In this paper we propose an extension to System Z+ that rectifies this shortcoming by extracting additional conditions between worlds from the defaults database.
We show that the additional constraints do not change the notion of the consistency of a database.
We also make comparisons with competing default reasoning systems.
