Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) exhibit remarkable performance in various machine learning tasks.
As sensor-equipped internet of things (IoT) devices permeate into every aspect of modern life, it is increasingly important to run CNN inference, a computationally intensive application, on resource constrained devices.
We present a technique for fast and energy-efficient CNN inference on mobile SoC platforms, which are projected to be a major player in the IoT space.
We propose techniques for efficient parallelization of CNN inference targeting mobile GPUs, and explore the underlying tradeoffs.
Experiments with running Squeezenet on three different mobile devices confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
