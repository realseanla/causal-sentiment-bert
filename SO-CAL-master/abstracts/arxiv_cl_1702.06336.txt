This paper presents a hybrid dialog state tracker enhanced by trainable Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) for slot-filling dialog systems.
Our architecture is inspired by previously proposed neural-network-based belief-tracking systems.
In addition, we extended some parts of our modular architecture with differentiable rules to allow end-to-end training.
We hypothesize that these rules allow our tracker to generalize better than pure machine-learning based systems.
For evaluation, we used the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset - a popular belief tracking testbed with dialogs from restaurant information system.
To our knowledge, our hybrid tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result in three out of four categories within the DSTC2.
