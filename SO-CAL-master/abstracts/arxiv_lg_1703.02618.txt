Graph-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms predict labels for all nodes based on provided labels of a small set of seed nodes.
Classic methods capture the graph structure through some underlying diffusion process that propagates through the graph edges.
Spectral diffusion, which includes personalized page rank and label propagation, propagates through random walks.
Social diffusion propagates through shortest paths.
A common ground to these diffusions is their {\em linearity}, which does not distinguish between contributions of few "strong" relations and many "weak" relations.
