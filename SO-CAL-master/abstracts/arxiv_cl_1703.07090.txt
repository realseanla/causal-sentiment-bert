Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long short-term memory (LSTM) RNNs, are effective network for sequential task like speech recognition.
Deeper LSTM models perform well on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition, because of their impressive learning ability.
However, it is more difficult to train a deeper network.
We introduce a training framework with layer-wise training and exponential moving average methods for deeper LSTM models.
It is a competitive framework that LSTM models of more than 7 layers are successfully trained on Shenma voice search data in Mandarin and they outperform the deep LSTM models trained by conventional approach.
Moreover, in order for online streaming speech recognition applications, the shallow model with low real time factor is distilled from the very deep model.
The recognition accuracy have little loss in the distillation process.
Therefore, the model trained with the proposed training framework reduces relative 14\ percent character error rate, compared to original model which has the similar real-time capability.
Furthermore, the novel transfer learning strategy with segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk is also introduced in the framework.
The strategy makes it possible that training with only a small part of dataset could outperform full dataset training from the beginning.
