Although deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have achieved remarkable results on object detection and segmentation, pre- and post-processing steps such as region proposals and non-maximum suppression(NMS), have been required.
These steps result in high computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters, e.g.
thresholds for NMS.
In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable deep neural network architecture that generates the correct number of object instances and their bounding boxes (or segmentation masks) given an image, using only a single network evaluation without any pre- or post-processing steps.
We have tested on detecting digits in multi-digit images synthesized using MNIST, automatically segmenting digits in these images, and detecting cars in the KITTI benchmark dataset.
The proposed approach outperforms a strong CNN baseline on the synthesized digits datasets and shows promising results on KITTI car detection.
