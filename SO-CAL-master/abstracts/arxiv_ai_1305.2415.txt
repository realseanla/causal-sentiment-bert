We present Exponentiated Gradient LINUCB, an algorithm for con-textual multi-armed bandits.
This algorithm uses Exponentiated Gradient to find the optimal exploration of the LINUCB.
Within a deliberately designed offline simulation framework we conduct evaluations with real online event log data.
The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms surveyed algorithms.
