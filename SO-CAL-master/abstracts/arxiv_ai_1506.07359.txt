Moving beyond the dualistic view in AI where agent and environment are separated incurs new challenges for decision making, as calculation of expected utility is no longer straightforward.
The non-dualistic decision theory literature is split between causal decision theory and evidential decision theory.
We extend these decision algorithms to the sequential setting where the agent alternates between taking actions and observing their consequences.
We find that evidential decision theory has two natural extensions while causal decision theory only has one.
