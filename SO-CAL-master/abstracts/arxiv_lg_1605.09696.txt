In this paper, the problem of multi-view embedding from different visual cues and modalities is considered.
We propose a unified solution for subspace learning methods using the Rayleigh quotient, which is extensible for multiple views, supervised learning, and non-linear embeddings.
Numerous methods including Canonical Correlation Analysis, Partial Least Sqaure regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis are studied using specific intrinsic and penalty graphs within the same framework.
Non-linear extensions based on kernels and (deep) neural networks are derived, achieving better performance than the linear ones.
Moreover, a novel variant of multi-view Linear Discriminant Analysis is proposed by taking the view difference into consideration.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view embedding methods on visual object recognition and cross-modal image retrieval, and obtain superior results in both applications compared to related methods.
