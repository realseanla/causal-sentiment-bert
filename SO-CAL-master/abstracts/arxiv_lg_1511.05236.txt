This work shows how using reduced precision data in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) affects network accuracy during classification.
Unlike similar studies, this study considers networks where each layer may use different precision data.
The key result of this study is that the tolerance of CNNs to reduced precision data not only varies across networks, a well established observation, but also within networks.
Tuning precision per layer is appealing as it could enable energy and performance improvements.
The trends of error tolerance across layers are studied and a method for finding a low precision configuration for a network while maintaining high accuracy is presented.
A diverse set of CNNs is analyzed showing that compared to a conventional implementation using a 32-bit floating-point representation for all layers, and with less than 1 percent loss in relative accuracy, the data footprint required by these networks can be reduced by an average of 74 percent and up to 92 percent.
