Without Linked Data, transport data is limited to applications exclusively around transport.
In this paper, we present a workflow for publishing and linking transport data on the Web.
So we will be able to develop transport applications and to add other features which will be created from other datasets.
This will be possible because transport data will be linked to these datasets.
We apply this workflow to two datasets: NEPTUNE, a French standard describing a transport line, and Passim, a directory containing relevant information on transport services, in every French city.
