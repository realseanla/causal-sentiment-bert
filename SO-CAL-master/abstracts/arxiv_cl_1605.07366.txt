Natural Language Generation systems typically have two parts - strategic ('what to say') and tactical ('how to say').
We present our experiments in building an unsupervised corpus-driven template based tactical NLG system.
We consider templates as a sequence of words containing gaps.
Our idea is based on the observation that templates are grammatical locally (within their textual span).
We posit the construction of a sentence as a highly restricted sequence of such templates.
This work is an attempt to explore the resulting search space using Genetic Algorithms to arrive at acceptable solutions.
We present a baseline implementation of this approach which outputs gapped text.
