In the last decade, several architectures have been proposed for exact computation of marginals using local computation.
In this paper, we compare three architectures - Lauritzen-Spiegelhalter, Hugin, and Shenoy-Shafer - from the perspective of graphical structure for message propagation, message-passing scheme, computational efficiency, and storage efficiency.
