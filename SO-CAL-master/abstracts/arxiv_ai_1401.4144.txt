We investigate an approach to reasoning about causes through argumentation.
We consider a causal model for a physical system, and look for arguments about facts.
Some arguments are meant to provide explanations of facts whereas some challenge these explanations and so on.
At the root of argumentation here, are causal links ({A_1, ... ,A_n} causes B) and ontological links (o_1 is_a o_2).
We present a system that provides a candidate explanation ({A_1, ... ,A_n} explains {B_1, ... ,B_m}) by resorting to an underlying causal link substantiated with appropriate ontological links.
Argumentation is then at work from these various explaining links.
A case study is developed: a severe storm Xynthia that devastated part of France in 2010, with an unaccountably high number of casualties.
