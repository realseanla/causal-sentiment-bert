Classical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are ubiquitous in statistics.
However, these techniques only reveal linear relationships in data.
Although nonlinear variants of PCA and CCA have been proposed, they are computationally prohibitive in the large scale.
