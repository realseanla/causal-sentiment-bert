We introduce a powerful recurrent neural network based method for novelty detection to the application of detecting radio anomalies.
This approach holds promise in significantly increasing the ability of naive anomaly detection to detect small anomalies in highly complex complexity multi-user radio bands.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on a number of common real over the air radio communications bands of interest and quantify detection performance in terms of probability of detection an false alarm rates across a range of interference to band power ratios and compare to baseline methods.
