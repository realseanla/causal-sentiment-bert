This paper describes a novel approach to software engineering derived from the "SP theory of intelligence" and its realisation in the "SP computer model".
These are the bases of a projected industrial-strength "SP machine" which, when mature, is anticipated to be the vehicle for software engineering as described in this paper.
Potential benefits of this new approach to software engineering include: the automation of semi-automation of software development, with non-automatic programming of the SP system where necessary; allowing programmers to concentrate on 'real-world' parallelism, without worries about parallelism to speed up processing; the ambitious long-term goal of programming the SP system via written or spoken natural language; reducing or eliminating the distinction between 'design' and 'implementation'; reducing or eliminating operations like compiling or interpretation; reducing or eliminating the need for verification of software; reducing the need for an explicit process of validation of software; no formal distinction between program and database; potential for substantial reductions in the number of types of data file and the number of computer languages; benefits for version control; and reducing technical debt.
