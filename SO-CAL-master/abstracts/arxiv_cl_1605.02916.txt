Pattern-based methods of IS-A relation extraction rely heavily on so called Hearst patterns.
These are ways of expressing instance enumerations of a class in natural language.
While these lexico-syntactic patterns prove quite useful, they may not capture all taxonomical relations expressed in text.
Therefore in this paper we describe a novel method of IS-A relation extraction from patterns, which uses morpho-syntactical annotations along with grammatical case of noun phrases that constitute entities participating in IS-A relation.
We also describe a method for increasing the number of extracted relations that we call pseudo-subclass boosting which has potential application in any pattern-based relation extraction method.
Experiments were conducted on a corpus of about 0.5 billion web documents in Polish language.
