Possibilistic logic offers a qualitative framework for representing pieces of information associated with levels of uncertainty of priority.
The fusion of multiple sources information is discussed in this setting.
Different classes of merging operators are considered including conjunctive, disjunctive, reinforcement, adaptive and averaging operators.
Then we propose to analyse these classes in terms of postulates.
This is done by first extending the postulate for merging classical bases to the case where priorites are avaialbe.
