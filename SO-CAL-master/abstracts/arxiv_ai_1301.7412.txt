One of the benefits of belief networks and influence diagrams is that so much knowledge is captured in the graphical structure.
In particular, statements of conditional irrelevance (or independence) can be verified in time linear in the size of the graph.
To resolve a particular inference query or decision problem, only some of the possible states and probability distributions must be specified, the "requisite information."
