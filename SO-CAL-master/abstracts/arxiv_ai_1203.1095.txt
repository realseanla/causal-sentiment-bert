The ability to model search in a constraint solver can be an essential asset for solving combinatorial problems.
However, existing infrastructure for defining search heuristics is often inadequate.
Either modeling capabilities are extremely limited or users are faced with a general-purpose programming language whose features are not tailored towards writing search heuristics.
As a result, major improvements in performance may remain unexplored.
