Deontic logic is a very well researched branch of mathematical logic and philosophy.
Various kinds of deontic logics are discussed for different application domains like argumentation theory, legal reasoning, and acts in multi-agent systems.
In this paper, we show how standard deontic logic can be stepwise transformed into description logic and DL- clauses, such that it can be processed by Hyper, a high performance theorem prover which uses a hypertableau calculus.
Two use cases, one from multi-agent research and one from the development of normative system are investigated.
