In this paper we propose the Structured Deep Neural Network (structured DNN) as a structured and deep learning framework.
This approach can learn to find the best structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between the structures rather than item by item.
