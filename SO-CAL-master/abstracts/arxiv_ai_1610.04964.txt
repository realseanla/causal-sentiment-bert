The problem of solving $(n^2-1)$-puzzle and cooperative path-finding (CPF) sub-optimally by rule based algorithms is addressed in this manuscript.
The task in the puzzle is to rearrange $n^2-1$ pebbles on the square grid of the size of n x n using one vacant position to a desired goal configuration.
An improvement to the existent polynomial-time algorithm is proposed and experimentally analyzed.
The improved algorithm is trying to move pebbles in a more efficient way than the original algorithm by grouping them into so-called snakes and moving them jointly within the snake.
An experimental evaluation showed that the algorithm using snakes produces solutions that are 8 percent to 9 percent shorter than solutions generated by the original algorithm.
