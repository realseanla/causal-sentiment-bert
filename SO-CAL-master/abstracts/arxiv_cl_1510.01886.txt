This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the existing gap on message translations in dialogue systems.
Currently, submitted messages to the dialogue systems are considered as isolated sentences.
Thus, missing context information impede the disambiguation of homographs words in ambiguous sentences.
Our approach solves this disambiguation problem by using concepts over existing ontologies.
