We introduce a globally normalized transition-based neural network model that achieves state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing and sentence compression results.
Our model is a simple feed-forward neural network that operates on a task-specific transition system, yet achieves comparable or better accuracies than recurrent models.
The key insight is based on a novel proof illustrating the label bias problem and showing that globally normalized models can be strictly more expressive than locally normalized models.
