There exist two general forms of exact algorithms for updating probabilities in Bayesian Networks.
The first approach involves using a structure, usually a clique tree, and performing local message based calculation to extract the belief in each variable.
The second general class of algorithm involves the use of non-serial dynamic programming techniques to extract the belief in some desired group of variables.
In this paper we present a hybrid algorithm based on the latter approach yet possessing the ability to retrieve the belief in all single variables.
The technique is advantageous in that it saves a NP-hard computation step over using one algorithm of each type.
Furthermore, this technique re-enforces a conjecture of Jensen and Jensen [JJ94] in that it still requires a single NP-hard step to set up the structure on which inference is performed, as we show by confirming Li and D'Ambrosio's [LD94] conjectured NP-hardness of OFP.
