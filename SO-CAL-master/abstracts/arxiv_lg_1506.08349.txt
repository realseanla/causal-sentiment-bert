A deep learning approach has been proposed recently to derive speaker identifies (d-vector) by a deep neural network (DNN).
This approach has been applied to text-dependent speaker recognition tasks and shows reasonable performance gains when combined with the conventional i-vector approach.
Although promising, the existing d-vector implementation still can not compete with the i-vector baseline.
This paper presents two improvements for the deep learning approach: a phonedependent DNN structure to normalize phone variation, and a new scoring approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW).
Experiments on a text-dependent speaker recognition task demonstrated that the proposed methods can provide considerable performance improvement over the existing d-vector implementation.
