In this exploratory note we ask the question of what a measure of performance for all tasks is like if we use a weighting of tasks based on a difficulty function.
This difficulty function depends on the complexity of the (acceptable) solution for the task (instead of a universal distribution over tasks or an adaptive test).
The resulting aggregations and decompositions are (now retrospectively) seen as the natural (and trivial) interactive generalisation of the $C$-tests.
