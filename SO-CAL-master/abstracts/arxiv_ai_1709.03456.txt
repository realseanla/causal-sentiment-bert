This paper introduces a novel activity dataset which exhibits real-life and diverse scenarios of complex, temporally-extended human activities and actions.
The dataset presents a set of videos of actors performing everyday activities in a natural and unscripted manner.
The dataset was recorded using a static Kinect 2 sensor which is commonly used on many robotic platforms.
The dataset comprises of RGB-D images, point cloud data, automatically generated skeleton tracks in addition to crowdsourced annotations.
Furthermore, we also describe the methodology used to acquire annotations through crowdsourcing.
Finally some activity recognition benchmarks are presented using current state-of-the-art techniques.
We believe that this dataset is particularly suitable as a testbed for activity recognition research but it can also be applicable for other common tasks in robotics/computer vision research such as object detection and human skeleton tracking.
