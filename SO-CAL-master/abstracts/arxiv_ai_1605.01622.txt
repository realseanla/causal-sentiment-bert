We improve further the 2015 version of abcdSAT by various heuristics such as at-least-one recently used strategy, learnt clause database approximation reduction etc.
Based on the requirement of different tracks at the SAT Competition 2016, we develop three versions of abcdSAT: drup, inc and lim, which participate in the competition of main (agile), incremental library and no-limit track, respectively.
