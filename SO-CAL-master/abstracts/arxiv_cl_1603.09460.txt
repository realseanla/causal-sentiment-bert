Noticeable performance degradation is often observed in text-independent speaker recognition with short test utterances.
This paper presents a combination approach to improve short utterance speaker recognition (SUSR), where two phonetic-aware systems are combined together: one is the DNN-based i-vector system and the other is the subregion-based GMM-UBM system proposed by us recently.
The former employs phone posteriors to construct an i-vector model in which the shared statistics offer stronger robustness against limited test data.
The latter establishes a phone-dependent GMM-UBM system which represents speaker characteristics with more details.
A scorelevel system combination approach is proposed to integrate the respective advantages of the two systems.
Experimental results confirm that on the text-independent SUSR task, both the DNN-based i-vector system and the subregion-based GMM-UBM system outperform their respective baselines, and the score-level system combination delivers significant performance improvement.
