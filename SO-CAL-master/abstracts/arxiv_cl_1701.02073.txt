In this paper, we focus on the personalized response generation for conversational systems.
Based on the sequence to sequence learning, especially the encoder-decoder framework, we propose a two-phase approach, namely initialization then adaptation, to model the responding style of human and then generate personalized responses.
For evaluation, we propose a novel human aided method to evaluate the performance of the personalized response generation models by online real-time conversation and offline human judgement.
Moreover, the lexical divergence of the responses generated by the 5 personalized models indicates that the proposed two-phase approach achieves good results on modeling the responding style of human and generating personalized responses for the conversational systems.
