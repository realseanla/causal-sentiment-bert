The automatic ranking of word pairs as per their semantic relatedness and ability to mimic human notions of semantic relatedness has widespread applications.
Measures that rely on raw data (distributional measures) and those that use knowledge-rich ontologies both exist.
Although extensive studies have been performed to compare ontological measures with human judgment, the distributional measures have primarily been evaluated by indirect means.
This paper is a detailed study of some of the major distributional measures; it lists their respective merits and limitations.
New measures that overcome these drawbacks, that are more in line with the human notions of semantic relatedness, are suggested.
The paper concludes with an exhaustive comparison of the distributional and ontology-based measures.
Along the way, significant research problems are identified.
Work on these problems may lead to a better understanding of how semantic relatedness is to be measured.
