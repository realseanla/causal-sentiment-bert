The spacing between two adjacent formants, which is known to play an important role in the perceived vowel quality, also determines the level of the spectral valley between them.
An objective critical distance (OCD) has been defined as that spacing between adjacent formants, when the level of the valley between them reaches the mean spectral level.
The measured OCD for synthetic vowels lies in the same range (viz., 3-3.5 bark) as the critical distance determined by subjective experiments for similar experimental conditions.
The computed OCD is vowel dependent and varies over a wide range.
The level of spectral valley serves a similar purpose as that of the spacing between the formants with an added advantage that it can be measured from the spectral envelope without an explicit knowledge of formant frequencies.
To demonstrate this, vowels have been classified into front/back based on the relative level of the spectral valley giving an accuracy of about 98  percent.
Information relating to the spectral valleys seems promising, which needs to be explored further.
