One task that is included in managing documents is how to find substantial information inside.
Topic modeling is a technique that has been developed to produce document representation in form of keywords.
The keywords will be used in the indexing process and document retrieval as needed by users.
In this research, we will discuss specifically about Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA).
It will cover PLSA mechanism which involves Expectation Maximization (EM) as the training algorithm, how to conduct testing, and obtain the accuracy result.
