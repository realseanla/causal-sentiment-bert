Differential privacy is a cryptographically-motivated definition of privacy which has gained significant attention over the past few years.
Differentially private solutions enforce privacy by adding random noise to a function computed over the data, and the challenge in designing such algorithms is to control the added noise in order to optimize the privacy-accuracy-sample size tradeoff.
