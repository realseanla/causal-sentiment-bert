In this paper new hierarchical hybrid fuzzy-crisp methods for decision making and action selection of an agent in soccer simulation 3D environment are presented.
First, the skills of an agent are introduced, implemented and classified in two layers, the basicskills and the highlevel skills.
In the second layer, a twophase mechanism for decision making is introduced.
In phase one, some useful methods are implemented which check the agent's situation for performing required skills.
In the next phase, the team str ategy, team for mation, agent's role and the agent's positioning system are introduced.
A fuzzy logical approach is employed to recognize the team strategy and further more to tell the player the best position to move.
At last, we comprised our implemented algor ithm in the Robocup Soccer Simulation 3D environment and results showed th eefficiency of the introduced methodology.
