Fuzzy logic is an alternate approach for quantifying uncertainty relating to activity duration.
The fuzzy version of the backward recursion has been shown to produce results that incorrectly amplify the level of uncertainty.
However, the fuzzy version of the forward recursion has been widely proposed as an approach for determining the fuzzy set of critical path lengths.
In this paper, the direct application of the extension principle leads to a proposition that must be satisfied in fuzzy critical path analysis.
Using a counterexample it is demonstrated that the fuzzy forward recursion when discrete fuzzy sets are used to represent activity durations produces results that are not consistent with the theory presented.
The problem is shown to be the application of the fuzzy maximum.
Several methods presented in the literature are described and shown to provide results that are consistent with the extension principle.
