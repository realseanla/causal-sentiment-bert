Many learning tasks combine perceptual and cognitive (e.g.
logical, symbolic) sub-tasks.
In some cases end-to-end learning of the perceptual and cognitive sub-tasks can be more difficult than learning each sub-task individually.
In other cases such end-to-end learning can be very efficient.
As end-to-end learning is becoming more prevalent in AI, it is important to understand when this approach can work efficiently.
