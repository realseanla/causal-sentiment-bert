Wikipedia is a useful knowledge source that benefits many applications in language processing and knowledge representation.
An important feature of Wikipedia is that of categories.
Wikipedia pages are assigned different categories according to their contents as human-annotated labels which can be used in information retrieval, ad hoc search improvements, entity ranking and tag recommendations.
However, important pages are usually assigned too many categories, which makes it difficult to recognize the most important ones that give the best descriptions.
