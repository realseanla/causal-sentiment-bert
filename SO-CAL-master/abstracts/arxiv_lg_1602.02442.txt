We describe a novel optimization method for finite sums (such as empirical risk minimization problems) building on the recently introduced SAGA method.
Our method achieves an accelerated convergence rate on strongly convex smooth problems, matching the conjectured optimal rate.
Our method has only one parameter (a step size), and is radically simpler than other accelerated methods for finite sums.
