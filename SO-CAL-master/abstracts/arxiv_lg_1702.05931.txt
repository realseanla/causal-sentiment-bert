The development of reliable imaging biomarkers for the analysis of colorectal cancer (CRC) in hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained histopathology images requires an accurate and reproducible classification of the main tissue components in the image.
In this paper, we propose a system for CRC tissue classification based on convolutional networks (ConvNets).
We investigate the importance of stain normalization in tissue classification of CRC tissue samples in H&amp;E-stained images.
Furthermore, we report the performance of ConvNets on a cohort of rectal cancer samples and on an independent publicly available dataset of colorectal H&amp;E images.
