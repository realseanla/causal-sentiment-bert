The proposed methodology is procedural i.e.
it follows finite number of steps that extracts relevant documents according to users query.
It is based on principles of Data Mining for analyzing web data.
Data Mining first adapts integration of data to generate warehouse.
Then, it extracts useful information with the help of algorithm.
The task of representing extracted documents is done by using Vector Based Statistical Approach that represents each document in set of Terms.
