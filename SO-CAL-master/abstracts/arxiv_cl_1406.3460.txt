Controlled natural languages for industrial application are often regarded as a response to the challenges of translation and multilingual communication.
This paper presents a quite different approach taken by Koenig &amp; Bauer AG, where the main goal was the improvement of the authoring process for technical documentation.
Most importantly, this paper explores the notion of a controlled language and demonstrates how style guides can emerge from non-linguistic considerations.
Moreover, it shows the transition from loose language recommendations into precise and prescriptive rules and investigates whether such rules can be regarded as a full-fledged controlled language.
