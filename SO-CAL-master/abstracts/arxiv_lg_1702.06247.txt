Recommendation system is a common demand in daily life and matrix completion is a widely adopted technique for this task.
However, most matrix completion methods lack semantic interpretation and usually result in weak-semantic recommendations.
To this end, this paper proposes a {\bf S}emantic {\bf A}nalysis approach for {\bf R}ecommendation systems \textbf{(SAR)}, which applies a two-level hierarchical generative process that assigns semantic properties and categories for user and item.
SAR learns semantic representations of users/items merely from user ratings on items, which offers a new path to recommendation by semantic matching with the learned representations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate SAR outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.
