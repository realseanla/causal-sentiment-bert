This paper describes the analysis of a selected testbed of Semantic Web ontologies, by a SPARQL query, which determines those ontologies that can be related to the description logic DL&lt;ForAllPiZero&gt;, introduced in [4] and studied in [9].
We will see that a reasonable number of them is expressible within such computationally efficient language.
We expect that, in a long-term view, a temporalization of description logics, and consequently, of OWL(2), can open new perspectives for the inclusion in this language of a greater number of ontologies of the testbed and, hopefully, of the "real world".
