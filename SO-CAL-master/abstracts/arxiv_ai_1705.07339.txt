The Maximum Balanced Biclique Problem is a well-known graph model with relevant applications in diverse domains.
This paper introduces a novel algorithm, which combines an effective constraint-based tabu search procedure and two dedicated graph reduction techniques.
We verify the effectiveness of the algorithm on 30 classical random benchmark graphs and 25 very large real-life sparse graphs from the popular Koblenz Network Collection (KONECT).
The results show that the algorithm improves the best-known results (new lower bounds) for 10 classical benchmarks and obtains the optimal solutions for 14 KONECT instances.
