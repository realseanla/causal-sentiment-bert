Suppose we want to build a system that answers a natural language question by representing its semantics as a logical form and computing the answer given a structured database of facts.
The core part of such a system is the semantic parser that maps questions to logical forms.
Semantic parsers are typically trained from examples of questions annotated with their target logical forms, but this type of annotation is expensive.
