In this work, we aim at developing an extractive summarizer in the multi-document setting.
We implement a rank based sentence selection using continuous vector representations along with key-phrases.
Furthermore, we propose a model to tackle summary coherence for increasing readability.
We conduct experiments on the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) 2004 datasets using ROUGE toolkit.
Our experiments demonstrate that the methods bring significant improvements over the state of the art methods in terms of informativity and coherence.
