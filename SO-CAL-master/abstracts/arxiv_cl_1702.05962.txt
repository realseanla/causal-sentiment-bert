We present a dialogue generation model that directly captures the variability in possible responses to a given input, which reduces the `boring output' issue of deterministic dialogue models.
Experiments show that our model generates more diverse outputs than baseline models, and also generates more consistently acceptable output than sampling from a deterministic encoder-decoder model.
