This paper aims to highlight distinctive features of the "SP theory of intelligence" and its apparent advantages compared with some AI-related alternatives.
The theory is outlined in an appendix.
The distinctive features and advantages are summarised: simplification and integration of observations and concepts, and of structures and processes in computing systems; the SP theory is itself a theory of computing; a central role for information compression via the matching and unification of patterns, and for multiple alignment; transparency in the representation and processing of knowledge; the discovery of 'natural' structures via information compression (DONSVIC); interpretation of aspects of mathematics; interpretation of phenomena in human perception and cognition; realisation of abstract concepts in terms of neurons and their inter-connections ("SP-neural").
Distinctive features and advantages of the SP system compared with alternatives in: minimum length encoding and related concepts; deep learning in neural networks; universal search; Bayesian networks and other models for AI; analysis and production of natural language; learning natural language; exact and inexact reasoning; representation and processing of diverse forms of knowledge; IBM's Watson; problems associated with big data, and in the development of intelligence in autonomous robots.
In conclusion, a major strength of SP system is that it can provide a firm foundation for the long-term development of AI and, at the same time, it may deliver some benefits and applications on relatively short timescales.
It is envisaged that a high-parallel, open-source version of the SP machine will be created, hosted on an existing high-performance computer and derived from the existing SP computer model.
This will be a means for researchers everywhere to explore what can be done with the system, and to create new versions of it.
