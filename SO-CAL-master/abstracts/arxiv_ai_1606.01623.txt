A kidney exchange is an organized barter market where patients in need of a kidney swap willing but incompatible donors.
Determining an optimal set of exchanges is theoretically and empirically hard.
Traditionally, exchanges took place in cycles, with each participating patient-donor pair both giving and receiving a kidney.
The recent introduction of chains, where a donor without a paired patient triggers a sequence of donations without requiring a kidney in return, increased the efficacy of fielded kidney exchanges---while also dramatically raising the empirical computational hardness of clearing the market in practice.
While chains can be quite long, unbounded-length chains are not desirable: planned donations can fail before transplant for a variety of reasons, and the failure of a single donation causes the rest of that chain to fail, so parallel shorter chains are better in practice.
