The Kaldi toolkit is becoming popular for constructing automated speech recognition (ASR) systems.
Meanwhile, in recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown state-of-the-art performance on various ASR tasks.
This document describes our open-source recipes to implement fully-fledged DNN acoustic modeling using Kaldi and PDNN.
PDNN is a lightweight deep learning toolkit developed under the Theano environment.
Using these recipes, we can build up multiple systems including DNN hybrid systems, convolutional neural network (CNN) systems and bottleneck feature systems.
These recipes are directly based on the Kaldi Switchboard 110-hour setup.
However, adapting them to new datasets is easy to achieve.
