Many kernel methods suffer from high time and space complexities, so they are prohibitive in big-data applications.
To tackle the computational challenge, the Nystr\"om method has been extensively used to reduce time and space complexities by sacrificing some accuracy.
The Nystr\"om method speedups computation by constructing an approximation of the kernel matrix in question using only a few columns of the matrix.
Recently, a variant of the Nystr\"om method called the modified Nystr\"om method has demonstrated significant improvement over the standard Nystr\"om method in approximation accuracy, both theoretically and empirically.
