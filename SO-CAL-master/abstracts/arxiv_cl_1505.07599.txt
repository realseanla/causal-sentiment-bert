Word segmentation and Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging are two fundamental tasks for Chinese language processing.
In recent years, word segmentation and POS tagging have undergone great development.
The popular method is to regard these two tasks as sequence labeling problem, which can be handled with supervised learning algorithms such as Conditional Random Fields (CRF).
However, the performances of the state-of-the-art systems are still relatively low for the informal texts, such as micro-blogs, forums.
In this shared task, we wish to investigate the performances of Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging for the micro-blog texts.
