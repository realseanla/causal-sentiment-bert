Many formal languages have been proposed to express or represent Ontologies, including RDF, RDFS, DAML+OIL and OWL.
Most of these languages are based on XML syntax, but with various terminologies and expressiveness.
Therefore, choosing a language for building an Ontology is the main step.
The main point of choosing language to represent Ontology is based mainly on what the Ontology will represent or be used for.
That language should have a range of quality support features such as ease of use, expressive power, compatibility, sharing and versioning, internationalisation.
This is because different kinds of knowledge-based applications need different language features.
The main objective of these languages is to add semantics to the existing information on the web.
The aims of this paper is to provide a good knowledge of existing language and understanding of these languages and how could be used.
