The Nystrom method has been widely used to compute low-rank approximations to positive semidefinite matrices.
Much work has been done on the sampling techniques for the Nystrom method, and many were guaranteed with upper error bounds.
However, the lower bounds, especially the relative error bounds, were largely unknown.
We explore in this paper the lower bounds of the Nystrom method to show how bad the Nystrom method can perform.
We establish both additive and relative error lower bounds for the Nystrom method.
Interestingly, some of the relative-error lower bounds we established can be attained by some algorithms, which indicates some lower bounds we establish are tight.
However, some lower bounds reveal the downside of the Nystrom method that they are much worse than the column selection problem and the CUR problem.
Sadly, we also show that some bounds cannot be improved by the ensemble Nystrom method.
