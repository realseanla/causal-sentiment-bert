Objective.
To pilot test an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that selects peer change agents (PCA) to disseminate HIV testing messaging in a population of homeless youth.
Methods.
We recruited and assessed 62 youth at baseline, 1 month (n = 48), and 3 months (n = 38).
A Facebook app collected preliminary social network data.
Eleven PCAs selected by AI attended a 1-day training and 7 weekly booster sessions.
Mixed-effects models with random effects were used to assess change over time.
Results.
Significant change over time was observed in past 6-month HIV testing (57.9 percent, 82.4 percent, 76.3 percent; p &lt; .05) but not condom use (63.9 percent, 65.7 percent, 65.8 percent).
Most youth reported speaking to a PCA about HIV prevention (72.0 percent at 1 month, 61.5 percent at 3 months).
Conclusions.
AI is a promising avenue for implementing PCA models for homeless youth.
Increasing rates of regular HIV testing is critical to HIV prevention and linking homeless youth to treatment.
