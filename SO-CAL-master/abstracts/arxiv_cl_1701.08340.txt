Bilingual dictionaries are very important in various fields of natural language processing.
In recent years, research on extracting new bilingual lexicons from non-parallel (comparable) corpora have been proposed.
Almost all use a small existing dictionary or other resource to make an initial list called the "seed dictionary".
In this paper we discuss the use of different types of dictionaries as the initial starting list for creating a bilingual Persian-Italian lexicon from a comparable corpus.
