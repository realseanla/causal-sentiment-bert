Knowledge Graphs are important tools to model multi-relational data that serves as information pool for various applications.
Traditionally, these graphs are considered to be static in nature.
However, recent availability of large scale event-based interaction data has given rise to dynamically evolving knowledge graphs that contain temporal information for each edge.
Reasoning over time in such graphs is not yet well understood.
