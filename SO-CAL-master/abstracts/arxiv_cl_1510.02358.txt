The Naming Game has been studied to explore the role of self-organization in the development and negotiation of linguistic conventions.
In this paper, we define an automata networks approach to the Naming Game.
Two problems are faced: (1) the definition of an automata networks for multi-party communicative interactions; and (2) the proof of convergence for three different orders in which the individuals are updated (updating schemes).
Finally, computer simulations are explored in two-dimensional lattices with the purpose to recover the main features of the Naming Game and to describe the dynamics under different updating schemes.
