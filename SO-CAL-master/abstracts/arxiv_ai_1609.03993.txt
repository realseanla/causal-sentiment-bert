A common strategy for improving optimization algorithms is to restart the algorithm when it is believed to be trapped in an inferior part of the search space.
However, while specific restart strategies have been developed for specific problems (and specific algorithms), restarts are typically not regarded as a general tool to speed up an optimization algorithm.
In fact, many optimization algorithms do not employ restarts at all.
