We present a concrete design for Solomonoff's incremental machine learning system suitable for desktop computers.
We use R5RS Scheme and its standard library with a few omissions as the reference machine.
We introduce a Levin Search variant based on a stochastic Context Free Grammar together with new update algorithms that use the same grammar as a guiding probability distribution for incremental machine learning.
The updates include adjusting production probabilities, re-using previous solutions, learning programming idioms and discovery of frequent subprograms.
The issues of extending the a priori probability distribution and bootstrapping are discussed.
We have implemented a good portion of the proposed algorithms.
Experiments with toy problems show that the update algorithms work as expected.
