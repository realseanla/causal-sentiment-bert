Supertagging is an approach originally developed by Bangalore and Joshi (1999) to improve the parsing efficiency.
In the beginning, the scholars used small training datasets and somewhat na\"ive smoothing techniques to learn the probability distributions of supertags.
Since its inception, the applicability of Supertags has been explored for TAG (tree-adjoining grammar) formalism as well as other related yet, different formalisms such as CCG.
This article will try to summarize the various chapters, relevant to statistical parsing, from the most recent edited book volume (Bangalore and Joshi, 2010).
The chapters were selected so as to blend the learning of supertags, its integration into full-scale parsing, and in semantic parsing.
