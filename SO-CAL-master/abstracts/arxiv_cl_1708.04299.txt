While there have been significant advances in detecting emotions from speech and image recognition, emotion detection on text is still under-explored and remained as an active research field.
This paper introduces a corpus for text-based emotion detection on multiparty dialogue as well as deep neural models that outperform the existing approaches for document classification.
We first present a new corpus that provides annotation of seven emotions on consecutive utterances in dialogues extracted from the show, Friends.
We then suggest four types of sequence-based convolutional neural network models with attention that leverage the sequence information encapsulated in dialogue.
Our best model shows the accuracies of 37.9 percent and 54 percent for fine- and coarse-grained emotions, respectively.
Given the difficulty of this task, this is promising.
