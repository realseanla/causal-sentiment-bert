The topological (or graph) structures of real-world networks are known to be predictive of multiple dynamic properties of the networks.
Conventionally, a graph structure is represented using an adjacency matrix or a set of hand-crafted structural features.
These representations either fail to highlight local and global properties of the graph or suffer from a severe loss of structural information.
There lacks an effective graph representation, which hinges the realization of the predictive power of network structures.
