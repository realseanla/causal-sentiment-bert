We study the problem of structured prediction under test-time budget constraints.
We propose a novel approach applicable to a wide range of structured prediction problems in computer vision and natural language processing.
Our approach seeks to adaptively generate computationally costly features during test-time in order to reduce the computational cost of prediction while maintaining prediction performance.
We show that training the adaptive feature generation system can be reduced to a series of structured learning problems, resulting in efficient training using existing structured learning algorithms.
This framework provides theoretical justification for several existing heuristic approaches found in literature.
We evaluate our proposed adaptive system on two real-world structured prediction tasks, optical character recognition (OCR) and dependency parsing.
For OCR our method cuts the feature acquisition time by half coming within a 1 percent margin of top accuracy.
For dependency parsing we realize an overall runtime gain of 20 percent without significant loss in performance.
