Various algorithms for text-independent speaker recognition have been developed through the decades, aiming to improve both accuracy and efficiency.
This paper presents a novel PCA/LDA-based approach that is faster than traditional statistical model-based methods and achieves competitive results.
First, the performance based on only PCA and only LDA is measured; then a mixed model, taking advantages of both methods, is introduced.
A subset of the TIMIT corpus composed of 200 male speakers, is used for enrollment, validation and testing.
The best results achieve 100 percent; 96 percent and 95 percent classification rate at population level 50; 100 and 200, using 39-dimensional MFCC features with delta and double delta.
These results are based on 12-second text-independent speech for training and 4-second data for test.
These are comparable to the conventional MFCC-GMM methods, but require significantly less time to train and operate.
