In this paper, a framework for testing Deep Neural Network (DNN) design in Python is presented.
First, big data, machine learning (ML), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are discussed to familiarize the reader with the importance of such a system.
Next, the benefits and detriments of implementing such a system in Python are presented.
Lastly, the specifics of the system are explained, and some experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness of the system.
