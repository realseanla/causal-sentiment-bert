This paper presents an axiomatic framework for qualitative decision under uncertainty in a finite setting.
The corresponding utility is expressed by a sup-min expression, called Sugeno (or fuzzy) integral.
Technically speaking, Sugeno integral is a median, which is indeed a qualitative counterpart to the averaging operation underlying expected utility.
The axiomatic justification of Sugeno integral-based utility is expressed in terms of preference between acts as in Savage decision theory.
Pessimistic and optimistic qualitative utilities, based on necessity and possibility measures, previously introduced by two of the authors, can be retrieved in this setting by adding appropriate axioms.
