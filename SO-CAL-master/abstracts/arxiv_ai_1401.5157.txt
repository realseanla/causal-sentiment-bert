We present a skill analysis with time series image data using data mining methods, focused on table tennis.
We do not use body model, but use only hi-speed movies, from which time series data are obtained and analyzed using data mining methods such as C4.5 and so on.
We identify internal models for technical skills as evaluation skillfulness for the forehand stroke of table tennis, and discuss mono and meta-functional skills for improving skills.
