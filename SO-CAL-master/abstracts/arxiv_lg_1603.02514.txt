Semi-supervised learning becomes one of the most significant problems nowadays since the size of datasets is increasing tremendously while labeled data is limited.
We propose a new semi-supervised learning method for sequence classification tasks.
Our work is based on both deep generative model for semi-supervised learning  and variational auto-encoder for sequence modeling .
We found the introduction of Sc-LSTM is critical to the success in our method.
We have obtained some preliminary experimental results on IMDB sentiment classification dataset, showing that the proposed model improves the classification accuracy comparing to pure supervised classifier.
