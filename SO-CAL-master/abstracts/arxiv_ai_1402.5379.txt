We frame the question of what kind of subjective experience a brain simulation would have in contrast to a biological brain.
We discuss the brain prosthesis thought experiment.
We evaluate how the experience of the brain simulation might differ from the biological, according to a number of hypotheses about experience and the properties of simulation.
Then, we identify finer questions relating to the original inquiry, and answer them from both a general physicalist, and panexperientialist perspective.
