In the past few years, attention mechanisms have become an indispensable component of end-to-end neural machine translation models.
However, previous attention models always refer to some source words when predicting a target word, which contradicts with the fact that some target words have no corresponding source words.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel attention model that has the capability of determining when a decoder should attend to source words and when it should not.
Experimental results on NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that the new model achieves an improvement of 0.8 BLEU score over a state-of-the-art baseline.
