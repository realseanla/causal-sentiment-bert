There is sufficient information in the far-field of a radiating dipole antenna to rediscover the Maxwell Equations and the wave equations of light, including the speed of light $c.$ TheoSea is a Julia program that does this in about a second, and the key insight is that the compactness of theories drives the search.
The program is a computational embodiment of the scientific method: observation, consideration of candidate theories, and validation.
