With the increasing popularity of online learning, intelligent tutoring systems are regaining increased attention.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive algorithms for personalized assignment of learning tasks to student so that to improve his performance in online learning environments.
As main contribution of this paper, we propose a a novel Skill-Based Task Selector (SBTS) algorithm which is able to approximate a student's skill level based on his performance and consequently suggest adequate assignments.
The SBTS is inspired by the class of multi-armed bandit algorithms.
However, in contrast to standard multi-armed bandit approaches, the SBTS aims at acquiring two criteria related to student learning, namely: which topics should the student work on, and what level of difficulty should the task be.
The SBTS centers on innovative reward and punishment schemes in a task and skill matrix based on the student behaviour.
