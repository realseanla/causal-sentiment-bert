The concepts of fuzzy objects and their classes are described that make it possible to structurally represent knowledge about fuzzy and partially-defined objects and their classes.
Operations over such objects and classes are also proposed that make it possible to obtain sets and new classes of fuzzy objects and also to model variations in object structures under the influence of external factors.
