In a recent article, Christiansen and Chater (2015) present a fundamental constraint on language, i.e.
a now-or-never bottleneck that arises from our fleeting memory, and explore its implications, e.g., chunk-and-pass processing, outlining a framework that promises to unify different areas of research.
Here we explore additional support for this constraint and suggest further connections from quantitative linguistics and information theory.
