Previous researches have shown that learning multiple representations for polysemous words can improve the performance of word embeddings on many tasks.
However, this leads to another problem.
Several vectors of a word may actually point to the same meaning, namely pseudo multi-sense.
In this paper, we introduce the concept of pseudo multi-sense, and then propose an algorithm to detect such cases.
With the consideration of the detected pseudo multi-sense cases, we try to refine the existing word embeddings to eliminate the influence of pseudo multi-sense.
Moreover, we apply our algorithm on previous released multi-sense word embeddings and tested it on artificial word similarity tasks and the analogy task.
The result of the experiments shows that diminishing pseudo multi-sense can improve the quality of word representations.
Thus, our method is actually an efficient way to reduce linguistic complexity.
