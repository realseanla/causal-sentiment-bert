Constraint Programming (CP) users need significant expertise in order to model their problems appropriately, notably to select propagators and search strategies.
This puts the brakes on a broader uptake of CP.
In this paper, we introduce MICE, a complete Java CP modeler that can use any Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) solver as a solution technique.
Our aim is to provide an alternative tool for democratizing the "CP-style" modeling thanks to its simplicity of use, with reasonable solving capabilities.
Our contributions include new decompositions of (reified) constraints and constraints on numerical variables.
