A text steganography method based on Markov chains is introduced, together with a reference implementation.
This method allows for information hiding in texts that are automatically generated following a given Markov model.
Other Markov - based systems of this kind rely on big simplifications of the language model to work, which produces less natural looking and more easily detectable texts.
The method described here is designed to generate texts within a good approximation of the original language model provided.
