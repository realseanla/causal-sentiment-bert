The project aims to provide a semi-supervised approach to identify Multiword Expressions in a multilingual context consisting of English and most of the major Indian languages.
Multiword expressions are a group of words which refers to some conventional or regional way of saying things.
If they are literally translated from one language to another the expression will lose its inherent meaning.
