Both supervised learning methods and LDA based topic model have been successfully applied in the field of query focused multi-document summarization.
In this paper, we propose a novel supervised approach that can incorporate rich sentence features into Bayesian topic models in a principled way, thus taking advantages of both topic model and feature based supervised learning methods.
Experiments on TAC2008 and TAC2009 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
