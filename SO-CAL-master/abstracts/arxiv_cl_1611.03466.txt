The aim of syntactic tracking is to classify spatio-temporal patterns of a target's motion using natural language processing models.
In this paper, we generalize earlier work by considering a constrained stochastic context free grammar (CSCFG) for modeling patterns confined to a roadmap.
The constrained grammar facilitates modeling specific directions and road names in a roadmap.
We present a novel particle filtering algorithm that exploits the CSCFG model for estimating the target's patterns.
This meta-level algorithm operates in conjunction with a base-level tracking algorithm.
Extensive numerical results using simulated ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar measurements show substantial improvement in target tracking accuracy.
