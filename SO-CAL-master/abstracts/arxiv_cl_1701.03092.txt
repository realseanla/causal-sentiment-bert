In this report, we propose a new application for twitter data called \textit{job detection}.
We identify people's job category based on their tweets.
As a preliminary work, we limited our task to identify only IT workers from other job holders.
We have used and compared both simple bag of words model and a document representation based on Skip-gram model.
Our results show that the model based on Skip-gram, achieves a 76\ percent precision and 82\ percent recall.
