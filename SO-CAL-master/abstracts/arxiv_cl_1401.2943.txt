We propose a real-time machine translation system that allows users to select a news category and to translate the related live news articles from Arabic, Czech, Danish, Farsi, French, German, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and Turkish into English.
The Moses-based system was optimised for the news domain and differs from other available systems in four ways: (1) News items are automatically categorised on the source side, before translation; (2) Named entity translation is optimised by recognising and extracting them on the source side and by re-inserting their translation in the target language, making use of a separate entity repository; (3) News titles are translated with a separate translation system which is optimised for the specific style of news titles; (4) The system was optimised for speed in order to cope with the large volume of daily news articles.
