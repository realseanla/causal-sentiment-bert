Biclustering involves the simultaneous clustering of objects and their attributes, thus defining local two-way clustering models.
Recently, efficient algorithms were conceived to enumerate all biclusters in real-valued datasets.
In this case, the solution composes a complete set of maximal and non-redundant biclusters.
However, the ability to enumerate biclusters revealed a challenging scenario: in noisy datasets, each true bicluster may become highly fragmented and with a high degree of overlapping.
It prevents a direct analysis of the obtained results.
To revert the fragmentation, we propose here two approaches for properly aggregating the whole set of enumerated biclusters: one based on single linkage and the other directly exploring the rate of overlapping.
Both proposals were compared with each other and with the actual state-of-the-art in several experiments, and they not only significantly reduced the number of biclusters but also consistently increased the quality of the solution.
