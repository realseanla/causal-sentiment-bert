Sentiment analysis on user reviews helps to keep track of user reactions towards products, and make advices to users about what to buy.
State-of-the-art review-level sentiment classification techniques could give pretty good precisions of above 90 percent.
However, current phrase-level sentiment analysis approaches might only give sentiment polarity labelling precisions of around 70 percent~80 percent, which is far from satisfaction and restricts its application in many practical tasks.
In this paper, we focus on the problem of phrase-level sentiment polarity labelling and attempt to bridge the gap between phrase-level and review-level sentiment analysis.
We investigate the inconsistency between the numerical star ratings and the sentiment orientation of textual user reviews.
Although they have long been treated as identical, which serves as a basic assumption in previous work, we find that this assumption is not necessarily true.
We further propose to leverage the results of review-level sentiment classification to boost the performance of phrase-level polarity labelling using a novel constrained convex optimization framework.
Besides, the framework is capable of integrating various kinds of information sources and heuristics, while giving the global optimal solution due to its convexity.
Experimental results on both English and Chinese reviews show that our framework achieves high labelling precisions of up to 89 percent, which is a significant improvement from current approaches.
