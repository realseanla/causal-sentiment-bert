A model of story generation recently proposed by Riedl and Young casts it as planning, with the additional condition that story characters behave intentionally.
This means that characters have perceivable motivation for the actions they take.
I show that this condition can be compiled away (in more ways than one) to produce a classical planning problem that can be solved by an off-the-shelf classical planner, more efficiently than by Riedl and Youngs specialised planner.
