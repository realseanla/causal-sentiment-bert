In event-driven programming frameworks, such as Android, the client and the framework interact using callins (framework methods that the client invokes) and callbacks (client methods that the framework invokes).
The protocols for interacting with these frameworks can often be described by finite-state machines we dub *asynchronous typestates*.
Asynchronous typestates are akin to classical typestates, with the key difference that their outputs (callbacks) are produced asynchronously.
