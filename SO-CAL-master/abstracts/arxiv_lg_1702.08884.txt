The success of semi-supervised learning crucially relies on the scalability to a huge amount of unlabelled data that are needed to capture the underlying manifold structure for better classification.
Since computing the pairwise similarity between the training data is prohibitively expensive in most kinds of input data, currently, there is no general ready-to-use semi-supervised learning method/tool available for learning with tens of millions or more data points.
In this paper, we adopted the idea of two low-rank label propagation algorithms, GLNP (Global Linear Neighborhood Propagation) and Kernel Nystr\"om Approximation, and implemented the parallelized version of the two algorithms accelerated with Nesterov's accelerated projected gradient descent for Big-data Label Propagation (BigLP).
