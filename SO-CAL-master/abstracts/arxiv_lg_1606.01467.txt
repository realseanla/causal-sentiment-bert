In this paper, we show that by feeding the weights of a deep neural network (DNN) during training into a deep Q-network (DQN) as its states, this DQN can learn policies to accelerate the training of that DNN.
The actions of the DQN modify different hyperparameters during training.
Empirically, this acceleration leads to better generalization performance of the DNN.
