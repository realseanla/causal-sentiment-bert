A new approach to data stream clustering with the help of an ensemble of adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems is proposed.
The proposed ensemble is formed with adaptive neuro-fuzzy self-organizing Kohonen maps in a parallel processing mode.
A final result is chosen by the best neuro-fuzzy self-organizing Kohonen map.
