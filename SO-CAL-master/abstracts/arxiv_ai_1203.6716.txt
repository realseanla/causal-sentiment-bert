Informledge System (ILS) is a knowledge network with autonomous nodes and intelligent links that integrate and structure the pieces of knowledge.
In this paper, we aim to put forward the link dynamics involved in intelligent processing of information in ILS.
There has been advancement in knowledge management field which involve managing information in databases from a single domain.
ILS works with information from multiple domains stored in distributed way in the autonomous nodes termed as Knowledge Network Node (KNN).
Along with the concept under consideration, KNNs store the processed information linking concepts and processors leading to the appropriate processing of information.
