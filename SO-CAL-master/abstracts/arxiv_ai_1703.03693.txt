Quantum decision systems are being increasingly considered for use in artificial intelligence applications.
Classical and quantum nodes can be distinguished based on certain correlations in their states.
This paper investigates some properties of the states obtained in a decision tree structure.
How these correlations may be mapped to the decision tree is considered.
Classical tree representations and approximations to quantum states are provided.
