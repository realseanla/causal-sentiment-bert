Recent advances in convolutional neural networks have considered model complexity and hardware efficiency to enable deployment onto embedded systems and mobile devices.
For example, it is now well-known that the arithmetic operations of deep networks can be encoded down to 8-bit fixed-point without significant deterioration in performance.
However, further reduction in precision down to as low as 3-bit fixed-point results in significant losses in performance.
In this paper we propose a new data representation that enables state-of-the-art networks to be encoded to 3 bits with negligible loss in classification performance.
To perform this, we take advantage of the fact that the weights and activations in a trained network naturally have non-uniform distributions.
Using non-uniform, base-2 logarithmic representation to encode weights, communicate activations, and perform dot-products enables networks to 1) achieve higher classification accuracies than fixed-point at the same resolution and 2) eliminate bulky digital multipliers.
Finally, we propose an end-to-end training procedure that uses log representation at 5-bits, which achieves higher final test accuracy than linear at 5-bits.
