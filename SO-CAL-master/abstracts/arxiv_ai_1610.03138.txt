People enjoy encounters with generative software, but rarely are they encouraged to interact with, understand or engage with it.
In this paper we define the term 'PCG-based game', and explain how this concept follows on from the idea of an AI-based game.
We look at existing examples of games which foreground their AI, put forward a methodology for designing PCG-based games, describe some example case study designs for PCG-based games, and describe lessons learned during this process of sketching and developing ideas.
