Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is the problem of learning a square matrix $A$, given samples of $X=AS$, where $S$ is a random vector with independent coordinates.
Most existing algorithms are provably efficient only when each $S_i$ has finite and moderately valued fourth moment.
However, there are practical applications where this assumption need not be true, such as speech and finance.
Algorithms have been proposed for heavy-tailed ICA, but they are not practical, using random walks and the full power of the ellipsoid algorithm multiple times.
