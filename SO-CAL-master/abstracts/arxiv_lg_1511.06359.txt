Features based on sparse representation, especially using synthesis dictionary model, have been heavily exploited in signal processing and computer vision.
However, synthesis dictionary learning involves NP-hard sparse coding and expensive learning steps.
Recently, sparsifying transform learning received interest for its cheap computation and closed-form solution.
In this work, we develop a methodology for learning of Flipping and Rotation Invariant Sparsifying Transform, dubbed FRIST, to better represent natural images that contain textures with various geometrical directions.
The proposed alternating learning algorithm involves simple closed-form solutions.
Preliminary experiments show the usefulness of adaptive sparse representation by FRIST for image compression, denoising and inpainting with promising performances.
