Estimating the confidence for a link is a critical task for Knowledge Graph construction.
Link prediction, or predicting the likelihood of a link in a knowledge graph based on prior state is a key research direction within this area.
We propose a Latent Feature Embedding based link recommendation model for prediction task and utilize Bayesian Personalized Ranking based optimization technique for learning models for each predicate.
Experimental results on large-scale knowledge bases such as YAGO2 show that our approach achieves substantially higher performance than several state-of-art approaches.
Furthermore, we also study the performance of the link prediction algorithm in terms of topological properties of the Knowledge Graph and present a linear regression model to reason about its expected level of accuracy.
