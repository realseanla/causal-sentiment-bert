In computer vision pixelwise dense prediction is the task of predicting a label for each pixel in the image.
Convolutional neural networks achieve good performance on this task, while being computationally efficient.
In this paper we carry these ideas over to the problem of assigning a sequence of labels to a set of speech frames, a task commonly known as framewise classification.
We show that dense prediction view of framewise classification offers several advantages and insights, including computational efficiency and the ability to apply batch normalization.
When doing dense prediction we pay specific attention to strided pooling in time and introduce an asymmetric dilated convolution, called time-dilated convolution, that allows for efficient and elegant implementation of pooling in time.
We show that by using time-dilated convolutions with a very deep VGG-style CNN with batch normalization, we achieve best published single model accuracy result on the switchboard-2000 benchmark dataset.
