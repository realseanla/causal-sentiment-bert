Sentiment analysis of reviews is a popular task in natural language processing.
In this work, the goal is to predict the score of food reviews on a scale of 1 to 5 with two recurrent neural networks that are carefully tuned.
As for baseline, we train a simple RNN for classification.
Then we extend the baseline to GRU.
In addition, we present two different methods to deal with highly skewed data, which is a common problem for reviews.
Models are evaluated using accuracies.
