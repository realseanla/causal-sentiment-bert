In this paper, we present a system to visualize RDF knowledge graphs.
These graphs are obtained from a knowledge extraction system designed by GEOLSemantics.
This extraction is performed using natural language processing and trigger detection.
The user can visualize subgraphs by selecting some ontology features like concepts or individuals.
The system is also multilingual, with the use of the annotated ontology in English, French, Arabic and Chinese.
