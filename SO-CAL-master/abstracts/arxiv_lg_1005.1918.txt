We study prediction with expert advice in the setting where the losses are accumulated with some discounting---the impact of old losses may gradually vanish.
We generalize the Aggregating Algorithm and the Aggregating Algorithm for Regression to this case, propose a suitable new variant of exponential weights algorithm, and prove respective loss bounds.
