Forensic science advocates the use of inference mechanisms which may be viewed as simple multi-agent protocols.
An important protocol of this kind involves an agent FE (forensic expert) who communicates to a second agent TOF (trier of fact) first its value of a certain likelihood ratio with respect to its own belief state which is supposed to be captured by a probability function on FE's proposition space.
Subsequently FE communicates its recently acquired confirmation that a certain evidence proposition is true.
The inference part of this sort of reasoning, here referred to as likelihood ratio transfer mediated reasoning, involves TOF's revision of its own belief state, and in particular an evaluation of the resulting belief in the hypothesis proposition.
