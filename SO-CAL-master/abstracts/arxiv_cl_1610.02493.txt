This work is part of a large research project entitled "Or\'eodule" aimed at developing tools for automatic speech recognition, translation, and synthesis for Arabic language.
Our attention has mainly been focused on an attempt to improve the probabilistic model on which our semantic decoder is based.
To achieve this goal, we have decided to test the influence of the pertinent context use, and of the contextual data integration of different types, on the effectiveness of the semantic decoder.
The findings are quite satisfactory.
