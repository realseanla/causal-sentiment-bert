Graph theoretical ideas are highly utilized by computer science fields especially data mining.
In this field, a data structure can be designed in the form of tree which in turn utilized vertices and edges.
Covering is a widely used form of data structure in data mining and covering-based rough sets provide a systematic approach to this type of data.
In this paper, we study the connectedness of graphs through covering-based rough sets and apply it to connected matroids.
First, we present an approach to inducing a covering by a graph, and then covering-based rough sets are employed to study the connectedness of the graph from the viewpoint of the approximation operators.
Second, we construct a graph from a matroid, and find the matroid and the graph have the same connectedness, which makes us to apply connected graphs to study connected matroids.
In summary, this paper provides a new approach to studying graph theory and matroid theory.
