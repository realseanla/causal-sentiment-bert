Probabilistic graphical models such as Bayesian Networks are one of the most powerful structures known by the Computer Science community for deriving probabilistic inferences.
However, modern cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability theory, because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make judgements.
Consequently, the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics, leading to violations of the law of total probability.
This means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various aspects of human decision making.
