In this work we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) that jointly handles low-, mid-, and high-level vision tasks in a unified architecture that is trained end-to-end.
Such a universal network can act like a `swiss knife' for vision tasks; we call this architecture an UberNet to indicate its overarching nature.
