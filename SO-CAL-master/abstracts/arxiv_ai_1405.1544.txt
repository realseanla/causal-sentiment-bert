In this paper we present the Transalg system, designed to produce SAT encodings for discrete functions, written as programs in a specific language.
Translation of such programs to SAT is based on propositional encoding methods for formal computing models and on the concept of symbolic execution.
We used the Transalg system to make SAT encodings for a number of cryptographic functions.
