This paper presents results of our experiments using the Ubuntu Dialog Corpus - the largest publicly available multi-turn dialog corpus.
First, we use an in-house implementation of previously reported models to do an independent evaluation using the same data.
Second, we evaluate the performances of various LSTMs, Bi-LSTMs and CNNs on the dataset.
Third, we create an ensemble by averaging predictions of multiple models.
The ensemble further improves the performance and it achieves a state-of-the-art result for this dataset.
Finally, we discuss our future plans using this corpus.
