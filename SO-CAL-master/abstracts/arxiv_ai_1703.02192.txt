Epistemic planning can be used for decision making in multi-agent situations with distributed knowledge and capabilities.
Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) has been shown to provide a very natural and expressive framework for epistemic planning.
In this paper, we aim to give an accessible introduction to DEL-based epistemic planning.
The paper starts with the most classical framework for planning, STRIPS, and then moves towards epistemic planning in a number of smaller steps, where each step is motivated by the need to be able to model more complex planning scenarios.
