Path planning for multiple robots is well studied in the AI and robotics communities.
For a given discretized environment, robots need to find collision-free paths to a set of specified goal locations.
Robots can be fully anonymous, non-anonymous, or organized in groups.
Although powerful solvers for this abstract problem exist, they make simplifying assumptions by ignoring kinematic constraints, making it difficult to use the resulting plans on actual robots.
In this paper, we present a solution which takes kinematic constraints, such as maximum velocities, into account, while guaranteeing a user-specified minimum safety distance between robots.
We demonstrate our approach in simulation and on real robots in 2D and 3D environments.
