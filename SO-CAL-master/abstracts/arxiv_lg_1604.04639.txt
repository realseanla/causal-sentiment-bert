Data scientists engage in model construction to discover machine learning models that well explain a dataset, in terms of predictiveness, understandability and generalization across domains.
Questions such as "what if we model common cause Z" and "what if Y's dependence on X reverses" inspire many candidate models to consider and compare, yet current tools emphasize constructing a final model all at once.
