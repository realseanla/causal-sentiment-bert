We apply a general recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder framework to community question answering (cQA) tasks.
Our approach does not rely on any linguistic processing, and can be applied to different languages or domains.
Further improvements are observed when we extend the RNN encoders with a neural attention mechanism that encourages reasoning over entire sequences.
To deal with practical issues such as data sparsity and imbalanced labels, we apply various techniques such as transfer learning and multitask learning.
Our experiments on the SemEval-2016 cQA task show 10 percent improvement on a MAP score compared to an information retrieval-based approach, and achieve comparable performance to a strong handcrafted feature-based method.
