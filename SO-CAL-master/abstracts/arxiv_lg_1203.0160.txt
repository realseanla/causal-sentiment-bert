In this paper, we present the case for a declarative foundation for data-intensive machine learning systems.
Instead of creating a new system for each specific flavor of machine learning task, or hardcoding new optimizations, we argue for the use of recursive queries to program a variety of machine learning systems.
By taking this approach, database query optimization techniques can be utilized to identify effective execution plans, and the resulting runtime plans can be executed on a single unified data-parallel query processing engine.
As a proof of concept, we consider two programming models--Pregel and Iterative Map-Reduce-Update---from the machine learning domain, and show how they can be captured in Datalog, tuned for a specific task, and then compiled into an optimized physical plan.
Experiments performed on a large computing cluster with real data demonstrate that this declarative approach can provide very good performance while offering both increased generality and programming ease.
