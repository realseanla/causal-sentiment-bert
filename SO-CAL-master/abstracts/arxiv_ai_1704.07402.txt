This manuscript introduces the problem of prominent object detection and recognition.
The problem deals with finding the most important region of interest, segmenting the relevant item/object in that area, and assigning it an object class label.
In other words, we are solving the three problems of saliency modeling, saliency detection, and object recognition under one umbrella.
The motivation behind such a problem formulation is 1) the benefits to the knowledge representation-based vision pipelines, and 2) the potential improvements in emulating bio-inspired vision systems by solving these three problems together.
We propose a method as a baseline for further research.
The proposed model predicts the most important area in the image, segments the associated objects, and labels them.
The proposed problem and method are evaluated against human fixations, annotated segmentation masks, and object class categories.
We define a chance level for each of the evaluation criterion to compare the proposed algorithm with.
Despite the good performance of the proposed baseline, the overall evaluations indicate that the problem of prominent object detection and recognition is a challenging task that is still worth investigating further.
