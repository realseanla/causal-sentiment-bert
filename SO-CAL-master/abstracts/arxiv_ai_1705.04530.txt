Turing test was long considered the measure for artificial intelligence.
But with the advances in AI, it has proved to be insufficient measure.
We can now aim to mea- sure machine intelligence like we measure human intelligence.
One of the widely accepted measure of intelligence is standardized math and science test.
In this paper, we explore the progress we have made towards the goal of making a machine smart enough to pass the standardized test.
We see the challenges and opportunities posed by the domain, and note that we are quite some ways from actually making a system as smart as a even a middle school scholar.
