Recommendation systems often rely on point-wise loss metrics such as the mean squared error.
However, in real recommendation settings only few items are presented to a user.
This observation has recently encouraged the use of rank-based metrics.
LambdaMART is the state-of-the-art algorithm in learning to rank which relies on such a metric.
Despite its success it does not have a principled regularization mechanism relying in empirical approaches to control model complexity leaving it thus prone to overfitting.
