We propose the topic grids to detect anomaly and analyze the behavior based on the access log content.
Content-based behavioral risk is quantified in the high dimensional space where the topics are generated from the log.
The topics are being projected homogeneously into a space that is perception- and interaction-friendly to the human experts.
