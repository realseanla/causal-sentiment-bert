First this report presents a restricted set of finite transducers used to synthesise structural time-series constraints described by means of a multi-layered function composition scheme.
Second it provides the corresponding synthesised catalogue of structural time-series constraints where each constraint is explicitly described in terms of automata with accumulators.
