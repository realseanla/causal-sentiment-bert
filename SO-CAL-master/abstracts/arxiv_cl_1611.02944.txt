The manuscript presents an experiment at implementation of a Machine Translation system in a MapReduce model.
The empirical evaluation was done using fully implemented translation systems embedded into the MapReduce programming model.
Two machine translation paradigms were studied: shallow transfer Rule Based Machine Translation and Statistical Machine Translation.
