We provide a qualitative analysis of the descriptions containing negations (no, not, n't, nobody, etc) in the Flickr30K corpus, and a categorization of negation uses.
Based on this analysis, we provide a set of requirements that an image description system should have in order to generate negation sentences.
As a pilot experiment, we used our categorization to manually annotate sentences containing negations in the Flickr30K corpus, with an agreement score of K=0.67.
With this paper, we hope to open up a broader discussion of subjective language in image descriptions.
