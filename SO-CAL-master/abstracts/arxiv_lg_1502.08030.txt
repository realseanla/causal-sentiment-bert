Author name ambiguity decreases the quality and reliability of information retrieved from digital libraries.
Existing methods have tried to solve this problem by predefining a feature set based on expert's knowledge for a specific dataset.
In this paper, we propose a new approach which uses deep neural network to learn features automatically from data.
Additionally, we propose the general system architecture for author name disambiguation on any dataset.
In this research, we evaluate the proposed method on a dataset containing Vietnamese author names.
The results show that this method significantly outperforms other methods that use predefined feature set.
The proposed method achieves 99.31 percent in terms of accuracy.
Prediction error rate decreases from 1.83 percent to 0.69 percent, i.e., it decreases by 1.14 percent, or 62.3 percent relatively compared with other methods that use predefined feature set (Table 3).
