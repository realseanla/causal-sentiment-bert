Many formalisms combining ontology languages with uncertainty, usually in the form of probabilities, have been studied over the years.
Most of these formalisms, however, assume that the probabilistic structure of the knowledge remains static over time.
We present a general approach for extending ontology languages to handle time-evolving uncertainty represented by a dynamic Bayesian network.
We show how reasoning in the original language and dynamic Bayesian inferences can be exploited for effective reasoning in our framework.
