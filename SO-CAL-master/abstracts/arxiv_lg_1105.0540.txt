Nearest neighbor (k-NN) graphs are widely used in machine learning and data mining applications, and our aim is to better understand what they reveal about the cluster structure of the unknown underlying distribution of points.
Moreover, is it possible to identify spurious structures that might arise due to sampling variability?
