We formalize the notion of a pseudo-ensemble, a (possibly infinite) collection of child models spawned from a parent model by perturbing it according to some noise process.
E.g., dropout (Hinton et.
al, 2012) in a deep neural network trains a pseudo-ensemble of child subnetworks generated by randomly masking nodes in the parent network.
We present a novel regularizer based on making the behavior of a pseudo-ensemble robust with respect to the noise process generating it.
In the fully-supervised setting, our regularizer matches the performance of dropout.
But, unlike dropout, our regularizer naturally extends to the semi-supervised setting, where it produces state-of-the-art results.
We provide a case study in which we transform the Recursive Neural Tensor Network of (Socher et.
al, 2013) into a pseudo-ensemble, which significantly improves its performance on a real-world sentiment analysis benchmark.
