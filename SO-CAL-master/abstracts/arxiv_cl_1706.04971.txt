This paper explores the information-theoretic measure entropy to detect metaphoric change, transferring ideas from hypernym detection to research on language change.
We also build the first diachronic test set for German as a standard for metaphoric change annotation.
Our model shows high performance, is unsupervised, language-independent and generalizable to other processes of semantic change.
