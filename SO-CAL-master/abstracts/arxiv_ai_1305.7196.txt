This article shows why the diffusion and peer-reviewing of research results would be more efficient, precise and relevant if all or at least some parts of the descriptions and peer-reviews of research results took the form of a fine-grained semantic network, within articles or knowledge bases, as part of the Semantic Web.
This article also shows some ways this can be done and hence how research journal/proceeding publishers could allow this.
So far, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not proposed simple notations and cooperation protocols - similar to those illustrated or referred to in this article - but it now seems likely that Wikipedia/Wikidata, Google or the W3C will propose them sooner or later.
Then, research journal/proceeding publishers and researchers may or may not quickly use this approach.
