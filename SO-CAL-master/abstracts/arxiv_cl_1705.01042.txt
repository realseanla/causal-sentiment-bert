This paper introduces a new model that uses named entity recognition, coreference resolution, and entity linking techniques, to approach the task of linking people entities on Wikipedia people pages to their corresponding Wikipedia pages if applicable.
Our task is different from general and traditional entity linking because we are working in a limited domain, namely, people entities, and we are including pronouns as entities, whereas in the past, pronouns were never considered as entities in entity linking.
We have built 2 models, both outperforms our baseline model significantly.
The purpose of our project is to build a model that could be use to generate cleaner data for future entity linking tasks.
Our contribution include a clean data set consisting of 50Wikipedia people pages, and 2 entity linking models, specifically tuned for this domain.
