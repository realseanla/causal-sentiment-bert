This paper investigates the scaling properties of Recurrent Neural Network Language Models (RNNLMs).
We discuss how to train very large RNNs on GPUs and address the questions of how RNNLMs scale with respect to model size, training-set size, computational costs and memory.
Our analysis shows that despite being more costly to train, RNNLMs obtain much lower perplexities on standard benchmarks than n-gram models.
We train the largest known RNNs and present relative word error rates gains of 18 percent on an ASR task.
We also present the new lowest perplexities on the recently released billion word language modelling benchmark, 1 BLEU point gain on machine translation and a 17 percent relative hit rate gain in word prediction.
