We present a distributed anytime algorithm for performing MAP inference in graphical models.
The problem is formulated as a linear programming relaxation over the edges of a graph.
The resulting program has a constraint structure that allows application of the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition principle.
Subprograms are defined over individual edges and can be computed in a distributed manner.
This accommodates solutions to graphs whose state space does not fit in memory.
The decomposition master program is guaranteed to compute the optimal solution in a finite number of iterations, while the solution converges monotonically with each iteration.
Formulating the MAP inference problem as a linear program allows additional (global) constraints to be defined; something not possible with message passing algorithms.
Experimental results show that our algorithm's solution quality outperforms most current algorithms and it scales well to large problems.
