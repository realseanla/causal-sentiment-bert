In the interpretation of experimental data, one is actually looking for plausible explanations.
We look for a measure of plausibility, with which we can compare different possible explanations, and which can be combined when there are different sets of data.
This is contrasted to the conventional measure for probabilities as well as to the proposed measure of possibilities.
We define what characteristics this measure of plausibility should have.
