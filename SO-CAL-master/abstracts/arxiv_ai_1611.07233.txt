Lossy image compression algorithms are pervasively used to reduce the size of images transmitted over the web and recorded on data storage media.
However, we pay for their high compression rate with visual artifacts degrading the user experience.
Deep convolutional neural networks have become a widespread tool to address high-level computer vision tasks very successfully.
Recently, they have found their way into the areas of low-level computer vision and image processing to solve regression problems mostly with relatively shallow networks.
