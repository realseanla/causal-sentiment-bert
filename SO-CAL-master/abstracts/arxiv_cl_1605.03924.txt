Due to the lack of structured knowledge applied in learning distributed representation of categories, existing work cannot incorporate category hierarchies into entity information.~We propose a framework that embeds entities and categories into a semantic space by integrating structured knowledge and taxonomy hierarchy from large knowledge bases.
The framework allows to compute meaningful semantic relatedness between entities and categories.~Compared with the previous state of the art, our framework can handle both single-word concepts and multiple-word concepts with superior performance in concept categorization and semantic relatedness.
