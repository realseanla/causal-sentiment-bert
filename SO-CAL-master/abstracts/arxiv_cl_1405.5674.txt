Economic issues related to the information processing techniques are very important.
The development of such technologies is a major asset for developing countries like Cambodia and Laos, and emerging ones like Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand.
The MotAMot project aims to computerize an under-resourced language: Khmer, spoken mainly in Cambodia.
The main goal of the project is the development of a multilingual lexical system targeted for Khmer.
The macrostructure is a pivot one with each word sense of each language linked to a pivot axi.
The microstructure comes from a simplification of the explanatory and combinatory dictionary.
The lexical system has been initialized with data coming mainly from the conversion of the French-Khmer bilingual dictionary of Denis Richer from Word to XML format.
The French part was completed with pronunciation and parts-of-speech coming from the FeM French-english-Malay dictionary.
The Khmer headwords noted in IPA in the Richer dictionary were converted to Khmer writing with OpenFST, a finite state transducer tool.
The resulting resource is available online for lookup, editing, download and remote programming via a REST API on a Jibiki platform.
