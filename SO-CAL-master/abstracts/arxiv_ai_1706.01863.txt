We describe the Marmara Turkish Coreference Corpus, which is an annotation of the whole METU-Sabanci Turkish Treebank with mentions and coreference chains.
Collecting nine or more independent annotations for each document allowed for fully automatic adjudication.
We provide a baseline system for Turkish mention detection and coreference resolution and evaluate it on the corpus.
