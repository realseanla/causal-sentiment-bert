In this paper, we propose a new data based model for influence maximization in online social networks.
We use the theory of belief functions to overcome the data imperfection problem.
Besides, the proposed model searches to detect influencer users that adopt a positive opinion about the product, the idea, etc, to be propagated.
Moreover, we present some experiments to show the performance of our model.
