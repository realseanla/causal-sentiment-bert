This work presents Drake, a dynamic executive for temporal plans with choice.
Dynamic plan execution strategies allow an autonomous agent to react quickly to unfolding events, improving the robustness of the agent.
Prior work developed methods for dynamically dispatching Simple Temporal Networks, and further research enriched the expressiveness of the plans executives could handle, including discrete choices, which are the focus of this work.
However, in some approaches to date, these additional choices induce significant storage or latency requirements to make flexible execution possible.
