This paper summarizes the recent progress we have made for the computer vision technologies in physical therapy with the accessible and affordable devices.
We first introduce the remote health coaching system we build with Microsoft Kinect.
Since the motion data captured by Kinect is noisy, we investigate the data accuracy of Kinect with respect to the high accuracy motion capture system.
We also propose an outlier data removal algorithm based on the data distribution.
In order to generate the kinematic parameter from the noisy data captured by Kinect, we propose a kinematic filtering algorithm based on Unscented Kalman Filter and the kinematic model of human skeleton.
The proposed algorithm can obtain smooth kinematic parameter with reduced noise compared to the kinematic parameter generated from the raw motion data from Kinect.
