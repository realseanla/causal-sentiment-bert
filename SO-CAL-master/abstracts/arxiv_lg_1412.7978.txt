This paper presents an information theoretic approach to the concept of intelligence in the computational sense.
We introduce a probabilistic framework from which computational intelligence is shown to be an entropy minimizing process at the local level.
Using this new scheme, we develop a simple data driven clustering example and discuss its applications.
