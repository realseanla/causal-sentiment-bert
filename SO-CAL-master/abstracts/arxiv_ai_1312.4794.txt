Given that semantic Web realization is based on the critical mass of metadata accessibility and the representation of data with formal knowledge, it needs to generate metadata that is specific, easy to understand and well-defined.
However, semantic annotation of the web documents is the successful way to make the Semantic Web vision a reality.
This paper introduces the Semantic Web and its vision (stack layers) with regard to some concept definitions that helps the understanding of semantic annotation.
Additionally, this paper introduces the semantic annotation categories, tools, domains and models.
