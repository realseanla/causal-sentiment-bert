We introduce Universum learning for multiclass problems and propose a novel formulation for multiclass universum SVM (MU-SVM).
We also propose a span bound for MU-SVM that can be used for model selection thereby avoiding resampling.
Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of MU-SVM and the proposed bound.
