In this paper we analyze the gate activation signals inside the gated recurrent neural networks, and find the temporal structure of such signals is highly correlated with the phoneme boundaries.
This correlation is further verified by a set of experiments for phoneme segmentation, in which better results compared to standard approaches were obtained.
