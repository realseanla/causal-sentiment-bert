Possibilistic logic, an extension of first-order logic, deals with uncertainty that can be estimated in terms of possibility and necessity measures.
Syntactically, this means that a first-order formula is equipped with a possibility degree or a necessity degree that expresses to what extent the formula is possibly or necessarily true.
Possibilistic resolution yields a calculus for possibilistic logic which respects the semantics developed for possibilistic logic.
A drawback, which possibilistic resolution inherits from classical resolution, is that it may not terminate if applied to formulas belonging to decidable fragments of first-order logic.
Therefore we propose an alternative proof method for possibilistic logic.
The main feature of this method is that it completely abstracts from a concrete calculus but uses as basic operation a test for classical entailment.
We then instantiate possibilistic logic with a terminological logic, which is a decidable subclass o f first-order logic but nevertheless much more expressive than propositional logic.
This yields an extension of terminological logics towards the representation of uncertain knowledge which is satisfactory from a semantic as well as algorithmic point of view.
