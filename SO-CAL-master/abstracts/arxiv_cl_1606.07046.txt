Situated question answering is the problem of answering questions about an environment such as an image.
This problem requires interpreting both a question and the environment, and is challenging because the set of interpretations is large, typically superexponential in the number of environmental objects.
Existing models handle this challenge by making strong -- and untrue -- independence assumptions.
We present Parsing to Probabilistic Programs (P3), a novel situated question answering model that utilizes approximate inference to eliminate these independence assumptions and enable the use of global features of the question/environment interpretation.
Our key insight is to treat semantic parses as probabilistic programs that execute nondeterministically and whose possible executions represent environmental uncertainty.
We evaluate our approach on a new, publicly-released data set of 5000 science diagram questions, finding that our approach outperforms several competitive baselines.
