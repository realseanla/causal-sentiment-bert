Causality has been recently introduced in databases, to model, characterize, and possibly compute causes for query answers.
Connections between QA-causality and consistency-based diagnosis and database repairs (wrt.
integrity constraint violations) have already been established.
In this work we establish precise connections between QA-causality and both abductive diagnosis and the view-update problem in databases, allowing us to obtain new algorithmic and complexity results for QA-causality.
We also obtain new results on the complexity of view-conditioned causality, and investigate the notion of QA-causality in the presence of integrity constraints, obtaining complexity results from a connection with view-conditioned causality.
The abduction connection under integrity constraints allows us to obtain algorithmic tools for QA-causality.
