Semantic similarity measures are an important part in Natural Language Processing tasks.
However Semantic similarity measures built for general use do not perform well within specific domains.
Therefore in this study we introduce a domain specific semantic similarity measure that was created by the synergistic union of word2vec, a word embedding method that is used for semantic similarity calculation and lexicon based (lexical) semantic similarity methods.
We prove that this proposed methodology out performs word embedding methods trained on generic corpus and methods trained on domain specific corpus but do not use lexical semantic similarity methods to augment the results.
Further, we prove that text lemmatization can improve the performance of word embedding methods.
