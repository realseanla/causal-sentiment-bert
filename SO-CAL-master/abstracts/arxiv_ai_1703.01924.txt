We investigate how to model exchangeability with choice functions.
Exchangeability is a structural assessment on a sequence of uncertain variables.
We show how such assessments are a special indifference assessment, and how that leads to a counterpart of de Finetti's Representation Theorem, both in a finite and a countable context.
