While Bayesian methods are praised for their ability to incorporate useful prior knowledge, in practice, priors that allow for computationally convenient or tractable inference are more commonly used.
In this paper, we investigate the following question: for a given model, is it possible to use any convenient prior to infer a false posterior, and afterwards, given some true prior of interest, quickly transform this result into the true posterior?
