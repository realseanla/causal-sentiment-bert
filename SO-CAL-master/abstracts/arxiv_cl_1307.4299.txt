In this paper we present a Marathi part of speech tagger.
It is a morphologically rich language.
It is spoken by the native people of Maharashtra.
The general approach used for development of tagger is statistical using trigram Method.
The main concept of trigram is to explore the most likely POS for a token based on given information of previous two tags by calculating probabilities to determine which is the best sequence of a tag.
