Neo-fuzzy elements are used as nodes for an evolving cascade system.
The proposed system can tune both its parameters and architecture in an online mode.
It can be used for solving a wide range of Data Mining tasks (namely time series forecasting).
The evolving cascade system with neo-fuzzy nodes can process rather large data sets with high speed and effectiveness.
