Especially in the Big Data era, the usage of different classification methods is increasing day by day.
The success of these classification methods depends on the effectiveness of learning methods.
Extreme learning machine (ELM) classification algorithm is a relatively new learning method built on feed-forward neural-network.
ELM classification algorithm is a simple and fast method that can create a model from high-dimensional data sets.
Traditional ELM learning algorithm implicitly assumes complete access to whole data set.
This is a major privacy concern in most of cases.
Sharing of private data (i.e.
medical records) is prevented because of security concerns.
In this research, we propose an efficient and secure privacy-preserving learning algorithm for ELM classification over data that is vertically partitioned among several parties.
The new learning method preserves the privacy on numerical attributes, builds a classification model without sharing private data without disclosing the data of each party to others.
