Many engineering optimization problems can be considered as linear programming problems where all or some of the parameters involved are linguistic in nature.
These can only be quantified using fuzzy sets.
The aim of this paper is to solve a fuzzy linear programming problem in which the parameters involved are fuzzy quantities with logistic membership functions.
To explore the applicability of the method a numerical example is considered to determine the monthly production planning quotas and profit of a home textile group.
