The paper presents some steps for multi-valued representation of neutrosophic information.
These steps are provided in the framework of multi-valued logics using the following logical value: true, false, neutral, unknown and saturated.
Also, this approach provides some calculus formulae for the following neutrosophic features: truth, falsity, neutrality, ignorance, under-definedness, over-definedness, saturation and entropy.
In addition, it was defined net truth, definedness and neutrosophic score.
