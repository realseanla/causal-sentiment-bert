We describe an approach to domain adaptation that is appropriate exactly in the case when one has enough ``target'' data to do slightly better than just using only ``source'' data.
Our approach is incredibly simple, easy to implement as a preprocessing step (10 lines of Perl!)
and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on a range of datasets.
Moreover, it is trivially extended to a multi-domain adaptation problem, where one has data from a variety of different domains.
