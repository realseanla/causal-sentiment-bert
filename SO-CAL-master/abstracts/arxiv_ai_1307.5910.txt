In this work we are interested in the problem of energy management in Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET).
The solving and optimization of MANET allow assisting the users to efficiently use their devices in order to minimize the batteries power consumption.
In this framework, we propose a modelling of the MANET in form of a Constraint Optimization Problem called COMANET.
Then, in the objective to minimize the consumption of batteries power, we present an approach based on an adaptation of the A star algorithm to the MANET problem called MANED.
Finally, we expose some experimental results showing utility of this approach.
