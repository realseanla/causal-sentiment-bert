We present a novel unsupervised framework for focused meeting summarization that views the problem as an instance of relation extraction.
We adapt an existing in-domain relation learner (Chen et al., 2011) by exploiting a set of task-specific constraints and features.
We evaluate the approach on a decision summarization task and show that it outperforms unsupervised utterance-level extractive summarization baselines as well as an existing generic relation-extraction-based summarization method.
Moreover, our approach produces summaries competitive with those generated by supervised methods in terms of the standard ROUGE score.
