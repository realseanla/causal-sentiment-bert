Programs to solve so-called constraint problems are complex pieces of software which require many design decisions to be made more or less arbitrarily by the implementer.
These decisions affect the performance of the finished solver significantly.
Once a design decision has been made, it cannot easily be reversed, although a different decision may be more appropriate for a particular problem.
