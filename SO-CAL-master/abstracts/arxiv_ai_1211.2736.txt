There are few knowledge representation (KR) techniques available for efficiently representing knowledge.
However, with the increase in complexity, better methods are needed.
Some researchers came up with hybrid mechanisms by combining two or more methods.
In an effort to construct an intelligent computer system, a primary consideration is to represent large amounts of knowledge in a way that allows effective use and efficiently organizing information to facilitate making the recommended inferences.
There are merits and demerits of combinations, and standardized method of KR is needed.
In this paper, various hybrid schemes of KR were explored at length and details presented.
