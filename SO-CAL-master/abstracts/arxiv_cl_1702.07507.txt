Only a year ago, all state-of-the-art coreference resolvers were using an extensive amount of surface features.
Recently, there was a paradigm shift towards using word embeddings and deep neural networks, where the use of surface features is very limited.
In this paper, we show that a simple SVM model with surface features outperforms more complex neural models for detecting anaphoric mentions.
Our analysis suggests that using generalized representations and surface features have different strength that should be both taken into account for improving coreference resolution.
