Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network that can make use of the internal structure of data such as the 2D structure of image data.
This paper studies CNN on text categorization to exploit the 1D structure (namely, word order) of text data for accurate prediction.
We directly apply CNN to high-dimensional text data, instead of low-dimensional word vectors as is often done.
Two types of CNN are studied: a straightforward adaptation of CNN from image to text, and a simple but new variation which employs bag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer.
The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, as well as previous CNN models for text, which are more complex and expensive to train.
