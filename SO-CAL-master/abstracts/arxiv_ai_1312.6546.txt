We consider the discrete assignment problem in which agents express ordinal preferences over objects and these objects are allocated to the agents in a fair manner.
We use the stochastic dominance relation between fractional or randomized allocations to systematically define varying notions of proportionality and envy-freeness for discrete assignments.
The computational complexity of checking whether a fair assignment exists is studied systematically for the fairness notions.
We characterize the conditions under which a fair assignment is guaranteed to exist.
For a number of fairness concepts, polynomial-time algorithms are presented to check whether a fair assignment exists or not.
Our algorithmic results also extend to the case of variable entitlements of agents.
Our NP-hardness result, which holds for several variants of envy-freeness, answers an open problem posed by Bouveret, Endriss, and Lang (ECAI 2010).
