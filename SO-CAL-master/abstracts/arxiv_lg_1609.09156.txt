Multi-object tracking has recently become an important area of computer vision, especially for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).
Despite growing attention, achieving high performance tracking is still challenging, with state-of-the- art systems resulting in high complexity with a large number of hyper parameters.
In this paper, we focus on reducing overall system complexity and the number hyper parameters that need to be tuned to a specific environment.
We introduce a novel tracking system based on similarity mapping by Enhanced Siamese Neural Network (ESNN), which accounts for both appearance and geometric information, and is trainable end-to-end.
Our system achieves competitive performance in both speed and accuracy on MOT16 challenge, compared to known state-of-the-art methods.
