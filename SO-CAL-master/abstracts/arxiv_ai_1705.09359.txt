Process mining is a research field focused on the analysis of event data with the aim of extracting insights related to dynamic behavior.
Applying process mining techniques on data from smart home environments has the potential to provide valuable insights in (un)healthy habits and to contribute to ambient assisted living solutions.
Finding the right event labels to enable the application of process mining techniques is however far from trivial, as simply using the triggering sensor as the label for sensor events results in uninformative models that allow for too much behavior (overgeneralizing).
Refinements of sensor level event labels suggested by domain experts have been shown to enable discovery of more precise and insightful process models.
However, there exists no automated approach to generate refinements of event labels in the context of process mining.
In this paper we propose a framework for the automated generation of label refinements based on the time attribute of events, allowing us to distinguish behaviourally different instances of the same event type based on their time attribute.
We show on a case study with real life smart home event data that using automatically generated refined labels in process discovery, we can find more specific, and therefore more insightful, process models.
We observe that one label refinement could have an effect on the usefulness of other label refinements when used together.
Therefore, we explore four strategies to generate useful combinations of multiple label refinements and evaluate those on three real life smart home event logs.
