In previous work, we proposed a logic-based framework in which computation is the execution of actions in an attempt to make reactive rules of the form if antecedent then consequent true in a canonical model of a logic program determined by an initial state, sequence of events, and the resulting sequence of subsequent states.
In this model-theoretic semantics, reactive rules are the driving force, and logic programs play only a supporting role.
