We have proposed a simple, effective and fast method named retrofitting to improve word vectors using word relation knowledge found in semantic lexicons constructed either automatically or by humans.
Retrofitting is used as a post-processing step to improve vector quality and is simpler to use than other approaches that use semantic information while training.
It can be used for improving vectors obtained from any word vector training model and performs better than current state-of-the-art approaches to semantic enrichment of word vectors.
We validated the applicability of our method across tasks, semantic lexicons, and languages.
