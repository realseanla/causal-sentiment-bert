In situ hybridisation gene expression information helps biologists identify where a gene is expressed.
However, the databases that republish the experimental information are often both incomplete and inconsistent.
This paper examines a system, Argudas, designed to help tackle these issues.
Argudas is an evolution of an existing system, and so that system is reviewed as a means of both explaining and justifying the behaviour of Argudas.
Throughout the discussion of Argudas a number of issues will be raised including the appropriateness of argumentation in biology and the challenges faced when integrating apparently similar online biological databases.
