Most real-world data can be modeled as heterogeneous information networks (HINs) consisting of vertices of multiple types and their relationships.
Search for similar vertices of the same type in large HINs, such as bibliographic networks and business-review networks, is a fundamental problem with broad applications.
Although similarity search in HINs has been studied previously, most existing approaches neither explore rich semantic information embedded in the network structures nor take user's preference as a guidance.
