In this study it is proven that the Hrebs used in Denotation analysis of texts and Cohesion Chains (defined as a fusion between Lexical Chains and Coreference Chains) represent similar linguistic tools.
This result gives us the possibility to extend to Cohesion Chains (CCs) some important indicators as, for example the Kernel of CCs, the topicality of a CC, text concentration, CC-diffuseness and mean diffuseness of the text.
Let us mention that nowhere in the Lexical Chains or Coreference Chains literature these kinds of indicators are introduced and used since now.
Similarly, some applications of CCs in the study of a text (as for example segmentation or summarization of a text) could be realized starting from hrebs.
As an illustration of the similarity between Hrebs and CCs a detailed analyze of the poem "Lacul" by Mihai Eminescu is given.
