This paper shows that one can be competitive with with the k-means objective while operating online.
In this model, the algorithm receives vectors v1,...,vn one by one in arbitrary order.
For each vector vi the algorithm outputs a cluster identifier before receiving vi+1.
Our online algorithm generates ~O(k) clusters whose k-means cost is ~O(W*) where W* is the optimal k-means cost using k clusters and ~O suppresses poly logarithmic factors.
We also show that, experimentally, it is not much worse than k-means++ while operating in a strictly more constrained computational model.
