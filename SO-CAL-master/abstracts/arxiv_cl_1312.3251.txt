For any deep computational processing of language we need evidences, and one such set of evidences is corpus.
This paper describes the development of a text-based corpus for the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.
A Corpus is considered as a building block for any language processing tasks.
Due to the lack of awareness like other Indian languages, it is also studied less frequently.
As a result the language still lacks a good corpus and basic language processing tools.
As per our knowledge this is the first effort to develop a corpus for Bishnupriya Manipuri language.
