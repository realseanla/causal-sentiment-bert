In this paper we present Gelisp, a new library to represent musical Constraint Satisfaction Problems and search strategies intuitively.
Gelisp has two interfaces, a command-line one for Common Lisp and a graphical one for OpenMusic.
Using Gelisp, we solved a problem of automatic music generation proposed by composer Michael Jarrell and we found solutions for the All-interval series.
