We look more carefully at the modeling of causality using structural equations.
It is clear that the structural equations can have a major impact on the conclusions we draw about causality.
In particular, the choice of variables and their values can also have a significant impact on causality.
These choices are, to some extent, subjective.
We consider what counts as an appropriate choice.
More generally, we consider what makes a model an appropriate model, especially if we want to take defaults into account, as was argued is necessary in recent work.
