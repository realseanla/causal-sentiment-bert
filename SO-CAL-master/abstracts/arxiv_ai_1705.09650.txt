This paper focuses on detecting anomalies in a digital video broadcasting (DVB) system from providers' perspective.
We learn a probabilistic deterministic real timed automaton profiling benign behavior of encryption control in the DVB control access system.
This profile is used as a one-class classifier.
Anomalous items in a testing sequence are detected when the sequence is not accepted by the learned model.
