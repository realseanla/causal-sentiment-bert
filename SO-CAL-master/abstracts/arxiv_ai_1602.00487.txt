Most Software Defined Networks (SDN) traffic engineering applications use excessive and frequent global monitoring in order to find the optimal Quality-of-Service (QoS) paths for the current state of the network.
In this work, we present the motivations, architecture and initial evaluation of a SDN application called Cognitive Routing Engine (CRE) which is able to find near-optimal paths for a user-specified QoS while using a very small monitoring overhead compared to global monitoring which is required to guarantee that optimal paths are found.
Smaller monitoring overheads bring the advantage of smaller response time for the SDN controllers and switches.
The initial evaluation of CRE on a SDN representation of the GEANT academic network shows that it is possible to find near-optimal paths with a small optimality gap of 1.65 percent while using 9.5 times less monitoring.
