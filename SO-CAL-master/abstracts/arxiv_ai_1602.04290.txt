Remote science operations require automated systems that can both act and react with minimal human intervention.
One such vision is that of an intelligent instrument that collects data in an automated fashion, and based on what it learns, decides which new measurements to take.
This innovation implements experimental design and unites it with data analysis in such a way that it completes the cycle of learning.
This cycle is the basis of the Scientific Method.
