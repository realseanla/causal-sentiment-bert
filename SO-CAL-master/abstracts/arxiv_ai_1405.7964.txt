In this paper, firstly we present Maji's definitions  and verify that that some propositions are incorrect by a counterexample.
We then redefine concept of neutrosophic soft set and their operation based on \c{C}a\u{g}man  and investigate some properties of these operations.
We then construct an decision making method and group decision making which selects an optimum element from the alternatives by using weights of parameters.
We finally present an example which shows that the method can be successfully applied to many problems that contain uncertainties
