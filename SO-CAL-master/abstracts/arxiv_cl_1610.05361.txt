End-to-end attention-based models have been shown to be competitive alternatives to conventional DNN-HMM models in the Speech Recognition Systems.
In this paper, we extend existing end-to-end attention-based models that can be applied for Distant Speech Recognition (DSR) task.
Specifically, we propose an end-to-end attention-based speech recognizer with multichannel input that performs sequence prediction directly at the character level.
To gain a better performance, we also incorporate Highway long short-term memory (HLSTM) which outperforms previous models on AMI distant speech recognition task.
