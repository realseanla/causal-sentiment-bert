We introduce a framework for lightweight dependency syntax annotation.
Our formalism builds upon the typical representation for unlabeled dependencies, permitting a simple notation and annotation workflow.
Moreover, the formalism encourages annotators to underspecify parts of the syntax if doing so would streamline the annotation process.
We demonstrate the efficacy of this annotation on three languages and develop algorithms to evaluate and compare underspecified annotations.
