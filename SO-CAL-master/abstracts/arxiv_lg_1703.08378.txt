Robot vision is a fundamental device for human-robot interaction and robot complex tasks.
In this paper, we use Kinect and propose a feature graph fusion (FGF) for robot recognition.
Our feature fusion utilizes RGB and depth information to construct fused feature from Kinect.
FGF involves multi-Jaccard similarity to compute a robust graph and utilize word embedding method to enhance the recognition results.
We also collect DUT RGB-D face dataset and a benchmark datset to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.
The experimental results illustrate FGF is robust and effective to face and object datasets in robot applications.
