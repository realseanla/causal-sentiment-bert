This paper discusses in layperson's terms human and computational studies of the impact of threat and fear on exploration and creativity.
A first study showed that both killifish from a lake with predators and from a lake without predators explore a new environment to the same degree and plotting number of new spaces covered over time generates a hump-shaped curve.
However, for the fish from the lake with predators the curve is shifted to the right; they take longer.
This pattern was replicated by a computer model of exploratory behavior varying only one parameter, the fear parameter.
A second study showed that stories inspired by threatening photographs were rated as more creative than stories inspired by non-threatening photographs.
Various explanations for the findings are discussed.
