Representation determines how we can reason about a specific problem.
Sometimes one representation helps us find a proof more easily than others.
Most current automated reasoning tools focus on reasoning within one representation.
There is, therefore, a need for the development of better tools to mechanise and automate formal and logically sound changes of representation.
