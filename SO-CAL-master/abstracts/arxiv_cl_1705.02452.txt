Voice browser applications in Text-to- Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems crucially depend on a pronunciation lexicon.
The present paper describes the model of pronunciation lexicon of Hindi developed to automatically generate the output forms of Hindi at two levels, the &lt;phoneme&gt; and the &lt;PS&gt; (PS, in short for Prosodic Structure).
The latter level involves both syllable-division and stress placement.
The paper describes the tool developed for generating the two-level outputs of lexica in Hindi.
