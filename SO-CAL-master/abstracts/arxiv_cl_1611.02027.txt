We report on an exploratory analysis of Emoji Dick, a project that leverages crowdsourcing to translate Melville's Moby Dick into emoji.
This distinctive use of emoji removes textual context, and leads to a varying translation quality.
In this paper, we use statistical word alignment and part-of-speech tagging to explore how people use emoji.
Despite these simple methods, we observed differences in token and part-of-speech distributions.
Experiments also suggest that semantics are preserved in the translation, and repetition is more common in emoji.
