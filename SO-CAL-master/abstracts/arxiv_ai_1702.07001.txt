Devising an optimal strategy for navigation in a partially observable environment is one of the key objectives in AI.
One of the problem in this context is the Canadian Traveler Problem (CTP).
CTP is a navigation problem where an agent is tasked to travel from source to target in a partially observable weighted graph, whose edge might be blocked with a certain probability and observing such blockage occurs only when reaching upon one of the edges end points.
The goal is to find a strategy that minimizes the expected travel cost.
The problem is known to be P$\#$ hard.
In this work we study the CTP theoretically and empirically.
First, we study the Dep-CTP, a CTP variant we introduce which assumes dependencies between the edges status.
We show that Dep-CTP is intractable, and further we analyze two of its subclasses on disjoint paths graph.
Second, we develop a general algorithm Gen-PAO that optimally solve the CTP.
Gen-PAO is capable of solving two other types of CTP called Sensing-CTP and Expensive-Edges CTP.
Since the CTP is intractable, Gen-PAO use some pruning methods to reduce the space search for the optimal solution.
We also define some variants of Gen-PAO, compare their performance and show some benefits of Gen-PAO over existing work.
