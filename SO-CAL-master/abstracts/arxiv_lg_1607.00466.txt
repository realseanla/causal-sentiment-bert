The presence of outliers is prevalent in machine learning applications and may produce misleading results.
In this paper a new method for dealing with outliers and anomal samples is proposed.
To overcome the outlier issue, the proposed method combines the global and local views of the samples.
By combination of these views, our algorithm performs in a robust manner.
The experimental results show the capabilities of the proposed method.
