Recognizing the activities of daily living plays an important role in healthcare.
It is necessary to use an adapted model to simulate the human behavior in a domestic space to monitor the patient harmonically and to intervene in the necessary time.

We propose a new grammar, called "Home By Room Activities Language", to facilitate the complexity of human scenarios and consider the abnormal activities.
