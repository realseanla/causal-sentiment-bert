The paper provides a survey of semantic methods for solution of fundamental tasks in mathematical knowledge management.
Ontological models and formalisms are discussed.
We propose an ontology of mathematical knowledge, covering wide range of fields of mathematics.
We demonstrate applications of this representation in mathematical formula search, and learning.
