We consider the statistical problem of recovering a hidden "ground truth" binary labeling for the vertices of a graph G up to low Hamming error from noisy edge and vertex measurements.
We present new algorithms and a sharp finite-sample analysis for this problem on trees and sparse graphs with poor expansion properties such as hypergrids and ring lattices.
Our method generalizes and improves over Globerson et al.
(2015), who introduced the problem for two-dimensional grid lattices.
