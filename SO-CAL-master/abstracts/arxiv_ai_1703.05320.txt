This paper presents a study of employing Ranking SVM and Convolutional Neural Network for two missions: legal information retrieval and question answering in the Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment.
For the first task, our proposed model used a triple of features (LSI, Manhattan, Jaccard), and is based on paragraph level instead of article level as in previous studies.
In fact, each single-paragraph article corresponds to a particular paragraph in a huge multiple-paragraph article.
For the legal question answering task, additional statistical features from information retrieval task integrated into Convolutional Neural Network contribute to higher accuracy.
