Declarative spatial reasoning denotes the ability to (declaratively) specify and solve real-world problems related to geometric and qualitative spatial representation and reasoning within standard knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) based methods (e.g., logic programming and derivatives).
One approach for encoding the semantics of spatial relations within a declarative programming framework is by systems of polynomial constraints.
However, solving such constraints is computationally intractable in general (i.e.
the theory of real-closed fields).
