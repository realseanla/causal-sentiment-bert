We explore techniques to maximize the effectiveness of discourse information in the task of authorship attribution.
We present a novel method to embed discourse features in a Convolutional Neural Network text classifier, which achieves a state-of-the-art result by a substantial margin.
We empirically investigate several featurization methods to understand the conditions under which discourse features contribute non-trivial performance gains, and analyze discourse embeddings.
