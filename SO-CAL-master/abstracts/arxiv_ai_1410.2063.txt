Communication and interaction among agents have been the subject of extensive investigation since many years.
Commitment-based communication, where communicating agents are seen as a debtor agent who is committed to a creditor agent to bring about something (possibly under some conditions) is now very well-established.
The approach of DACMAS (Data-Aware Commitment-based MAS) lifts commitment-related approaches proposed in the literature from a propositional to a first-order setting via the adoption the DRL-Lite Description Logic.
Notably, DACMASs provide, beyond commitments, simple forms of inter-agent event-based communication.
Yet, the aspect is missing of making a MAS able to acquire knowledge from contexts which are not agents and which are external to the MAS.
This topic is coped with in Managed MCSs (Managed Multi-Context Systems), where however exchanges are among knowledge bases and not agents.
In this paper, we propose the new approach of DACmMCMASs (Data-Aware Commitment-based managed Multi- Context MAS), so as to obtain a commitment-based first-order agent system which is able to interact with heterogeneous external information sources.
We show that DACmMCMASs retain the nice formal properties of the original approaches.
