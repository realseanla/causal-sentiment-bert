This work focuses on answering single-relation factoid questions over Freebase.
Each question can acquire the answer from a single fact of form (subject, predicate, object) in Freebase.
This task, simple question answering (SimpleQA), can be addressed via a two-step pipeline: entity linking and fact selection.
In fact selection, we match the subject entity in fact with the entity mention in question by a character-level convolutional neural network (char-CNN), and match the predicate in fact with the question by a word-level CNN (word-CNN).
This work makes two main contributions.
(i) A simple and effective entity linker over Freebase is proposed.
Our entity linker outperforms the state-of-the-art entity linker of SimpleQA task.
(ii) A novel attentive maxpooling is stacked over word-CNN, so that the predicate representation can be matched with the predicate-focused question representation more effectively.
Experiments show that our system sets new state-of-the-art in this task.
