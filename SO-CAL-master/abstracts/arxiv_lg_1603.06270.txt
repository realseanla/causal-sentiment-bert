We present a deep hierarchical recurrent neural network for sequence tagging.
Given a sequence of words, our model employs deep gated recurrent units on both character and word levels to encode morphology and context information, and applies a conditional random field layer to predict the tags.
Our model is task independent, language independent, and feature engineering free.
We further extend our model to multi-task and cross-lingual joint training by sharing the architecture and parameters.
Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple languages on several benchmark tasks including POS tagging, chunking, and NER.
We also demonstrate that multi-task and cross-lingual joint training can improve the performance in various cases.
