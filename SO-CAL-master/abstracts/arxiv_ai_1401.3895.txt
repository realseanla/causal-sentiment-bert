Translations between different nonmonotonic formalisms always have been an important topic in the field, in particular to understand the knowledge-representation capabilities those formalisms offer.
We provide such an investigation in terms of different semantics proposed for abstract argumentation frameworks, a nonmonotonic yet simple formalism which received increasing interest within the last decade.
Although the properties of these different semantics are nowadays well understood, there are no explicit results about intertranslatability.
We provide such translations wrt.
different properties and also give a few novel complexity results which underlie some negative results.
