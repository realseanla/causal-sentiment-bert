We investigate properties of ABA+, a formalism that extends the well studied structured argumentation formalism Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) with a preference handling mechanism.
In particular, we establish desirable properties that ABA+ semantics exhibit.
These pave way to the satisfaction by ABA+ of some (arguably) desirable principles of preference handling in argumentation and non-monotonic reasoning, as well as non-monotonic inference properties of ABA+ under various semantics.
