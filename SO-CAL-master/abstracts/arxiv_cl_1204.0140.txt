WordNet proved that it is possible to construct a large-scale electronic lexical database on the principles of lexical semantics.
It has been accepted and used extensively by computational linguists ever since it was released.
Inspired by WordNet's success, we propose as an alternative a similar resource, based on the 1987 Penguin edition of Roget's Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases.
