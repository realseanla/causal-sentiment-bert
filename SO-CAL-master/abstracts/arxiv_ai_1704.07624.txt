We propose a simple, yet effective, approach towards inducing multilingual taxonomies from Wikipedia.
Given an English taxonomy, our approach leverages the interlanguage links of Wikipedia followed by character-level classifiers to induce high-precision, high-coverage taxonomies in other languages.
Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, heuristics-heavy approaches for six languages.
As a consequence of our work, we release presumably the largest and the most accurate multilingual taxonomic resource spanning over 280 languages.
