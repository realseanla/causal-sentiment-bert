This paper describes a graph clustering algorithm that aims to minimize the normalized cut criterion and has a model order selection procedure.
The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparable to spectral approaches in terms of minimizing normalized cut.
However, unlike spectral approaches, the proposed algorithm scales to graphs with millions of nodes and edges.
The algorithm consists of three components that are processed sequentially: a greedy agglomerative hierarchical clustering procedure, model order selection, and a local refinement.
