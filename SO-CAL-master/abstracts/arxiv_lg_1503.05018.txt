Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences and their similarity to a time series can be used for time series classification.
Since the discovery of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long or multivariate time series is difficult.
In this work we propose Ultra-Fast Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets.
It is shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-the-art shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by being by up to three orders of magnitudes.
Since this method allows a ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time series classification becomes feasible.
