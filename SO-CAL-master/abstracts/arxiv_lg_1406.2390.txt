We introduce a deep scattering network, which computes invariants with iterated contractions adapted to training data.
It defines a deep convolution network model, whose contraction properties can be analyzed mathematically.
A cascade of wavelet transform convolutions are computed with a multirate filter bank, and adapted with permutations.
Unsupervised learning of permutations optimize the contraction directions, by maximizing the average discriminability of training data.
For Haar wavelets, it is solved with a polynomial complexity pairing algorithm.
Translation and rotation invariance learning is shown with classification experiments on hand-written digits.
