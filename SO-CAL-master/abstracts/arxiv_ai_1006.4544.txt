Human disease diagnosis is a complicated process and requires high level of expertise.
Any attempt of developing a web-based expert system dealing with human disease diagnosis has to overcome various difficulties.
This paper describes a project work aiming to develop a web-based fuzzy expert system for diagnosing human diseases.
Now a days fuzzy systems are being used successfully in an increasing number of application areas; they use linguistic rules to describe systems.
This research project focuses on the research and development of a web-based clinical tool designed to improve the quality of the exchange of health information between health care professionals and patients.
Practitioners can also use this web-based tool to corroborate diagnosis.
The proposed system is experimented on various scenarios in order to evaluate it's performance.
In all the cases, proposed system exhibits satisfactory results.
