In the last two decades, modal and description logics have been applied to numerous areas of computer science, including knowledge representation, formal verification, database theory, distributed computing and, more recently, semantic web and ontologies.
For this reason, the problem of automated reasoning in modal and description logics has been thoroughly investigated.
In particular, many approaches have been proposed for efficiently handling the satisfiability of the core normal modal logic K(m), and of its notational variant, the description logic ALC.
Although simple in structure, K(m)/ALC is computationally very hard to reason on, its satisfiability being PSPACE-complete.
