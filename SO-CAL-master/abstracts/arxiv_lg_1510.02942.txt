Multi-instance multi-label (MIML) learning is a challenging problem in many aspects.
Such learning approaches might be useful for many medical diagnosis applications including breast cancer detection and classification.
In this study subset of digiPATH dataset (whole slide digital breast cancer histopathology images) are used for training and evaluation of six state-of-the-art MIML methods.
