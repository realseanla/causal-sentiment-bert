This paper explores two separate questions: Can we perform natural language processing tasks without a lexicon?
; and, Should we?
Existing natural language processing techniques are either based on words as units or use units such as grams only for basic classification tasks.
How close can a machine come to reasoning about the meanings of words and phrases in a corpus without using any lexicon, based only on grams?
