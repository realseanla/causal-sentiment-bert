Multi-party Conversational Systems are systems with natural language interaction between one or more people or systems.
From the moment that an utterance is sent to a group, to the moment that it is replied in the group by a member, several activities must be done by the system: utterance understanding, information search, reasoning, among others.
In this paper we present the challenges of designing and building multi-party conversational systems, the state of the art, our proposed hybrid architecture using both rules and machine learning and some insights after implementing and evaluating one on the finance domain.
