A basic problem in the design of privacy-preserving algorithms is the private maximization problem: the goal is to pick an item from a universe that (approximately) maximizes a data-dependent function, all under the constraint of differential privacy.
This problem has been used as a sub-routine in many privacy-preserving algorithms for statistics and machine-learning.
