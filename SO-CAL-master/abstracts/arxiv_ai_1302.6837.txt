This paper examines methods of decision making that are able to accommodate limitations on both the form in which uncertainty pertaining to a decision problem can be realistically represented and the amount of computing time available before a decision must be made.
The methods are anytime algorithms in the sense of Boddy and Dean 1991.
Techniques are presented for use with Frisch and Haddawy's [1992] anytime deduction system, with an anytime adaptation of Nilsson's [1986] probabilistic logic, and with a probabilistic database model.
