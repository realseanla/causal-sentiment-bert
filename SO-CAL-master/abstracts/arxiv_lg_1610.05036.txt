In this work, we propose a novel framework to encode the local connectivity patterns of brain, using Fisher Vectors (FV), Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) and Bag-of-Words (BoW) methods.
We first obtain local descriptors, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) from fMRI data, by forming local meshes around anatomical regions, and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood.
Then, we extract a dictionary of relationships, called \textit{brain connectivity dictionary} by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to a set of MADs, and selecting the codewords at the mean of each component of the mixture.
Codewords represent the connectivity patterns among anatomical regions.
We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the k-Means clustering.
