In recent years, there has been growing focus on the study of automated recommender systems.
Music recommendation systems serve as a prominent domain for such works, both from an academic and a commercial perspective.
A relatively well known fact in music cognition is that music is experienced in temporal context and in sequence.
In this work we present DJ-MC, a reinforcement-learning based framework for music recommendation that does not recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on a learned model of preferences for both individual songs and song transitions.
To reduce exploration time, we initialize a model based on user feedback.
This model is subsequently updated by reinforcement.
We show our algorithm outperforms a more naive approach, using both real song data and real playlist data to validate our approach.
