Information sources such as relational databases, spreadsheets, XML, JSON, and Web APIs contain a tremendous amount of structured data that can be leveraged to build and augment knowledge graphs.
However, they rarely provide a semantic model to describe their contents.
Semantic models of data sources represent the implicit meaning of the data by specifying the concepts and the relationships within the data.
Such models are the key ingredients to automatically publish the data into knowledge graphs.
Manually modeling the semantics of data sources requires significant effort and expertise, and although desirable, building these models automatically is a challenging problem.
Most of the related work focuses on semantic annotation of the data fields (source attributes).
However, constructing a semantic model that explicitly describes the relationships between the attributes in addition to their semantic types is critical.
