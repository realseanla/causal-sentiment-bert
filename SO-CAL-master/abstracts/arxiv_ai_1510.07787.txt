Upcoming many core processors are expected to employ a distributed memory architecture similar to currently available supercomputers, but parallel pattern mining algorithms amenable to the architecture are not comprehensively studied.
We present a novel closed pattern mining algorithm with a well-engineered communication protocol, and generalize it to find statistically significant patterns from personal genome data.
For distributing communication evenly, it employs global load balancing with multiple stacks distributed on a set of cores organized as a hypercube with random edges.
Our algorithm achieved up to 1175-fold speedup by using 1200 cores for solving a problem with 11,914 items and 697 transactions, while the naive approach of separating the search space failed completely.
