This paper describes our submission to the shared task on word/phrase level Quality Estimation (QE) in the First Conference on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT16).
The objective of the shared task was to predict if the given word/phrase is a correct/incorrect (OK/BAD) translation in the given sentence.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach for word level Quality Estimation using Recurrent Neural Network Language Model (RNN-LM) architecture.
RNN-LMs have been found very effective in different Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.
RNN-LM is mainly used for vector space language modeling for different NLP problems.
For this task, we modify the architecture of RNN-LM.
The modified system predicts a label (OK/BAD) in the slot rather than predicting the word.
The input to the system is a word sequence, similar to the standard RNN-LM.
The approach is language independent and requires only the translated text for QE.
To estimate the phrase level quality, we use the output of the word level QE system.
