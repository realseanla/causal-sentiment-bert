In this paper we investigate an emerging application, 3D scene understanding, likely to be significant in the mobile space in the near future.
The goal of this exploration is to reduce execution time while meeting our quality of result objectives.
In previous work we showed for the first time that it is possible to map this application to power constrained embedded systems, highlighting that decision choices made at the algorithmic design-level have the most impact.
