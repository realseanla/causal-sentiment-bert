This paper presents inference rules for Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL).
Our formalization is based on Notation 3 Logic, which extended RDF by logical symbols and created Semantic Web logic for deductive RDF graph stores.
We also propose OWL-P that is a lightweight formalism of OWL and supports soft inferences by omitting complex language constructs.
