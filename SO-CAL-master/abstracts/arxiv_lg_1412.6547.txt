Many modern multiclass and multilabel problems are characterized by increasingly large output spaces.
For these problems, label embeddings have been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and statistical efficiency.
In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers fast label embedding algorithms and provides us with a unifying view of label embeddings in the multiclass and multilabel settings.
Leveraging techniques from randomized linear algebra, the running time of our label embedding algorithm is exponentially faster than naive algorithms.
Finally, we demonstrate our techniques on two datasets from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text Challenge and the Open Directory Project where we obtain state of the art results.
