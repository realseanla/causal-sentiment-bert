We present a simple approach for automatically extracting the number of subjects involved in randomised controlled trials (RCT).
Our approach first applies a set of rule-based techniques to extract candidate study sizes from the abstracts of the articles.
Supervised classification is then performed over the candidates with support vector machines, using a small set of lexical, structural, and contextual features.
With only a small annotated training set of 201 RCTs, we obtained an accuracy of 88\ percent.
We believe that this system will aid complex medical text processing tasks such as summarisation and question answering.
