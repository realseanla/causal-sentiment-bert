We propose that operator induction serves as an adequate model of perception.
We explain how to reduce universal agent models to operator induction.
We propose a universal measure of operator induction fitness, and show how it can be used in a reinforcement learning model and a homeostasis (self-preserving) agent based on the free energy principle.
We show that the action of the homeostasis agent can be explained by the operator induction model.
