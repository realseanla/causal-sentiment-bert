Dung's abstract argumentation theory is a widely used formalism to model conflicting information and to draw conclusions in such situations.
Hereby, the knowledge is represented by so-called argumentation frameworks (AFs) and the reasoning is done via semantics extracting acceptable sets.
All reasonable semantics are based on the notion of conflict-freeness which means that arguments are only jointly acceptable when they are not linked within the AF.
In this paper, we study the question which information on top of conflict-free sets is needed to compute extensions of a semantics at hand.
We introduce a hierarchy of so-called verification classes specifying the required amount of information.
We show that well-known standard semantics are exactly verifiable through a certain such class.
Our framework also gives a means to study semantics lying inbetween known semantics, thus contributing to a more abstract understanding of the different features argumentation semantics offer.
