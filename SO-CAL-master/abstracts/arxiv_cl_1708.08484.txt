Discourse parsing has long been treated as a stand-alone problem independent from constituency or dependency parsing.
Most attempts at this problem are pipelined rather than end-to-end, sophisticated, and not self-contained: they assume gold-standard text segmentations (Elementary Discourse Units), and use external parsers for syntactic features.
In this paper we propose the first end-to-end discourse parser that jointly parses in both syntax and discourse levels, as well as the first syntacto-discourse treebank by integrating the Penn Treebank with the RST Treebank.
Built upon our recent span-based constituency parser, this joint syntacto-discourse parser requires no preprocessing whatsoever (such as segmentation or feature extraction), achieves the state-of-the-art end-to-end discourse parsing accuracy.
