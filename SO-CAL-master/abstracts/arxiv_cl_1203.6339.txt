The folksonomy is the result of free personal information or assignment of tags to an object (determined by the URI) in order to find them.
The practice of tagging is done in a collective environment.
Folksonomies are self constructed, based on co-occurrence of definitions, rather than a hierarchical structure of the data.
The downside of this was that a few sites and applications are able to successfully exploit the sharing of bookmarks.
The need for tools that are able to resolve the ambiguity of the definitions is becoming urgent as the need of simple instruments for their visualization, editing and exploitation in web applications still hinders their diffusion and wide adoption.
An intelligent interactive interface design for folksonomies should consider the contextual design and inquiry based on a concurrent interaction for a perceptual user interfaces.
To represent folksonomies a new concept structure called "Folksodriven" is used in this paper.
While it is presented the Folksodriven Structure Network (FSN) to resolve the ambiguity of definitions of folksonomy tags suggestions for the user.
On this base a Human-Computer Interactive (HCI) systems is developed for the visualization, navigation, updating and maintenance of folksonomies Knowledge Bases - the FSN - through the web.
System functionalities as well as its internal architecture will be introduced.
