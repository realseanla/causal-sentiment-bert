Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) refers to the task of resolving multiple named entity mentions in a document to their correct references in a knowledge base (KB) (e.g., Wikipedia).
In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method specifically designed for NED.
The proposed method jointly maps words and entities into the same continuous vector space.
We extend the skip-gram model by using two models.
The KB graph model learns the relatedness of entities using the link structure of the KB, whereas the anchor context model aims to align vectors such that similar words and entities occur close to one another in the vector space by leveraging KB anchors and their context words.
By combining contexts based on the proposed embedding with standard NED features, we achieved state-of-the-art accuracy of 93.1 percent on the standard CoNLL dataset and 85.2 percent on the TAC 2010 dataset.
Our code and pre-trained vectors will be made available online.
