Qualitative calculi play a central role in representing and reasoning about qualitative spatial and temporal knowledge.
This paper studies distributive subalgebras of qualitative calculi, which are subalgebras in which (weak) composition distributives over nonempty intersections.
It has been proven for RCC5 and RCC8 that path consistent constraint network over a distributive subalgebra is always minimal and globally consistent (in the sense of strong $n$-consistency) in a qualitative sense.
The well-known subclass of convex interval relations provides one such an example of distributive subalgebras.
This paper first gives a characterisation of distributive subalgebras, which states that the intersection of a set of $n\geq 3$ relations in the subalgebra is nonempty if and only if the intersection of every two of these relations is nonempty.
We further compute and generate all maximal distributive subalgebras for Point Algebra, Interval Algebra, RCC5 and RCC8, Cardinal Relation Algebra, and Rectangle Algebra.
Lastly, we establish two nice properties which will play an important role in efficient reasoning with constraint networks involving a large number of variables.
