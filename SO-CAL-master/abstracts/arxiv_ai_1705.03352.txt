Recently introduced composition operator for credal sets is an analogy of such operators in probability, possibility, evidence and valuation-based systems theories.
It was designed to construct multidimensional models (in the framework of credal sets) from a system of low- dimensional credal sets.
In this paper we study its potential from the computational point of view utilizing methods of polyhedral geometry.
