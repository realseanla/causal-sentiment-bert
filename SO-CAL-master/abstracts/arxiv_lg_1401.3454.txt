Several multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to optimize agents decisions.
Due to the complexity of the problem, the majority of the previously developed MARL algorithms assumed agents either had some knowledge of the underlying game (such as Nash equilibria) and/or observed other agents actions and the rewards they received.
