This paper presents an empirical comparison of different dependency parsers for Vietnamese, which has some unusual characteristics such as copula drop and verb serialization.
Experimental results show that the neural network-based parsers perform significantly better than the traditional parsers.
We report the highest parsing scores published to date for Vietnamese with the labeled attachment score (LAS) at 73.53 percent and the unlabeled attachment score (UAS) at 80.66 percent.
