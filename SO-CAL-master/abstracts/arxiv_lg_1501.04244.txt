Assuming a view of the Random Forest as a special case of a nested ensemble of interchangeable modules, we construct a generalisation space allowing one to easily develop novel methods based on this algorithm.
We discuss the role and required properties of modules at each level, especially in context of some already proposed RF generalisations.
