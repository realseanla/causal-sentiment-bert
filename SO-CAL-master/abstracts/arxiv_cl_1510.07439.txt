The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) starts with eliciting requirements of the customers in the form of Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
SRS document needed for software development is mostly written in Natural Language(NL) convenient for the client.
From the SRS document only, the class name, its attributes and the functions incorporated in the body of the class are traced based on pre-knowledge of analyst.
The paper intends to present a review on Object Oriented (OO) analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
This analysis can be manual where domain expert helps to generate the required diagram or automated system, where the system generates the required diagram, from the input in the form of SRS.
