Combining efficiency with reliability within CP systems is one of the main concerns of CP developers.
This paper presents a simple and efficient way to connect Choco and Ibex, two CP solvers respectively specialised on finite and continuous domains.
This enables to take advantage of the most recent advances of the continuous community within Choco while saving development and maintenance resources, hence ensuring a better software quality.
