Displaying a document in Middle Eastern languages requires contextual analysis due to different presentational forms for each character of the alphabet.
The words of the document will be formed by the joining of the correct positional glyphs representing corresponding presentational forms of the characters.
A set of rules defines the joining of the glyphs.
As usual, these rules vary from language to language and are subject to interpretation by the software developers.
