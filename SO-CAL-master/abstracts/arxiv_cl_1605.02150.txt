Multi Sentence Compression (MSC) is of great value to many real world applications, such as guided microblog summarization, opinion summarization and newswire summarization.
Recently, word graph-based approaches have been proposed and become popular in MSC.
Their key assumption is that redundancy among a set of related sentences provides a reliable way to generate informative and grammatical sentences.
In this paper, we propose an effective approach to enhance the word graph-based MSC and tackle the issue that most of the state-of-the-art MSC approaches are confronted with: i.e., improving both informativity and grammaticality at the same time.
Our approach consists of three main components: (1) a merging method based on Multiword Expressions (MWE); (2) a mapping strategy based on synonymy between words; (3) a re-ranking step to identify the best compression candidates generated using a POS-based language model (POS-LM).
We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel approach using a dataset made of clusters of English newswire sentences.
The observed improvements on informativity and grammaticality of the generated compressions show that our approach is superior to state-of-the-art MSC methods.
