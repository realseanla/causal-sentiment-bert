This paper presents a trust computation for international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference, Dempster Shafer theory and subjective logic.
We proposed a method that allows a trust computation which is previously subjective and incomputable.
An example of case study for the trust computation is the United States of America Great Britain relations.
The method supports decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense ministry, presidential or prime minister office.
The Department of Defense (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be known as a friendly, neutral or hostile nation.
