We present an initial version of Regular Boardgames general game description language.
This stands as an extension of Simplified Boardgames language.
Our language is designed to be able to express the rules of a majority of popular boardgames including the complex rules such as promotions, castling, en passant, jump captures, liberty captures, and obligatory moves.
The language describes all the above through one consistent general mechanism based on regular expressions, without using exceptions or ad hoc rules.
