In this paper we focus on the detection of network anomalies like Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and port scans in a unified manner.
While there has been an extensive amount of research in network anomaly detection, current state of the art methods are only able to detect one class of anomalies at the cost of others.
The key tool we will use is based on the spectral decomposition of a trajectory/hankel matrix which is able to detect deviations from both between and within correlation present in the observed network traffic data.
Detailed experiments on synthetic and real network traces shows a significant improvement in detection capability over competing approaches.
In the process we also address the issue of robustness of anomaly detection systems in a principled fashion.
