Plausible reasoning concerns situations whose inherent lack of precision is not quantified; that is, there are no degrees or levels of precision, and hence no use of numbers like probabilities.
A hopefully comprehensive set of principles that clarifies what it means for a formal logic to do plausible reasoning is presented.
A new propositional logic, called Propositional Plausible Logic (PPL), is defined and applied to some important examples.
PPL is the only non-numeric non-monotonic logic we know of that satisfies all the principles and correctly reasons with all the examples.
Some important results about PPL are proved.
