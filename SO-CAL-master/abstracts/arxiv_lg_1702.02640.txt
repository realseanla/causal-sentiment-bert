Connecting different text attributes associated with the same entity (conflation) is important in business data analytics since it could help merge two different tables in a database to provide a more comprehensive profile of an entity.
However, the conflation task is challenging because two text strings that describe the same entity could be quite different from each other for reasons such as misspelling.
It is therefore critical to develop a conflation model that is able to truly understand the semantic meaning of the strings and match them at the semantic level.
To this end, we develop a character-level deep conflation model that encodes the input text strings from character level into finite dimension feature vectors, which are then used to compute the cosine similarity between the text strings.
The model is trained in an end-to-end manner using back propagation and stochastic gradient descent to maximize the likelihood of the correct association.
Specifically, we propose two variants of the deep conflation model, based on long-short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), respectively.
Both models perform well on a real-world business analytics dataset and significantly outperform the baseline bag-of-character (BoC) model.
