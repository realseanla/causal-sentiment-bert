A selective classifier (f,g) comprises a classification function f and a binary selection function g, which determines if the classifier abstains from prediction, or uses f to predict.
The classifier is called pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain.
The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined to be the probability mass of the points it rejects.
A "fast" rejection rate is achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by O(1/m) where m is the number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and O hides logarithmic factors).
Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the well-known CAL active algorithm.
