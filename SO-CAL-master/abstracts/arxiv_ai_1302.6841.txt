Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) are a powerful formalism for reasoning under uncertainty but bear some severe limitations: they require a large amount of information before any reasoning process can start, they have limited contradiction handling capabilities, and their ability to provide explanations for their conclusion is still controversial.
There exists a class of reasoning systems, called Truth Maintenance Systems (TMSs), which are able to deal with partially specified knowledge, to provide well-founded explanation for their conclusions, and to detect and handle contradictions.
TMSs incorporating measure of uncertainty are called Belief Maintenance Systems (BMSs).
This paper describes how a BMS based on probabilistic logic can be applied to BBNs, thus introducing a new class of BBNs, called Ignorant Belief Networks, able to incrementally deal with partially specified conditional dependencies, to provide explanations, and to detect and handle contradictions.
