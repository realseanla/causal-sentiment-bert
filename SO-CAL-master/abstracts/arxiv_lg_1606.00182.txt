In the problem of edge sign classification, we are given a directed graph (representing an online social network), and our task is to predict the binary labels of the edges (i.e., the positive or negative nature of the social relationships).
Many successful heuristics for this problem are based on the troll-trust features, estimating on each node the fraction of outgoing and incoming positive edges.
We show that these heuristics can be understood, and rigorously analyzed, as approximators to the Bayes optimal classifier for a simple probabilistic model of the edge labels.
We then show that the maximum likelihood estimator of this model approximately corresponds to the predictions of a label propagation algorithm run on a transformed version of the original social graph.
Extensive experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that this algorithm is competitive against state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of both prediction performance and scalability.
Finally, we show that troll-trust features can also be used to derive online learning algorithms which have theoretical guarantees even when edges are adversarially labeled.
