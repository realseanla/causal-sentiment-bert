We introduce new methods for estimating and evaluating embeddings of words from dozens of languages in a single shared embedding space.
Our estimation methods, multiCluster and multiCCA, use dictionaries and monolingual data; they do not require parallel data.
Our new evaluation method, multiQVEC+, is shown to correlate better than previous ones with two downstream tasks (text categorization and parsing).
On this evaluation and others, our estimation methods outperform existing ones.
We also describe a web portal for evaluation that will facilitate further research in this area, along with open-source releases of all our methods.
