This paper describes the Duluth systems that participated in Task 14 of SemEval 2016, Semantic Taxonomy Enrichment.
There were three related systems in the formal evaluation which are discussed here, along with numerous post--evaluation runs.
All of these systems identified synonyms between WordNet and other dictionaries by measuring the gloss overlaps between them.
These systems perform better than the random baseline and one post--evaluation variation was within a respectable margin of the median result attained by all participating systems.
