Yield and quality improvement is of paramount importance to any manufacturing company.
One of the ways of improving yield is through discovery of the root causal factors affecting yield.
We propose the use of data-driven interpretable causal models to identify key factors affecting yield.
We focus on factors that are measured in different stages of production and testing in the manufacturing cycle of a product.
We apply causal structure learning techniques on real data collected from this line.
Specifically, the goal of this work is to learn interpretable causal models from observational data produced by manufacturing lines.
