The maturity of deep learning techniques has led in recent years to a breakthrough in object recognition in visual media.
While for some specific benchmarks, neural techniques seem to match if not outperform human judgement, challenges are still open for detecting arbitrary concepts in arbitrary videos.
In this paper, we propose a system that combines neural techniques, a large scale visual concepts ontology, and an active learning loop, to provide on the fly model learning of arbitrary concepts.
We give an overview of the system as a whole, and focus on the central role of the ontology for guiding and bootstrapping the learning of new concepts, improving the recall of concept detection, and, on the user end, providing semantic search on a library of annotated videos.
