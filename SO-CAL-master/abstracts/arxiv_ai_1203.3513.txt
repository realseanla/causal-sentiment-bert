Decision circuits perform efficient evaluation of influence diagrams, building on the ad- vances in arithmetic circuits for belief net- work inference [Darwiche, 2003; Bhattachar- jya and Shachter, 2007].
We show how even more compact decision circuits can be con- structed for dynamic programming in influ- ence diagrams with separable value functions and conditionally independent subproblems.
Once a decision circuit has been constructed based on the diagram's "global" graphical structure, it can be compiled to exploit "lo- cal" structure for efficient evaluation and sen- sitivity analysis.
