This paper presents a fuzzy inference system for integrated volt/var control (VVC) in distribution substations.
The purpose is go forward to automation distribution applying conservation voltage reduction (CVR) in isolated power systems where control capabilities are limited.
A fuzzy controller has been designed.
Working as an on-line tool, it has been tested under real conditions and it has managed the operation during a whole day in a distribution substation.
Within the limits of control capabilities of the system, the controller maintained successfully an acceptable voltage profile, power factor values over 0,98 and it has ostensibly improved the performance given by an optimal power flow based automation system.
CVR savings during the test are evaluated and the aim to integrate it in the VVC is presented.
