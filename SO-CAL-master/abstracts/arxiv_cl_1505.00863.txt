Our FRDC_QA team participated in the QA-Lab English subtask of the NTCIR-11.
In this paper, we describe our system for solving real-world university entrance exam questions, which are related to world history.

Since problems with choosing right/wrong sentence from multiple sentence choices account for about two-thirds of the total, we individually design a classification based model for solving this type of questions.
For other types of questions, we also design some simple methods.
