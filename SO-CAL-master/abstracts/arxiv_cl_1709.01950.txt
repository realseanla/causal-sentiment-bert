Sarcasm occurring due to the presence of numerical portions in text has been quoted as an error made by automatic sarcasm detection approaches in the past.
We present a first study in detecting sarcasm in numbers, as in the case of the sentence 'Love waking up at 4 am'.
We analyze the challenges of the problem, and present Rule-based, Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches to detect sarcasm in numerical portions of text.
Our Deep Learning approach outperforms four past works for sarcasm detection and Rule-based and Machine learning approaches on a dataset of tweets, obtaining an F1-score of 0.93.
This shows that special attention to text containing numbers may be useful to improve state-of-the-art in sarcasm detection.
