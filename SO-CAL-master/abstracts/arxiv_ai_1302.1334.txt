The paper considers the class of information systems capable of solving heuristic problems on basis of formal theory that was termed modal and vector theory of formal intelligent systems (FIS).
The paper justifies the construction of FIS resolution algorithm, defines the main features of these systems and proves theorems that underlie the theory.
The principle of representation diversity of FIS construction is formulated.
The paper deals with the main principles of constructing and functioning formal intelligent system (FIS) on basis of FIS modal and vector theory.
The following phenomena are considered: modular architecture of FIS presentation sub-system, algorithms of data processing at every step of the stage of creating presentations.
Besides the paper suggests the structure of neural elements, i.e.
zone detectors and processors that are the basis for FIS construction.
