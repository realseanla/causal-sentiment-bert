In this paper we present architectures based on deep neural nets for gesture recognition in videos, which are invariant to local scaling.
We amalgamate autoencoder and predictor architectures using an adaptive weighting scheme coping with a reduced size labeled dataset, while enriching our models from enormous unlabeled sets.
We further improve robustness to lighting conditions by introducing a new adaptive filer based on temporal local scale normalization.
We provide superior results over known methods, including recent reported approaches based on neural nets.
