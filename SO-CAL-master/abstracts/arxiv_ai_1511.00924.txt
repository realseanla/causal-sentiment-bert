To exploit the Web Ontology Language OWL as an answer set programming (ASP) language, we introduce the notion of bounded model semantics, as an intuitive and computationally advantageous alternative to its classical semantics.
We show that a translation into ASP allows for solving a wide range of bounded-model reasoning tasks, including satisfiability and axiom entailment but also novel ones such as model extraction and enumeration.
Ultimately, our work facilitates harnessing advanced semantic web modeling environments for the logic programming community through an "off-label use" of OWL.
