This paper describes a technique to compare large text sources using word vector representations (word2vec) and dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) and how it can be implemented using Python.
The technique provides a bird's-eye view of text sources, e.g.
text summaries and their source material, and enables users to explore text sources like a geographical map.
Word vector representations capture many linguistic properties such as gender, tense, plurality and even semantic concepts like "capital city of".
Using dimensionality reduction, a 2D map can be computed where semantically similar words are close to each other.
The technique uses the word2vec model from the gensim Python library and t-SNE from scikit-learn.
