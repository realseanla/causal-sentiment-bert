Surely we want solid foundations.
What kind of castle can we build on sand?
What is the point of devoting effort to balconies and minarets, if the foundation may be so weak as to allow the structure to collapse of its own weight?
We want our foundations set on bedrock, designed to last for generations.
Who would want an architect who cannot certify the soundness of the foundations of his buildings?
