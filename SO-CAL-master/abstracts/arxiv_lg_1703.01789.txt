Recently, the end-to-end approach that learns hierarchical representations from raw data using deep convolutional neural networks has been successfully explored in the image, text and speech domains.
This approach was applied to musical signals as well but has been not fully explored yet.
To this end, we propose sample-level deep convolutional neural networks which learn representations from very small grains of waveforms (e.g.
2 or 3 samples) beyond typical frame-level input representations.
This allows the networks to hierarchically learn filters that are sensitive to log-scaled frequency, such as mel-frequency spectrogram that is widely used in music classification systems.
It also helps learning high-level abstraction of music by increasing the depth of layers.
We show how deep architectures with sample-level filters improve the accuracy in music auto-tagging and they provide results that are com- parable to previous state-of-the-art performances for the Magnatagatune dataset and Million song dataset.
In addition, we visualize filters learned in a sample-level DCNN in each layer to identify hierarchically learned features.
