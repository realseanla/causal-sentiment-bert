This paper presents a knowledge-based detection of objects approach using the OWL ontology language, the Semantic Web Rule Language, and 3D processing built-ins aiming at combining geometrical analysis of 3D point clouds and specialist's knowledge.
This combination allows the detection and the annotation of objects contained in point clouds.
The context of the study is the detection of railway objects such as signals, technical cupboards, electric poles, etc.
Thus, the resulting enriched and populated ontology, that contains the annotations of objects in the point clouds, is used to feed a GIS systems or an IFC file for architecture purposes.
