This paper describes the approach taken to the XML Mining track at INEX 2008 by a group at the Queensland University of Technology.
We introduce the K-tree clustering algorithm in an Information Retrieval context by adapting it for document clustering.
Many large scale problems exist in document clustering.
K-tree scales well with large inputs due to its low complexity.
It offers promising results both in terms of efficiency and quality.
Document classification was completed using Support Vector Machines.
