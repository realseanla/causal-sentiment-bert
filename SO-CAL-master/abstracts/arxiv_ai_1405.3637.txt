The paper presents a knowledge representation language $\mathcal{A}log$ which extends ASP with aggregates.
The goal is to have a language based on simple syntax and clear intuitive and mathematical semantics.
We give some properties of $\mathcal{A}log$, an algorithm for computing its answer sets, and comparison with other approaches.
