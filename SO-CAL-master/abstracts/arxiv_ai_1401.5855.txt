The minimisation problem of a sum of unary and pairwise functions of discrete variables is a general NP-hard problem with wide applications such as computing MAP configurations in Markov Random Fields (MRF), minimising Gibbs energy, or solving binary Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems (VCSPs).
