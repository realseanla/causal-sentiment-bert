In this article we develop an algorithm to detect parallel texts in the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible.
The results are presented online and chapters in the Hebrew Bible containing parallel passages can be inspected synoptically.
Differences between parallel passages are highlighted.
In a similar way the MT of Isaiah is presented synoptically with 1QIsaa.
We also investigate how one can investigate the degree of similarity between parallel passages with the help of a case study of 2 Kings 19-25 and its parallels in Isaiah, Jeremiah and 2 Chronicles.
