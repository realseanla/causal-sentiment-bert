Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems.
This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues.
The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS.
The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM).
The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions are different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validates the proposed approach.
