Robots assisting disabled or elderly people in the performance of activities of daily living need to perform complex manipulation tasks which are highly dependent on the environment and preferences of the user.
In addition, these environments and users are not suitable for the collection of massive amounts of training data, as the manipulated objects can be fragile, and the wheelchair-bound users might have difficulty recovering from a failed manipulation task.
