Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a problem in the field of computational linguistics given as finding the intended sense of a word (or a set of words) when it is activated within a certain context.
WSD was recently addressed as a combinatorial optimization problem in which the goal is to find a sequence of senses that maximize the semantic relatedness among the target words.
In this article, a novel algorithm for solving the WSD problem called D-Bees is proposed which is inspired by bee colony optimization (BCO)where artificial bee agents collaborate to solve the problem.
The D-Bees algorithm is evaluated on a standard dataset (SemEval 2007 coarse-grained English all-words task corpus)and is compared to simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and two ant colony optimization techniques (ACO).
It will be observed that the BCO and ACO approaches are on par.
