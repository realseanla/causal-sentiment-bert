Computer-supported learning is an increasingly important form of study since it allows for independent learning and individualized instruction.
In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to developing an intelligent tutoring system for teaching textbook-style mathematical proofs.
We characterize the particularities of the domain and discuss common ITS design models.
Our approach is motivated by phenomena found in a corpus of tutorial dialogs that were collected in a Wizard-of-Oz experiment.
We show how an intelligent tutor for textbook-style mathematical proofs can be built on top of an adapted assertion-level proof assistant by reusing representations and proof search strategies originally developed for automated and interactive theorem proving.
The resulting prototype was successfully evaluated on a corpus of tutorial dialogs and yields good results.
