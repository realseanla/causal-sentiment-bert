There is a growing trend towards the convergence of cyber-physical systems (CPS) and social computing, which will lead to the emergence of smart communities composed of various objects (including both human individuals and physical things) that interact and cooperate with each other.
These smart communities promise to enable a number of innovative applications and services that will improve the quality of life.
This position paper addresses some opportunities and challenges of building smart communities characterized by cyber-physical and social intelligence.
