Although the problem of assigning a critique of robotic behavior in near-unanimous agreement to human norms seems intractable, a starting point of such a framework is of the collection of knowledge a priori and experience a posteriori categorized in a set of judgments available to the intelligence, translated into computer code.
If such an intersection were successful, an algorithm with ethically traceable behavior and cogent equivalence to human cognition is established.
The process of framework development itself reveals avenues of improvement and optimization.
This paper will propose the application of Kant's critique of reason to current perceptions of autonomous intelligent systems.
