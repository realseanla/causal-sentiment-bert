The prediction of periodical time-series remains challenging due to various types of data distortions and misalignments.
Here, we propose a novel model called Temporal embedding-enhanced convolutional neural Network (TeNet) to learn repeatedly-occurring-yet-hidden structural elements in periodical time-series, called abstract snippets, for predicting future changes.
Our model uses convolutional neural networks and embeds a time-series with its potential neighbors in the temporal domain for aligning it to the dominant patterns in the dataset.
The model is robust to distortions and misalignments in the temporal domain and demonstrates strong prediction power for periodical time-series.
