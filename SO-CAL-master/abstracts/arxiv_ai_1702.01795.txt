ASHACL, a variant of the W3C Shapes Constraint Language, is designed to determine whether an RDF graph meets some conditions.
These conditions are grouped into shapes, which validate whether particular RDF terms each meet the constraints of the shape.
Shapes are themselves expressed as RDF triples in an RDF graph, called a shapes graph.
