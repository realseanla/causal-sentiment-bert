Hand-engineered feature sets are a well understood method for creating robust NLP models, but they require a lot of expertise and effort to create.
In this work we describe how to automatically generate rich feature sets from simple units called featlets, requiring less engineering.
Using information gain to guide the generation process, we train models which rival the state of the art on two standard Semantic Role Labeling datasets with almost no task or linguistic insight.
