Since formulation of Inductive Database (IDB) problem, several Data Mining (DM) languages have been proposed, confirming that KDD process could be supported via inductive queries (IQ) answering.
This paper reviews the existing DM languages.
We are presenting important primitives of the DM language and classifying our languages according to primitives' satisfaction.
In addition, we presented languages' syntaxes and tried to apply each one to a database sample to test a set of KDD operations.
This study allows us to highlight languages capabilities and limits, which is very useful for future work and perspectives.
