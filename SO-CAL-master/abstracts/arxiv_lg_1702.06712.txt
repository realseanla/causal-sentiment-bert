Shapelets are discriminative time series subsequences that allow generation of interpretable classification models, which provide faster and generally better classification than the nearest neighbor approach.
However, the shapelet discovery process requires the evaluation of all possible subsequences of all time series in the training set, making it extremely computation intensive.
Consequently, shapelet discovery for large time series datasets quickly becomes intractable.
A number of improvements have been proposed to reduce the training time.
These techniques use approximation or discretization and often lead to reduced classification accuracy compared to the exact method.
