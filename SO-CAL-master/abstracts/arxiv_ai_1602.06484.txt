Narrative intelligence is the ability to craft, tell, understand, and respond affectively to stories.
We argue that instilling artificial intelligences with computational narrative intelligence affords a number of applications beneficial to humans.
We lay out some of the machine learning challenges necessary to solve to achieve computational narrative intelligence.
Finally, we argue that computational narrative is a practical step towards machine enculturation, the teaching of sociocultural values to machines.
