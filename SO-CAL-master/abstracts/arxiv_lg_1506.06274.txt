In this paper, we proposed a pose estimation system based on rendered image training set, which predicts the pose of objects in real image, with knowledge of object category and tight bounding box.
We developed a patch-based multi-class classification algorithm, and an iterative approach to improve the accuracy.
We achieved state-of-the-art performance on pose estimation task.
