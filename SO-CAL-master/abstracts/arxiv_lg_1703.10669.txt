Motivated by runtime verification of QoS requirements in self-adaptive and self-organizing systems that are able to reconfigure their structure and behavior in response to runtime data, we propose a QoS-aware variant of Thompson sampling for multi-armed bandits.
It is applicable in settings where QoS satisfaction of an arm has to be ensured with high confidence efficiently, rather than finding the optimal arm while minimizing regret.
Preliminary experimental results encourage further research in the field of QoS-aware decision making.
