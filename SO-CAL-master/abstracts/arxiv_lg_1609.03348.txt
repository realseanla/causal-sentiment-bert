A generic and scalable Reinforcement Learning scheme for Artificial Neural Networks is presented, providing a general purpose learning machine.
By reference to a node threshold three features are described 1) A mechanism for Primary Reinforcement, capable of solving linearly inseparable problems 2) The learning scheme is extended to include a mechanism for Conditioned Reinforcement, capable of forming long term strategy 3) The learning scheme is modified to use a threshold-based deep learning algorithm, providing a robust and biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation.
The model may be used for supervised as well as unsupervised training regimes.
