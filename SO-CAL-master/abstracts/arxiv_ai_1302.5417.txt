The information retrieval systems that are present nowadays are mainly based on full text matching of keywords or topic based classification.
This matching of keywords often returns a large number of irrelevant information and this does not meet the users query requirement.
In order to solve this problem and to enhance the search using semantic environment, a technique named ontology is implemented for the field of poultry in this paper.
Ontology is an emerging technique in the current field of research in semantic environment.
This paper constructs ontology using the tool named Protege version 4.0 and this also generates Resource Description Framework schema and XML scripts for using poultry ontology in web.
