Residual learning has recently surfaced as an effective means of constructing very deep neural networks for object recognition.
However, current incarnations of residual networks do not allow for the modeling and integration of complex relations between closely coupled recognition tasks or across domains.
Such problems are often encountered in multimedia and vision applications involving large-scale content recognition.
We propose a novel extension of residual learning for deep networks that enables intuitive learning across multiple related tasks using cross-connections called cross-residuals.
These cross-residuals connections can be viewed as a form of in-network regularization and enables greater network generalization.
We show how cross-residual learning (CRL) can be integrated in multitask networks to jointly train and detect visual concepts across several tasks.
We present a single multitask cross-residual network with &gt;40 percent less parameters that is able to achieve competitive, or even better, detection performance on a visual sentiment concept detection problem normally requiring multiple specialized single-task networks.
The resulting multitask cross-residual network also achieves better detection performance by about 10.4 percent over a standard multitask residual network without cross-residuals with even a small amount of cross-task weighting.
