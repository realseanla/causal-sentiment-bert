To know which operators to apply and in which order, as well as attributing good values to their parameters is a challenge for users of computer vision.
This paper proposes a solution to this problem as a multi-agent system modeled according to the Vowel approach and using the Q-learning algorithm to optimize its choice.
An implementation is given to test and validate this method.
