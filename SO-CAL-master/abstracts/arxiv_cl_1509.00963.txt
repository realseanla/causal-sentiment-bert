It is commonly acknowledged that temporal expression extractors are important components of larger natural language processing systems like information retrieval and question answering systems.
Extraction and normalization of temporal expressions in Turkish has not been given attention so far except the extraction of some date and time expressions within the course of named entity recognition.
As TimeML is the current standard of temporal expression and event annotation in natural language texts, in this paper, we present an analysis of temporal expressions in Turkish based on the related TimeML classification (i.e., date, time, duration, and set expressions).
We have created a lexicon for Turkish temporal expressions and devised considerably wide-coverage patterns using the lexical classes as the building blocks.
We believe that the proposed patterns, together with convenient normalization rules, can be readily used by prospective temporal expression extraction tools for Turkish.
