We present an annotation schema as part of an effort to create a manually annotated corpus for Arabic dialogue language understanding including spoken dialogue and written "chat" dialogue for inquiry-answer domain.
The proposed schema handles mainly the request and response acts that occurs frequently in inquiry-answer debate conversations expressing request services, suggests, and offers.
We applied the proposed schema on 83 Arabic inquiry-answer dialogues.
