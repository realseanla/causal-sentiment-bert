Social network platforms can archive data produced by their users and re-use the data to serve the users better.
One of the services that these platforms provide is the recommendation service.
Recommendation systems can predict the future preferences of the users using various different techniques.
One of the most popular technique for recommendation is matrix-factorization, which uses low-rank approximation of input data.
Similarly word embedding methods from natural language processing literature learn low-dimensional vector space representation of input elements.
Noticing the similarities among word embedding and matrix factorization techniques and based on the previous works that apply techniques from text processing for recommendation, Word2Vec's skip-gram technique is employed to make recommendations.
Unlike previous works that use Word2Vec for recommendation, non-textual features are used.
The aim of this work is to make recommendation on next check-in venues and a Foursquare check-in dataset is used for this purpose.
The results showed that use of vector space representations of items modelled by skip-gram technique is promising for making recommendations.
