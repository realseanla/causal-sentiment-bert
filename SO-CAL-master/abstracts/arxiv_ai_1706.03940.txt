We have studied the Infrastructure-Stressing population in the light of their correlation with geo-demographic segments.
This is motivated by the fact that specific geo-demographic segments can be targeted via marketing campaigns.
Fuzzy logic is applied to create an interface between big data, numeric methods for processing big data and a manager.
