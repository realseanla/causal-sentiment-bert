This paper describes our approach for the triple scoring task at WSDM Cup 2017.
The task aims to assign a relevance score for each pair of entities and their types in a knowledge base in order to enhance the ranking results in entity retrieval tasks.
We propose an approach wherein the outputs of multiple neural network classifiers are combined using a supervised machine learning model.
The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves the best performance in one out of three measures, and performs competitively in the other two measures.
