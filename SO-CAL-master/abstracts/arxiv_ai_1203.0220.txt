We introduce a family of new equational semantics for argumentation networks which can handle odd and even loops in a uniform manner.
We offer one version of equational semantics which is equivalent to CF2 semantics, and a better version which gives the same results as traditional Dung semantics for even loops but can still handle odd loops.
