Using SMS (Short Message System), cell phones can be used to query for information about various topics.
In an SMS based search system, one of the key problems is to identify a domain (broad topic) associated with the user query; so that a more comprehensive search can be carried out by the domain specific search engine.
In this paper we use a rule based approach, to identify the domain, called Short Query Intent Identification System (SQIIS).
We construct two different rule-bases using different strategies to suit query intent identification.
We evaluate the two rule-bases experimentally.
