We propose a novel system which can transform a recipe into any selected regional style (e.g., Japanese, Mediterranean, or Italian).
This system has three characteristics.
First the system can identify the degree of dietary style mixture of any selected recipe.
Second, the system can visualize such dietary style mixtures using barycentric Newton diagrams.
Third, the system can suggest ingredient substitutions through an extended word2vec model, such that a recipe becomes more authentic for any selected dietary style.
Drawing on a large number of recipes from Yummly, an example shows how the proposed system can transform a traditional Japanese recipe, Sukiyaki, into French style.
