This paper explores a novel way for analyzing the tournament structures to find a best suitable one for the tournament under consideration.
It concerns about three aspects such as tournament conducting cost, competitiveness development and ranking precision.
It then proposes a new method using progress tree to detect potential throwaway matches.
The analysis performed using the proposed method reveals the strengths and weaknesses of tournament structures.
As a conclusion, single elimination is best if we want to qualify one winner only, all matches conducted are exciting in term of competitiveness.
Double elimination with proper seeding system is a better choice if we want to qualify more winners.
A reasonable number of extra matches need to be conducted in exchange of being able to qualify top four winners.
Round-robin gives reliable ranking precision for all participants.
However, its conduction cost is very high, and it fails to maintain competitiveness development.
