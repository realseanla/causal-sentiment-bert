Summarization of large texts is still an open problem in language processing.
In this work we develop a full fledged pipeline to generate summaries of news articles using the Abstract Meaning Representation(AMR).
We first generate the AMR graphs of stories then extract summary graphs from the story graphs and finally generate sentences from the summary graph.
For extracting summary AMRs from the story AMRs we use a two step process.
First, we find important sentences from the text and then extract the summary AMRs from those selected sentences.
We outperform the previous methods using AMR for summarization by more that 3 ROGUE-1 points.
On the CNN-Dailymail corpus we achieve results competitive with the strong lead-3 baseline till summary graph extraction step.
