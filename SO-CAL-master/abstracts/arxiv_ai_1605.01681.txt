This study suggests a new prediction model for chaotic time series inspired by the brain emotional learning of mammals.
We describe the structure and function of this model, which is referred to as BELPM (Brain Emotional Learning-Based Prediction Model).
Structurally, the model mimics the connection between the regions of the limbic system, and functionally it uses weighted k nearest neighbors to imitate the roles of those regions.
The learning algorithm of BELPM is defined using steepest descent (SD) and the least square estimator (LSE).
Two benchmark chaotic time series, Lorenz and Henon, have been used to evaluate the performance of BELPM.
The obtained results have been compared with those of other prediction methods.
The results show that BELPM has the capability to achieve a reasonable accuracy for long-term prediction of chaotic time series, using a limited amount of training data and a reasonably low computational time.
