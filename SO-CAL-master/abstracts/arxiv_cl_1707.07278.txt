\emph{Verifiability} is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, editors being encouraged to provide citations for the added content.
For a Wikipedia article, determining the \emph{citation span} of a citation, i.e.
what content is covered by a citation, is important as it helps decide for which content citations are still missing.
