We study the best arm identification (BEST-1-ARM) problem, which is defined as follows.
We are given $n$ stochastic bandit arms.
The $i$th arm has a reward distribution $D_i$ with an unknown mean $\mu_i$.
Upon each play of the $i$th arm, we can get a reward, sampled i.i.d.
from $D_i$.
We would like to identify the arm with largest mean with probability at least $1-\delta$, using as few samples as possible.
We also study an important special case where there are only two arms, which we call the sign problem.
We achieve a very detailed understanding of the optimal sample complexity of sign, simplifying and significantly extending a classical result by Farrell in 1964, with a completely new proof.
Using the new lower bound for sign, we obtain the first lower bound for BEST-1-ARM that goes beyond the classic Mannor-Tsitsiklis lower bound, by an interesting reduction from sign to BEST-1-ARM.
