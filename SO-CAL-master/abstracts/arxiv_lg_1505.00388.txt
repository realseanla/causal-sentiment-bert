An order-revealing encryption scheme gives a public procedure by which two ciphertexts can be compared to reveal the ordering of their underlying plaintexts.
We show how to use order-revealing encryption to separate computationally efficient PAC learning from efficient $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private PAC learning.
That is, we construct a concept class that is efficiently PAC learnable, but for which every efficient learner fails to be differentially private.
This answers a question of Kasiviswanathan et al.
(FOCS '08, SIAM J. Comput.
'11).
