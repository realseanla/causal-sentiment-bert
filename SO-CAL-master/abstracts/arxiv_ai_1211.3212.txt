We consider the online distributed non-stochastic experts problem, where the distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to $k$ sites, and the sites are required to communicate with each other via the coordinator.
At each time-step $t$, one of the $k$ site nodes has to pick an expert from the set ${1, ..., n}$, and the same site receives information about payoffs of all experts for that round.
The goal of the distributed system is to minimize regret at time horizon $T$, while simultaneously keeping communication to a minimum.
