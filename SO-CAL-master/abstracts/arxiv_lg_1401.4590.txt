Many Artificial Intelligence tasks cannot be evaluated with a single quality criterion and some sort of weighted combination is needed to provide system rankings.
A problem of weighted combination measures is that slight changes in the relative weights may produce substantial changes in the system rankings.
This paper introduces the Unanimous Improvement Ratio (UIR), a measure that complements standard metric combination criteria (such as van Rijsbergen's F-measure) and indicates how robust the measured differences are to changes in the relative weights of the individual metrics.
UIR is meant to elucidate whether a perceived difference between two systems is an artifact of how individual metrics are weighted.
