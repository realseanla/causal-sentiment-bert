Influence diagrams are decision theoretic extensions of Bayesian networks.
They are applied to diverse decision problems.
In this paper we apply influence diagrams to the optimization of a vehicle speed profile.
We present results of computational experiments in which an influence diagram was used to optimize the speed profile of a Formula 1 race car at the Silverstone F1 circuit.
The computed lap time and speed profiles correspond well to those achieved by test pilots.
An extended version of our model that considers a more complex optimization function and diverse traffic constraints is currently being tested onboard a testing car by a major car manufacturer.
This paper opens doors for new applications of influence diagrams.
