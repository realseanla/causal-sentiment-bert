In this paper, I describe several approaches to automatic or semi-automatic development of symbolic rules for grammar checkers from the information contained in corpora.
The rules obtained this way are an important addition to manually-created rules that seem to dominate in rule-based checkers.
However, the manual process of creation of rules is costly, time-consuming and error-prone.
It seems therefore advisable to use machine-learning algorithms to create the rules automatically or semi-automatically.
The results obtained seem to corroborate my initial hypothesis that symbolic machine learning algorithms can be useful for acquiring new rules for grammar checking.
It turns out, however, that for practical uses, error corpora cannot be the sole source of information used in grammar checking.
I suggest therefore that only by using different approaches, grammar-checkers, or more generally, computer-aided proofreading tools, will be able to cover most frequent and severe mistakes and avoid false alarms that seem to distract users.
