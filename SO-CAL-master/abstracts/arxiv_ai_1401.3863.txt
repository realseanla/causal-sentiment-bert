The Hamiltonian cycle problem (HCP) is an important combinatorial problem with applications in many areas.
It is among the first problems used for studying intrinsic properties, including phase transitions, of combinatorial problems.
While thorough theoretical and experimental analyses have been made on the HCP in undirected graphs, a limited amount of work has been done for the HCP in directed graphs (DHCP).
The main contribution of this work is an effective algorithm for the DHCP.
Our algorithm explores and exploits the close relationship between the DHCP and the Assignment Problem (AP) and utilizes a technique based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT).
By combining effective algorithms for the AP and SAT, our algorithm significantly outperforms previous exact DHCP algorithms, including an algorithm based on the award-winning Concorde TSP algorithm.
The second result of the current study is an experimental analysis of phase transitions of the DHCP, verifying and refining a known phase transition of the DHCP.
