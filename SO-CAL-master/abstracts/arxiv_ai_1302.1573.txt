This paper is concerned with planning in stochastic domains by means of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs).
POMDPs are difficult to solve.
This paper identifies a subclass of POMDPs called region observable POMDPs, which are easier to solve and can be used to approximate general POMDPs to arbitrary accuracy.
