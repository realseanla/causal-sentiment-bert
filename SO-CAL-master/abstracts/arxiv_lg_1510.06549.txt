There is an explosion of data, documents, and other content, and people require tools to analyze and interpret these, tools to turn the content into information and knowledge.
Topic modeling have been developed to solve these problems.
Topic models such as LDA [Blei et.
al.
2003] allow salient patterns in data to be extracted automatically.
When analyzing texts, these patterns are called topics.
Among numerous extensions of LDA, few of them can reliably analyze multiple groups of documents and extract topic similarities.
Recently, the introduction of differential topic modeling (SPDP) [Chen et.
al.
2012] performs uniformly better than many topic models in a discriminative setting.
