This paper proposes a new approach to model the temporal dynamics of a sequence of facial expressions.
To this purpose, a sequence of Face Image Descriptors (FID) is regarded as the output of a Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system.
The temporal dynamics of such sequence of descriptors are represented by means of a Hankel matrix.
The paper presents different strategies to compute dynamics-based representation of a sequence of FID, and reports classification accuracy values of the proposed representations within different standard classification frameworks.
The representations have been validated in two very challenging application domains: emotion recognition and pain detection.
Experiments on two publicly available benchmarks and comparison with state-of-the-art approaches demonstrate that the dynamics-based FID representation attains competitive performance when off-the-shelf classification tools are adopted.
