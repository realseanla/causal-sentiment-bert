State of the art speech recognition systems use data-intensive context-dependent phonemes as acoustic units.
However, these approaches do not translate well to low resourced languages where large amounts of training data is not available.
For such languages, automatic discovery of acoustic units is critical.
In this paper, we demonstrate the application of nonparametric Bayesian models to acoustic unit discovery.
We show that the discovered units are correlated with phonemes and therefore are linguistically meaningful.
We also present a spoken term detection (STD) by example query algorithm based on these automatically learned units.
We show that our proposed system produces a P@N of 61.2 percent and an EER of 13.95 percent on the TIMIT dataset.
The improvement in the EER is 5 percent while P@N is only slightly lower than the best reported system in the literature.
