We suggest a new method for creating and using gold-standard datasets for word similarity evaluation.
Our goal is to improve the reliability of the evaluation, and we do this by redesigning the annotation task to achieve higher inter-rater agreement, and by defining a performance measure which takes the reliability of each annotation decision in the dataset into account.
