The ideas about decision making under ignorance in economics are combined with the ideas about uncertainty representation in computer science.
The combination sheds new light on the question of how artificial agents can act in a dynamically consistent manner.
The notion of sequential consistency is formalized by adapting the law of iterated expectation for plausibility measures.
The necessary and sufficient condition for a certainty equivalence operator for Nehring-Puppe's preference to be sequentially consistent is given.
This result sheds light on the models of decision making under uncertainty.
