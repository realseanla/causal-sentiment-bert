We propose a system for automated essay grading using ontologies and textual entailment.
The process of textual entailment is guided by hypotheses, which are extracted from a domain ontology.
Textual entailment checks if the truth of the hypothesis follows from a given text.
We enact textual entailment to compare students answer to a model answer obtained from ontology.
We validated the solution against various essays written by students in the chemistry domain.
