Abstractions are essential when a person performs intellectual tasks.
In this case, however, abstractions are either ideas or depend on ideas in the mind of the person, making them unsuitable for mechanical manipulation.
In spite of this, it is possible to define abstractions that can be processed entirely through a mechanical process.
In this paper, I introduce these computable abstractions and the mechanical abstractional process that deals with them, opening the possibility for machines to perform intellectual tasks with results that are intuitively comparable to humans results.
