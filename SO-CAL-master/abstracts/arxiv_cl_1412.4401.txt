Automatic terminology processing appeared 10 years ago when electronic corpora became widely available.
Such processing may be statistically or linguistically based and produces terminology resources that can be used in a number of applications : indexing, information retrieval, technology watch, etc.
We present the tools that have been developed in the IRIN Institute.
They all take as input texts (or collection of texts) and reflect different states of terminology processing: term acquisition, term recognition and term structuring.
