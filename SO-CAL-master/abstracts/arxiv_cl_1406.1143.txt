Our study identifies sentences in Wikipedia articles that are either identical or highly similar by applying techniques for near-duplicate detection of web pages.
This is accomplished with a MapReduce implementation of minhash to identify clusters of sentences with high Jaccard similarity.
We show that these clusters can be categorized into six different types, two of which are particularly interesting: identical sentences quantify the extent to which content in Wikipedia is copied and pasted, and near-duplicate sentences that state contradictory facts point to quality issues in Wikipedia.
