We describe a machine learning based method to identify incorrect entries in translation memories.
It extends previous work by Barbu (2015) through incorporating recall-based machine translation and part-of-speech-tagging features.
Our system ranked first in the Binary Classification (II) task for two out of three language pairs: English-Italian and English-Spanish.
