We provide asymptotically sharp bounds for the Gaussian surface area and the Gaussian noise sensitivity of polynomial threshold functions.
In particular we show that if $f$ is a degree-$d$ polynomial threshold function, then its Gaussian sensitivity at noise rate $\epsilon$ is less than some quantity asymptotic to $\frac{d\sqrt{2\epsilon}}{\pi}$ and the Gaussian surface area is at most $\frac{d}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$.
Furthermore these bounds are asymptotically tight as $\epsilon\to 0$ and $f$ the threshold function of a product of $d$ distinct homogeneous linear functions.
