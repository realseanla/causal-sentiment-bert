In this paper, we reexamine the Movie Graph Argument, which demonstrates a basic incompatibility between computationalism and materialism.
We discover that the incompatibility is only manifest in singular classical-like universes.
If we accept that we live in a Multiverse, then the incompatibility goes away, but in that case another line of argument shows that with computationalism, the fundamental, or primitive materiality has no causal influence on what is observed, which must must be derivable from basic arithmetic properties.
