We develop T-SKIRT: a temporal, structured-knowledge, IRT-based method for predicting student responses online.
By explicitly accounting for student learning and employing a structured, multidimensional representation of student proficiencies, the model outperforms standard IRT-based methods on an online response prediction task when applied to real responses collected from students interacting with diverse pools of educational content.
