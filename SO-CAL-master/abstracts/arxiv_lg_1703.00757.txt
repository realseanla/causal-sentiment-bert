Software verification competitions, such as the annual SV-COMP, evaluate software verification tools with respect to their effectivity and efficiency.
Typically, the outcome of a competition is a (possibly category-specific) ranking of the tools.
For many applications, such as building portfolio solvers, it would be desirable to have an idea of the (relative) performance of verification tools on a given verification task beforehand, i.e., prior to actually running all tools on the task.
