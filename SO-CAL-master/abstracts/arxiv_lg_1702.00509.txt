We have developed and trained a convolutional neural network to automatically and simultaneously segment optic disc, fovea and blood vessels.
Fundus images were normalised before segmentation was performed to enforce consistency in background lighting and contrast.
For every effective point in the fundus image, our algorithm extracted three channels of input from the neighbourhood of the point and forward the response across the 7 layer network.
In average, our segmentation achieved an accuracy of 92.68 percent on the testing set from Drive database.
