In cross-lingual dependency annotation projection, information is often lost during transfer because of early decoding.
We present an end-to-end graph-based neural network dependency parser that can be trained to reproduce matrices of edge scores, which can be directly projected across word alignments.
We show that our approach to cross-lingual dependency parsing is not only simpler, but also achieves an absolute improvement of 2.25 percent averaged across 10 languages compared to the previous state of the art.
