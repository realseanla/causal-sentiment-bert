This paper describes a context free grammar (CFG) based grammatical relations for Myanmar sentences which combine corpus-based function tagging system.
Part of the challenge of statistical function tagging for Myanmar sentences comes from the fact that Myanmar has free-phrase-order and a complex morphological system.
Function tagging is a pre-processing step to show grammatical relations of Myanmar sentences.
In the task of function tagging, which tags the function of Myanmar sentences with correct segmentation, POS (part-of-speech) tagging and chunking information, we use Naive Bayesian theory to disambiguate the possible function tags of a word.
We apply context free grammar (CFG) to find out the grammatical relations of the function tags.
We also create a functional annotated tagged corpus for Myanmar and propose the grammar rules for Myanmar sentences.
Experiments show that our analysis achieves a good result with simple sentences and complex sentences.
