This paper presents an analysis of data from a gift-exchange-game experiment.
The experiment was described in `The Impact of Social Comparisons on Reciprocity' by G\"achter et al.
2012.
Since this paper uses state-of-art data science techniques, the results provide a different point of view on the problem.
As already shown in relevant literature from experimental economics, human decisions deviate from rational payoff maximization.
The average gift rate was $31$ percent.
Gift rate was under no conditions zero.
Further, we derive some special findings and calculate their significance.
