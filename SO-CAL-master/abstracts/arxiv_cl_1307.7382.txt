We develop a probabilistic latent-variable model to discover semantic frames---types of events and their participants---from corpora.
We present a Dirichlet-multinomial model in which frames are latent categories that explain the linking of verb-subject-object triples, given document-level sparsity.
We analyze what the model learns, and compare it to FrameNet, noting it learns some novel and interesting frames.
This document also contains a discussion of inference issues, including concentration parameter learning; and a small-scale error analysis of syntactic parsing accuracy.
