In this paper, we propose a unified algorithmic framework for solving many known variants of \mds.
Our algorithm is a simple iterative scheme with guaranteed convergence, and is \emph{modular}; by changing the internals of a single subroutine in the algorithm, we can switch cost functions and target spaces easily.
In addition to the formal guarantees of convergence, our algorithms are accurate; in most cases, they converge to better quality solutions than existing methods, in comparable time.
We expect that this framework will be useful for a number of \mds variants that have not yet been studied.
