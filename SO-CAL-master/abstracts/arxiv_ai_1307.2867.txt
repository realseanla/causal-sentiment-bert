We study the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems involving global constraints, i.e., special-purpose constraints provided by a solver and represented implicitly by a parametrised algorithm.
Such constraints are widely used; indeed, they are one of the key reasons for the success of constraint programming in solving real-world problems.
