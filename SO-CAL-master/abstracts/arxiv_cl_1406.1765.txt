The long term aim of the project carried out by the French National Space Agency (CNES) is to design a writing guide based on the real and regular writing of requirements.
As a first step in the project, this paper proposes a lin-guistic analysis of requirements written in French by CNES engineers.
The aim is to determine to what extent they conform to two rules laid down in INCOSE, a recent guide for writing requirements.
Although CNES engineers are not obliged to follow any Controlled Natural Language in their writing of requirements, we believe that language regularities are likely to emerge from this task, mainly due to the writers' experience.
The issue is approached using natural language processing tools to identify sentences that do not comply with INCOSE rules.
We further review these sentences to understand why the recommendations cannot (or should not) always be applied when specifying large-scale projects.
