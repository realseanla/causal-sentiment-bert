SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) is one of the most widespread ontologies in the life sciences, with more than 300,000 concepts and relationships, but is distributed with no associated software tools.
In this paper we present MySNOM, a web-based SNOMED CT browser.
MySNOM allows organizations to browse their own distribution of SNOMED CT under a controlled environment, focuses on navigating using the structure of SNOMED CT, and has diagramming capabilities.
