We study the problem of finding appropriate experts who are able to complete timely reviews and would not say "no" to the invitation.
The problem is a central issue in many question-and-answer systems, but has received little research attention.
Different from most existing studies that focus on expertise matching, we want to further predict the expert's response: given a question, how can we find the expert who is able to provide a quality review and will agree to do it.
We formalize the problem as a ranking problem.
We first present an embedding-based question-to-expert distance metric for expertise matching and propose a ranking factor graph (RankFG) model to predict expert response.
For online evaluation, we developed a Chrome Extension for reviewer recommendation and deployed it in the Google Chrome Web Store, and then collected the reviewers' feedback.
We also used the review bidding of a CS conference for evaluation.
In the experiments, the proposed method demonstrates its superiority (+6.6-21.2 percent by MAP) over several state-of-the-art algorithms.
