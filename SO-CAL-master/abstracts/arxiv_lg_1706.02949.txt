K-means (MacQueen, 1967) [1] is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well-known clustering problem.
The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set to a predefined, say K number of clusters.
Determination of K is a difficult job and it is not known that which value of K can partition the objects as per our intuition.
To overcome this problem we proposed K+ Means algorithm.
This algorithm is an enhancement over K-Means algorithm.
