Identifying relationships between items is a key task of an online recommender system, in order to help users discover items that are functionally complementary or visually compatible.
In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved.
Furthermore, the human notion of "compatibility" that we need to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible---whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger---they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others.
