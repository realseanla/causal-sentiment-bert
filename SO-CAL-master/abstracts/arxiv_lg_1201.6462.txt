Clustering is considered a non-supervised learning setting, in which the goal is to partition a collection of data points into disjoint clusters.
Often a bound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner.
Many versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and $k$-median.
