We define a context-sensitive temporal probability logic for representing classes of discrete-time temporal Bayesian networks.
Context constraints allow inference to be focused on only the relevant portions of the probabilistic knowledge.
We provide a declarative semantics for our language.
We present a Bayesian network construction algorithm whose generated networks give sound and complete answers to queries.
We use related concepts in logic programming to justify our approach.
We have implemented a Bayesian network construction algorithm for a subset of the theory and demonstrate it's application to the problem of evaluating the effectiveness of treatments for acute cardiac conditions.
