This note presents some representative methods which are based on dictionary learning (DL) for classification.
We do not review the sophisticated methods or frameworks that involve DL for classification, such as online DL and spatial pyramid matching (SPM), but rather, we concentrate on the direct DL-based classification methods.
Here, the "so-called direct DL-based method" is the approach directly deals with DL framework by adding some meaningful penalty terms.
By listing some representative methods, we can roughly divide them into two categories, i.e.
(1) directly making the dictionary discriminative and (2) forcing the sparse coefficients discriminative to push the discrimination power of the dictionary.
From this taxonomy, we can expect some extensions of them as future researches.
