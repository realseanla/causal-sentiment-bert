Academic researchers often need to face with a large collection of research papers in the literature.
This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start.
To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model.
The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015.
Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling.
The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level.
The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level.
It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.
