Normalized web distance (NWD) is a similarity or normalized semantic distance based on the World Wide Web or any other large electronic database, for instance Wikipedia, and a search engine that returns reliable aggregate page counts.
For sets of search terms the NWD gives a similarity on a scale from 0 (identical) to 1 (completely different).
The NWD approximates the similarity according to all (upper semi)computable properties.
We develop the theory and give applications.
The derivation of the NWD method is based on Kolmogorov complexity.
