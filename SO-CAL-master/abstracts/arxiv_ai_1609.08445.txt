We present the AP16-OL7 database which was released as the training and test data for the oriental language recognition (OLR) challenge on APSIPA 2016.
Based on the database, a baseline system was constructed on the basis of the i-vector model.
We report the baseline results evaluated in various metrics defined by the AP16-OLR evaluation plan and demonstrate that AP16-OL7 is a reasonable data resource for multilingual research.
