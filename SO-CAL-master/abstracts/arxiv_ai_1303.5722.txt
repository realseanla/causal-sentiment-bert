We discuss representing and reasoning with knowledge about the time-dependent utility of an agent's actions.
Time-dependent utility plays a crucial role in the interaction between computation and action under bounded resources.
We present a semantics for time-dependent utility and describe the use of time-dependent information in decision contexts.
We illustrate our discussion with examples of time-pressured reasoning in Protos, a system constructed to explore the ideal control of inference by reasoners with limit abilities.
