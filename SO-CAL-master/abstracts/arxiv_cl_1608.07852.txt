Tang (618-907 AD) and Song (960-1279) dynasties are two very important periods in the development of Chinese literary.
The most influential forms of the poetry in Tang and Song were Shi and Ci, respectively.
Tang Shi and Song Ci established crucial foundations of the Chinese literature, and their influences in both literary works and daily lives of the Chinese communities last until today.
