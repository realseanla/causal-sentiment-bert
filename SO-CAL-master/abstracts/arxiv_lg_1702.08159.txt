F2F is a C++ library for large-scale machine learning.
It contains a CPU optimized implementation of the Fastfood algorithm, that allows the computation of approximated kernel expansions in loglinear time.
The algorithm requires to compute the product of Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) matrices.
A cache friendly SIMD Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) that achieves compelling speed and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods has been developed.
F2F allows to obtain non-linear classification combining Fastfood and a linear classifier.
