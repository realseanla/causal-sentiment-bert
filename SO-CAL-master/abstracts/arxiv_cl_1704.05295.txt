Artificial Intelligence federates numerous scientific fields in the aim of developing machines able to assist human operators performing complex treatments -- most of which demand high cognitive skills (e.g.
learning or decision processes).
Central to this quest is to give machines the ability to estimate the likeness or similarity between things in the way human beings estimate the similarity between stimuli.
