In this document, we introduce a new dataset designed for training machine learning models of symbolic music data.
Five datasets are provided, one of which is from a newly collected corpus of 20K midi files.
We describe our preprocessing and cleaning pipeline, which includes the exclusion of a number of files based on scores from a previously developed probabilistic machine learning model.
We also define training, testing and validation splits for the new dataset, based on a clustering scheme which we also describe.
Some simple histograms are included.
