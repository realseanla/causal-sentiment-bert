This paper describes maxDNN, a computationally efficient convolution kernel for deep learning with the NVIDIA Maxwell GPU.
maxDNN reaches 96.3\ percent computational efficiency on typical deep learning network architectures using a single kernel.
The design combines ideas from cuda-convnet2 with the Maxas SGEMM assembly code.
We only address forward propagation (FPROP) operation of the network, but we believe that the same techniques used here will be effective for backward propagation (BPROP) as well.
