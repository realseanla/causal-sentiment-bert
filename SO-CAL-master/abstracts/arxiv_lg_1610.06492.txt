The paper focuses on the problem of learning saccades enabling visual object search.
The developed system combines reinforcement learning with a neural network for learning to predict the possible outcomes of its actions.
We validated the solution in three types of environment consisting of (pseudo)-randomly generated matrices of digits.
The experimental verification is followed by the discussion regarding elements required by systems mimicking the fovea movement and possible further research directions.
