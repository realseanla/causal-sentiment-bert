We present a new method to propagate lower bounds on conditional probability distributions in conventional Bayesian networks.
Our method guarantees to provide outer approximations of the exact lower bounds.
A key advantage is that we can use any available algorithms and tools for Bayesian networks in order to represent and infer lower bounds.
This new method yields results that are provable exact for trees with binary variables, and results which are competitive to existing approximations in credal networks for all other network structures.
Our method is not limited to a specific kind of network structure.
Basically, it is also not restricted to a specific kind of inference, but we restrict our analysis to prognostic inference in this article.
The computational complexity is superior to that of other existing approaches.
