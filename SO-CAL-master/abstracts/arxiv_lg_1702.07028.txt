Deep neural nets have caused a revolution in many classification tasks.
A related ongoing revolution---also theoretically not understood---concerns their ability to serve as generative models for complicated types of data such as images and texts.
These models are trained using ideas like variational autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.
