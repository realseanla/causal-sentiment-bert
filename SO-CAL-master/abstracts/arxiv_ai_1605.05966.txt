This paper proposes a new general approach based on Bayesian networks to model the human behaviour.
This approach represents human behaviour with probabilistic cause-effect relations based on knowledge, but also with conditional probabilities coming either from knowledge or deduced from observations.
This approach has been applied to the co-simulation of the CO2 concentration in an office coupled with human behaviour.
