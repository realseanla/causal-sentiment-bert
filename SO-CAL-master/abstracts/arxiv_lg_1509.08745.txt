Because of their performance, deep neural networks are increasingly used for object recognition.
They are particularly attractive because of their ability to 'absorb' great quantities of labeled data through millions of parameters.
However, as the accuracy and the model sizes increase, so does the memory requirements of the classifiers.
This prohibits their usage on resource limited hardware, including cell phones or other embedded devices.
