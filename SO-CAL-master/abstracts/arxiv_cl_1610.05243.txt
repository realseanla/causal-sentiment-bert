Recently, the development of neural machine translation (NMT) has significantly improved the translation quality of automatic machine translation.
While most sentences are more accurate and fluent than translations by statistical machine translation (SMT)-based systems, in some cases, the NMT system produces translations that have a completely different meaning.
This is especially the case when rare words occur.
