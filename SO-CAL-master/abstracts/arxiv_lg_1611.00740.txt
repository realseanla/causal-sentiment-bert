The paper reviews an emerging body of theoretical results on deep learning including the conditions under which it can be exponentially better than shallow learning.
Deep convolutional networks represent an important special case of these conditions, though weight sharing is not the main reason for their exponential advantage.
Explanation of a few key theorems is provided together with new results, open problems and conjectures.
