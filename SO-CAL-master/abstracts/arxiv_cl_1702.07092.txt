Medical errors are leading causes of death in the US and as such, prevention of these errors is paramount to promoting health care.
Patient Safety Event reports are narratives describing potential adverse events to the patients and are important in identifying and preventing medical errors.
We present a neural network architecture for identifying the type of safety events which is the first step in understanding these narratives.
Our proposed model is based on a soft neural attention model to improve the effectiveness of encoding long sequences.
Empirical results on two large-scale real-world datasets of patient safety reports demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with significant improvements over existing methods.
