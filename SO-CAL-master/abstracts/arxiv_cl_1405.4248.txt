We present a natural language modelization method which is strongely relying on mathematics.
This method, called "Formal Semantics," has been initiated by the American linguist Richard M. Montague in the 1970's.
It uses mathematical tools such as formal languages and grammars, first-order logic, type theory and $\lambda$-calculus.
Our goal is to have the reader discover both Montagovian formal semantics and the mathematical tools that he used in his method.
