Maintenance of association rules is an interesting problem.
Several incremental maintenance algorithms were proposed since the work of (Cheung et al, 1996).
The majority of these algorithms maintain rule bases assuming that support threshold doesn't change.
In this paper, we present incremental maintenance algorithm under support threshold change.
This solution allows user to maintain its rule base under any support threshold.
