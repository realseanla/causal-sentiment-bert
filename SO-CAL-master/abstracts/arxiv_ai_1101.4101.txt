The context of a software developer is something hard to define and capture, as it represents a complex network of elements across different dimensions that are not limited to the work developed on an IDE.
We propose the definition of a software developer context model that takes into account all the dimensions that characterize the work environment of the developer.
We are especially focused on what the software developer context encompasses at the project level and how it can be captured.
The experimental work done so far show that useful context information can be extracted from project management tools.
The extraction, analysis and availability of this context information can be used to enrich the work environment of the developer with additional knowledge to support her/his work.
