This paper considers the textual guidelines proposed by People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam to manage earthquake, tsunami and try to represent it in a more formal way in order to provide means to simulate, analyse and adapt it.
After a state of the art about the coordination models and their possible applications to disaster management, we give an overview of the tsunami plan of Ho Chi Minh City and then its graphical representation with BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation).
We then show how to exploit it with workflow tools to simulate (YAWL language) and analyse it (PROM tool)
