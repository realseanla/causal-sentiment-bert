Data representation is a fundamental task in machine learning.
The representation of data affects the performance of the whole machine learning system.
In a long history, the representation of data is done by feature engineering, and researchers aim at designing better features for specific tasks.
Recently, the rapid development of deep learning and representation learning has brought new inspiration to various domains.
