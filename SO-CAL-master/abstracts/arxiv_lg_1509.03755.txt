Feature weighting algorithms try to solve a problem of great importance nowadays in machine learning: The search of a relevance measure for the features of a given domain.
This relevance is primarily used for feature selection as feature weighting can be seen as a generalization of it, but it is also useful to better understand a problem's domain or to guide an inductor in its learning process.
Relief family of algorithms are proven to be very effective in this task.
Some other feature weighting methods are reviewed in order to give some context and then the different existing extensions to the original algorithm are explained.
