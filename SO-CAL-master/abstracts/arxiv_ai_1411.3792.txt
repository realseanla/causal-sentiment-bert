The paper presents an approach to verification of a multi-agent data analysis algorithm.
We base correct simulation of the multi-agent system by a finite integer model.
For verification we use model checking tool SPIN.
Protocols of agents are written in Promela language and properties of the multi-agent data analysis system are expressed in logic LTL.
We run several experiments with SPIN and the model.
