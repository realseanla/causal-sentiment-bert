In this paper we describe approaches for discovering acoustic concepts and relations in text.
The first major goal is to be able to identify text phrases which contain a notion of audibility and can be termed as a sound or an acoustic concept.
We also propose a method to define an acoustic scene through a set of sound concepts.
We use pattern matching and parts of speech tags to generate sound concepts from large scale text corpora.
We use dependency parsing and LSTM recurrent neural network to predict a set of sound concepts for a given acoustic scene.
These methods are not only helpful in creating an acoustic knowledge base but also directly help in acoustic event and scene detection research in a variety of ways.
