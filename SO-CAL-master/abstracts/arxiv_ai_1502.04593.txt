Multicriteria decision analysis aims at supporting a person facing a decision problem involving conflicting criteria.
We consider an additive utility model which provides robust conclusions based on preferences elicited from the decision maker.
The recommendations based on these robust conclusions are even more convincing if they are complemented by explanations.
We propose a general scheme, based on sequence of preference swaps, in which explanations can be computed.
We show first that the length of explanations can be unbounded in the general case.
However, in the case of binary reference scales, this length is bounded and we provide an algorithm to compute the corresponding explanation.
