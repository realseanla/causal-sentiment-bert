Much attention has been given to the task of gender inference of Twitter users.
Although names are strong gender indicators, the names of Twitter users are rarely used as a feature; probably due to the high number of ill-formed names, which cannot be found in any name dictionary.
Instead of relying solely on a name database, we propose a novel name classifier.
Our approach extracts characteristics from the user names and uses those in order to assign the names to a gender.
This enables us to classify international first names as well as ill-formed names.
