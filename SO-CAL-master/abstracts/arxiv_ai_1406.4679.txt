We establish optimal bounds on the number of nested propagation steps in $k$-consistency tests.
It is known that local consistency algorithms such as arc-, path- and $k$-consistency are not efficiently parallelizable.
Their inherent sequential nature is caused by long chains of nested propagation steps, which cannot be executed in parallel.
This motivates the question "What is the minimum number of nested propagation steps that have to be performed by $k$-consistency algorithms on (binary) constraint networks with $n$ variables and domain size $d$?"
