In recent years, the reliability of information on the Internet has emerged as a crucial issue of modern society.
Social network sites (SNSs) have revolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to freely share content.
As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as vectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes.
The amount of disseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically impossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for automatic hoax detection systems.
