We present probabilistic neural programs, a framework for program induction that permits flexible specification of both a computational model and inference algorithm while simultaneously enabling the use of deep neural networks.
Probabilistic neural programs combine a computation graph for specifying a neural network with an operator for weighted nondeterministic choice.
Thus, a program describes both a collection of decisions as well as the neural network architecture used to make each one.
We evaluate our approach on a challenging diagram question answering task where probabilistic neural programs correctly execute nearly twice as many programs as a baseline model.
