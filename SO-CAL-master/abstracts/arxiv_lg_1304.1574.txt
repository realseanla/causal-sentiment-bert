In this paper, we provide a new framework to obtain the generalization bounds of the learning process for domain adaptation, and then apply the derived bounds to analyze the asymptotical convergence of the learning process.
Without loss of generality, we consider two kinds of representative domain adaptation: one is with multiple sources and the other is combining source and target data.
