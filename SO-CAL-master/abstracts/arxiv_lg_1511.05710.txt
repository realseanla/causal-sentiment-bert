In this paper we propose a novel Bayesian kernel based solution for regression in complex fields.
We develop the formulation of the Gaussian process for regression (GPR) to deal with complex-valued outputs.
Previous solutions for kernels methods usually assume a complexification approach, where the real-valued kernel is replaced by a complex-valued one.
However, based on the results in complex-valued linear theory, we prove that both a kernel and a pseudo-kernel are to be included in the solution.
This is the starting point to develop the new formulation for the complex-valued GPR.
The obtained formulation resembles the one of the widely linear minimum mean-squared (WLMMSE) approach.
Just in the particular case where the outputs are proper, the pseudo-kernel cancels and the solution simplifies to a real-valued GPR structure, as the WLMMSE does into a strictly linear solution.
We include some numerical experiments to show that the novel solution, denoted as widely non-linear complex GPR (WCGPR), outperforms a strictly complex GPR where a pseudo-kernel is not included.
