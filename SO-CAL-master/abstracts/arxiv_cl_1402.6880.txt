The textual, big-data literature misses Bentley, OBrien, &amp; Brocks (Bentley et als) message on distributions; it largely examines the first-order effects of how a single, signature distribution can predict population behaviour, neglecting second-order effects involving distributional shifts, either between signature distributions or within a given signature distribution.
Indeed, Bentley et al.
themselves under-emphasise the potential richness of the latter, within-distribution effects.
