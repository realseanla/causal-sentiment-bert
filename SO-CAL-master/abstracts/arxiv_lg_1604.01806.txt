We present a novel theoretical result that generalises the Discriminative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (DRBM).
While originally the DRBM was defined assuming the {0, 1}-Bernoulli distribution in each of its hidden units, this result makes it possible to derive cost functions for variants of the DRBM that utilise other distributions, including some that are often encountered in the literature.
This is illustrated with the Binomial and {-1, +1}-Bernoulli distributions here.
We evaluate these two DRBM variants and compare them with the original one on three benchmark datasets, namely the MNIST and USPS digit classification datasets, and the 20 Newsgroups document classification dataset.
Results show that each of the three compared models outperforms the remaining two in one of the three datasets, thus indicating that the proposed theoretical generalisation of the DRBM may be valuable in practice.
