This paper presents a microkernel architecture for constraint programming organized around a number of small number of core functionalities and minimal interfaces.
The architecture contrasts with the monolithic nature of many implementations.
Experimental results indicate that the software engineering benefits are not incompatible with runtime efficiency.
