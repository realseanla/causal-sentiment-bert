The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence.
In this paper we present a faster and conceptually simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers.
This allows to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies.
We achieve a new state-of-the-art on WMT'16 English-Romanian translation and outperform several recently published results on the WMT'15 English-German task.
We also achieve almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation.
Our convolutional encoder speeds up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bi-directional LSTM baseline.
