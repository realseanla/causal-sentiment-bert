This paper presents our work on development of OWL-driven systems for formal representation and reasoning about terminological knowledge and facts in petrology.
The long-term aim of our project is to provide solid foundations for a large-scale integration of various kinds of knowledge, including basic terms, rock classification algorithms, findings and reports.
We describe three steps we have taken towards that goal here.
First, we develop a semi-automated procedure for transforming a database of igneous rock samples to texts in a controlled natural language (CNL), and then a collection of OWL ontologies.
Second, we create an OWL ontology of important petrology terms currently described in natural language thesauri.
We describe a prototype of a tool for collecting definitions from domain experts.
Third, we present an approach to formalization of current industrial standards for classification of rock samples, which requires linear equations in OWL 2.
In conclusion, we discuss a range of opportunities arising from the use of semantic technologies in petrology and outline the future work in this area.
