Contemporary research on computational processing of linguistic metaphors is divided into two main branches: metaphor recognition and metaphor interpretation.
We take a different line of research and present an automated method for generating conceptual metaphors from linguistic data.
Given the generated conceptual metaphors, we find corresponding linguistic metaphors in corpora.
In this paper, we describe our approach and its evaluation using English and Russian data.
