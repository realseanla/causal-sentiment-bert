Outlier detection in high-dimensional data is a challenging yet important task, as it has applications in, e.g., fraud detection and quality control.
State-of-the-art density-based algorithms perform well because they 1) take the local neighbourhoods of data points into account and 2) consider feature subspaces.
In highly complex and high-dimensional data, however, existing methods are likely to overlook important outliers because they do not explicitly take into account that the data is often a mixture distribution of multiple components.
