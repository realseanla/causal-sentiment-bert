We prove the existence of a canonical form for semi-deterministic transducers with incomparable sets of output strings.
Based on this, we develop an algorithm which learns semi-deterministic transducers given access to translation queries.
We also prove that there is no learning algorithm for semi-deterministic transducers that uses only domain knowledge.
