Using geometric data analysis, our objective is the analysis of narrative, with narrative of emotion being the focus in this work.
The following two principles for analysis of emotion inform our work.
Firstly, emotion is revealed not as a quality in its own right but rather through interaction.
We study the 2-way relationship of Ilsa and Rick in the movie Casablanca, and the 3-way relationship of Emma, Charles and Rodolphe in the novel Madame Bovary.
Secondly, emotion, that is expression of states of mind of subjects, is formed and evolves against the backdrop of external events and (personal, social, physical) context.
In addition to the analysis methodology with key aspects that are innovative, the input data used is crucial.
We use, firstly, dialog and, secondly, broad and general description that incoporates dialog.
