Reasoning, the most important human brain operation, is charactrized by a degree fuzziness.
In the present paper we construct a fuzzy model for the reasoning process giving through the calculation of the possibilities of all possible individuals' profiles a quantitative/qualitative view of their behaviour during the above process and we use the centroid defuzzification technique for measuring the reasoning skills.
We also present a number of classroom experiments illustrating our results in practice.
