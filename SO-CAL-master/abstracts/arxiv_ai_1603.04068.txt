As most database users cannot precisely express their information needs, it is challenging for database querying and exploration interfaces to understand them.
We propose a novel formal framework for representing and understanding information needs in database querying and exploration.
Our framework considers querying as a collaboration between the user and the database system to establish a mutual language for representing information needs.
We formalize this collaboration as a signaling game, where each mutual language is an equilibrium for the game.
A query interface is more effective if it establishes a less ambiguous mutual language faster.
We discuss some equilibria, strategies, and the convergence in this game.
In particular, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism and analyze it within our framework.
We prove that this adaptation mechanism for the query interface improves the effectiveness of answering queries stochastically speaking, and converges almost surely.
Most importantly, we show that the proposed learning rule is robust to the choice of the metric/reward by the database.
