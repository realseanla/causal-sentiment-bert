The goal of this project is to (i) accumulate annotated informal/formal mathematical corpora suitable for training semi-automated translation between informal and formal mathematics by statistical machine-translation methods, (ii) to develop such methods oriented at the formalization task, and in particular (iii) to combine such methods with learning-assisted automated reasoning that will serve as a strong semantic component.
We describe these ideas, the initial set of corpora, and some initial experiments done over them.
