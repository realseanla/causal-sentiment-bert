Machine learning and data analysis now finds both scientific and industrial application in biology, chemistry, geology, medicine, and physics.
These applications rely on large quantities of data gathered from automated sensors and user input.
Furthermore, the dimensionality of many datasets is extreme: more details are being gathered about single user interactions or sensor readings.
All of these applications encounter problems with a common theme: use observed data to make inferences about the world.
Our work obtains the first provably efficient algorithms for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the presence of heavy-tailed data.
The main tool in this result is the centroid body (a well-known topic in convex geometry), along with optimization and random walks for sampling from a convex body.
This is the first algorithmic use of the centroid body and it is of independent theoretical interest, since it effectively replaces the estimation of covariance from samples, and is more generally accessible.
