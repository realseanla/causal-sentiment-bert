In this paper, we consider the problem of actively learning a linear classifier through query synthesis where the learner can construct artificial queries in order to estimate the true decision boundaries.
This problem has recently gained a lot of interest in automated science and adversarial reverse engineering for which only heuristic algorithms are known.
In such applications, queries can be constructed de novo to elicit information (e.g., automated science) or to evade detection with minimal cost (e.g., adversarial reverse engineering).
