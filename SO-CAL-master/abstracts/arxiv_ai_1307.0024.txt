Wilson et al.
propose a measure of flexibility in project scheduling problems and propose several ways of distributing flexibility over tasks without overrunning the deadline.
These schedules prove quite robust: delays of some tasks do not necessarily lead to delays of subsequent tasks.
The number of tasks that finish late depends, among others, on the way of distributing flexibility.
