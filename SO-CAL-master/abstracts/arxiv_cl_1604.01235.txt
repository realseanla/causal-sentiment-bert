Tree adjoining grammar (TAG) is specifically suited for morph rich and agglutinated languages like Tamil due to its psycho linguistic features and parse time dependency and morph resolution.
Though TAG and LTAG formalisms have been known for about 3 decades, efforts on designing TAG Syntax for Tamil have not been entirely successful due to the complexity of its specification and the rich morphology of Tamil language.
In this paper we present a minimalistic TAG for Tamil without much morphological considerations and also introduce a parser implementation with some obvious variations from the XTAG system
