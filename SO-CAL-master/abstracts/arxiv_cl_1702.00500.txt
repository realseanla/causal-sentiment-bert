This paper addresses the task of AMR-to-text generation by leveraging synchronous node replacement grammar.
During training, graph-to-string rules are learned using a heuristic extraction algorithm.
At test time, a graph transducer is applied to collapse input AMRs and generate output sentences.
Evaluated on SemEval-2016 Task 8, our method gives a BLEU score of 25.62, which is the best reported so far.
