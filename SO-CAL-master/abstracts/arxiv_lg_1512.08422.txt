Recognizing entailment and contradiction between two sentences has wide applications in NLP.
Traditional methods include feature-rich classifiers or formal reasoning.
However, they are usually limited in terms of accuracy and scope.
Recently, the renewed prosperity neural networks has made many improvements in a variety of NLP tasks.
In particular, the tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) proposed in our previous work has achieved high performance in several sentence-level classification tasks.
But whether TBCNN is applicable to recognize entailment and contradiction between two sentences remains unknown.
In this paper, we propose TBCNN-pair model for entailment/contradiction recognition.
Experimental results in a large dataset verifies the rationale of using TBCNN as the sentence-level model; leveraging additional heuristics like element-wise product/difference further improves the result, and outperforms published results by a large margin.
