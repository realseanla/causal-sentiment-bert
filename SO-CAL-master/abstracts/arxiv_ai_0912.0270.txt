This document is a thesis on the subject of single-agent on-line path planning in continuous,unpredictable and highly dynamic environments.
The problem is finding and traversing a collision-free path for a holonomic robot, without kinodynamic restrictions, moving in an environment with several unpredictably moving obstacles or adversaries.
The availability of perfect information of the environment at all times is assumed.
