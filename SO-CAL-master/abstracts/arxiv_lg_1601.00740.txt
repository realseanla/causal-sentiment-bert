Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have made driving safer over the last decade.
They prepare vehicles for unsafe road conditions and alert drivers if they perform a dangerous maneuver.
However, many accidents are unavoidable because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late.
Anticipating maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the maneuver and also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger.
