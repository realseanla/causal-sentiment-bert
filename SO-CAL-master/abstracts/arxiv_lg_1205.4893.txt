The complexity of a computational problem is traditionally quantified based on the hardness of its worst case.
This approach has many advantages and has led to a deep and beautiful theory.
However, from the practical perspective, this leaves much to be desired.
In application areas, practically interesting instances very often occupy just a tiny part of an algorithm's space of instances, and the vast majority of instances are simply irrelevant.
Addressing these issues is a major challenge for theoretical computer science which may make theory more relevant to the practice of computer science.
