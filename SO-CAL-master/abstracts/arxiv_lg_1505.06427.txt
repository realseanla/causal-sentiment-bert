Recent research shows that deep neural networks (DNNs) can be used to extract deep speaker vectors (d-vectors) that preserve speaker characteristics and can be used in speaker verification.
This new method has been tested on text-dependent speaker verification tasks, and improvement was reported when combined with the conventional i-vector method.
