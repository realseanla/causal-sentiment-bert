Recent years have witnessed a new trend on building ontology-based question answering systems, that is to use semantic web information to provide more precise answers to users' queries.
However, these systems are mostly designed for English, therefore, we introduce in this paper such a system for Vietnamese, that is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one made for Vietnamese.
Different from most of previous works, we propose an approach that systematically builds a knowledge base of grammar rules for processing each input question into an intermediate representation element.
Then we take this element with respect to a target ontology by applying concept-matching techniques for returning an answer.
Experimental results show that the performance of the system on a wide range of Vietnamese questions is promising with accuracies of 84.1 percent and 82.4 percent for analyzing question and retrieving answer, respectively.
Furthermore, our approach to the question analysis can easily be applied to new domains and new languages, thus saving time and human effort.
