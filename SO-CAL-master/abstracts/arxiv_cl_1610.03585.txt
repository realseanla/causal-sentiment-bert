A distinguishing property of human intelligence is the ability to flexibly use language in order to communicate complex ideas with other humans in a variety of contexts.
Research in natural language dialogue should focus on designing communicative agents which can integrate themselves into these contexts and productively collaborate with humans.
In this abstract, we propose a general situated language learning paradigm which is designed to bring about robust language agents able to cooperate productively with humans.
