In this paper we explore the application of some notable Boolean methods, namely the Disjunctive Normal Form representation of logic table expansions, and apply them to a real-valued logic model which utilizes quantities on the range [0,1] to produce a probabilistic programming of a game character's logic in mathematical form.
