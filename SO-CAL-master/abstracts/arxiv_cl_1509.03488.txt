We infer semantic classes of verbs signaling modality from a purely syntactic classification of 637 German verbs by applying findings from linguistics about correspondences between verb meaning and syntax.
Our extensive evaluation of the semantic classification is based on a linking to three other lexical resources at the word sense level: to the German wordnet GermaNet and to the English resources VerbNet and FrameNet.
This way, we are able to perform a reproducible semantic characterization of the inferred German classes.
We also perform a corpus-based evaluation revealing that the frequencies of the classes in corpora of different genres are significantly different.
We will make the resulting bilingual resource of German-English semantically categorized verb classes publicly available.
