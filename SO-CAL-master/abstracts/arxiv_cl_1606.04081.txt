In this paper we propose a graph-community detection approach to identify cross-document relationships at the topic segment level.
Given a set of related documents, we automatically find these relationships by clustering segments with similar content (topics).
In this context, we study how different weighting mechanisms influence the discovery of word communities that relate to the different topics found in the documents.
Finally, we test different mapping functions to assign topic segments to word communities, determining which topic segments are considered equivalent.
