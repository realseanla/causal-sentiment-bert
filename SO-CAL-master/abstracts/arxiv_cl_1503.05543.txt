We explore the use of semantic word embeddings in text segmentation algorithms, including the C99 segmentation algorithm and new algorithms inspired by the distributed word vector representation.
By developing a general framework for discussing a class of segmentation objectives, we study the effectiveness of greedy versus exact optimization approaches and suggest a new iterative refinement technique for improving the performance of greedy strategies.
We compare our results to known benchmarks, using known metrics.
We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for an untrained method with our Content Vector Segmentation (CVS) on the Choi test set.
Finally, we apply the segmentation procedure to an in-the-wild dataset consisting of text extracted from scholarly articles in the arXiv.org database.
