In this paper, we describe an approach that enables an autonomous system to infer the semantics of a command (i.e.
a symbol sequence representing an action) in terms of the relations between changes in the observations and the action instances.
We present a method of how to induce a theory (i.e.
a semantic description) of the meaning of a command in terms of a minimal set of background knowledge.
The only thing we have is a sequence of observations from which we extract what kinds of effects were caused by performing the command.
This way, we yield a description of the semantics of the action and, hence, a definition.
