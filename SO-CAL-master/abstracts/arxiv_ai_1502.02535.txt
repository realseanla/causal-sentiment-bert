Reasoning semantically in first-order logic is notoriously a challenge.
This paper surveys a selection of {\em semantically-guided} or {\em model-based} methods that aim at meeting aspects of this challenge.
For first-order logic we touch upon {\em resolution-based} methods, {\em tableaux-based} methods, {\em DPLL-inspired} methods, and we give a preview of a new method called SGGS, for {\em Semantically-Guided Goal-Sensitive} reasoning.
For first-order theories we highlight {\em hierarchical} and {\em locality-based} methods, concluding with the recent {\em Model-Constructing satisfiability calculus}.
