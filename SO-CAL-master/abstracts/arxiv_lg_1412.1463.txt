The pre-image problem has to be solved during inference by most structured output predictors.
For string kernels, this problem corresponds to finding the string associated to a given input.
An algorithm capable of solving or finding good approximations to this problem would have many applications in computational biology and other fields.
This work uses a recent result on combinatorial optimization of linear predictors based on string kernels to develop, for the pre-image, a low complexity upper bound valid for many string kernels.
This upper bound is used with success in a branch and bound searching algorithm.
Applications and results in the discovery of druggable peptides are presented and discussed.
