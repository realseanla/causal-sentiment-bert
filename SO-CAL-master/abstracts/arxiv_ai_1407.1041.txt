In this paper we present a short history of logics: from particular cases of 2-symbol or numerical valued logic to the general case of n-symbol or numerical valued logic.
We show generalizations of 2-valued Boolean logic to fuzzy logic, also from the Kleene and Lukasiewicz 3-symbol valued logics or Belnap 4-symbol valued logic to the most general n-symbol or numerical valued refined neutrosophic logic.
Two classes of neutrosophic norm (n-norm) and neutrosophic conorm (n-conorm) are defined.
Examples of applications of neutrosophic logic to physics are listed in the last section.
Similar generalizations can be done for n-Valued Refined Neutrosophic Set, and respectively n- Valued Refined Neutrosopjhic Probability.
