The Why3 IDE and verification system facilitates the use of a wide range of Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers through a driver-based architecture.
We present Where4: a portfolio-based approach to discharge Why3 proof obligations.
We use data analysis and machine learning techniques on static metrics derived from program source code.
Our approach benefits software engineers by providing a single utility to delegate proof obligations to the solvers most likely to return a useful result.
It does this in a time-efficient way using existing Why3 and solver installations - without requiring low-level knowledge about SMT solver operation from the user.
