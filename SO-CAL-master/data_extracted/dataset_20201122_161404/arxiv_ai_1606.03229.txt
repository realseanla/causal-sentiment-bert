This paper proposes a model which aim is providing a more coherent framework for agents design.
We identify three closely related anthropo-centered domains working on separate functional levels.
Abstracting from human physiology, psychology, and philosophy we create the $P^3$ model to be used as a multi-tier approach to deal with complex class of problems.
The three layers identified in this model have been named PhysioComputing, MindComputing, and MetaComputing.
Several instantiations of this model are finally presented related to different IT areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed computing, software and service engineering.
