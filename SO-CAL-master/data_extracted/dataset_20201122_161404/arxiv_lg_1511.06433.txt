We show that a deep convolutional network with an architecture inspired by the models used in image recognition can yield accuracy similar to a long-short term memory (LSTM) network, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the standard Switchboard automatic speech recognition task.
Moreover, we demonstrate that merging the knowledge in the CNN and LSTM models via model compression further improves the accuracy of the convolutional model.
