We study the problem of prediction with expert advice when the number of experts in question may be extremely large or even infinite.
We devise an algorithm that obtains a tight regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon T + N + \sqrt{NT})$, where $N$ is the empirical $\epsilon$-covering number of the sequence of loss functions generated by the environment.
In addition, we present a hedging procedure that allows us to find the optimal $\epsilon$ in hindsight.
