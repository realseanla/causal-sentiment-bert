This paper describes a process for clustering concepts into chains from data presented randomly to an evaluating system.
There are a number of rules or guidelines that help the system to determine more accurately what concepts belong to a particular chain and what ones do not, but it should be possible to write these in a generic way.
This mechanism also uses a flat structure without any hierarchical path information, where the link between two concepts is made at the level of the concept itself.
It does not require related metadata, but instead, a simple counting mechanism is used.
Key to this is a count for both the concept itself and also the group or chain that it belongs to.
To test the possible success of the mechanism, concept chain parts taken randomly from a larger ontology were presented to the system, but only at a depth of 2 concepts each time.
That is - root concept plus a concept that it is linked to.
The results show that this can still lead to very variable structures being formed and can also accommodate some level of randomness.
