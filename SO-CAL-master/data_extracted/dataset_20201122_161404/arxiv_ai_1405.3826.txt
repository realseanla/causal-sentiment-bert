My research goal is to employ a parser generation algorithm based on the Earley parsing algorithm to the evaluation and compilation of queries to logic programs, especially to deductive databases.
By means of partial deduction, from a query to a logic program a parameterized automaton is to be generated that models the evaluation of this query.
This automaton can be compiled to executable code; thus we expect a speedup in runtime of query evaluation.
