Protein-protein interaction extraction is the key precondition of the construction of protein knowledge network, and it is very important for the research in the biomedicine.
This paper extracted directional protein-protein interaction from the biological text, using the SVM-based method.
Experiments were evaluated on the LLL05 corpus with good results.
The results show that dependency features are import for the protein-protein interaction extraction and features related to the interaction word are effective for the interaction direction judgment.
At last, we analyzed the effects of different features and planed for the next step.
