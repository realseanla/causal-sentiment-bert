Lasso, or $\ell^1$ regularized least squares, has been explored extensively for its remarkable sparsity properties.
It is shown in this paper that the solution to Lasso, in addition to its sparsity, has robustness properties: it is the solution to a robust optimization problem.
This has two important consequences.
First, robustness provides a connection of the regularizer to a physical property, namely, protection from noise.
This allows a principled selection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of Lasso that also yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different uncertainty sets.
