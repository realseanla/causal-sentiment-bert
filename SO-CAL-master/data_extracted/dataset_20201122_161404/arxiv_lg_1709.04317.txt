In this thesis, the uses of Artificial Immune Systems (AIS) in Machine learning is studded.
the thesis focus on some of immune inspired algorithms such as clonal selection algorithm and artificial immune network.
The effect of changing the algorithm parameter on its performance is studded.
Then a new immune inspired algorithm for unsupervised classification is proposed.
The new algorithm is based on clonal selection principle and named Unsupervised Clonal Selection Classification (UCSC).
The new proposed algorithm is almost parameter free.
The algorithm parameters are data driven and it adjusts itself to make the classification as fast as possible.
The performance of UCSC is evaluated.
The experiments show that the proposed UCSC algorithm has a good performance and more reliable.
