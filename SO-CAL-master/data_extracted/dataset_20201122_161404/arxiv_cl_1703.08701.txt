Maltese is a morphologically rich language with a hybrid morphological system which features both concatenative and non-concatenative processes.
This paper analyses the impact of this hybridity on the performance of machine learning techniques for morphological labelling and clustering.
In particular, we analyse a dataset of morphologically related word clusters to evaluate the difference in results for concatenative and nonconcatenative clusters.
We also describe research carried out in morphological labelling, with a particular focus on the verb category.
Two evaluations were carried out, one using an unseen dataset, and another one using a gold standard dataset which was manually labelled.
The gold standard dataset was split into concatenative and non-concatenative to analyse the difference in results between the two morphological systems.
