This paper presents a novel approach for modeling threaded discussions on social media using a graph-structured bidirectional LSTM which represents both hierarchical and temporal conversation structure.
In experiments with a task of predicting popularity of comments in Reddit discussions, the proposed model outperforms a node-independent architecture for different sets of input features.
Analyses show a benefit to the model over the full course of the discussion, improving detection in both early and late stages.
Further, the use of language cues with the bidirectional tree state updates helps with identifying controversial comments.
