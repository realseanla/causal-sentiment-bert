Multiple extensions of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been proposed recently to address the difficulty of storing information over long time periods.
In this paper, we experiment with the capacity of Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) to deal with these long-term dependencies on well-balanced strings of parentheses.
We show that not only does the NTM emulate a stack with its heads and learn an algorithm to recognize such words, but it is also capable of strongly generalizing to much longer sequences.
