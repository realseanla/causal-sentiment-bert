Speech analysis had been taken to a new level with the discovery of Reverse Speech (RS).
RS is the discovery of hidden messages, referred as reversals, in normal speech.
Works are in progress for exploiting the relevance of RS in different real world applications such as investigation, medical field etc.
In this paper we represent an innovative method for preparing a reliable Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document with the help of reverse speech.
As SRS act as the backbone for the successful completion of any project, a reliable method is needed to overcome the inconsistencies.
Using RS such a reliable method for SRS documentation was developed.
