In this paper, we explore the use of convolutional networks (ConvNets) for the purpose of cognate identification.
We compare our architecture with binary classifiers based on string similarity measures on different language families.
Our experiments show that convolutional networks achieve competitive results across concepts and across language families at the task of cognate identification.
