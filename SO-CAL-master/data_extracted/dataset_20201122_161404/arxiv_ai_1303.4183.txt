This paper presents capabilities of using genetic algorithms to find approximations of function extrema, which cannot be found using analytic ways.
To enhance effectiveness of calculations, algorithm has been parallelized using OpenMP library.
We gained much increase in speed on platforms using multithreaded processors with shared memory free access.
During analysis we used different modifications of genetic operator, using them we obtained varied evolution process of potential solutions.
Results allow to choose best methods among many applied in genetic algorithms and observation of acceleration on Yorkfield, Bloomfield, Westmere-EX and most recent Sandy Bridge cores.
