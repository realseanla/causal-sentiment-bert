We approach the challenging problem of generating highlights from sports broadcasts utilizing audio information only.
A language-independent, multi-stage classification approach is employed for detection of key acoustic events which then act as a platform for summarization of highlight scenes.
Objective results and human experience indicate that our system is highly efficient.
