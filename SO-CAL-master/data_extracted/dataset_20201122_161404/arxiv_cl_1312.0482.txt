This paper presents a novel semantic-based phrase translation model.
A pair of source and target phrases are projected into continuous-valued vector representations in a low-dimensional latent semantic space, where their translation score is computed by the distance between the pair in this new space.
The projection is performed by a multi-layer neural network whose weights are learned on parallel training data.
The learning is aimed to directly optimize the quality of end-to-end machine translation results.
Experimental evaluation has been performed on two Europarl translation tasks, English-French and German-English.
The results show that the new semantic-based phrase translation model significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical machine translation sys-tem, leading to a gain of 0.7-1.0 BLEU points.
