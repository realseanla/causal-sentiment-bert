This paper addresses the problem of learning a finite linear combination of operator-valued kernels.
We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with a lr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients.
We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinate descent procedure.
We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).
