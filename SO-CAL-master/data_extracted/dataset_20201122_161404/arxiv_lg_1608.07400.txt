We show that collaborative filtering can be viewed as a sequence prediction problem, and that given this interpretation, recurrent neural networks offer very competitive approach.
In particular we study how the long short-term memory (LSTM) can be applied to collaborative filtering, and how it compares to standard nearest neighbors and matrix factorization methods on movie recommendation.
We show that the LSTM is competitive in all aspects, and largely outperforms other methods in terms of item coverage and short term predictions.
