One of the major challenges of ECoG-based Brain-Machine Interfaces is the movement prediction of a human subject.
Several methods exist to predict an arm 2-D trajectory.
The fourth BCI Competition gives a dataset in which the aim is to predict individual finger movements (5-D trajectory).
The difficulty lies in the fact that there is no simple relation between ECoG signals and finger movement.
We propose in this paper to decode finger flexions using switching models.
This method permits to simplify the system as it is now described as an ensemble of linear models depending on an internal state.
We show that an interesting accuracy prediction can be obtained by such a model.
