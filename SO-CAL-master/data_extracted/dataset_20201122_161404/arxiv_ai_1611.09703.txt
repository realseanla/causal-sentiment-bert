We study methods for automated parsing of informal mathematical expressions into formal ones, a main prerequisite for deep computer understanding of informal mathematical texts.
We propose a context-based parsing approach that combines efficient statistical learning of deep parse trees with their semantic pruning by type checking and large-theory automated theorem proving.
We show that the methods very significantly improve on previous results in parsing theorems from the Flyspeck corpus.
