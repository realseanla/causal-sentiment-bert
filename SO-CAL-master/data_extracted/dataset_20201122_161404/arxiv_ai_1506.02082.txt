This report covers an intelligent decision support system (IDSS), which handles an efficient and effective way to rapidly inspect containerized cargos for defection.
Defection is either cargo exposure to radiation, physical damages such as holes, punctured surfaces, iron surface oxidation, etc.
The system uses a sorting array triangulation technique (SAT) and surface damage detection (SDD) to conduct the inspection.
This new technique saves time and money on finding damaged goods during transportation such that, instead of running $n$ inspections on $n$ containers, only 3 inspections per triangulation or a ratio of $3:n$ is required, assuming $n &gt; 3$ containers.
The damaged stack in the array is virtually detected contiguous to an actually-damaged cargo by calculating nearby distances of such cargos, delivering reliable estimates for the whole local stack population.
The estimated values on damaged, somewhat damaged and undamaged cargo stacks, are listed and profiled after being sorted by the program, thereby submitted to the manager for a final decision.
The report describes the problem domain and the implementation of the simulator prototype, showing how the system operates via software, hardware with/without human agents, conducting real-time inspections and management per se.
