We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly.
We introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also with non-uniform sampling.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the (highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset.
