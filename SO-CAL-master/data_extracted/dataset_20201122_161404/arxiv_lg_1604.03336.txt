In this paper, we introduce a new notion of algorithmic stability called typical stability.
When our goal is to release real-valued queries (statistics) computed over a dataset, this notion does not require the queries to be of bounded sensitivity -- a condition that is generally assumed under a standard notion of algorithmic stability known as differential privacy [DMNS06, Dwo06].
Instead, typical stability requires the output of the query, when computed on a dataset drawn from the underlying distribution, to be "well-concentrated" around its expected value with respect to that distribution.
Typical stability can also be motivated as an alternative definition for database privacy (in such case, we call it typical privacy).
Like differential privacy, this notion enjoys several important properties including robustness to post-processing and adaptive composition.
