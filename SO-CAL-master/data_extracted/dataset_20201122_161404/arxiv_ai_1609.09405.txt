We compare the effectiveness of four different syntactic CCG parsers for a semantic slot-filling task to explore how much syntactic supervision is required for downstream semantic analysis.
This extrinsic, task-based evaluation also provides a unique window into the semantics captured (or missed) by unsupervised grammar induction systems.
