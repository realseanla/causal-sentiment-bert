Binary Knapsack Problem (BKP) is to select a subset of an element (item) set with the highest value while keeping the total weight within the capacity of the knapsack.
This paper presents an integer programming model for a variation of BKP where the value of each element may depend on selecting or ignoring other elements.
Strengths of such Value-Related Dependencies are assumed to be imprecise and hard to specify.
To capture this imprecision, we have proposed modeling value-related dependencies using fuzzy graphs and their algebraic structure.
