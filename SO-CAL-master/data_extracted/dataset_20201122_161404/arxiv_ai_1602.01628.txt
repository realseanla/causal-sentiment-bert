This article generalizes object-oriented dynamic networks to the fuzzy case, which allows one to represent knowledge on objects and classes of objects that are fuzzy by nature and also to model their changes in time.
Within the framework of the approach described, a mechanism is proposed that makes it possible to acquire new knowledge on the basis of basic knowledge and considerably differs from well-known methods used in existing models of knowledge representation.
The approach is illustrated by an example of construction of a concrete fuzzy object-oriented dynamic network.
