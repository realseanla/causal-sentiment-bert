In this paper, we propose a simple, fast decoding algorithm that fosters diversity in neural generation.
The algorithm modifies the standard beam search algorithm by adding an inter-sibling ranking penalty, favoring choosing hypotheses from diverse parents.
We evaluate the proposed model on the tasks of dialogue response generation, abstractive summarization and machine translation.
We find that diverse decoding helps across all tasks, especially those for which reranking is needed.
