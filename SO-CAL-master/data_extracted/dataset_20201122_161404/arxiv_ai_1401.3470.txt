Thanks to recent advances, AI Planning has become the underlying technique for several applications.
Figuring prominently among these is automated Web Service Composition (WSC) at the "capability" level, where services are described in terms of preconditions and effects over ontological concepts.
A key issue in addressing WSC as planning is that ontologies are not only formal vocabularies; they also axiomatize the possible relationships between concepts.
Such axioms correspond to what has been termed "integrity constraints" in the actions and change literature, and applying a web service is essentially a belief update operation.
The reasoning required for belief update is known to be harder than reasoning in the ontology itself.
The support for belief update is severely limited in current planning tools.
