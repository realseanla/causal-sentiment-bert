Inventing targeted proof search strategies for specific problem sets is a difficult task.
State-of-the-art automated theorem provers (ATPs) such as E allow a large number of user-specified proof search strategies described in a rich domain specific language.
Several machine learning methods that invent strategies automatically for ATPs were proposed previously.
One of them is the Blind Strategymaker (BliStr), a system for automated invention of ATP strategies.
