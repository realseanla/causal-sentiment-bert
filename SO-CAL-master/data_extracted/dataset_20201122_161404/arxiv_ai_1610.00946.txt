Many fields are now snowed under with an avalanche of data, which raises considerable challenges for computer scientists.
Meanwhile, robotics (among other fields) can often only use a few dozen data points because acquiring them involves a process that is expensive or time-consuming.
How can an algorithm learn with only a few data points?
