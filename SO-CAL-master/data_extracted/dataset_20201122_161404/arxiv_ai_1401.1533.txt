In this work I propose the conjecture that, within a cognitive system, it is possible to represent only the structure of objects and phenomena of the external reality.
I suggest a methodology to handle the concepts of structure and scheme, and to carry out on them operations of structural analysis.
These operations will allow the first transitions from concrete to abstract representations.
With these tools, I suggest a definition for the concepts of rules and emergent phenomena.
I analyze some aspects of the concept of rule and I propose to distinguish between operational and associative rules.
I suggest that associative rules have a prevalent function in the cognitive activity.
I also propose a definition for the concept of problem.
I finally illustrate how to handle and finalize the cognitive activities.
