We investigate the relationship between the generalization of program completion defined in 1984 by Lloyd and Topor and the generalization of the stable model semantics introduced recently by Ferraris et al.
The main theorem can be used to characterize, in some cases, the general stable models of a logic program by a first-order formula.
The proof uses Truszczynski's stable model semantics of infinitary propositional formulas.
