Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are frequently used in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), but they are easily contaminated by artifacts and noises, so preprocessing must be done before they are fed into a machine learning algorithm for classification or regression.
Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited.
This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by making use of fuzzy sets.
Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality.
When used in LASSO and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 10.02-19.77 percent, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39-86.47 percent.
