In this paper, we improve the previously best known regret bound to achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy in oblivious adversarial bandits from $\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3}/\epsilon)}$ to $\mathcal{O}{(\sqrt{T} \ln T /\epsilon)}$.
This is achieved by combining a Laplace Mechanism with EXP3.
We show that though EXP3 is already differentially private, it leaks a linear amount of information in $T$.
However, we can improve this privacy by relying on its intrinsic exponential mechanism for selecting actions.
This allows us to reach $\mathcal{O}{(\sqrt{\ln T})}$-DP, with a regret of $\mathcal{O}{(T^{2/3})}$ that holds against an adaptive adversary, an improvement from the best known of $\mathcal{O}{(T^{3/4})}$.
This is done by using an algorithm that run EXP3 in a mini-batch loop.
Finally, we run experiments that clearly demonstrate the validity of our theoretical analysis.
