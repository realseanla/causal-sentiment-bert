LP relaxation-based message passing algorithms provide an effective tool for MAP inference over Probabilistic Graphical Models.
However, different LP relaxations often have different objective functions and variables of differing dimensions, which presents a barrier to effective comparison and analysis.
In addition, the computational complexity of LP relaxation-based methods grows quickly with the number of constraints.
Reducing the number of constraints without sacrificing the quality of the solutions is thus desirable.
