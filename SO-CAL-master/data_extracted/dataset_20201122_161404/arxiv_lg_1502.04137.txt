We give a new deterministic algorithm that non-adaptively learns a hidden hypergraph from edge-detecting queries.
All previous non-adaptive algorithms either run in exponential time or have non-optimal query complexity.
We give the first polynomial time non-adaptive learning algorithm for learning hypergraph that asks almost optimal number of queries.
