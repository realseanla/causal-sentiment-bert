We present research towards bridging the language gap between migrant workers in Qatar and medical staff.
In particular, we present the first steps towards the development of a real-world Hindi-English machine translation system for doctor-patient communication.
As this is a low-resource language pair, especially for speech and for the medical domain, our initial focus has been on gathering suitable training data from various sources.
We applied a variety of methods ranging from fully automatic extraction from the Web to manual annotation of test data.
Moreover, we developed a method for automatically augmenting the training data with synthetically generated variants, which yielded a very sizable improvement of more than 3 BLEU points absolute.
