Learning an algorithm from examples is a fundamental problem that has been widely studied.
Recently it has been addressed using neural networks, in particular by Neural Turing Machines (NTMs).
These are fully differentiable computers that use backpropagation to learn their own programming.
Despite their appeal NTMs have a weakness that is caused by their sequential nature: they cannot be parallelized and are are hard to train due to their large depth when unfolded.
