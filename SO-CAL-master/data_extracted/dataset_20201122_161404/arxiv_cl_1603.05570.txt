There are several major proposals for treating donkey anaphora such as discourse representation theory and the likes, or E-Type theories and the likes.
Every one of them works well for a set of specific examples that they use to demonstrate validity of their approaches.
As I show in this paper, however, they are not very generalisable and do not account for essentially the same problem that they remedy when it manifests in other examples.
I propose another logical approach.
I develoop logic that extends a recent, propositional gradual logic, and show that it can treat donkey anaphora generally.
I also identify and address a problem around the modern convention on existential import.
Furthermore, I show that Aristotle's syllogisms and conversion are realisable in this logic.
