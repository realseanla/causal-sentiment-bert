Previous works demonstrated that Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) by sentences extraction may be improved using sentence compression.
In this work we present a sentence compressions approach guided by level-sentence discourse segmentation and probabilistic language models (LM).
The results presented here show that the proposed solution is able to generate coherent summaries with grammatical compressed sentences.
The approach is simple enough to be transposed into other languages.
