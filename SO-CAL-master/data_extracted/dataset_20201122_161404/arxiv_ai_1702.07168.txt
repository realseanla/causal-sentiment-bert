Though the word cognitive has a wide range of meanings we define cognitive engineering as learning from brain to bolster engineering solutions.
However, giving an achievable framework to the process towards this has been a difficult task.
In this work we take the classic data information knowledge wisdom (DIKW) framework to set some achievable goals and sub-goals towards cognitive engineering.
A layered framework like DIKW aligns nicely with the layered structure of pre-frontal cortex.
And breaking the task into sub-tasks based on the layers also makes it easier to start developmental endeavours towards achieving the final goal of a brain-inspired system.
