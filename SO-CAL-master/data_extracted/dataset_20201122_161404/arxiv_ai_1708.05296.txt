A* is a best-first search algorithm for finding optimal-cost paths in graphs.
A* benefits significantly from parallelism because in many applications, A* is limited by memory usage, so distributed memory implementations of A* that use all of the aggregate memory on the cluster enable problems that can not be solved by serial, single-machine implementations to be solved.
We survey approaches to parallel A*, focusing on decentralized approaches to A* which partition the state space among processors.
We also survey approaches to parallel, limited-memory variants of A* such as parallel IDA*.
