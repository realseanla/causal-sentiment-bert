This article extends the method of Garriga et al.
for mining relevant rules to numerical attributes by extracting interval-based pattern rules.
We propose an algorithm that extracts such rules from numerical datasets using the interval-pattern approach from Kaytoue et al.
This algorithm has been implemented and evaluated on real datasets.
