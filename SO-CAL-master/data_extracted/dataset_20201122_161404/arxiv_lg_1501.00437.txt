It is well known that most of the common clustering objectives are NP-hard to optimize.
In practice, however, clustering is being routinely carried out.
One approach for providing theoretical understanding of this seeming discrepancy is to come up with notions of clusterability that distinguish realistically interesting input data from worst-case data sets.
The hope is that there will be clustering algorithms that are provably efficient on such 'clusterable' instances.
In other words, hope that "Clustering is difficult only when it does not matter" (CDNM thesis, for short).
