A family of regularization functionals is said to admit a linear representer theorem if every member of the family admits minimizers that lie in a fixed finite dimensional subspace.
In this paper, we show that a general class of extended real-valued regularization functionals admits a linear representer theorem if and only if the regularizer is a non-decreasing function of the norm.
In this way, we extend a recent characterization stating that such condition is necessary and sufficient for differentiable regularizers.
