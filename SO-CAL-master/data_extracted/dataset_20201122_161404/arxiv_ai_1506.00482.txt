This work is concerned with regular languages defined over large alphabets, either infinite or just too large to be expressed enumeratively.
We define a generic model where transitions are labeled by elements of a finite partition of the alphabet.
We then extend Angluin's L* algorithm for learning regular languages from examples for such automata.
We have implemented this algorithm and we demonstrate its behavior where the alphabet is a subset of the natural or real numbers.
We sketch the extension of the algorithm to a class of languages over partially ordered alphabets.
