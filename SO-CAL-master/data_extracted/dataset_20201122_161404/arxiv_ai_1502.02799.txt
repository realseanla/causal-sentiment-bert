Distilling from a knowledge base only the part that is relevant to a subset of alphabet, which is recognized as forgetting, has attracted extensive interests in AI community.
In standard propositional logic, a general algorithm of forgetting and its computation-oriented investigation in various fragments whose satisfiability are tractable are still lacking.
The paper aims at filling the gap.
After exploring some basic properties of forgetting in propositional logic, we present a resolution-based algorithm of forgetting for CNF fragment, and some complexity results about forgetting in Horn, renamable Horn, q-Horn, Krom, DNF and CNF fragments of propositional logic.
