This paper describes a technology to connect patients to information in the experiences of other patients by using the power of structured big data.
The approach, implemented in the Abzooba Smart Health Informatics Platform (SHIP),is to distill concepts of facts and expressions from conversations and discussions in health social media forums, and use those distilled concepts in connecting patients to experiences and insights that are highly relevant to them in particular.
We envision our work, in progress, to provide new and effective tools to exploit the richness of content in social media in health for outcomes research.
