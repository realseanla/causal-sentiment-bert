Background: Lung cancer was known as primary cancers and the survival rate of cancer is about 15 percent.
Early detection of lung cancer is the leading factor in survival rate.
All symptoms (features) of lung cancer do not appear until the cancer spreads to other areas.
It needs an accurate early detection of lung cancer, for increasing the survival rate.
For accurate detection, it need characterizes efficient features and delete redundancy features among all features.
Feature selection is the problem of selecting informative features among all features.
Materials and Methods: Lung cancer database consist of 32 patient records with 57 features.
This database collected by Hong and Youngand indexed in the University of California Irvine repository.
Experimental contents include the extracted from the clinical data and X-ray data, etc.
The data described 3 types of pathological lung cancers and all features are taking an integer value 0-3.
In our study, new method is proposed for identify efficient features of lung cancer.
It is based on Hyper-Heuristic.
Results: We obtained an accuracy of 80.63 percent using reduced 11 feature set.
The proposed method compare to the accuracy of 5 machine learning feature selections.
The accuracy of these 5 methods are 60.94, 57.81, 68.75, 60.94 and 68.75.
Conclusions: The proposed method has better performance with the highest level of accuracy.
Therefore, the proposed model is recommended for identifying an efficient symptom of Disease.
These finding are very important in health research, particularly in allocation of medical resources for patients who predicted as high-risks
