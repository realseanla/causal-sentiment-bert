MXNet is a multi-language machine learning (ML) library to ease the development of ML algorithms, especially for deep neural networks.
Embedded in the host language, it blends declarative symbolic expression with imperative tensor computation.
It offers auto differentiation to derive gradients.
MXNet is computation and memory efficient and runs on various heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices to distributed GPU clusters.
