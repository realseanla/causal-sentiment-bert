In this paper, we propose a method, learning with adversary, to learn a robust network.
Our method takes finding adversarial examples as its mediate step.
A new and simple way of finding adversarial examples are presented and experimentally shown to be more `efficient'.
Lastly, experimental results shows our learning method greatly improves the robustness of the learned network.
