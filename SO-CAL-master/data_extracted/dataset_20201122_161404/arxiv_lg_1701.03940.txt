This work presents a fast and scalable algorithm for incremental learning of Gaussian mixture models.
By performing rank-one updates on its precision matrices and determinants, its asymptotic time complexity is of \BigO{NKD^2} for $N$ data points, $K$ Gaussian components and $D$ dimensions.
The resulting algorithm can be applied to high dimensional tasks, and this is confirmed by applying it to the classification datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10.
Additionally, in order to show the algorithm's applicability to function approximation and control tasks, it is applied to three reinforcement learning tasks and its data-efficiency is evaluated.
