Inverse problems, such as denoising and source separation, are of great interest in audio and image processing.
The classical model-based approach uses problem domain knowledge to define an appropriate objective function requiring in general an iterative inference algorithm.
In the case of monoaural speech separation, we require robust signal models that integrate information across long temporal contexts while removing uninformative variability.
This is achieved with a pyramid of wavelet scattering operators, which generalizes Constant Q Transforms (CQT) with extra layers of convolution and complex modulus.
Learning Non-Negative Matrix Factorizations at different resolutions improves source separation results over fixed-resolution methods.
