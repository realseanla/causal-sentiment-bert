We present a simple and effective scheme for dependency parsing which is based on bidirectional-LSTMs (BiLSTMs).
Each sentence token is associated with a BiLSTM vector representing the token in its sentential context, and feature vectors are constructed by concatenating a few BiLSTM vectors.
The BiLSTM is trained jointly with the parser objective, resulting in very effective feature extractors for parsing.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by applying it to a greedy transition based parser as well as to a globally optimized graph-based parser.
The resulting parsers have very simple architectures, and match or surpass the state-of-the-art accuracies on English and Chinese.
