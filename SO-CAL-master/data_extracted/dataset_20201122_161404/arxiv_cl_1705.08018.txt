With the evolution of neural network based methods, automatic speech recognition (ASR) field has been advanced to a level where building an application with speech interface is a reality.
In spite of these advances, building a real-time speech recogniser faces several problems such as low recognition accuracy, domain constraint, and out-of-vocabulary words.
The low recognition accuracy problem is addressed by improving the acoustic model, language model, decoder and by rescoring the N-best list at the output of the decoder.
We are considering the N-best list rescoring approach to improve the recognition accuracy.
Most of the methods in the literature use the grammatical, lexical, syntactic and semantic connection between the words in a recognised sentence as a feature to rescore.
In this paper, we have tried to see the semantic relatedness between the words in a sentence to rescore the N-best list.
Semantic relatedness is computed using TransE~, a method for low dimensional embedding of a triple in a knowledge graph.
The novelty of the paper is the application of semantic web to automatic speech recognition.
