This papers shows that using separators, which is a pair of two complementary contractors, we can easily and efficiently solve the localization problem of a robot with sonar measurements in an unstructured environment.
We introduce separators associated with the Minkowski sum and the Minkowski difference in order to facilitate the resolution.
A test-case is given in order to illustrate the principle of the approach.
