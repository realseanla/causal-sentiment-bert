The Center of Gravity (COG) method is one of the most popular defuzzification techniques of fuzzy mathematics.
In earlier works the COG technique was properly adapted to be used as an assessment model (RFAM)and several variations of it (GRFAM, TFAM and TpFAM)were also constructed for the same purpose.
In this paper the outcomes of all these models are compared to the corresponding outcomes of a traditional assessment method of the bi-valued logic, the Grade Point Average (GPA) Index.
Examples are also presented illustrating our results.
