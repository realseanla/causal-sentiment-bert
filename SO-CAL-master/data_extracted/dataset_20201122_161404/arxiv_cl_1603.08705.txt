In this paper, we describe ROOT13, a supervised system for the classification of hypernyms, co-hyponyms and random words.
The system relies on a Random Forest algorithm and 13 unsupervised corpus-based features.
We evaluate it with a 10-fold cross validation on 9,600 pairs, equally distributed among the three classes and involving several Parts-Of-Speech (i.e.
adjectives, nouns and verbs).
When all the classes are present, ROOT13 achieves an F1 score of 88.3 percent, against a baseline of 57.6 percent (vector cosine).
When the classification is binary, ROOT13 achieves the following results: hypernyms-co-hyponyms (93.4 percent vs. 60.2 percent), hypernymsrandom (92.3 percent vs. 65.5 percent) and co-hyponyms-random (97.3 percent vs. 81.5 percent).
Our results are competitive with stateof-the-art models.
