Accurate and computationally efficient means for classifying human activities have been the subject of extensive research efforts.
Most current research focuses on extracting complex features to achieve high classification accuracy.
We propose a template selection approach based on Dynamic Time Warping, such that complex feature extraction and domain knowledge is avoided.
We demonstrate the predictive capability of the algorithm on both simulated and real smartphone data.
