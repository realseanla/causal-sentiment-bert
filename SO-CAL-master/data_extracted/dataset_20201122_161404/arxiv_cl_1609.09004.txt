We report on our system for the shared task on discriminating between similar languages (DSL 2016).
The system uses only byte representations in a deep residual network (ResNet).
The system, named ResIdent, is trained only on the data released with the task (closed training).
We obtain 84.88 percent accuracy on subtask A, 68.80 percent accuracy on subtask B1, and 69.80 percent accuracy on subtask B2.
A large difference in accuracy on development data can be observed with relatively minor changes in our network's architecture and hyperparameters.
We therefore expect fine-tuning of these parameters to yield higher accuracies.
