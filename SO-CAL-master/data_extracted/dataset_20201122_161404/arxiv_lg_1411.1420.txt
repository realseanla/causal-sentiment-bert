In this paper we formulate the framework of recovering a hidden orthonormal basis given access to a certain "Basis Encoding Function".
We describe the class of Basis Encoding Functions (BEF), such that their local maxima on the unit sphere are in one-to-one correspondence with the basis elements.
This description relies on a certain "hidden convexity" property of these functions.
A number of theoretical and practical problems of recent interest can be interpreted as recovering a hidden basis from potentially noisy observations.
Specifically, we show how our simple and general framework applies to Independent Component Analysis (ICA), tensor decompositions, spectral clustering and Gaussian mixture learning.
