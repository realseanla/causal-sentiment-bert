This paper reports on the comparison of the subject and object of verbs in their usage between phishing emails and legitimate emails.
The purpose of this research is to explore whether the syntactic structures and subjects and objects of verbs can be distinguishable features for phishing detection.
To achieve the objective, we have conducted two series of experiments: the syntactic similarity for sentences, and the subject and object of verb comparison.
The results of the experiments indicated that both features can be used for some verbs, but more work has to be done for others.
