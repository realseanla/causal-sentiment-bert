In this paper, we applied a dynamic model for manoeuvring targets in SIR particle filter algorithm for improving tracking accuracy of multiple manoeuvring targets.
In our proposed approach, a color distribution model is used to detect changes of target's model .
Our proposed approach controls deformation of target's model.
If deformation of target's model is larger than a predetermined threshold, then the model will be updated.
Global Nearest Neighbor (GNN) algorithm is used as data association algorithm.
We named our proposed method as Deformation Detection Particle Filter (DDPF) .
DDPF approach is compared with basic SIR-PF algorithm on real airshow videos.
Comparisons results show that, the basic SIR-PF algorithm is not able to track the manoeuvring targets when the rotation or scaling is occurred in target' s model.
However, DDPF approach updates target's model when the rotation or scaling is occurred.
Thus, the proposed approach is able to track the manoeuvring targets more efficiently and accurately.
