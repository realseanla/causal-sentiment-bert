Expectation for the emergence of higher functions is getting larger in the framework of end-to-end reinforcement learning using a recurrent neural network.
However, the emergence of "thinking" that is a typical higher function is difficult to realize because "thinking" needs non fixed-point, flow-type attractors with both convergence and transition dynamics.
Furthermore, in order to introduce "inspiration" or "discovery" in "thinking", not completely random but unexpected transition should be also required.
