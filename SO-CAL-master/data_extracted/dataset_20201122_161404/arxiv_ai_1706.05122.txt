We propose a novel embedding model that represents relationships among several elements in bibliographic information with high representation ability and flexibility.
Based on this model, we present a novel search system that shows the relationships among the elements in the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus.
The evaluation results show that our model can achieve a high prediction ability and produce reasonable search results.
