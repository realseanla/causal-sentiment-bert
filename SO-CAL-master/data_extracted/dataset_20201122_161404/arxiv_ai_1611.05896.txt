In this work, we explore a genre of puzzles ("image riddles") which involves a set of images and a question.
Answering these puzzles require both capabilities involving visual detection (including object, activity recognition) and, knowledge-based or commonsense reasoning.
We compile a dataset of over 3k riddles where each riddle consists of 4 images and a groundtruth answer.
The annotations are validated using crowd-sourced evaluation.
We also define an automatic evaluation metric to track future progress.
Our task bears similarity with the commonly known IQ tasks such as analogy solving, sequence filling that are often used to test intelligence.
