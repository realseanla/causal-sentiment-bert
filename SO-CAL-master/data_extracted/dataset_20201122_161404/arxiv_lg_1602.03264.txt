The convolutional neural network (ConvNet or CNN) is a powerful discriminative learning machine.
In this paper, we show that a generative random field model that we call generative ConvNet can be derived from the discriminative ConvNet.
The probability distribution of the generative ConvNet model is in the form of exponential tilting of a reference distribution.
Assuming re-lu non-linearity and Gaussian white noise reference distribution, we show that the generative ConvNet model contains a representational structure with multiple layers of binary activation variables.
The model is non-Gaussian, or more precisely, piecewise Gaussian, where each piece is determined by an instantiation of the binary activation variables that reconstruct the mean of the Gaussian piece.
The Langevin dynamics for synthesis is driven by the reconstruction error, and the corresponding gradient descent dynamics converges to a local energy minimum that is auto-encoding.
As for learning, we show that the contrastive divergence learning tends to reconstruct the observed images.
Finally, we show that the maximum likelihood learning algorithm can generate realistic natural images.
