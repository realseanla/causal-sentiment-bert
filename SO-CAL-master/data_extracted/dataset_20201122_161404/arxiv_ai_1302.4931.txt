The first contribution of this paper is the presentation of a Pavelka - like formulation of possibilistic logic in which the language is naturally enriched by two connectives which represent negation (eg) and a new type of conjunction (otimes).
The space of truth values for this logic is the lattice of possibility functions, that, from an algebraic point of view, forms a quantal.
A second contribution comes from the understanding of the new conjunction as the combination of tokens of information coming from different sources, which makes our language "dynamic".
A Gentzen calculus is presented, which is proved sound and complete with respect to the given semantics.
The problem of truth functionality is discussed in this context.
