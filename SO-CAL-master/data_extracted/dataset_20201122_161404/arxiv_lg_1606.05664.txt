In this paper, we study the support vector machine and introduced the notion of generalized support vector machine for classification of data.
We show that the problem of generalized support vector machine is equivalent to the problem of generalized variational inequality and establish various results for the existence of solutions.
Moreover, we provide various examples to support our results.
