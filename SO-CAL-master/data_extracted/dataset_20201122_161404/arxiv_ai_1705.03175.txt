We present a new social animal inspired emotional swarm intelligence technique.
This technique is used to solve a variant of the popular collective robots problem called foraging.
We show with a simulation study how simple interaction rules based on sensations like hunger and loneliness can lead to globally coherent emergent behavior which allows sensor constrained robots to solve the given problem
