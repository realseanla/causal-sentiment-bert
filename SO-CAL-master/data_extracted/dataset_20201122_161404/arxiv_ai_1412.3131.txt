The domain model is one of the important components used by adaptive learning systems to automatically generate customized courses for the learners.
In this paper our contribution is to propose a new tool for implementation of a domain model based on fuzzy relationships among concepts.
This tool allows the experts and teachers to find the best parameters in order to adapt the learners's differences.
