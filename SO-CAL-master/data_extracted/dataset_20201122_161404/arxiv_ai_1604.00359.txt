The bbob-biobj test suite contains 55 bi-objective functions in continuous domain which are derived from combining functions of the well-known single-objective noiseless bbob test suite.
Besides giving the actual function definitions and presenting their (known) properties, this documentation also aims at giving the rationale behind our approach in terms of function groups, instances, and potential objective space normalization.
