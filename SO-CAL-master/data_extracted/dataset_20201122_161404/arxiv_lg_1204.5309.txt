Exploiting a priori known structural information lies at the core of many image reconstruction methods that can be stated as inverse problems.
The synthesis model, which assumes that images can be decomposed into a linear combination of very few atoms of some dictionary, is now a well established tool for the design of image reconstruction algorithms.
An interesting alternative is the analysis model, where the signal is multiplied by an analysis operator and the outcome is assumed to be the sparse.
This approach has only recently gained increasing interest.
The quality of reconstruction methods based on an analysis model severely depends on the right choice of the suitable operator.
