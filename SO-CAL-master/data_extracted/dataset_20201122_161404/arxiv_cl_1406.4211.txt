In this paper we describe our contribution to the PoliInformatics 2014 Challenge on the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
We propose a state of the art technique to extract information from texts and provide different representations, giving first a static overview of the domain and then a dynamic representation of its main evolutions.
We show that this strategy provides a practical solution to some recent theories in social sciences that are facing a lack of methods and tools to automatically extract information from natural language texts.
