We provide a simple and efficient algorithm for computing the Euclidean projection of a point onto the capped simplex---a simplex with an additional uniform bound on each coordinate---together with an elementary proof.
Both the MATLAB and C++ implementations of the proposed algorithm can be downloaded at
