We introduce co-occurring directions sketching, a deterministic algorithm for approximate matrix product (AMM), in the streaming model.
We show that co-occuring directions achieves a better error bound for AMM than other randomized and deterministic approaches for AMM.
Co-occurring directions gives a $1 + \epsilon$ -approximation of the optimal low rank approximation of a matrix product.
Empirically our algorithm outperforms competing methods for AMM, for a small sketch size.
We validate empirically our theoretical findings and algorithms
