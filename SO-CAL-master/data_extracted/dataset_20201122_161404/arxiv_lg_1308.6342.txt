We introduce a new algorithm to learn the potentials of a large class of Markov Random Fields (MRFs) with exact and efficient inference.
If every node in the MRF has a bounded number of neighbors, the proposed algorithm has linear complexity in the number of nodes in the MRF.
For example, for a fully observed square lattice MRF, parameter estimation using the junction tree inference engine has exponential complexity, but our algorithm only has linear complexity.
Moreover, the algorithm is naturally parallel and hence applicable to large scale data modeling.
The algorithm applies to many practical MRFs of great interest, including 2D and 3D lattices, chimera models, and skip-chain conditional random fields.
