In this paper, we introduce a threshold free approach, motivated from Chinese Restaurant Process, for the purpose of cognate clustering.
We show that our approach yields similar results to a linguistically motivated cognate clustering system known as LexStat.
Our Chinese Restaurant Process system is fast and does not require any threshold and can be applied to any language family of the world.
