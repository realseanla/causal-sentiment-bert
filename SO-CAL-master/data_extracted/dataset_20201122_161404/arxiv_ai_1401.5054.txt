This paper studies the applicability of evolutionary algorithms, particularly, the evolution strategies family to estimation of a degradation parameter (referred as kappa parameter) for the shear design of reinforced concrete beams, a problem which have an expensive computational cost and highly relevant in the design of pillars and reinforced concrete structures, which however, has not been covered extensively in the present literature.
