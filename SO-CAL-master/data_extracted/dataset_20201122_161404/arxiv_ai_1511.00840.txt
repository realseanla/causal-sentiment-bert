Path planning is typically considered in Artificial Intelligence as a graph searching problem and R* is state-of-the-art algorithm tailored to solve it.
The algorithm decomposes given path finding task into the series of subtasks each of which can be easily (in computational sense) solved by well-known methods (such as A*).
Parameterized random choice is used to perform the decomposition and as a result R* performance largely depends on the choice of its input parameters.
In our work we formulate a range of assumptions concerning possible upper and lower bounds of R* parameters, their interdependency and their influence on R* performance.
Then we evaluate these assumptions by running a large number of experiments.
As a result we formulate a set of heuristic rules which can be used to initialize the values of R* parameters in a way that leads to algorithm's best performance.
