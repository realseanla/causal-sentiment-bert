This paper describes our deep learning-based approach to multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis as part of SemEval 2016 Task 5.
We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for both aspect extraction and aspect-based sentiment analysis.
We cast aspect extraction as a multi-label classification problem, outputting probabilities over aspects parameterized by a threshold.
To determine the sentiment towards an aspect, we concatenate an aspect vector with every word embedding and apply a convolution over it.
Our constrained system (unconstrained for English) achieves competitive results across all languages and domains, placing first or second in 5 and 7 out of 11 language-domain pairs for aspect category detection (slot 1) and sentiment polarity (slot 3) respectively, thereby demonstrating the viability of a deep learning-based approach for multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis.
