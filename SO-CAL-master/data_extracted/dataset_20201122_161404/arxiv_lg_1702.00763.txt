Given a non-convex function $f(x)$ that is an average of $n$ smooth functions, we design stochastic first-order methods to find its approximate stationary points.
The performance of our new methods depend on the smallest (negative) eigenvalue $-\sigma$ of the Hessian.
This parameter $\sigma$ captures how strongly non-convex $f(x)$ is, and is analogous to the strong convexity parameter for convex optimization.
