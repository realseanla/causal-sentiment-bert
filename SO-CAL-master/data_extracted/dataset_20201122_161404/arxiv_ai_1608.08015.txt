Explanations have been introduced in the previous century.
Their interest in reducing the search space is no longer questioned.
Yet, their efficient implementation into CSP solver is still a challenge.
In this paper, we introduce ESeR, an Event Selection Rules algorithm that filters events generated during propagation.
This dynamic selection enables an efficient computation of explanations for intelligent backtracking al- gorithms.
We show the effectiveness of our approach on the instances of the last three MiniZinc challenges
