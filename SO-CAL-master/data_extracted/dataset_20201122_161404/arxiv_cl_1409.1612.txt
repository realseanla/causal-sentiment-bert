The paper deals with word sense induction from lexical co-occurrence graphs.
We construct such graphs on large Russian corpora and then apply this data to cluster the results of Mail.ru search according to meanings of the query.
We compare different methods of performing such clustering and different source corpora.
Models of applying distributional semantics to big linguistic data are described.
