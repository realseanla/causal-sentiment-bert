In view of the paradigm shift that makes science ever more data-driven, in this thesis we propose a synthesis method for encoding and managing large-scale deterministic scientific hypotheses as uncertain and probabilistic data.
In the form of mathematical equations, hypotheses symmetrically relate aspects of the studied phenomena.
For computing predictions, however, deterministic hypotheses are used asymmetrically as functions.
We build upon Simon's notion of structural equations in order to extract the (so-called) causal ordering embedded in a hypothesis structure (set of mathematical equations).
