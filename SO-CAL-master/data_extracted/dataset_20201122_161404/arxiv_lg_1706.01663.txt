A classical problem in grammatical inference is to identify a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) from a set of positive and negative examples.
In this paper, we address the related - yet seemingly novel - problem of identifying a set of DFAs from examples that belong to different unknown simple regular languages.
We propose two methods based on compression for clustering the observed positive examples.
We apply our methods to a set of print jobs submitted to large industrial printers.
