Transforming constraint models is an important task in re- cent constraint programming systems.
User-understandable models are defined during the modeling phase but rewriting or tuning them is manda- tory to get solving-efficient models.
We propose a new architecture al- lowing to define bridges between any (modeling or solver) languages and to implement model optimizations.
This architecture follows a model- driven approach where the constraint modeling process is seen as a set of model transformations.
Among others, an interesting feature is the def- inition of transformations as concept-oriented rules, i.e.
based on types of model elements where the types are organized into a hierarchy called a metamodel.
