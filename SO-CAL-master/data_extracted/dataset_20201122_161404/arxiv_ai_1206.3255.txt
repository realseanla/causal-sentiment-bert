We introduce Church, a universal language for describing stochastic generative processes.
Church is based on the Lisp model of lambda calculus, containing a pure Lisp as its deterministic subset.
The semantics of Church is defined in terms of evaluation histories and conditional distributions on such histories.
Church also includes a novel language construct, the stochastic memoizer, which enables simple description of many complex non-parametric models.
We illustrate language features through several examples, including: a generalized Bayes net in which parameters cluster over trials, infinite PCFGs, planning by inference, and various non-parametric clustering models.
Finally, we show how to implement query on any Church program, exactly and approximately, using Monte Carlo techniques.
