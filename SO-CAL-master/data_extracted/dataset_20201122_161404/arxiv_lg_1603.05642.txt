The diverse world of machine learning applications has given rise to a plethora of algorithms and optimization methods, finely tuned to the smoothness, convexity, and other parameterizations of the objective.
In this paper we attempt to simplify and reduce the complexity of algorithm design for machine learning by reductions: we develop reductions that take a method developed for one setting and apply it to the entire spectrum of smoothness and strong-convexity found in practice.
