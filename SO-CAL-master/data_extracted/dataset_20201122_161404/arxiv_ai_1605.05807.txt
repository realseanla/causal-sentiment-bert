In a recent paper, we have shown that Plan Recognition over STRIPS can be formulated and solved using Classical Planning heuristics and algorithms.
In this work, we show that this formulation subsumes the standard formulation of Plan Recognition over libraries through a compilation of libraries into STRIPS theories.
The libraries correspond to AND/OR graphs that may be cyclic and where children of AND nodes may be partially ordered.
These libraries include Context-Free Grammars as a special case, where the Plan Recognition problem becomes a parsing with missing tokens problem.
Plan Recognition over the standard libraries become
