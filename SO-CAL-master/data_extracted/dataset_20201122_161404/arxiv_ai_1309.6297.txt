We introduce novel mathematical models and algorithms to generate (shortest or k different) explanations for biomedical queries, using answer set programming.
We implement these algorithms and integrate them in BIOQUERY-ASP.
We illustrate the usefulness of these methods with some complex biomedical queries related to drug discovery, over the biomedical knowledge resources PHARMGKB, DRUGBANK, BIOGRID, CTD, SIDER, DISEASE ONTOLOGY and ORPHADATA.
To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP).
