In this paper, we propose a dynamic shared context processing method based on DSC (Dynamic Shared Context) model, applied in an e-collaborative learning environment.
Firstly, we present the model.
This is a way to measure the relevance between events and roles in collaborative environments.
With this method, we can share the most appropriate event information for each role instead of sharing all information to all roles in a collaborative work environment.
Then, we apply and verify this method in our project with Google App supported e-learning collaborative environment.
During this experiment, we compared DSC method measured relevance of events and roles to manual measured relevance.
And we describe the favorable points from this comparison and our finding.
Finally, we discuss our future research of a hybrid DSC method to make dynamical information shared more effective in a collaborative work environment.
