A deep learning approach to reinforcement learning led to a general learner able to train on visual input to play a variety of arcade games at the human and superhuman levels.
Its creators at the Google DeepMind's team called the approach: Deep Q-Network (DQN).
We present an extension of DQN by "soft" and "hard" attention mechanisms.
Tests of the proposed Deep Attention Recurrent Q-Network (DARQN) algorithm on multiple Atari 2600 games show level of performance superior to that of DQN.
Moreover, built-in attention mechanisms allow a direct online monitoring of the training process by highlighting the regions of the game screen the agent is focusing on when making decisions.
