Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Set and -Logic were defined by the author in 1995 and published for the first time in 2007.
We extended the neutrosophic set respectively to Neutrosophic Overset {when some neutrosophic component is over 1}, Neutrosophic Underset {when some neutrosophic component is below 0}, and to Neutrosophic Offset {when some neutrosophic components are off the interval [0, 1], i.e.
some neutrosophic component over 1 and other neutrosophic component below 0}.
This is no surprise with respect to the classical fuzzy set/logic, intuitionistic fuzzy set/logic, or classical/imprecise probability, where the values are not allowed outside the interval [0, 1], since our real-world has numerous examples and applications of over-/under-/off-neutrosophic components.
For example, person working overtime deserves a membership degree over 1, while a person producing more damage than benefit to a company deserves a membership below 0.
Then, similarly, the Neutrosophic Logic/Measure/Probability/Statistics etc.
were extended to respectively Neutrosophic Over-/Under-/Off-Logic, -Measure, -Probability, -Statistics etc.
