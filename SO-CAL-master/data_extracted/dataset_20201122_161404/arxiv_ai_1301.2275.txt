We propose a new definition of actual causes, using structural equations to model counterfactuals.We show that the definitions yield a plausible and elegant account ofcausation that handles well examples which have caused problems forother definitions and resolves major difficulties in the traditionalaccount.
In a companion paper, we show how the definition of causality can beused to give an elegant definition of (causal) explanation.
