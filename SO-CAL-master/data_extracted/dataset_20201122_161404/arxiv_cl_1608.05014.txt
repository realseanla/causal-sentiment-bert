Recognizing various semantic relations between terms is crucial for many NLP tasks.
While path-based and distributional information sources are considered complementary, the strong results the latter showed on recent datasets suggested that the former's contribution might have become obsolete.
We follow the recent success of an integrated neural method for hypernymy detection (Shwartz et al., 2016) and extend it to recognize multiple relations.
We demonstrate that these two information sources are indeed complementary, and analyze the contributions of each source.
