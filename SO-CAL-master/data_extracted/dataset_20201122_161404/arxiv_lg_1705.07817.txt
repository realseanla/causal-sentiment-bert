This work focus on regression optimization problem with hierarchical interactions between variables, which is beyond the additive models in the traditional linear regression.
We investigate two different fashions in the literature to deal with this problem: "hierNet" and structural-sparsity regularization, and study their connections, then we propose a primal-dual proximal algorithm based on epigraphical projection to optimize the learning problem.
The experimental setting first highlight the improvement of the proposed procedure compare to state-of-the-art methods based on FISTA or ADMM and second we provide comparisons between the different hierarchical penalization.
The experiments are conducted both on the synthetic and real data.
