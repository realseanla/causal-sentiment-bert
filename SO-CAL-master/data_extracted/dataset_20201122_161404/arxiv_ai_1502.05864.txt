Here a novel idea to handle imprecise or vague set viz.
Pseudo fuzzy set has been proposed.
Pseudo fuzzy set is a triplet of element and its two membership functions.
Both the membership functions may or may not be dependent.
The hypothesis is that every positive sense has some negative sense.
So, one membership function has been considered as positive and another as negative.
Considering this concept, here the development of Pseudo fuzzy set and its property along with Pseudo fuzzy numbers has been discussed.
