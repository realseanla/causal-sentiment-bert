This article deals with plausible reasoning from incomplete knowledge about large-scale spatial properties.
The availableinformation, consisting of a set of pointwise observations,is extrapolated to neighbour points.
We make use of belief functions to represent the influence of the knowledge at a given point to another point; the quantitative strength of this influence decreases when the distance between both points increases.
These influences arethen aggregated using a variant of Dempster's rule of combination which takes into account the relative dependence between observations.
