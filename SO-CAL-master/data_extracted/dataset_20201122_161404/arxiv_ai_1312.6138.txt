Research on developing efficient and scalable ASP solvers can substantially benefit by the availability of data sets to experiment with.
KB_Bio_101 contains knowledge from a biology textbook, has been developed as part of Project Halo, and has recently become available for research use.
KB_Bio_101 is one of the largest KBs available in ASP and the reasoning with it is undecidable in general.
We give a description of this KB and ASP programs for a suite of queries that have been of practical interest.
We explain why these queries pose significant practical challenges for the current ASP solvers.
