The idea of dynamic move chains has been described in a preceding paper [6].
It allows the search tree to be forward-pruned, which is known to be dangerous, because that can remove important moves which would only be evaluated through a more exhaustive search process.
This paper has added to the forward-pruning technique, through the use of 'Move Tables' that can act in the same way as Transposition Tables, but for moves not positions.
They use an efficient memory structure and have put the design into the context of short or long-term memories.
These can allow the search to be broadened, making it more reliable and are relatively independent, allowing some configuration as to how much to use.
It has advanced some of the future work theory of the earlier paper and made more explicit where logical plans or more knowledge-based approaches might be applied.
