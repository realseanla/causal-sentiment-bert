We present results on combining supervised and unsupervised methods to ensemble multiple systems for two popular Knowledge Base Population (KBP) tasks, Cold Start Slot Filling (CSSF) and Tri-lingual Entity Discovery and Linking (TEDL).
We demonstrate that our combined system along with auxiliary features outperforms the best performing system for both tasks in the 2015 competition, several ensembling baselines, as well as the state-of-the-art stacking approach to ensembling KBP systems.
The success of our technique on two different and challenging problems demonstrates the power and generality of our combined approach to ensembling.
