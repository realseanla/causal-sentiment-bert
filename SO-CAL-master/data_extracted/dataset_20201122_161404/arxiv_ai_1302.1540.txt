We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with succinct representations.
We find that many problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE.
Of these, the probabilistic classes PP and NP^PP are likely to be of special interest in the field of uncertainty in artificial intelligence and are deserving of additional study.
These results suggest a fruitful direction of future algorithmic development.
