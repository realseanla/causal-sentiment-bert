We present the Civique system for emergency detection in urban areas by monitoring micro blogs like Tweets.
The system detects emergency related events, and classifies them into appropriate categories like "fire", "accident", "earthquake", etc.
We demonstrate our ideas by classifying Twitter posts in real time, visualizing the ongoing event on a map interface and alerting users with options to contact relevant authorities, both online and offline.
We evaluate our classifiers for both the steps, i.e., emergency detection and categorization, and obtain F-scores exceeding 70 percent and 90 percent, respectively.
We demonstrate Civique using a web interface and on an Android application, in realtime, and show its use for both tweet detection and visualization.
