Search engines today present results that are often oblivious to abrupt shifts in intent.
For example, the query `independence day' usually refers to a US holiday, but the intent of this query abruptly changed during the release of a major film by that name.
While no studies exactly quantify the magnitude of intent-shifting traffic, studies suggest that news events, seasonal topics, pop culture, etc account for 50 percent of all search queries.
This paper shows that the signals a search engine receives can be used to both determine that a shift in intent has happened, as well as find a result that is now more relevant.
We present a meta-algorithm that marries a classifier with a bandit algorithm to achieve regret that depends logarithmically on the number of query impressions, under certain assumptions.
We provide strong evidence that this regret is close to the best achievable.
Finally, via a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms prior approaches, particularly as the amount of intent-shifting traffic increases.
