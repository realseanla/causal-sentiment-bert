Arabic language and writing are now facing a resurgence of international normative solutions that challenge most of their local or network based operating principles.
Even if the multilingual digital coding solutions, especially those proposed by Unicode, have solved many difficulties of Arabic writing, the linguistic aspect is still in search of more adapted solutions.
Terminology is one of the sectors in which the Arabic language requires a deep modernization of its classical productivity models.
The normative approach, in particular that of the ISO TC37, is proposed as one of the solutions that would allow it to combine with international standards to better integrate the knowledge society under construction.
