The article contains a preliminary glance at balanced clustering problems.
Basic balanced structures and combinatorial balanced problems are briefly described.
A special attention is targeted to various balance/unbalance indices (including some new versions of the indices): by cluster cardinality, by cluster weights, by inter-cluster edge/arc weights, by cluster element structure (for element multi-type clustering).
Further, versions of optimization clustering problems are suggested (including multicriteria problem formulations).
Illustrative numerical examples describe calculation of balance indices and element multi-type balance clustering problems (including example for design of student teams).
