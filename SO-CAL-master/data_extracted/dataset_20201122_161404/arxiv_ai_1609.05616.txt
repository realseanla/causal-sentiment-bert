Bilattice-based triangle provides elegant algebraic structure for reasoning with vague and uncertain information.
But the truth and knowledge ordering of intervals in bilattice-based triangle can not deal with nonmonotonic reasoning and are not always intuitive.
In this work, we construct an alternative algebraic structure, namely poset-based triangle and we provide with proper logical connectives for this.
It as an enhancement of the bilattice-based triangle to handle nonmonotonicity in logical reasoning.
