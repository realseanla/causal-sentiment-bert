The fundamental laws of quantum world upsets the logical foundation of classic physics.
They are completely counter-intuitive with many bizarre behaviors.
However, this paper shows that they may make sense from the perspective of a general decision-optimization principle for cooperation.
This principle also offers a generalization of Nash equilibrium, a key concept in game theory, for better payoffs and stability of game playing.
