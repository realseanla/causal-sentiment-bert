In this paper, we attempt to classify tweets into root categories of the Amazon browse node hierarchy using a set of tweets with browse node ID labels, a much larger set of tweets without labels, and a set of Amazon reviews.
Examining twitter data presents unique challenges in that the samples are short (under 140 characters) and often contain misspellings or abbreviations that are trivial for a human to decipher but difficult for a computer to parse.
A variety of query and document expansion techniques are implemented in an effort to improve information retrieval to modest success.
