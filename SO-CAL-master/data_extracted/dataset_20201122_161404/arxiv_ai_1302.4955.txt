This is a working paper summarizing results of an ongoing research project whose aim is to uniquely characterize the uncertainty measure for the Dempster-Shafer Theory.
A set of intuitive axiomatic requirements is presented, some of their implications are shown, and the proof is given of the minimality of recently proposed measure AU among all measures satisfying the proposed requirements.
