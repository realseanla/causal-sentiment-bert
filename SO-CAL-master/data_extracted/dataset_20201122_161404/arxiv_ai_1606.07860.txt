The systematic modelling of dynamic spatial systems is a key requirement in a wide range of application areas such as commonsense cognitive robotics, computer-aided architecture design, dynamic geographic information systems.
We present ASPMT(QS), a novel approach and fully-implemented prototype for non-monotonic spatial reasoning --- a crucial requirement within dynamic spatial systems --- based on Answer Set Programming Modulo Theories (ASPMT).
