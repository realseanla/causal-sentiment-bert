The aim of the CTU Prague Relational Learning Repository is to support machine learning research with multi-relational data.
The repository currently contains 50 SQL databases hosted on a public MySQL server located at relational.fit.cvut.cz.
A searchable meta-database provides metadata (e.g., the number of tables in the database, the number of rows and columns in the tables, the number of foreign key constraints between tables).
