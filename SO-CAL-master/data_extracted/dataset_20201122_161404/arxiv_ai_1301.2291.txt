In this paper we compare three different architectures for the evaluation of influence diagrams: HUGIN, Shafer-Shenoy, and Lazy Evaluation architecture.
The computational complexity of the architectures are compared on the LImited Memory Influence Diagram (LIMID): a diagram where only the requiste information for the computation of the optimal policies are depicted.
Because the requsite information is explicitly represented in the LIMID the evaluation can take advantage of it, and significant savings in computational can be obtained.
In this paper we show how the obtained savings is considerably increased when the computations performed on the LIMID is according to the Lazy Evaluation scheme.
