A large part of the use of knowledge base systems is the interpretation of the output by the end-users and the interaction with these users.
Even during the development process visualisations can be a great help to the developer.
We created IDPD3 as a library to visualise models of logic theories.
IDPD3 is a new version of $ID^{P}_{Draw}$ and adds support for visualised interactive simulations.
