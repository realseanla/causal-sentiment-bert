In this paper, we extend the Maximum Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problem to {\L}ukasiewicz logic.
The MaxSAT problem for a set of formulae {\Phi} is the problem of finding an assignment to the variables in {\Phi} that satisfies the maximum number of formulae.
Three possible solutions (encodings) are proposed to the new problem: (1) Disjunctive Linear Relations (DLRs), (2) Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and (3) Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problem (WCSP).
Like its Boolean counterpart, the extended fuzzy MaxSAT will have numerous applications in optimization problems that involve vagueness.
