We define a problem theory from first principles.
We investigate the objects of this theory: problems, resolutions, and solutions.
We relate problem theory with set theory and with computing theory.
We find taxonomies for resolutions and for problems.
We build a hierarchy of resolvers: mechanism, adaptor, internalizer, learner, and subject.
We show that the problem theory is complete.
Finally, we propose a thesis: We are Turing complete subjects because we are the result of an evolution of resolvers of the survival problem.
