In many embedded systems, such as imaging sys- tems, the system has a single designated purpose, and same threads are executed repeatedly.
Profiling thread behavior, allows the system to allocate each thread its resources in a way that improves overall system performance.
We study an online resource al- locationproblem,wherearesourcemanagersimulta- neously allocates resources (exploration), learns the impact on the different consumers (learning) and im- proves allocation towards optimal performance (ex- ploitation).
We build on the rich framework of multi- armed bandits and present online and offline algo- rithms.
Through extensive experiments with both synthetic data and real-world cache allocation to threads we show the merits and properties of our al- gorithms
