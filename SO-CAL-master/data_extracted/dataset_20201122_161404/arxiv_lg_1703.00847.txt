In this article we present a method to reconstruct the interconnectedness of dynamically related stochastic processes, where the interactions are bi-directional and the underlying topology is a tree.
Our approach is based on multivariate Wiener filtering which recovers spurious edges apart from the true edges in the topology reconstruction.
The main contribution of this work is to show that all spurious links obtained using Wiener filtering can be eliminated if the underlying topology is a tree based on which we present a three stage network reconstruction procedure for trees.
We illustrate the effectiveness of the method developed by applying it on a typical distribution system of the electric grid.
