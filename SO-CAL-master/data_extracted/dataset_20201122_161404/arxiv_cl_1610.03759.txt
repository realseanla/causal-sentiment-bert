In this work we implement a training of a Language Model (LM), using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and GloVe word embeddings, introduced by Pennigton et al.
in [1].
The implementation is following the general idea of training RNNs for LM tasks presented in [2], but is rather using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [3] for a memory cell, and not the more commonly used LSTM [4].
