A broad variety of knowledge-based applications such as recommender, expert, planning or configuration systems usually operate on the basis of knowledge represented by means of some logical language.
Such a logical knowledge base (KB) enables intelligent behavior of such systems by allowing them to automatically reason, answer queries of interest or solve complex real-world problems.
Nowadays, where information acquisition comes at low costs and often happens automatically, the applied KBs are continuously growing in terms of size, information content and complexity.
These developments foster the emergence of errors in these KBs and thus pose a significant challenge on all people and tools involved in KB evolution, maintenance and application.
