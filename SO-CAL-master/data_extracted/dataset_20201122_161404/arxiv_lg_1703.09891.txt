Semantic segmentation requires a detailed labeling of image pixels by object category.
Information derived from local image patches is necessary to describe the detailed shape of individual objects.
However, this information is ambiguous and can result in noisy labels.
Global inference of image content can instead capture the general semantic concepts present.
We advocate that holistic inference of image concepts provides valuable information for detailed pixel labeling.
We propose a generic framework to leverage holistic information in the form of a LabelBank for pixel-level segmentation.
