Finding a good classifier is a multiobjective optimization problem with different error rates and the costs to be minimized.
The receiver operating characteristic is widely used in the machine learning community to analyze the performance of parametric classifiers or sets of Pareto optimal classifiers.
In order to directly compare two sets of classifiers the area (or volume) under the convex hull can be used as a scalar indicator for the performance of a set of classifiers in receiver operating characteristic space.
