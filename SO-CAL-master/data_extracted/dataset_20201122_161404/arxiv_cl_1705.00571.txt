This paper describes our participation in Task 5 track 2 of SemEval 2017 to predict the sentiment of financial news headlines for a specific company on a continuous scale between -1 and 1.
We tackled the problem using a number of approaches, utilising a Support Vector Regression (SVR) and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM).
We found an improvement of 4-6 percent using the LSTM model over the SVR and came fourth in the track.
We report a number of different evaluations using a finance specific word embedding model and reflect on the effects of using different evaluation metrics.
