We devise the Unit Commitment Nearest Neighbor (UCNN) algorithm to be used as a proxy for quickly approximating outcomes of short-term decisions, to make tractable hierarchical long-term assessment and planning for large power systems.
Experimental results on an updated version of IEEE-RTS96 show high accuracy measured on operational cost, achieved in run-times that are lower in several orders of magnitude than the traditional approach.
