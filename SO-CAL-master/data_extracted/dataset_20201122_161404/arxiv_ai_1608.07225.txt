The goal of our research was to enhance local search heuristics used to construct Latin Hypercube Designs.
First, we introduce the \textit{1D-move} perturbation to improve the space exploration performed by these algorithms.
Second, we propose a new evaluation function $\psi_{p,\sigma}$ specifically targeting the Maximin criterion.
