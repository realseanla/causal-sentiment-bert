Software capable of improving itself has been a dream of computer scientists since the inception of the field.
In this work we provide definitions for Recursively Self-Improving software, survey different types of self-improving software, review the relevant literature, analyze limits on computation restricting recursive self-improvement and introduce RSI Convergence Theory which aims to predict general behavior of RSI systems.
Finally, we address security implications from self-improving intelligent software.
