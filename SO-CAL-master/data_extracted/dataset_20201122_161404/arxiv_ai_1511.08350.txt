Sequential pattern mining (SPM) under gap constraint is a challenging task.
Many efficient specialized methods have been developed but they are all suffering from a lack of genericity.
The Constraint Programming (CP) approaches are not so effective because of the size of their encodings.
In[7], we have proposed the global constraint Prefix-Projection for SPM which remedies to this drawback.
However, this global constraint cannot be directly extended to support gap constraint.
In this paper, we propose the global constraint GAP-SEQ enabling to handle SPM with or without gap constraint.
GAP-SEQ relies on the principle of right pattern extensions.
Experiments show that our approach clearly outperforms both CP approaches and the state-of-the-art cSpade method on large datasets.
