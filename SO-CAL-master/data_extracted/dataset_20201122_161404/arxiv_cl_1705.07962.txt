Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer in order to build customized software, websites and mobile applications.
In this paper, we show that Deep Learning techniques can be leveraged to automatically generate code given a graphical user interface screenshot as input.
Our model is able to generate code targeting three different platforms (i.e.
iOS, Android and web-based technologies) from a single input image with over 77 percent of accuracy.
