This paper presents the InScript corpus (Narrative Texts Instantiating Script structure).
InScript is a corpus of 1,000 stories centered around 10 different scenarios.
Verbs and noun phrases are annotated with event and participant types, respectively.
Additionally, the text is annotated with coreference information.
The corpus shows rich lexical variation and will serve as a unique resource for the study of the role of script knowledge in natural language processing.
