We present in this paper an efficient approach for acoustic scene classification by exploring the structure of class labels.
Given a set of class labels, a category taxonomy is automatically learned by collectively optimizing a clustering of the labels into multiple meta-classes in a tree structure.
An acoustic scene instance is then embedded into a low-dimensional feature representation which consists of the likelihoods that it belongs to the meta-classes.
We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on two different datasets for the acoustic scene classification task, including the DCASE 2013 and LITIS Rouen datasets.
