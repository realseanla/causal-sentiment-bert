The goal of this paper is to present a scenario-based serious-game simulation platform that supports social training and coaching in the context of job interviews.
It relies on the use of virtual agents that are capable to react in real time to a human interlocutor's expressed affects, through the detection of non-verbal cues, their analysis and their interpretation in the context of the job interview situation.
Our system build affective states and beliefs about a real user in interaction with a virtual character.
To this end, we rely on real-time social cue recognition, communicative performance computation and affective computation/decision from the recruiter.
Indeed, building a credible job interview simulation with a reactive virtual agent requires to perceive the applicant in order to understand its reactions and adapt to his performance.
