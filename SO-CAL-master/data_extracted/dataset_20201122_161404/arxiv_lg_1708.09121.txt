The explanation of heterogeneous multivariate time series data is a central problem in many applications.
The problem requires two major data mining challenges to be addressed simultaneously: Learning models that are human-interpretable and mining of heterogeneous multivariate time series data.
The intersection of these two areas is not adequately explored in the existing literature.
To address this gap, we propose grammar-based decision trees and an algorithm for learning them.
Grammar-based decision tree extends decision trees with a grammar framework.
Logical expressions, derived from context-free grammar, are used for branching in place of simple thresholds on attributes.
The added expressivity enables support for a wide range of data types while retaining the interpretability of decision trees.
By choosing a grammar based on temporal logic, we show that grammar-based decision trees can be used for the interpretable classification of high-dimensional and heterogeneous time series data.
In addition to classification, we show how grammar-based decision trees can also be used for categorization, which is a combination of clustering and generating interpretable explanations for each cluster.
We apply grammar-based decision trees to analyze the classic Australian Sign Language dataset as well as categorize and explain near mid-air collisions to support the development of a prototype aircraft collision avoidance system.
