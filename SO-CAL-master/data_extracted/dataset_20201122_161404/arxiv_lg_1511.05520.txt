Traditional methods to tackle many music information retrieval tasks typically follow a two-step architecture: feature engineering followed by a simple learning algorithm.
In these "shallow" architectures, feature engineering and learning are typically disjoint and unrelated.
Additionally, feature engineering is difficult, and typically depends on extensive domain expertise.
