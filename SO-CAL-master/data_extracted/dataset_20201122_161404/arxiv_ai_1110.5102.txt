Scene understanding includes many related sub-tasks, such as scene categorization, depth estimation, object detection, etc.
Each of these sub-tasks is often notoriously hard, and state-of-the-art classifiers already exist for many of them.
These classifiers operate on the same raw image and provide correlated outputs.
It is desirable to have an algorithm that can capture such correlation without requiring any changes to the inner workings of any classifier.
