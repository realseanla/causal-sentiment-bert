Motivated by the amount of code that goes unidentified on the web, we introduce a practical method for algorithmically identifying the programming language of source code.
Our work is based on supervised learning and intelligent statistical features.
We also explored, but abandoned, a grammatical approach.
In testing, our implementation greatly outperforms that of an existing tool that relies on a Bayesian classifier.
