The most studied and most successful language models were developed and evaluated mainly for English and other close European languages, such as French, German, etc.
It is important to study applicability of these models to other languages.
The use of vector space models for Russian was recently studied for multiple corpora, such as Wikipedia, RuWac, lib.ru.
These models were evaluated against word semantic similarity task.
For our knowledge Twitter was not considered as a corpus for this task, with this work we fill the gap.
Results for vectors trained on Twitter corpus are comparable in accuracy with other single-corpus trained models, although the best performance is currently achieved by combination of multiple corpora.
