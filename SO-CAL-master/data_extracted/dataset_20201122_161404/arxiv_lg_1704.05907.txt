We propose a multi-view network for text classification.
Our method automatically creates various views of its input text, each taking the form of soft attention weights that distribute the classifier's focus among a set of base features.
For a bag-of-words representation, each view focuses on a different subset of the text's words.
Aggregating many such views results in a more discriminative and robust representation.
Through a novel architecture that both stacks and concatenates views, we produce a network that emphasizes both depth and width, allowing training to converge quickly.
Using our multi-view architecture, we establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on two benchmark tasks.
