Prepared domain specific datasets plays an important role to supervised learning approaches.
In this article a new sentence dataset for software quality-in-use is proposed.
Three experts were chosen to annotate the data using a proposed annotation scheme.
Then the data were reconciled in a (no match eliminate) process to reduce bias.
The Kappa, k statistics revealed an acceptable level of agreement; moderate to substantial agreement between the experts.
The built data can be used to evaluate software quality-in-use models in sentiment analysis models.
Moreover, the annotation scheme can be used to extend the current dataset.
