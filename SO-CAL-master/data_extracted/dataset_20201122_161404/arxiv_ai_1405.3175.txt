Efficient modeling of uncertain information in real world is still an open issue.
Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is one of the most commonly used methods.
However, the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory has the assumption that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other.
This condition can be violated in real applications, especially in linguistic decision making since the linguistic variables are not exclusive of each others essentially.
In this paper, a new theory, called as D numbers theory (DNT), is systematically developed to address this issue.
The combination rule of two D numbers is presented.
An coefficient is defined to measure the exclusive degree among the hypotheses in the framework of discernment.
The combination rule of two D numbers is presented.
If the exclusive coefficient is one which means that the hypothesis in the framework of discernment is exclusive of each other totally, the D combination is degenerated as the classical Dempster combination rule.
Finally, a linguistic variables transformation of D numbers is presented to make a decision.
A numerical example on linguistic evidential decision making is used to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed D numbers theory.
