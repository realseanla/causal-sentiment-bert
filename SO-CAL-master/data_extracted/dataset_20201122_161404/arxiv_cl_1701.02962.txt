Distinguishing between antonyms and synonyms is a key task to achieve high performance in NLP systems.
While they are notoriously difficult to distinguish by distributional co-occurrence models, pattern-based methods have proven effective to differentiate between the relations.
In this paper, we present a novel neural network model AntSynNET that exploits lexico-syntactic patterns from syntactic parse trees.
In addition to the lexical and syntactic information, we successfully integrate the distance between the related words along the syntactic path as a new pattern feature.
The results from classification experiments show that AntSynNET improves the performance over prior pattern-based methods.
