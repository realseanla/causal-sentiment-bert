While looking for abductive explanations of a given set of manifestations, an ordering between possible solutions is often assumed.
The complexity of finding/verifying optimal solutions is already known.
In this paper we consider the computational complexity of finding second-best solutions.
We consider different orderings, and consider also different possible definitions of what a second-best solution is.
