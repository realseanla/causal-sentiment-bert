Classification involves the learning of the mapping function that associates input samples to corresponding target label.
There are two major categories of classification problems: Single-label classification and Multi-label classification.
Traditional binary and multi-class classifications are sub-categories of single-label classification.
Several classifiers are developed for binary, multi-class and multi-label classification problems, but there are no classifiers available in the literature capable of performing all three types of classification.
In this paper, a novel online universal classifier capable of performing all the three types of classification is proposed.
Being a high speed online classifier, the proposed technique can be applied to streaming data applications.
The performance of the developed classifier is evaluated using datasets from binary, multi-class and multi-label problems.
The results obtained are compared with state-of-the-art techniques from each of the classification types.
