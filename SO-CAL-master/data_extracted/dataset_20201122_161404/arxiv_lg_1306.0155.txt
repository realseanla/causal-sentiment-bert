We consider an application of multi-armed bandits to internet advertising (specifically, to dynamic ad allocation in the pay-per-click model, with uncertainty on the click probabilities).
We focus on an important practical issue that advertisers are constrained in how much money they can spend on their ad campaigns.
This issue has not been considered in the prior work on bandit-based approaches for ad allocation, to the best of our knowledge.
