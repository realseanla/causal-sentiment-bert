We consider the problem of learning the canonical parameters specifying an undirected graphical model (Markov random field) from the mean parameters.
For graphical models representing a minimal exponential family, the canonical parameters are uniquely determined by the mean parameters, so the problem is feasible in principle.
The goal of this paper is to investigate the computational feasibility of this statistical task.
Our main result shows that parameter estimation is in general intractable: no algorithm can learn the canonical parameters of a generic pair-wise binary graphical model from the mean parameters in time bounded by a polynomial in the number of variables (unless RP = NP).
Indeed, such a result has been believed to be true (see the monograph by Wainwright and Jordan (2008)) but no proof was known.
