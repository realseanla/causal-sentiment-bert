Learning-assisted automated reasoning has recently gained popularity among the users of Isabelle/HOL, HOL Light, and Mizar.
In this paper, we present an add-on to the HOL4 proof assistant and an adaptation of the HOLyHammer system that provides machine learning-based premise selection and automated reasoning also for HOL4.
We efficiently record the HOL4 dependencies and extract features from the theorem statements, which form a basis for premise selection.
HOLyHammer transforms the HOL4 statements in the various TPTP-ATP proof formats, which are then processed by the ATPs.
We discuss the different evaluation settings: ATPs, accessible lemmas, and premise numbers.
We measure the performance of HOLyHammer on the HOL4 standard library.
The results are combined accordingly and compared with the HOL Light experiments, showing a comparably high quality of predictions.
The system directly benefits HOL4 users by automatically finding proofs dependencies that can be reconstructed by Metis.
