Sparse iterative methods, in particular first-order methods, are known to be among the most effective in solving large-scale two-player zero-sum extensive-form games.
The convergence rates of these methods depend heavily on the properties of the distance-generating function that they are based on.
We investigate the acceleration of first-order methods for solving extensive-form games through better design of the dilated entropy function---a class of distance-generating functions related to the domains associated with the extensive-form games.
By introducing a new weighting scheme for the dilated entropy function, we develop the first distance-generating function for the strategy spaces of sequential games that has no dependence on the branching factor of the player.
This result improves the convergence rate of several first-order methods by a factor of $\Omega(b^dd)$, where $b$ is the branching factor of the player, and $d$ is the depth of the game tree.
