Lexicon-Grammar tables constitute a large-coverage syntactic lexicon but they cannot be directly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications because they sometimes rely on implicit information.
In this paper, we introduce LGExtract, a generic tool for generating a syntactic lexicon for NLP from the Lexicon-Grammar tables.
It is based on a global table that contains undefined information and on a unique extraction script including all operations to be performed for all tables.
We also present an experiment that has been conducted to generate a new lexicon of French verbs and predicative nouns.
