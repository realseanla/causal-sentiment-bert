In this paper we present an unsupervised method to learn the weights with which the scores of multiple classifiers must be combined in classifier fusion settings.
We also introduce a novel metric for ranking instances based on an index which depends upon the rank of weighted scores of test points among the weighted scores of training points.
We show that the optimized index can be used for computing measures such as average precision.
Unlike most classifier fusion methods where a single weight is learned to weigh all examples our method learns instance-specific weights.
The problem is formulated as learning the weight which maximizes a clarity index; subsequently the index itself and the learned weights both are used separately to rank all the test points.
Our method gives an unsupervised method of optimizing performance on actual test data, unlike the well known stacking-based methods where optimization is done over a labeled training set.
Moreover, we show that our method is tolerant to noisy classifiers and can be used for selecting N-best classifiers.
