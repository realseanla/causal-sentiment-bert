This paper introduces the revival of the popular Ms. Pac-Man Versus Ghost Team competition.
We present an updated game engine with Partial Observability constraints, a new Multi-Agent Systems approach to developing Ghost agents and several sample controllers to ease the development of entries.
A restricted communication protocol is provided for the Ghosts, providing a more challenging environment than before.
The competition will debut at the IEEE Computational Intelligence and Games Conference 2016.
Some preliminary results showing the effects of Partial Observability and the benefits of simple communication are also presented.
