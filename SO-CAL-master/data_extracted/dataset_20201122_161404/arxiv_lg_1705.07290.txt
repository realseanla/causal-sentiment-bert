We address the problem of reconstructing sparse signals from noisy and compressive measurements using a feed-forward deep neural network (DNN) with an architecture motivated by the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA).
We maintain the weights and biases of the network links as prescribed by ISTA and model the nonlinear activation function using a linear expansion of thresholds (LET), which has been very successful in image denoising and deconvolution.
The optimal set of coefficients of the parametrized activation is learned over a training dataset containing measurement-sparse signal pairs, corresponding to a fixed sensing matrix.
For training, we develop an efficient second-order algorithm, which requires only matrix-vector product computations in every training epoch (Hessian-free optimization) and offers superior convergence performance than gradient-descent optimization.
Subsequently, we derive an improved network architecture inspired by FISTA, a faster version of ISTA, to achieve similar signal estimation performance with about 50 percent of the number of layers.
The resulting architecture turns out to be a deep residual network, which has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance in several visual recognition tasks.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed DNN architectures lead to 3 to 4 dB improvement in the reconstruction signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compared with the state-of-the-art sparse coding algorithms.
