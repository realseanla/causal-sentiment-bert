We explore the ability of word embeddings to capture both semantic and morphological similarity, as affected by the different types of linguistic properties (surface form, lemma, morphological tag) used to compose the representation of each word.
We train several models, where each uses a different subset of these properties to compose its representations.
By evaluating the models on semantic and morphological measures, we reveal some useful insights on the relationship between semantics and morphology.
