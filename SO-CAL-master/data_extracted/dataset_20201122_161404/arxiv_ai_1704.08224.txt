Wit is a quintessential form of rich inter-human interaction, and is often grounded in a specific situation (e.g., a comment in response to an event).
In this work, we attempt to build computational models that can produce witty descriptions for a given image.
Inspired by a cognitive account of humor appreciation, we employ linguistic wordplay, specifically puns.
We compare our approach against meaningful baseline approaches via human studies.
In a Turing test style evaluation, people find our model's description for an image to be wittier than a human's witty description 55 percent of the time!
