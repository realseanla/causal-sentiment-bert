In this work we show that the classification performance of high-dimensional structural MRI data with only a small set of training examples is improved by the usage of dimension reduction methods.
We assessed two different dimension reduction variants: feature selection by ANOVA F-test and feature transformation by PCA.
On the reduced datasets, we applied common learning algorithms using 5-fold cross-validation.
Training, tuning of the hyperparameters, as well as the performance evaluation of the classifiers was conducted using two different performance measures: Accuracy, and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC).
Our hypothesis is supported by experimental results.
