We present Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation (NADE) models, which are neu- ral network architectures applied to the problem of unsupervised distribution and density esitmation.
They leverage the probability product rule and a weight sharing scheme in- spired from restricted Boltzmann machines, to yield an estimator that is both tractable and has good generalization performance.
We discuss how they achieve competitive per- formance in modeling both binary and real-valued observations.
We also present how deep NADE models can be trained to be agnostic to the ordering of input dimensions used by the autoregressive product rule decomposition.
Finally, we also show how to exploit the topological structure of pixels in images using a deep convolutional architecture for NADE.
