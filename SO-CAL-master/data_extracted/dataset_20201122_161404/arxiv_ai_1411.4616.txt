This paper is aimed at providing a very first, more "global", systematic point of view with respect to possible conflict generation in CA-EN-like causal structures.
For simplicity, only the outermost level of graphs is taken into account.
Localization of the "conflict area", diagnostic preferences, and bases for systematic conflict generation are considered.
A notion of {\em Potential Conflict Structure} ({\em PCS}) constituting a basic tool for identification of possible conflicts is proposed and its use is discussed.
