This paper presents an approach to identify efficient techniques used in Web Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
Understanding SEO factors which can influence page ranking in search engine is significant for webmasters who wish to attract large number of users to their website.
Different from previous relevant research, in this study we developed an intelligent Meta search engine which aggregates results from various search engines and ranks them based on several important SEO parameters.
The research tries to establish that using more SEO parameters in ranking algorithms helps in retrieving better search results thus increasing user satisfaction.
Initial results generated from Meta search engine outperformed existing search engines in terms of better retrieved search results with high precision.
