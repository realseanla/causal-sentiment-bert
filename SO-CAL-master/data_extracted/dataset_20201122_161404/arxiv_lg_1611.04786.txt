We present AdversariaLib, an open-source python library for the security evaluation of machine learning (ML) against carefully-targeted attacks.
It supports the implementation of several attacks proposed thus far in the literature of adversarial learning, allows for the evaluation of a wide range of ML algorithms, runs on multiple platforms, and has multi-processing enabled.
The library has a modular architecture that makes it easy to use and to extend by implementing novel attacks and countermeasures.
It relies on other widely-used open-source ML libraries, including scikit-learn and FANN.
Classification algorithms are implemented and optimized in C/C++, allowing for a fast evaluation of the simulated attacks.
The package is distributed under the GNU General Public License v3, and it is available for download at
