We overview dataflow matrix machines as a Turing complete generalization of recurrent neural networks and as a programming platform.
We describe vector space of finite prefix trees with numerical leaves which allows us to combine expressive power of dataflow matrix machines with simplicity of traditional recurrent neural networks.
