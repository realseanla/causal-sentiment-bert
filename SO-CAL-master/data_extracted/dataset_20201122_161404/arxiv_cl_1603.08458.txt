Identifying topics of discussions in online health communities (OHC) is critical to various applications, but can be difficult because topics of OHC content are usually heterogeneous and domain-dependent.
In this paper, we provide a multi-class schema, an annotated dataset, and supervised classifiers based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and other models for the task of classifying discussion topics.
We apply the CNN classifier to the most popular breast cancer online community, and carry out a longitudinal analysis to show topic distributions and topic changes throughout members' participation.
Our experimental results suggest that CNN outperforms other classifiers in the task of topic classification, and that certain trajectories can be detected with respect to topic changes.
