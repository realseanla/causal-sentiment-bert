We report about significant enhancements of the complex algebraic geometry theorem proving subsystem in GeoGebra for automated proofs in Euclidean geometry, concerning the extension of numerous GeoGebra tools with proof capabilities.
As a result, a number of elementary theorems can be proven by using GeoGebra's intuitive user interface on various computer architectures including native Java and web based systems with JavaScript.
We also provide a test suite for benchmarking our results with 200 test cases.
