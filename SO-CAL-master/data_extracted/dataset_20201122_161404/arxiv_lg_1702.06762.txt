The idea of style transfer has largely only been explored in image-based tasks, which we attribute in part to the specific nature of loss functions used for style transfer.
We propose a general formulation of style transfer as an extension of generative adversarial networks, by using a discriminator to regularize a generator with an otherwise separate loss function.
We apply our approach to the task of learning to play chess in the style of a specific player, and present empirical evidence for the viability of our approach.
