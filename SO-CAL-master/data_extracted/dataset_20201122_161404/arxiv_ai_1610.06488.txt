An architecture of a new neuro-fuzzy system is proposed.
The basic idea of this approach is to tune both synaptic weights and membership functions with the help of the supervised learning and self-learning paradigms.
The approach to solving the problem has to do with evolving online neuro-fuzzy systems that can process data under uncertainty conditions.
The results prove the effectiveness of the developed architecture and the learning procedure.
