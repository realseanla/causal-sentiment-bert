A modification of the neo-fuzzy neuron is proposed (an extended neo-fuzzy neuron (ENFN)) that is characterized by improved approximating properties.
An adaptive learning algorithm is proposed that has both tracking and smoothing properties.
An ENFN distinctive feature is its computational simplicity compared to other artificial neural networks and neuro-fuzzy systems.
