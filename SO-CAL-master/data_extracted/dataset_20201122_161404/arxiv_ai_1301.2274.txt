In previous work cite{Ha98:Towards} we presented a case-based approach to eliciting and reasoning with preferences.
A key issue in this approach is the definition of similarity between user preferences.
We introduced the probabilistic distance as a measure of similarity on user preferences, and provided an algorithm to compute the distance between two partially specified {em value} functions.
This is for the case of decision making under {em certainty}.
In this paper we address the more challenging issue of computing the probabilistic distance in the case of decision making under{em uncertainty}.
We provide an algorithm to compute the probabilistic distance between two partially specified {em utility} functions.
We demonstrate the use of this algorithm with a medical data set of partially specified patient preferences,where none of the other existing distancemeasures appear definable.
Using this data set, we also demonstrate that the case-based approach to preference elicitation isapplicable in domains with uncertainty.
Finally, we provide a comprehensive analytical comparison of the probabilistic distance with some existing distance measures on preferences.
