In the literature, two series of models have been proposed to address prediction problems including classification and regression.
Simple models, such as generalized linear models, have ordinary performance but strong interpretability on a set of simple features.
The other series, including tree-based models, organize numerical, categorical and high dimensional features into a comprehensive structure with rich interpretable information in the data.
