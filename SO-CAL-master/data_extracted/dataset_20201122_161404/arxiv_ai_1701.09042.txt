Frequent itemset mining is a popular data mining technique.
Apriori, Eclat, and FP-Growth are among the most common algorithms for frequent itemset mining.
Considerable research has been performed to compare the relative performance between these three algorithms, by evaluating the scalability of each algorithm as the dataset size increases.
While scalability as data size increases is important, previous papers have not examined the performance impact of similarly sized datasets that contain different itemset characteristics.
This paper explores the effects that two dataset characteristics can have on the performance of these three frequent itemset algorithms.
To perform this empirical analysis, a dataset generator is created to measure the effects of frequent item density and the maximum transaction size on performance.
The generated datasets contain the same number of rows.
This provides some insight into dataset characteristics that are conducive to each algorithm.
The results of this paper's research demonstrate Eclat and FP-Growth both handle increases in maximum transaction size and frequent itemset density considerably better than the Apriori algorithm.
