Intersections constitute one of the most dangerous elements in road systems.
Traffic signals remain the most common way to control traffic at high-volume intersections and offer many opportunities to apply intelligent transportation systems to make traffic more efficient and safe.
This paper describes an automated method to estimate the temporal exposure of road users crossing the conflict zone to lateral collision with road users originating from a different approach.
This component is part of a larger system relying on video sensors to provide queue lengths and spatial occupancy that are used for real time traffic control and monitoring.
The method is evaluated on data collected during a real world experiment.
