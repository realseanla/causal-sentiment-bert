Motivated by the common academic problem of allocating papers to referees for conference reviewing we propose a novel mechanism for solving the assignment problem when we have a two sided matching problem with preferences from one side (the agents/reviewers) over the other side (the objects/papers) and both sides have capacity constraints.
The assignment problem is a fundamental problem in both computer science and economics with application in many areas including task and resource allocation.
We draw inspiration from multi-criteria decision making and voting and use order weighted averages (OWAs) to propose a novel and flexible class of algorithms for the assignment problem.
We show an algorithm for finding a $\Sigma$-OWA assignment in polynomial time, in contrast to the NP-hardness of finding an egalitarian assignment.
Inspired by this setting we observe an interesting connection between our model and the classic proportional multi-winner election problem in social choice.
