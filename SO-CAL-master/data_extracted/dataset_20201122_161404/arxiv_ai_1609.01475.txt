A mesoscopic approach to modeling pedestrian simulation with multiple exits is proposed in this paper.
A floor field based on Qlearning Algorithm is used.
Attractiveness of exits to pedestrian typically is based on shortest path.
However, several factors may influence pedestrian choice of exits.
Scenarios with multiple exits are presented and effect of Q-learning rewards system on navigation is investigated
