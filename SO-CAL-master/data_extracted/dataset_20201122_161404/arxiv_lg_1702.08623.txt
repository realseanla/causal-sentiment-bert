Process modeling and understanding is fundamental for advanced human-computer interfaces and automation systems.
Recent research focused on activity recognition, but little work has focused on process progress detection from sensor data.
We introduce a real-time, sensor-based system for modeling, recognizing and estimating the completeness of a process.
We implemented a multimodal CNN-LSTM structure to extract the spatio-temporal features from different sensory datatypes.
We used a novel deep regression structure for overall completeness estimation.
By combining process completeness estimation with a Gaussian mixture model, our system can predict the process phase using the estimated completeness.
We also introduce the rectified hyperbolic tangent (rtanh) activation function and conditional loss to help the training process.
Using the completeness estimation result and performance speed calculations, we also implemented an online estimator of remaining time.
We tested this system using data obtained from a medical process (trauma resuscitation) and sport events (swim competition).
Our system outperformed existing implementations for phase prediction during trauma resuscitation and achieved over 80 percent of process phase detection accuracy with less than 9 percent completeness estimation error and time remaining estimation error less than 18 percent of duration in both dataset.
