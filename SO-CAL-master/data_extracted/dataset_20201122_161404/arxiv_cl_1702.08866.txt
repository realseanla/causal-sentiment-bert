We present results of empirical studies on positive speech on Twitter.
By positive speech we understand speech that works for the betterment of a given situation, in this case relations between different communities in a conflict-prone country.
We worked with four Twitter data sets.
Through semi-manual opinion mining, we found that positive speech accounted for &lt; 1 percent of the data .
In fully automated studies, we tested two approaches: unsupervised statistical analysis, and supervised text classification based on distributed word representation.
We discuss benefits and challenges of those approaches and report empirical evidence obtained in the study.
