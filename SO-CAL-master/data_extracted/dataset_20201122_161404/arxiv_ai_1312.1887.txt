Drawing from research on computational models of argumentation (particularly the Carneades Argumentation System), we explore the graphical representation of arguments in a dispute; then, comparing two different traditions on the limits of the justification of decisions, and devising an intermediate, semi-formal, model, we also show that it can shed light on the theory of dispute resolution.
