This document is about the multi-document Von-Mises-Fisher mixture model with a Dirichlet prior, referred to as VMFMix.
VMFMix is analogous to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in that they can capture the co-occurrence patterns acorss multiple documents.
The difference is that in VMFMix, the topic-word distribution is defined on a continuous n-dimensional hypersphere.
Hence VMFMix is used to derive topic embeddings, i.e., representative vectors, from multiple sets of embedding vectors.
An efficient Variational Expectation-Maximization inference algorithm is derived.
The performance of VMFMix on two document classification tasks is reported, with some preliminary analysis.
