An initial study of surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms used to design vertical-axis wind turbines wherein candidate prototypes are evaluated under approximated wind tunnel conditions after being physically instantiated by a three-dimensional printer has recently been presented.
Unlike other approaches, such as computational fluid dynamics simulations, no mathematical formulations were used and no model assumptions were made.
This paper extends that work by exploring alternative surrogate modelling and evolutionary techniques.
The accuracy of various modelling algorithms used to estimate the fitness of evaluated individuals from the initial experiments is compared.
The effect of temporally windowing surrogate model training samples is explored.
A surrogate-assisted approach based on an enhanced local search is introduced; and alternative coevolution collaboration schemes are examined.
