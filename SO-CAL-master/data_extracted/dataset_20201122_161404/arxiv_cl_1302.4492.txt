Purpose: Terminology is the set of technical words or expressions used in specific contexts, which denotes the core concept in a formal discipline and is usually applied in the fields of machine translation, information retrieval, information extraction and text categorization, etc.
Bilingual terminology extraction plays an important role in the application of bilingual dictionary compilation, bilingual Ontology construction, machine translation and cross-language information retrieval etc.
This paper addresses the issues of monolingual terminology extraction and bilingual term alignment based on multi-level termhood.
