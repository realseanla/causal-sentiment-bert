PC(ID) extends propositional logic with inductive definitions: rule sets under the well-founded semantics.
Recently, a notion of relevance was introduced for this language.
This notion determines the set of undecided literals that can still influence the satisfiability of a PC(ID) formula in a given partial assignment.
The idea is that the PC(ID) solver can make decisions only on relevant literals without losing soundness and thus safely ignore irrelevant literals.
