This paper advances the state of the art in text understanding of medical guidelines by releasing two new annotated clinical guidelines datasets, and establishing baselines for using machine learning to extract condition-action pairs.
In contrast to prior work that relies on manually created rules, we report experiment with several supervised machine learning techniques to classify sentences as to whether they express conditions and actions.
We show the limitations and possible extensions of this work on text mining of medical guidelines.
