Topic modeling of streaming sensor data can be used for high level perception of the environment by a mobile robot.
In this paper we compare various Gibbs sampling strategies for topic modeling of streaming spatiotemporal data, such as video captured by a mobile robot.
Compared to previous work on online topic modeling, such as o-LDA and incremental LDA, we show that the proposed technique results in lower online and final perplexity, given the realtime constraints.
