We present two related methods for creating MasterPrints, synthetic fingerprints that a fingerprint verification system identifies as many different people.
Both methods start with training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on a set of real fingerprint images.
The generator network is then used to search for images that can be recognized as multiple individuals.
The first method uses evolutionary optimization in the space of latent variables, and the second uses gradient-based search.
Our method is able to design a MasterPrint that a commercial fingerprint system matches to 22 percent of all users in a strict security setting, and 75 percent of all users at a looser security setting.
