We present a framework that allows an observer to determine occluded portions of a structure by finding the maximum-likelihood estimate of those occluded portions consistent with visible image evidence and a consistency model.
Doing this requires determining which portions of the structure are occluded in the first place.
Since each process relies on the other, we determine a solution to both problems in tandem.
We extend our framework to determine confidence of one's assessment of which portions of an observed structure are occluded, and the estimate of that occluded structure, by determining the sensitivity of one's assessment to potential new observations.
We further extend our framework to determine a robotic action whose execution would allow a new observation that would maximally increase one's confidence.
