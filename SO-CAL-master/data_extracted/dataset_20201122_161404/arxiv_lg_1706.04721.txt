We consider the effect of introducing a curriculum of targets when training Boolean models on supervised Multi Label Classification (MLC) problems.
In particular, we consider how to order targets in the absence of prior knowledge, and how such a curriculum may be enforced when using meta-heuristics to train discrete non-linear models.
