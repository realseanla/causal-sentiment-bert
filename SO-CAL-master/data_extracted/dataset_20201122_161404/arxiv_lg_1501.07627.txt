Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) are high-dimensional vector representations of objects (eg., words, image parts), relations (eg., sentence structures), and sequences for use with machine learning algorithms.
They consist of a vector addition operator for representing a collection of unordered objects, a Binding operator for associating groups of objects, and a methodology for encoding complex structures.
