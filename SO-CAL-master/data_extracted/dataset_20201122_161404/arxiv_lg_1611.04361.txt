Sequence labeling architectures use word embeddings for capturing similarity, but suffer when handling previously unseen or rare words.
We investigate character-level extensions to such models and propose a novel architecture for combining alternative word representations.
By using an attention mechanism, the model is able to dynamically decide how much information to use from a word- or character-level component.
We evaluated different architectures on a range of sequence labeling datasets, and character-level extensions were found to improve performance on every benchmark.
In addition, the proposed attention-based architecture delivered the best results even with a smaller number of trainable parameters.
