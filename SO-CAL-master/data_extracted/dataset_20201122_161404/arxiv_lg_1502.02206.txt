Methods for learning to search for structured prediction typically imitate a reference policy, with existing theoretical guarantees demonstrating low regret compared to that reference.
This is unsatisfactory in many applications where the reference policy is suboptimal and the goal of learning is to improve upon it.
Can learning to search work even when the reference is poor?
