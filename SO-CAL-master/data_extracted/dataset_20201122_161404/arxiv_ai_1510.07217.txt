Stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms have exhibited great effectiveness in finding models of random instances of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).
As one of the most widely known and used SLS algorithm,WalkSAT plays a key role in the evolutions of SLS for SAT, and also hold state-ofthe- art performance on random instances.
This work proposes a novel implementation forWalkSAT which decreases the redundant calculations leading to a dramatically speeding up, thus dominates the latest version of WalkSAT including its advanced variants.
