This paper presents a comparison of classification methods for linguistic typology for the purpose of expanding an extensive, but sparse language resource: the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS) (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013).
We experimented with a variety of regression and nearest-neighbor methods for use in classification over a set of 325 languages and six syntactic rules drawn from WALS.
To classify each rule, we consider the typological features of the other five rules; linguistic features extracted from a word-aligned Bible in each language; and genealogical features (genus and family) of each language.
In general, we find that propagating the majority label among all languages of the same genus achieves the best accuracy in label pre- diction.
Following this, a logistic regression model that combines typological and linguistic features offers the next best performance.
Interestingly, this model actually outperforms the majority labels among all languages of the same family.
