This study describes the experimental application of Machine Learning techniques to build prediction models that can assess the injury risk associated with traffic accidents.
This work uses an freely available data set of traffic accident records that took place in the city of Porto Alegre/RS (Brazil) during the year of 2013.
This study also provides an analysis of the most important attributes of a traffic accident that could produce an outcome of injury to the people involved in the accident.
