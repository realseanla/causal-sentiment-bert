We investigate crowdsourcing algorithms for finding the top-quality item within a large collection of objects with unknown intrinsic quality values.
This is an important problem with many relevant applications, for example in networked recommendation systems.
The core of the algorithms is that objects are distributed to crowd workers, who return a noisy evaluation.
All received evaluations are then combined, to identify the top-quality object.
We first present a simple probabilistic model for the system under investigation.
Then, we devise and study a class of efficient adaptive algorithms to assign in an effective way objects to workers.
We compare the performance of several algorithms, which correspond to different choices of the design parameters/metrics.
We finally compare our approach based on scoring object qualities against traditional proposals based on comparisons and tournaments.
