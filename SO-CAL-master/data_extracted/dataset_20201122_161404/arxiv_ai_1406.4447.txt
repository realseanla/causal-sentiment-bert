In late 2011, Fado was elevated to the oral and intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO.
This study aims to develop a tool for automatic detection of Fado music based on the audio signal.
To do this, frequency spectrum-related characteristics were captured form the audio signal: in addition to the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and the energy of the signal, the signal was further analysed in two frequency ranges, providing additional information.
Tests were run both in a 10-fold cross-validation setup (97.6 percent accuracy), and in a traditional train/test setup (95.8 percent accuracy).
The good results reflect the fact that Fado is a very distinctive musical style.
