This paper aims at one-shot learning of deep neural nets, where a highly parallel setting is considered to address the algorithm calibration problem - selecting the best neural architecture and learning hyper-parameter values depending on the dataset at hand.
The notoriously expensive calibration problem is optimally reduced by detecting and early stopping non-optimal runs.
The theoretical contribution regards the optimality guarantees within the multiple hypothesis testing framework.
Experimentations on the Cifar10, PTB and Wiki benchmarks demonstrate the relevance of the approach with a principled and consistent improvement on the state of the art with no extra hyper-parameter.
