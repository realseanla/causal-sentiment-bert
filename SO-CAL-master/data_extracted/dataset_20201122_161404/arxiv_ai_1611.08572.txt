This paper discusses the semantics of weighted argumentation graphs that are biplor, i.e.
contain both attacks and support graphs.
The work builds on previous work by Amgoud, Ben-Naim et.
al., which presents and compares several semantics for argumentation graphs that contain only supports or only attacks relationships, respectively.
