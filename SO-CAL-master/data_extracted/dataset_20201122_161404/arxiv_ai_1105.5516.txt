We present PARIS, an approach for the automatic alignment of ontologies.
PARIS aligns not only instances, but also relations and classes.
Alignments at the instance-level cross-fertilize with alignments at the schema-level.
Thereby, our system provides a truly holistic solution to the problem of ontology alignment.
The heart of the approach is probabilistic.
This allows PARIS to run without any parameter tuning.
We demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm and its precision through extensive experiments.
In particular, we obtain a precision of around 80 percent in experiments with two of the world's largest ontologies.
