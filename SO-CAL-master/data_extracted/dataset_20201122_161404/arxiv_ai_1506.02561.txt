Frequent itemset mining is an essential part of data analysis and data mining.
Recent works propose interesting SAT-based encodings for the problem of discovering frequent itemsets.
Our aim in this work is to define strategies for adapting SAT solvers to such encodings in order to improve models enumeration.
In this context, we deeply study the effects of restart, branching heuristics and clauses learning.
We then conduct an experimental evaluation on SAT-Based itemset mining instances to show how SAT solvers can be adapted to obtain an efficient SAT model enumerator.
