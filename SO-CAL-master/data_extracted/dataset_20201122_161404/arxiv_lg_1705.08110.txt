This paper unifies two lines of work on multi-armed bandits, Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) and semi-bandits.
The former concerns scenarios with limited "resources" consumed by the algorithm, e.g., limited inventory in a dynamic pricing problem.
The latter has a huge number of actions, but there is combinatorial structure and additional feedback which makes the problem tractable.
Both lines of work has received considerable recent attention, and are supported by numerous application examples.
We define a common generalization, and design a general algorithm for this model.
Our regret rates are comparable with those for BwK and semi-bandits in general, and essentially optimal for important special cases.
