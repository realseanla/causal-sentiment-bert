Deep learning algorithm display powerful ability in Computer Vision area, in recent year, the CNN has been applied to solve problems in the subarea of Image-generating, which has been widely applied in areas such as photo editing, image design, computer animation, real-time rendering for large scale of scenes and for visual effects in movies.
However in the texture synthesize procedure.
The state-of-art CNN can not capture the spatial location of texture in image, lead to significant distortion after texture synthesize, we propose a new way to generating-image by adding the semantic segment step with deep learning algorithm as Pre-Processing and analyze the outcome.
