Bangla handwriting recognition is becoming a very important issue nowadays.
It is potentially a very important task specially for Bangla speaking population of Bangladesh and West Bengal.
By keeping that in our mind we are introducing a comprehensive Bangla handwritten character dataset named BanglaLekha-Isolated.
This dataset contains Bangla handwritten numerals, basic characters and compound characters.
This dataset was collected from multiple geographical location within Bangladesh and includes sample collected from a variety of aged groups.
This dataset can also be used for other classification problems i.e: gender, age, district.
This is the largest dataset on Bangla handwritten characters yet.
