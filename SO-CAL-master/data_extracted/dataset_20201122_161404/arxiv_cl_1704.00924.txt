Previous approaches to training syntax-based sentiment classification models required phrase-level annotated corpora, which are not readily available in many languages other than English.
Thus, we propose the use of tree-structured Long Short-Term Memory with an attention mechanism that pays attention to each subtree of the parse tree.
Experimental results indicate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in a Japanese sentiment classification task.
