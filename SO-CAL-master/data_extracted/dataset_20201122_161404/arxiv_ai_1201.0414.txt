In this paper, the continuity and strong continuity in domain-free information algebras and labeled information algebras are introduced respectively.
A more general concept of continuous function which is defined between two domain-free continuous information algebras is presented.
It is shown that, with the operations combination and focusing, the set of all continuous functions between two domain-free s-continuous information algebras forms a new s-continuous information algebra.
By studying the relationship between domain-free information algebras and labeled information algebras, it is demonstrated that they do correspond to each other on s-compactness.
