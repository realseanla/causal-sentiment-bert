Efficient use of multiple batteries is a practical problem with wide and growing application.
The problem can be cast as a planning problem under uncertainty.
We describe the approach we have adopted to modelling and solving this problem, seen as a Markov Decision Problem, building effective policies for battery switching in the face of stochastic load profiles.
