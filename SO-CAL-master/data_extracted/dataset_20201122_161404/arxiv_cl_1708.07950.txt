English to Indian language machine translation poses the challenge of structural and morphological divergence.
This paper describes English to Indian language statistical machine translation using pre-ordering and suffix separation.
The pre-ordering uses rules to transfer the structure of the source sentences prior to training and translation.
This syntactic restructuring helps statistical machine translation to tackle the structural divergence and hence better translation quality.
The suffix separation is used to tackle the morphological divergence between English and highly agglutinative Indian languages.
We demonstrate that the use of pre-ordering and suffix separation helps in improving the quality of English to Indian Language machine translation.
