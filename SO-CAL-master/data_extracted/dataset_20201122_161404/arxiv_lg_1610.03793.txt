A novel reinforcement learning benchmark, called Industrial Benchmark, is introduced.
The Industrial Benchmark aims at being be realistic in the sense, that it includes a variety of aspects that we found to be vital in industrial applications.
It is not designed to be an approximation of any real system, but to pose the same hardness and complexity.
