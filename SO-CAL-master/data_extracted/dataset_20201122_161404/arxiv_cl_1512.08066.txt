This paper describes the algorithm for translating English negative sentences into Korean in English-Korean Machine Translation (EKMT).
The proposed algorithm is based on the comparative study of English and Korean negative sentences.
The earlier translation software cannot translate English negative sentences into accurate Korean equivalents.
We established a new algorithm for the negative sentence translation and evaluated it.
