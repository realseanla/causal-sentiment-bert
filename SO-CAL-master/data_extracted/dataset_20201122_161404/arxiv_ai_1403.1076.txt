Our understanding of intelligence is primarily directed at the level of human beings.
This paper will attempt to give a more unifying definition that can be applied to everything that we know of.
The definition would be used more to verify intelligence, where a scale would also be required to measure how much.
A version of an accepted result of AI is then put forward as the acid test for Artificial Intelligence itself.
Recent work has been more from a direction of mechanical processes, where this paper will not try to refute the idea of intelligence, but only to put it in a more general context.
