This work presents and analyzes three convolutional neural network (CNN) models for efficient pixelwise classification of images.
When using convolutional neural networks to classify single pixels in patches of a whole image, a lot of redundant computations are carried out when using sliding window networks.
This set of new architectures solve this issue by either removing redundant computations or using fully convolutional architectures that inherently predict many pixels at once.
