\emph{Strongly adaptive algorithms} are algorithms whose performance on {\em every time interval} is close to optimal.
We present a reduction that can transform standard low-regret algorithms to strongly adaptive.
As a consequence, we derive simple, yet efficient, strongly adaptive algorithms for a handful of problems.
