Vector representation of sentences is important for many text processing tasks that involve clustering, classifying, or ranking sentences.
Recently, distributed representation of sentences learned by neural models from unlabeled data has been shown to outperform the traditional bag-of-words representation.
However, most of these learning methods consider only the content of a sentence and disregard the relations among sentences in a discourse by and large.
