We investigate different approaches to integrating object recognition and planning in a tabletop manipulation domain with the set of objects used in the 2012 RoboCup@Work competition.
Results of our preliminary experiments show that, with some approaches, close integration of perception and planning improves the quality of plans, as well as the computation times of feasible plans.
