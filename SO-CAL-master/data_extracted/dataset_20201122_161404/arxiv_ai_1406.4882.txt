In order to improve children speech therapy, we develop a Fuzzy Expert System based on a speech therapy guide.
This guide, write in natural language, was formalized using fuzzy logic paradigm.
In this manner we obtain a knowledge base with over 150 rules and 19 linguistic variables.
All these researches, including expert system validation, are part of TERAPERS project.
