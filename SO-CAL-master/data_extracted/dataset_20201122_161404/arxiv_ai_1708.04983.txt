T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) is a popular and prize-winning approach for dimensionality reduction and visualizing high-dimensional data.
However, tSNE is non-parametric: once visualization is built, tSNE is not designed to incorporate additional data into existing representation.
It highly limits the applicability of tSNE to the scenarios where data are added or updated over time (like dashboards or series of data snapshots).
