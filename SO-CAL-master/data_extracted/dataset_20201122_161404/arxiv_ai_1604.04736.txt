It is crucial to be able to negotiate successfully with heterogeneous opponents since opponents' negotiation strategy and behavior may vary in an open environment.
While one opponent might collaborate and concede over time, another may not be inclined to concede.
This paper analyzes the performance of recently proposed intra-team strategies for negotiation teams against different categories of opponents: competitors, matchers, and conceders.
Furthermore, it provides an extension of the negotiation tool Genius for negotiation teams in bilateral settings.
Consequently, this work facilitates research in negotiation teams.
