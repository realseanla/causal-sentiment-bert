In this work, we utilize a Trust Region based Derivative Free Optimization (DFO-TR) method to directly maximize the Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), which is a nonsmooth, noisy function.
We show that AUC is a smooth function, in expectation, if the distributions of the positive and negative data points obey a jointly normal distribution.
The practical performance of this algorithm is compared to three prominent Bayesian optimization methods and random search.
The presented numerical results show that DFO-TR surpasses Bayesian optimization and random search on various black-box optimization problem, such as maximizing AUC and hyperparameter tuning.
