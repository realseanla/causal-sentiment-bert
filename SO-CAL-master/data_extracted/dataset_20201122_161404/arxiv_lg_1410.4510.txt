Originally designed to model text, topic modeling has become a powerful tool for uncovering latent structure in domains including medicine, finance, and vision.
The goals for the model vary depending on the application: in some cases, the discovered topics may be used for prediction or some other downstream task.
In other cases, the content of the topic itself may be of intrinsic scientific interest.
