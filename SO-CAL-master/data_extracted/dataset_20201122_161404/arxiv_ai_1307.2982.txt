There is growing interest in representing image data and feature descriptors using compact binary codes for fast near neighbor search.
Although binary codes are motivated by their use as direct indices (addresses) into a hash table, codes longer than 32 bits are not being used as such, as it was thought to be ineffective.
We introduce a rigorous way to build multiple hash tables on binary code substrings that enables exact k-nearest neighbor search in Hamming space.
The approach is straightforward to implement and storage efficient.
Theoretical analysis shows that the algorithm exhibits sub-linear run-time behavior for uniformly distributed codes.
Empirical results show dramatic speed-ups over a linear scan baseline for datasets of up to one billion codes of 64, 128, or 256 bits.
