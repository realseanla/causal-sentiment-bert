The Stable Matching Problem with Couples (SMP-C) is a ubiquitous real-world extension of the stable matching problem (SMP) involving complementarities.
Although SMP can be solved in polynomial time, SMP-C is NP-Complete.
Hence, it is not clear which, if any, of the theoretical results surrounding the canonical SMP problem apply in this setting.
In this paper, we use a recently-developed SAT encoding to solve SMP-C exactly.
This allows us to enumerate all stable matchings for any given instance of SMP-C. With this tool, we empirically evaluate some of the properties that have been hypothesized to hold for SMP-C.
