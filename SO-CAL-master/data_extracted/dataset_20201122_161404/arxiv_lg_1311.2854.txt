Spectral clustering is arguably one of the most important algorithms in data mining and machine intelligence; however, its computational complexity makes challenging to use in large scale data analysis.
Recently, several approximation algorithms for spectral clustering have been developed in order to alleviate the relevant costs, but theoretical results are lacking.
In this paper, we present an approximation algorithm for spectral clustering with strong theoretical evidence of its performance.
Our algorithm is based on approximating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix using random projections, a.k.a randomized sketching.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approximation algorithm compares remarkably well to the exact algorithm.
