To find all extreme points of multimodal functions is called extremum problem, which is a well known difficult issue in optimization fields.
Applying ant colony optimization (ACO) to solve this problem is rarely reported.
The method of applying ACO to solve extremum problem is explored in this paper.
Experiment shows that the solution error of the method presented in this paper is less than 10^-8.
