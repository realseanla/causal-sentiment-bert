Traffic regulation must be respected by all vehicles, either human- or computer- driven.
However, extreme traffic situations might exhibit practical cases in which a vehicle should safely and reasonably relax traffic regulation, e.g., in order not to be indefinitely blocked and to keep circulating.
In this paper, we propose a high-level representation of an automated vehicle, other vehicles and their environment, which can assist drivers in taking such "illegal" but practical relaxation decisions.
This high-level representation (an ontology) includes topological knowledge and inference rules, in order to compute the next high-level motion an automated vehicle should take, as assistance to a driver.
Results on practical cases are presented.
