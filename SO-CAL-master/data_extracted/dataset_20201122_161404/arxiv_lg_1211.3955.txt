Calibration is a basic property for prediction systems, and algorithms for achieving it are well-studied in both statistics and machine learning.
In many applications, however, the predictions are used to make decisions that select which observations are made.
This makes calibration difficult, as adjusting predictions to achieve calibration changes future data.
We focus on click-through-rate (CTR) prediction for search ad auctions.
Here, CTR predictions are used by an auction that determines which ads are shown, and we want to maximize the value generated by the auction.
