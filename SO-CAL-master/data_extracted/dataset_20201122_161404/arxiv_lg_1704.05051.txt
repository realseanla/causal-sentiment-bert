Google has recently introduced the Cloud Vision API for image analysis.
According to the demonstration website, the API "quickly classifies images into thousands of categories, detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images."
It can be also used to "detect different types of inappropriate content from adult to violent content."
