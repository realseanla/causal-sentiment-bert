We describe the TempEval-3 task which is currently in preparation for the SemEval-2013 evaluation exercise.
The aim of TempEval is to advance research on temporal information processing.
TempEval-3 follows on from previous TempEval events, incorporating: a three-part task structure covering event, temporal expression and temporal relation extraction; a larger dataset; and single overall task quality scores.
