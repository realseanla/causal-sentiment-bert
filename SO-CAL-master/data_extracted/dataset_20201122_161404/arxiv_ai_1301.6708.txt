The paper is a second in a series of two papers evaluating the power of a new scheme that generates search heuristics mechanically.
The heuristics are extracted from an approximation scheme called mini-bucket elimination that was recently introduced.
The first paper introduced the idea and evaluated it within Branch-and-Bound search.
In the current paper the idea is further extended and evaluated within Best-First search.
The resulting algorithms are compared on coding and medical diagnosis problems, using varying strength of the mini-bucket heuristics.
