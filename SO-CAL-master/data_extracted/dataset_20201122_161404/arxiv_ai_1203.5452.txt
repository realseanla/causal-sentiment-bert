Decision making whenever and wherever it is happened is key to organizations success.
In order to make correct decision, individuals, teams and organizations need both knowledge management (to manage content) and collaboration (to manage group processes) to make that more effective and efficient.
In this paper, we explain the knowledge management and collaboration convergence.
Then, we propose a formal description of mixed and multimodal decision making (MDM) process where decision may be made by three possible modes: individual, collective or hybrid.
Finally, we explicit the MDM process based on UML-G profile.
