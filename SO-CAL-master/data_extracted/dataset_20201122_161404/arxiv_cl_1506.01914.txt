The quality and quantity of articles in each Wikipedia language varies greatly.
Translating from another Wikipedia is a natural way to add more content, but the translation process is not properly supported in the software used by Wikipedia.
Past computer-assisted translation tools built for Wikipedia are not commonly used.
We created a tool that adapts to the specific needs of an open community and to the kind of content in Wikipedia.
Qualitative and quantitative data indicates that the new tool helps users translate articles easier and faster.
