Controlling embodied agents with many actuated degrees of freedom is a challenging task.
We propose a method that can discover and interpolate between context dependent high-level actions or body-affordances.
These provide an abstract, low-dimensional interface indexing high-dimensional and time- extended action policies.
Our method is related to recent ap- proaches in the machine learning literature but is conceptually simpler and easier to implement.
More specifically our method requires the choice of a n-dimensional target sensor space that is endowed with a distance metric.
The method then learns an also n-dimensional embedding of possibly reactive body-affordances that spread as far as possible throughout the target sensor space.
