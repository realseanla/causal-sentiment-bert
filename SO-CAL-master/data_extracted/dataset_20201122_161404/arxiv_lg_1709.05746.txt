A modular method is proposed to learn and transfer visuo-motor policies from simulation to the real world in an efficient manner by combining domain randomization and adaptation.
The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a table-top object reaching task where a 7 DoF arm is controlled in velocity mode to reach a blue cuboid in clutter through visual observations.
The learned visuo-motor policies are robust to novel (not seen in training) objects in clutter and even a moving target, achieving a 93.3 percent success rate and 2.2 cm control accuracy.
