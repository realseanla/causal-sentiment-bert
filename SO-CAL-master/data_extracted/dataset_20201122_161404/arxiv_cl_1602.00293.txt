Language in social media is mostly driven by new words and spellings that are constantly entering the lexicon thereby polluting it and resulting in high deviation from the formal written version.
The primary entities of such language are the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.
In this paper, we study various sociolinguistic properties of the OOV words and propose a classification model to categorize them into at least six categories.
We achieve 81.26 percent accuracy with high precision and recall.
We observe that the content features are the most discriminative ones followed by lexical and context features.
