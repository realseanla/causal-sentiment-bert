The number $R(4,3,3)$ is often presented as the unknown Ramsey number with the best chances of being found "soon".
Yet, its precise value has remained unknown for almost 50 years.
This paper presents a methodology based on \emph{abstraction} and \emph{symmetry breaking} that applies to solve hard graph edge-coloring problems.
The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by using it to compute the value $R(4,3,3)=30$.
Along the way it is required to first compute the previously unknown set ${\cal R}(3,3,3;13)$ consisting of 78{,}892 Ramsey colorings.
