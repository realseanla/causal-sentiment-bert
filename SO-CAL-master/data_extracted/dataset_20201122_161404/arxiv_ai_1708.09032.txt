We consider the problem of rational uncertainty about unproven mathematical statements, which G\"odel and others have remarked on.
Using Bayesian-inspired arguments we build a normative model of fair bets under deductive uncertainty which diverges from probability theory per se but draws on the theory of algorithms.
We comment on connections to Zeilberger's notion of "semi-rigorous proofs", particularly that inherent subjectivity is an obstacle.
