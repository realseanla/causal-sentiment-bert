We take the generation of Chinese classical poem lines as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem, and build a novel system based on the RNN Encoder-Decoder structure to generate quatrains (Jueju in Chinese), with a topic word as input.
Our system can jointly learn semantic meaning within a single line, semantic relevance among lines in a poem, and the use of structural, rhythmical and tonal patterns, without utilizing any constraint templates.
Experimental results show that our system outperforms other competitive systems.
We also find that the attention mechanism can capture the word associations in Chinese classical poetry and inverting target lines in training can improve performance.
