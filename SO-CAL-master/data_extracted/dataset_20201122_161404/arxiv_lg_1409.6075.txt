This document discusses the Information Theoretically Efficient Model (ITEM), a computerized system to generate an information theoretically efficient multinomial logistic regression from a general dataset.
More specifically, this model is designed to succeed even where the logit transform of the dependent variable is not necessarily linear in the independent variables.
This research shows that for large datasets, the resulting models can be produced on modern computers in a tractable amount of time.
These models are also resistant to overfitting, and as such they tend to produce interpretable models with only a limited number of features, all of which are designed to be well behaved.
