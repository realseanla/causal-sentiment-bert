We observe a trend regarding restart strategies used in SAT solvers.
A few years ago, most state-of-the-art solvers restarted on average after a few thousands of backtracks.
Currently, restarting after a dozen backtracks results in much better performance.
The main reason for this trend is that heuristics and data structures have become more restart-friendly.
We expect further continuation of this trend, so future SAT solvers will restart even more rapidly.
Additionally, we present experimental results to support our observations.
