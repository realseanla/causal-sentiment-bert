Knowledge representation is a critical topic in AI, and currently embedding as a key branch of knowledge representation takes the numerical form of entities and relations to joint the statistical models.
However, most embedding methods merely concentrate on the triple fitting and ignore the explicit semantic expression, leading to an uninterpretable representation form.
Thus, traditional embedding methods do not only degrade the performance, but also restrict many potential applications.
For this end, this paper proposes a semantic representation method for knowledge graph \textbf{(KSR)}, which imposes a two-level hierarchical generative process that globally extracts many aspects and then locally assigns a specific category in each aspect for every triple.
Because both the aspects and categories are semantics-relevant, the collection of categories in each aspect is treated as the semantic representation of this triple.
Extensive experiments justify our model outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines in a substantial extent.
