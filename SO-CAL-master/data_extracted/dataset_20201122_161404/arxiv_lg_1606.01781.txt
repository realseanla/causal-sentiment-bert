The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neural networks, in particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks.
However, these architectures are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional networks which are very successful in computer vision.
We present a new architecture for text processing which operates directly on the character level and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations.
We are able to show that the performance of this model increases with the depth: using up to 29 convolutional layers, we report significant improvements over the state-of-the-art on several public text classification tasks.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that very deep convolutional nets have been applied to NLP.
