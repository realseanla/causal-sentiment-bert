How can we detect suspicious users in large online networks?
Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.)
can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales.
Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck.
Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users.
However, small-scale, stealthy attacks may go unnoticed due to the nature of low-rank eigenanalysis used in practice.
