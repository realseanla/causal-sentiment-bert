Given a teacher that holds a function $f:X\to R$ from some class of functions $C$.
The teacher can receive from the learner an element~$d$ in the domain $X$ (a query) and returns the value of the function in $d$, $f(d)\in R$.
The learner goal is to find $f$ with a minimum number of queries, optimal time complexity, and optimal resources.
