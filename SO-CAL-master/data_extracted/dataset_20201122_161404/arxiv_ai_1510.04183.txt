This article is an attempt to combine different ways of working with sets of objects and their classes for designing and development of artificial intelligent systems (AIS) of analysis information, using object-oriented programming (OOP).
This paper contains analysis of basic concepts of OOP and their relation with set theory and artificial intelligence (AI).
Process of sets and multisets creation from different sides, in particular mathematical set theory, OOP and AI is considered.
Definition of object and its properties, homogeneous and inhomogeneous classes of objects, set of objects, multiset of objects and constructive methods of their creation and classification are proposed.
In addition, necessity of some extension of existing OOP tools for the purpose of practical implementation AIS of analysis information, using proposed approach, is shown.
