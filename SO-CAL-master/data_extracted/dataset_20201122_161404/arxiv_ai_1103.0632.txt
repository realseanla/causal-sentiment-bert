The process-based semantic composition of Web Services is gaining a considerable momentum as an approach for the effective integration of distributed, heterogeneous, and autonomous applications.
To compose Web Services semantically, we need an ontology.
There are several ways of inserting semantics in Web Services.
One of them consists of using description languages like OWL-S.
In this paper, we introduce our work which consists in the proposition of a new model and the use of semantic matching technology for semantic and dynamic composition of ebXML business processes.
