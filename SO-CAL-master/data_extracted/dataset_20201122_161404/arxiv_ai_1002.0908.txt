Recently, Wang et al.
discussed the properties of fuzzy information systems under homomorphisms in the paper [C. Wang, D. Chen, L. Zhu, Homomorphisms between fuzzy information systems, Applied Mathematics Letters 22 (2009) 1045-1050], where homomorphisms are based upon the concepts of consistent functions and fuzzy relation mappings.
In this paper, we classify consistent functions as predecessor-consistent and successor-consistent, and then proceed to present more properties of consistent functions.
In addition, we improve some characterizations of fuzzy relation mappings provided by Wang et al.
