We present a pixel recursive super resolution model that synthesizes realistic details into images while enhancing their resolution.
A low resolution image may correspond to multiple plausible high resolution images, thus modeling the super resolution process with a pixel independent conditional model often results in averaging different details--hence blurry edges.
By contrast, our model is able to represent a multimodal conditional distribution by properly modeling the statistical dependencies among the high resolution image pixels, conditioned on a low resolution input.
We employ a PixelCNN architecture to define a strong prior over natural images and jointly optimize this prior with a deep conditioning convolutional network.
Human evaluations indicate that samples from our proposed model look more photo realistic than a strong L2 regression baseline.
