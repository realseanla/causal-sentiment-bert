LSTMs have become a basic building block for many deep NLP models.
In recent years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence models in general, and LSTMs in particular.
We propose and analyze a series of architectural modifications for LSTM networks resulting in improved performance for text classification datasets.
We observe compounding improvements on traditional LSTMs using Monte Carlo test-time model averaging, deep vector averaging (DVA), and residual connections, along with four other suggested modifications.
Our analysis provides a simple, reliable, and high quality baseline model.
