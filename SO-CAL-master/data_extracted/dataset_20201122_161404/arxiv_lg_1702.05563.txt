We show the equivalence of two state-of-the-art link prediction/knowledge graph completion methods: Nickel et al's holographic embedding and Trouillon et~al.
's complex embedding.
We first consider a spectral version of the holographic embedding, exploiting the frequency domain in the Fourier transform for efficient computation.
The analysis of the resulting method reveals that it can be viewed as an instance of the complex embedding with certain constraints cast on the initial vectors upon training.
Conversely, any complex embedding can be converted to an equivalent holographic embedding.
