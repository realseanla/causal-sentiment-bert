An important capability of autonomous multi-robot systems is to prevent collision among the individual robots.
One approach to this problem is to plan conflict-free trajectories and let each of the robots follow its pre-planned trajectory.
A widely used practical method for multi-robot trajectory planning is prioritized planning, which has been shown to be effective in practice, but is in general incomplete.
Formal analysis of instances that are provably solvable by prioritized planning is still missing.
Moreover, prioritized planning is a centralized algorithm, which may be in many situations undesirable.
