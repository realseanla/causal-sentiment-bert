Most modern systems strive to learn from interactions with users, and many engage in \emph{exploration}: making potentially suboptimal choices for the sake of acquiring new information.
We initiate a study of the interplay between \emph{exploration and competition}---how such systems balance the exploration for learning and the competition for users.
Here the users play three distinct roles: they are customers that generate revenue, they are sources of data for learning, and they are self-interested agents which choose among the competing systems.
