The analysis of online least squares estimation is at the heart of many stochastic sequential decision making problems.
We employ tools from the self-normalized processes to provide a simple and self-contained proof of a tail bound of a vector-valued martingale.
We use the bound to construct a new tighter confidence sets for the least squares estimate.
