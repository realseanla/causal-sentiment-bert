Many sensors/meters are deployed in commercial buildings to monitor and optimize their performance.
However, because sensor metadata is inconsistent across buildings, software-based solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor metadata conventions (i.e.
schemas and naming) for each building.
Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort.
