Recently there has been significant activity in developing algorithms with provable guarantees for topic modeling.
In standard topic models, a topic (such as sports, business, or politics) is viewed as a probability distribution $\vec a_i$ over words, and a document is generated by first selecting a mixture $\vec w$ over topics, and then generating words i.i.d.
from the associated mixture $A{\vec w}$.
Given a large collection of such documents, the goal is to recover the topic vectors and then to correctly classify new documents according to their topic mixture.
