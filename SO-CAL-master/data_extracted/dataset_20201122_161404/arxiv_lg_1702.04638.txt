In modern machine learning, pattern recognition replaces realtime semantic reasoning.
The mapping from input to output is learned with fixed semantics by training outcomes deliberately.
This is an expensive and static approach which depends heavily on the availability of a very particular kind of prior raining data to make inferences in a single step.
Conventional semantic network approaches, on the other hand, base multi-step reasoning on modal logics and handcrafted ontologies, which are {\em ad hoc}, expensive to construct, and fragile to inconsistency.
Both approaches may be enhanced by a hybrid approach, which completely separates reasoning from pattern recognition.
In this report, a quasi-linguistic approach to knowledge representation is discussed, motivated by spacetime structure.
Tokenized patterns from diverse sources are integrated to build a lightly constrained and approximately scale-free network.
This is then be parsed with very simple recursive algorithms to generate `brainstorming' sets of reasoned knowledge.
