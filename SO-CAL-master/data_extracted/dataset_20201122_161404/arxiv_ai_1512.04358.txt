Action languages have emerged as an important field of Knowledge Representation for reasoning about change and causality in dynamic domains.
This article presents Cerbere, a production system designed to perform online causal, temporal and epistemic reasoning based on the Event Calculus.
The framework implements the declarative semantics of the underlying logic theories in a forward-chaining rule-based reasoning system, coupling the high expressiveness of its formalisms with the efficiency of rule-based systems.
To illustrate its applicability, we present both the modeling of benchmark problems in the field, as well as its utilization in the challenging domain of smart spaces.
A hybrid framework that combines logic-based with probabilistic reasoning has been developed, that aims to accommodate activity recognition and monitoring tasks in smart spaces.
