This paper presents an approach combining lexico-semantic resources and distributed representations of words applied to the evaluation in machine translation (MT).
This study is made through the enrichment of a well-known MT evaluation metric: METEOR.
This metric enables an approximate match (synonymy or morphological similarity) between an automatic and a reference translation.
Our experiments are made in the framework of the Metrics task of WMT 2014.
We show that distributed representations are a good alternative to lexico-semantic resources for MT evaluation and they can even bring interesting additional information.
The augmented versions of METEOR, using vector representations, are made available on our Github page.
