Web Service is one of the most significant current discussions in information sharing technologies and one of the examples of service oriented processing.
To ensure accurate execution of web services operations, it must be adaptable with policies of the social networks in which it signs up.
This adaptation implements using controls called 'Commitment'.
This paper describes commitments structure and existing research about commitments and social web services, then suggests an algorithm for consistency of commitments in social web services.
As regards the commitments may be executed concurrently, a key challenge in web services execution based on commitment structure is consistency ensuring in execution time.
The purpose of this research is providing an algorithm for consistency ensuring between web services operations based on commitments structure.
