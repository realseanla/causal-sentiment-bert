We propose a general framework for inconsistency-tolerant query answering within existential rule setting.
This framework unifies the main semantics proposed by the state of art and introduces new ones based on cardinality and majority principles.
It relies on two key notions: modifiers and inference strategies.
An inconsistency-tolerant semantics is seen as a composite modifier plus an inference strategy.
We compare the obtained semantics from a productivity point of view.
