The historic background of algorithmic processing with regard to etymology and methodology is translated into terms of mathematical logic and Computer Science.
A formal logic structure is introduced by exemplaryquestions posed to Fiqh-chapters to define alogic query language.
As a foundation, ageneric algorithm for deciding Fiqh-rulings is designed to enable and further leverage rule of law (vs. rule by law) with full transparency and complete algorithmic coverage of Islamic law eventually providing legal security, legal equality, and full legal accountability.This is implemented by disentangling and reinstating classic Fiqh-methodology (usul al-Fiqh) with the expressive power of subsets of First Order Logic (FOL)sustainably substituting ad hoc reasoning with falsifiable rational argumentation.
The results are discussed in formal terms of completeness, decidability and complexity of formal Fiqh-systems.
AnEntscheidungsproblem for formal Fiqh-Systems is formulated and validated.
