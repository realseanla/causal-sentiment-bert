In this paper we present an extension of Peirce's existential graphs to provide a diagrammatic representation of expressions in Quantified Equilibrium Logic (QEL).
Using this formalisation, logical connectives are replaced by encircled regions (circles and squares) and quantified variables are represented as "identity" lines.
Although the expressive power is equivalent to that of QEL, the new representation can be useful for illustrative or educational purposes.
