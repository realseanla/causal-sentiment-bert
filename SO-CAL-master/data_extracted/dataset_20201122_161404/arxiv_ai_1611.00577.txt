In this article using Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm and simple additive weighting method the hybrid COAW algorithm is presented to solve multi-objective problems.
Cuckoo algorithm is an efficient and structured method for solving nonlinear continuous problems.
The created Pareto frontiers of the COAW proposed algorithm are exact and have good dispersion.
This method has a high speed in finding the Pareto frontiers and identifies the beginning and end points of Pareto frontiers properly.
In order to validation the proposed algorithm, several experimental problems were analyzed.
The results of which indicate the proper effectiveness of COAW algorithm for solving multi-objective problems.
