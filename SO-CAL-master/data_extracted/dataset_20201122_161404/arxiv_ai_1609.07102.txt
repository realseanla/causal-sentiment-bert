Annotating semantic data with metadata is becoming more and more important to provide information about the statements being asserted.
While initial solutions proposed a data model to represent a specific dimension of meta-information (such as time or provenance), the need for a general annotation framework which allows representing different context dimensions is needed.
In this paper, we extend the 4dFluents ontology by Welty and Fikes---on associating temporal validity to statements---to any dimension of context, and discuss possible issues that multidimensional context representations have to face and how we address them.
