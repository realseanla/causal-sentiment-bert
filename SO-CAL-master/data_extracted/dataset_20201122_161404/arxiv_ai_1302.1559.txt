In this paper we present some results obtained with a troupe of low-cost robots designed to cooperatively explore and adquire the map of unknown structured orthogonal environments.
In order to improve the covering of the explored zone, the robots show different behaviours and cooperate by transferring each other the perceived environment when they meet.
The returning robots deliver to a host computer their partial maps and the host incrementally generates the map of the environment by means of apossibility/ necessity grid.
