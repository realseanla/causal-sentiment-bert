Penalty logic, introduced by Pinkas, associates to each formula of a knowledge base the price to pay if this formula is violated.
Penalties may be used as a criterion for selecting preferred consistent subsets in an inconsistent knowledge base, thus inducing a non-monotonic inference relation.
A precise formalization and the main properties of penalty logic and of its associated non-monotonic inference relation are given in the first part.
We also show that penalty logic and Dempster-Shafer theory are related, especially in the infinitesimal case.
