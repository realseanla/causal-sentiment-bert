We present a novel distributed probabilistic bisection algorithm using social learning with application to target localization.
Each agent in the network first constructs a query about the target based on its local information and obtains a noisy response.
Agents then perform a Bayesian update of their beliefs followed by a local averaging of the log beliefs.
This two stage algorithm consisting of repeated querying and averaging runs until convergence.
We derive bounds on the rate of convergence of the beliefs at the correct target location.
Numerical simulations show that our method outperforms current state of the art methods.
