Algorithms of inference in a computer system oriented to input and semantic processing of text information are presented.
Such inference is necessary for logical questions when the direct comparison of objects from a question and database can not give a result.
The following classes of problems are considered: a check of hypotheses for persons and non-typical actions, the determination of persons and circumstances for non-typical actions, planning actions, the determination of event cause and state of persons.
To form an answer both deduction and plausible reasoning are used.
As a knowledge domain under consideration is social behavior of persons, plausible reasoning is based on laws of social psychology.
Proposed algorithms of inference and plausible reasoning can be realized in computer systems closely connected with text processing (criminology, operation of business, medicine, document systems).
