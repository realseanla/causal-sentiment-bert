We explore the design of a seamless broadcast communication system that brings together the distributed community of remote secondary education schools.
In contrast to higher education, primary and secondary education establishments should remain distributed, in order to maintain a balance of urban and rural life in the developing and the developed world.
We plan to deploy an ambient and social interactive TV platform (physical installation, authoring tools, interactive content) that supports social communication in a positive way.
In particular, we present the physical design and the conceptual model of the system.
