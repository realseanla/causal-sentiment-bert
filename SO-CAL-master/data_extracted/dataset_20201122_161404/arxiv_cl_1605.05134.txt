Twitter has become one of the main sources of news for many people.
As real-world events and emergencies unfold, Twitter is abuzz with hundreds of thousands of stories about the events.
Some of these stories are harmless, while others could potentially be life-saving or sources of malicious rumors.
Thus, it is critically important to be able to efficiently track stories that spread on Twitter during these events.
In this paper, we present a novel semi-automatic tool that enables users to efficiently identify and track stories about real-world events on Twitter.
We ran a user study with 25 participants, demonstrating that compared to more conventional methods, our tool can increase the speed and the accuracy with which users can track stories about real-world events.
