We consider packing LP's with $m$ rows where all constraint coefficients are normalized to be in the unit interval.
The n columns arrive in random order and the goal is to set the corresponding decision variables irrevocably when they arrive so as to obtain a feasible solution maximizing the expected reward.
Previous (1 - \epsilon)-competitive algorithms require the right-hand side of the LP to be Omega((m/\epsilon^2) log (n/\epsilon)), a bound that worsens with the number of columns and rows.
However, the dependence on the number of columns is not required in the single-row case and known lower bounds for the general case are also independent of n.
