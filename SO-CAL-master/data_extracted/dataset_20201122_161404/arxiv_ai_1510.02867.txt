When human agents come together to make decisions it is often the case that one human agent has more information than the other and this phenomenon is called information asymmetry and this distorts the market.
Often if one human agent intends to manipulate a decision in its favor the human agent can signal wrong or right information.
Alternatively, one human agent can screen for information to reduce the impact of asymmetric information on decisions.
With the advent of artificial intelligence, signaling and screening have been made easier.
This chapter studies the impact of artificial intelligence on the theory of asymmetric information.
It is surmised that artificial intelligent agents reduce the degree of information asymmetry and thus the market where these agents are deployed become more efficient.
It is also postulated that the more artificial intelligent agents there are deployed in the market the less is the volume of trades in the market.
This is because for trade to happen the asymmetry of information on goods and services to be traded should exist.
