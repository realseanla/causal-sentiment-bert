This manual outlines a fully automated liquid handling robot to enable physically-embodied evolution within a chemical oil-droplet system.
The robot is based upon the REPRAP3D printer system and makes the droplets by mixing chemicals and then placing them in a petri dish after which they are recorded using a camera and the behaviour of the droplets analysed using image recognition software.
This manual accompanies the open access publication published in Nature Communications DOI: 10.1038/ncomms6571.
