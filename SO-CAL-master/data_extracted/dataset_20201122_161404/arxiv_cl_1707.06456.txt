Selectional preferences have long been claimed to be essential for coreference resolution.
However, they are mainly modeled only implicitly by current coreference resolvers.
We propose a dependency-based embedding model of selectional preferences which allows fine-grained compatibility judgments with high coverage.
We show that the incorporation of our model improves coreference resolution performance on the CoNLL dataset, matching the state-of-the-art results of a more complex system.
However, it comes with a cost that makes it debatable how worthwhile such improvements are.
