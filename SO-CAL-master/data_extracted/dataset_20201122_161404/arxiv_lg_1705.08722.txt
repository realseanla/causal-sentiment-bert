In real-world classification tasks, it is difficult to collect samples of all possible categories of the environment in the training stage.
Therefore, the classifier should be prepared for unseen classes.
When an instance of an unseen class appears in the prediction stage, a robust classifier should have the ability to tell it is unseen, instead of classifying it to be any known category.
In this paper, adopting the idea of adversarial learning, we propose the ASG framework for open-category classification.
ASG generates positive and negative samples of seen categories in the unsupervised manner via an adversarial learning strategy.
With the generated samples, ASG then learns to tell seen from unseen in the supervised manner.
Experiments performed on several datasets show the effectiveness of ASG.
