How to model a pair of sentences is a critical issue in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as answer selection (AS), paraphrase identification (PI) and textual entailment (TE).
Most prior work (i) deals with one individual task by fine-tuning a specific system; (ii) models each sentence separately, without considering the impact of the other sentence; or (iii) relies fully on manually designed, task-specific linguistic features.
This work presents a general Attention Based Convolutional Neural Network (ABCNN) for modeling a pair of sentences.
We make three contributions.
(i) ABCNN can be applied to a wide variety of tasks that require modeling of sentence pairs.
(ii) We propose three attention schemes that integrate mutual influence between sentences into CNN; thus, the representation of each sentence takes into consideration its counterpart.
These interdependent sentence pair representations are more powerful than isolated sentence representations.
(iii) ABCNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on AS, PI and TE tasks.
