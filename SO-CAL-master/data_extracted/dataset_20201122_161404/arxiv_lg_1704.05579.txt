We introduce the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC), a large corpus for sarcasm research and for training and evaluating systems for sarcasm detection.
The corpus has 1.3 million sarcastic statements -- 10 times more than any previous dataset -- and many times more instances of non-sarcastic statements, allowing for learning in regimes of both balanced and unbalanced labels.
Each statement is furthermore self-annotated -- sarcasm is labeled by the author and not an independent annotator -- and provided with user, topic, and conversation context.
We evaluate the corpus for accuracy, compare it to previous related corpora, and provide baselines for the task of sarcasm detection.
