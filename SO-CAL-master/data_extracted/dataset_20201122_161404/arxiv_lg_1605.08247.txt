The "cvpaper.challenge" is a group composed of members from AIST, Tokyo Denki Univ.
(TDU), and Univ.
of Tsukuba that aims to systematically summarize papers on computer vision, pattern recognition, and related fields.
For this particular review, we focused on reading the ALL 602 conference papers presented at the CVPR2015, the premier annual computer vision event held in June 2015, in order to grasp the trends in the field.
Further, we are proposing "DeepSurvey" as a mechanism embodying the entire process from the reading through all the papers, the generation of ideas, and to the writing of paper.
