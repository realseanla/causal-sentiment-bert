Big Data streams are being generated in a faster, bigger, and more commonplace.
In this scenario, Hoeffding Trees are an established method for classification.
Several extensions exist, including high-performing ensemble setups such as online and leveraging bagging.
Also, $k$-nearest neighbors is a popular choice, with most extensions dealing with the inherent performance limitations over a potentially-infinite stream.
