Can we make Bayesian posterior MCMC sampling more efficient when faced with very large datasets?
We argue that computing the likelihood for N datapoints twice in order to reach a single binary decision is computationally inefficient.
We introduce an approximate Metropolis-Hastings rule based on a sequential hypothesis test which allows us to accept or reject samples with high confidence using only a fraction of the data required for the exact MH rule.
While this introduces an asymptotic bias, we show that this bias can be controlled and is more than offset by a decrease in variance due to our ability to draw more samples per unit of time.
We show that the same idea can also be applied to Gibbs sampling in densely connected graphs.
