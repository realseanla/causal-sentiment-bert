We investigate sequence machine learning techniques on raw radio signal time-series data.
By applying deep recurrent neural networks we learn to discriminate between several application layer traffic types on top of a constant envelope modulation without using an expert demodulation algorithm.
We show that complex protocol sequences can be learned and used for both classification and generation tasks using this approach.
