This paper describes an approach to the methodology of answer set programming (ASP) that can facilitate the design of encodings that are easy to understand and provably correct.
Under this approach, after appending a rule or a small group of rules to the emerging program we include a comment that states what has been "achieved" so far.
This strategy allows us to set out our understanding of the design of the program by describing the roles of small parts of the program in a mathematically precise way.
