This paper describes a novel approach to medical diagnosis based on the SP theory of computing and cognition.
The main attractions of this approach are: a format for representing diseases that is simple and intuitive; an ability to cope with errors and uncertainties in diagnostic information; the simplicity of storing statistical information as frequencies of occurrence of diseases; a method for evaluating alternative diagnostic hypotheses that yields true probabilities; and a framework that should facilitate unsupervised learning of medical knowledge and the integration of medical diagnosis with other AI applications.
