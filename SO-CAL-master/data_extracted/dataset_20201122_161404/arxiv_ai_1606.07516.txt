Gossip protocols aim at arriving, by means of point-to-point or group communications, at a situation in which all the agents know each other's secrets.
We consider distributed gossip protocols which are expressed by means of epistemic logic.
We provide an operational semantics of such protocols and set up an appropriate framework to argue about their correctness.
Then we analyze specific protocols for complete graphs and for directed rings.
