Topic Models have been reported to be beneficial for aspect-based sentiment analysis.
This paper reports a simple topic model for sarcasm detection, a first, to the best of our knowledge.
Designed on the basis of the intuition that sarcastic tweets are likely to have a mixture of words of both sentiments as against tweets with literal sentiment (either positive or negative), our hierarchical topic model discovers sarcasm-prevalent topics and topic-level sentiment.
Using a dataset of tweets labeled using hashtags, the model estimates topic-level, and sentiment-level distributions.
Our evaluation shows that topics such as `work', `gun laws', `weather' are sarcasm-prevalent topics.
Our model is also able to discover the mixture of sentiment-bearing words that exist in a text of a given sentiment-related label.
Finally, we apply our model to predict sarcasm in tweets.
We outperform two prior work based on statistical classifiers with specific features, by around 25\ percent.
