The Volterra series can be used to model a large subset of nonlinear, dynamic systems.
A major drawback is the number of coefficients required model such systems.
In order to reduce the number of required coefficients, Laguerre polynomials are used to estimate the Volterra kernels.
Existing literature proposes algorithms for a fixed number of Volterra kernels, and Laguerre series.
This paper presents a novel algorithm for generalized calculation of the finite order Volterra-Laguerre (VL) series for a MIMO system.
An example addresses the utility of the algorithm in practical application.
