Algorithm portfolios represent a strategy of composing multiple heuristic algorithms, each suited to a different class of problems, within a single general solver that will choose the best suited algorithm for each input.
This approach recently gained popularity especially for solving combinatoric problems, but optimization applications are still emerging.
The COCO platform of the BBOB workshop series is the current standard way to measure performance of continuous black-box optimization algorithms.
