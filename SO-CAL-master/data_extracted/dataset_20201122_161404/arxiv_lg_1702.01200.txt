A task of clustering data given in the ordinal scale under conditions of overlapping clusters has been considered.
It's proposed to use an approach based on memberhsip and likelihood functions sharing.
A number of performed experiments proved effectiveness of the proposed method.
The proposed method is characterized by robustness to outliers due to a way of ordering values while constructing membership functions.
