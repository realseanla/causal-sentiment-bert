A large amount of labeled data is required for supervised learning.
However, labeling by domain experts is expensive and time-consuming.
A low cost and high efficiency way to obtain large training datasets is to aggregate noisy labels collected from non-professional crowds.
Prior works have proposed confusion matrices to evaluate the reliability of workers.
In this paper, we redefine the structure of the confusion matrices and propose two Bayesian Network based methods which utilize item difficulty in label aggregation.
We assume that labels are generated by a probability distribution over confusion matrices, item difficulties, labels and true labels.
We use Markov chain Monte Carlo method to generate samples from the posterior distribution of model parameters and then infer the results.
To avoid bad local optima, we design a method to preliminarily predict the difficulty of each item and initialize the model parameters.
We also introduce how to improve the scalability of our model.
Empirical results show that our methods consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods.
