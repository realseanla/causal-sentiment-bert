We present a new platform, "Regulus Lite", which supports rapid development and web deployment of several types of phrasal speech translation systems using a minimal formalism.
A distinguishing feature is that most development work can be performed directly by domain experts.
We motivate the need for platforms of this type and discuss three specific cases: medical speech translation, speech-to-sign-language translation and voice questionnaires.
We briefly describe initial experiences in developing practical systems.
