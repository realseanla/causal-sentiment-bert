We study the problem of agreement and disagreement detection in online discussions.
An isotonic Conditional Random Fields (isotonic CRF) based sequential model is proposed to make predictions on sentence- or segment-level.
We automatically construct a socially-tuned lexicon that is bootstrapped from existing general-purpose sentiment lexicons to further improve the performance.
We evaluate our agreement and disagreement tagging model on two disparate online discussion corpora -- Wikipedia Talk pages and online debates.
Our model is shown to outperform the state-of-the-art approaches in both datasets.
For example, the isotonic CRF model achieves F1 scores of 0.74 and 0.67 for agreement and disagreement detection, when a linear chain CRF obtains 0.58 and 0.56 for the discussions on Wikipedia Talk pages.
