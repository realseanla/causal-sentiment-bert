Online learning is a familiar problem setting within Machine-Learning in which data is presented serially in time to a learning agent, requiring it to progressively adapt within the constraints of the learning algorithm.
More sophisticated variants may involve concepts such as transfer-learning which increase this adaptive capability, enhancing the learner's cognitive capacities in a manner that can begin to imitate the open-ended learning capabilities of human beings.
