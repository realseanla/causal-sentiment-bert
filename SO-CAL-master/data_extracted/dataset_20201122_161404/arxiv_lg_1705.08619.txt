While cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are prevalent across economic strata, the economically disadvantaged population is disproportionately affected due to the high cost of traditional CVD management.
Accordingly, developing an ultra-low-cost alternative, affordable even to groups at the bottom of the economic pyramid, has emerged as a societal imperative.
Against this backdrop, we propose an inexpensive yet accurate home-based electrocardiogram(ECG) monitoring service.
Specifically, we seek to provide point-of-care monitoring of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), high frequency of which could indicate the onset of potentially fatal arrhythmia.
Note that a traditional telecardiology system acquires the ECG, transmits it to a professional diagnostic centre without processing, and nearly achieves the diagnostic accuracy of a bedside setup, albeit at high bandwidth cost.
In this context, we aim at reducing cost without significantly sacrificing reliability.
To this end, we develop a dictionary-based algorithm that detects with high sensitivity the anomalous beats only which are then transmitted.
We further compress those transmitted beats using class-specific dictionaries subject to suitable reconstruction/diagnostic fidelity.
Such a scheme would not only reduce the overall bandwidth requirement, but also localising anomalous beats, thereby reducing physicians' burden.
Finally, using Monte Carlo cross validation on MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the performance of the proposed system.
In particular, with a sensitivity target of at most one undetected PVC in one hundred beats, and a percentage root mean squared difference less than 9 percent (a clinically acceptable level of fidelity), we achieved about 99.15 percent reduction in bandwidth cost, equivalent to 118-fold savings over traditional telecardiology.
