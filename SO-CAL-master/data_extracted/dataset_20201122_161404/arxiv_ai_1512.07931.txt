Nowadays, hospitals are ubiquitous and integral to modern society.
Patients flow in and out of a veritable whirlwind of paperwork, consultations, and potential inpatient admissions, through an abstracted system that is not without flaws.
One of the biggest flaws in the medical system is perhaps an unexpected one: the patient alarm system.
One longitudinal study reported an 88.8 percent rate of false alarms, with other studies reporting numbers of similar magnitudes.
These false alarm rates lead to a number of deleterious effects that manifest in a significantly lower standard of care across clinics.
