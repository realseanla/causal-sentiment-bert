Here we study the problem of predicting labels for large text corpora where each text can be assigned multiple labels.
The problem might seem trivial when the number of labels is small, and can be easily solved using a series of one-vs-all classifiers.
However, as the number of labels increases to several thousand, the parameter space becomes extremely large, and it is no longer possible to use the one-vs-all technique.
Here we propose a model based on the factorization of higher order word vector moments, as well as the cross moments between the labels and the words for multi-label prediction.
Our model provides guaranteed converge bounds on the extracted parameters.
Further, our model takes only three passes through the training dataset to extract the parameters, resulting in a highly scalable algorithm that can train on GB's of data consisting of millions of documents with hundreds of thousands of labels using a nominal resource of a single processor with 16GB RAM.
Our model achieves 10x-15x order of speed-up on large-scale datasets while producing competitive performance in comparison with existing benchmark algorithms.
