With the rise of digital humanities research, natural language processing for historical texts is of increasing interest.
However, directly applying standard language processing tools to historical texts often yields unsatisfactory performance, due to language change and genre differences.
Spelling normalization is the dominant solution, but it fails to account for changes in usage and vocabulary.
In this empirical paper, we assess the capability of do- main adaptation techniques to cope with historical texts, focusing on the classic bench- mark task of part-of-speech tagging.
We empirically evaluate several domain adaptation methods on the task of tagging two million- word treebanks of the Penn Corpora of Historical English.
We demonstrate that domain adaptation significantly outperforms spelling normalization when adapting modern taggers to older texts, and that domain adaptation is complementary with spelling normalization, yielding better results in combination.
