We present a new concept - Wikiometrics - the derivation of metrics and indicators from Wikipedia.
Wikipedia provides an accurate representation of the real world due to its size, structure, editing policy and popularity.
We demonstrate an innovative mining methodology, where different elements of Wikipedia - content, structure, editorial actions and reader reviews - are used to rank items in a manner which is by no means inferior to rankings produced by experts or other methods.
We test our proposed method by applying it to two real-world ranking problems: top world universities and academic journals.
Our proposed ranking methods were compared to leading and widely accepted benchmarks, and were found to be extremely correlative but with the advantage of the data being publically available.
