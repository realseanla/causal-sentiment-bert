A qualitative representation $\phi$ is like an ordinary representation of a relation algebra, but instead of requiring $(a; b)^\phi = a^\phi | b^\phi$, as we do for ordinary representations, we only require that $c^\phi\supseteq a^\phi | b^\phi \iff c\geq a ; b$, for each $c$ in the algebra.
A constraint network is qualitatively satisfiable if its nodes can be mapped to elements of a qualitative representation, preserving the constraints.
If a constraint network is satisfiable then it is clearly qualitatively satisfiable, but the converse can fail.
However, for a wide range of relation algebras including the point algebra, the Allen Interval Algebra, RCC8 and many others, a network is satisfiable if and only if it is qualitatively satisfiable.
