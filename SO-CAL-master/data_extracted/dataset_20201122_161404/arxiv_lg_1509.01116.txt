The availability of graph data with node attributes that can be either discrete or real-valued is constantly increasing.
While existing kernel methods are effective techniques for dealing with graphs having discrete node labels, their adaptation to non-discrete or continuous node attributes has been limited, mainly for computational issues.
Recently, a few kernels especially tailored for this domain, have been proposed.
In order to alleviate the computational problems, the size of the feature space of such kernels tend to be smaller than the ones of the kernels for discrete node attributes.
However, such choice might have a negative impact on the predictive performance.
In this paper, we propose a graph kernel for complex and continuous nodes' attributes, whose features are tree structures extracted from specific graph visits.
Experimental results obtained on real-world datasets show that the (approximated version of the) proposed kernel is comparable with current state-of-the-art kernels in terms of classification accuracy while requiring shorter running times.
