In this paper we explore whether or not deep neural architectures can learn to classify Boolean satisfiability (SAT).
We devote considerable time to discussing the theoretical properties of SAT.
Then, we define a graph representation for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form, and train neural classifiers over general graph structures called Graph Neural Networks, or GNNs, to recognize features of satisfiability.
To the best of our knowledge this has never been tried before.
Our preliminary findings are potentially profound.
In a weakly-supervised setting, that is, without problem specific feature engineering, Graph Neural Networks can learn features of satisfiability.
