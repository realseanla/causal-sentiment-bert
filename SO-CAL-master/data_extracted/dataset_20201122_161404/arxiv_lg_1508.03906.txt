Bike-sharing systems are a means of smart transportation in urban environments with the benefit of a positive impact on urban mobility.
In this paper we are interested in studying and modeling the behavior of features that permit the end user to access, with her/his web browser, the status of the Bike-Sharing system.
In particular, we address features able to make a prediction on the system state.
We propose to use a machine learning approach to analyze usage patterns and learn computational models of such features from logs of system usage.
