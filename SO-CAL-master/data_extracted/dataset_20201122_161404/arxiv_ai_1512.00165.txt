Classic machine learning algorithms learn from labelled examples.
For example, to design a machine translation system, a typical training set will consist of English sentences and their translation.
There is a stronger model, in which the algorithm can also query for labels of new examples it creates.
E.g, in the translation task, the algorithm can create a new English sentence, and request its translation from the user during training.
This combination of examples and queries has been widely studied.
Yet, despite many theoretical results, query algorithms are almost never used.
One of the main causes for this is a report (Baum and Lang, 1992) on very disappointing empirical performance of a query algorithm.
These poor results were mainly attributed to the fact that the algorithm queried for labels of examples that are artificial, and impossible to interpret by humans.
