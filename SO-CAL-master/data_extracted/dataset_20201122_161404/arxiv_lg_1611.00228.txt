In this paper we present a new scheme for instrumentation, which has been inspired by the way small mammals sense their environment.
We call this scheme Application Specific Instrumentation (ASIN).
A conventional instrumentation system focuses on gathering as much information about the scene as possible.
This, usually, is a generic system whose data can be used by another system to take a specific action.
ASIN fuses these two steps into one.
The major merit of the proposed scheme is that it uses low resolution sensors and much less computational overhead to give good performance for a highly specialised application
