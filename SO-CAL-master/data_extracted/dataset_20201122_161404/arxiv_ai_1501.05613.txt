Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are learning methods for pattern recognition.
The probabilistic HMMs have been one of the most used techniques based on the Bayesian model.
First-order probabilistic HMMs were adapted to the theory of belief functions such that Bayesian probabilities were replaced with mass functions.
In this paper, we present a second-order Hidden Markov Model using belief functions.
Previous works in belief HMMs have been focused on the first-order HMMs.
We extend them to the second-order model.
