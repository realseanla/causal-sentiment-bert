We discuss the problem of construction of inference procedures which can manipulate with uncertainties measured in ordinal scales and fulfill to the property of strict monotonicity of conclusion.
The class of A-valuations of plausibility is considered where operations based only on information about linear ordering of plausibility values are used.
In this class the modus ponens generating function fulfiling to the property of strict monotonicity of conclusions is introduced.
