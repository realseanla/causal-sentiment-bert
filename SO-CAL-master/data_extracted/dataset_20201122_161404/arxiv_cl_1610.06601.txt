In this paper, we are going to focus on speed up of the Word Sense Disambiguation procedure by filtering the relevant senses of an ambiguous word through Part-of-Speech Tagging.
First, this proposed approach performs the Part-of-Speech Tagging operation before the disambiguation procedure using Bigram approximation.
As a result, the exact Part-of-Speech of the ambiguous word at a particular text instance is derived.
In the next stage, only those dictionary definitions (glosses) are retrieved from an online dictionary, which are associated with that particular Part-of-Speech to disambiguate the exact sense of the ambiguous word.
In the training phase, we have used Brown Corpus for Part-of-Speech Tagging and WordNet as an online dictionary.
The proposed approach reduces the execution time upto half (approximately) of the normal execution time for a text, containing around 200 sentences.
Not only that, we have found several instances, where the correct sense of an ambiguous word is found for using the Part-of-Speech Tagging before the Disambiguation procedure.
