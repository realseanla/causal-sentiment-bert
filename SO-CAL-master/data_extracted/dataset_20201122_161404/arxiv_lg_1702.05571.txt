We consider the problem of outlier robust PCA (OR-PCA) where the goal is to recover principal directions despite the presence of outlier data points.
That is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-\alpha)$ fraction of the points are noisy samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $\alpha$ fraction of the points can be arbitrary outliers, the goal is to recover the subspace accurately.
Existing results for \OR-PCA have serious drawbacks: while some results are quite weak in the presence of noise, other results have runtime quadratic in dimension, rendering them impractical for large scale applications.
