Derivational morphology is a fundamental and complex characteristic of language.
In this paper we propose the new task of predicting the derivational form of a given base-form lemma that is appropriate for a given context.
We present an encoder--decoder style neural network to produce a derived form character-by-character, based on its corresponding character-level representation of the base form and the context.
We demonstrate that our model is able to generate valid context-sensitive derivations from known base forms, but is less accurate under a lexicon agnostic setting.
