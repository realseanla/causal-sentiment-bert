Knowledge representation is a popular research field in IT.
As mathematical knowledge is most formalized, its representation is important and interesting.
Mathematical knowledge consists of various mathematical theories.
In this paper we consider a deductive system that derives mathematical notions, axioms and theorems.
All these notions, axioms and theorems can be considered as the part of elementary set theory.
This theory will be represented as a semantic net.
