The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) has expanded significantly in recent years.
With the widespread of MOOC, the opportunity to study the fascinating courses for free has attracted numerous people of diverse educational backgrounds all over the world.
In the big data era, a key research topic for MOOC is how to mine the needed courses in the massive course databases in cloud for each individual (course) learner accurately and rapidly as the number of courses is increasing fleetly.
In this respect, the key challenge is how to realize personalized course recommendation as well as to reduce the computing and storage costs for the tremendous course data.
In this paper, we propose a big data-supported, context-aware online learning-based course recommender system that could handle the dynamic and infinitely massive datasets, which recommends courses by using personalized context information and historical statistics.
The context-awareness takes the personal preferences into consideration, making the recommendation suitable for people with different backgrounds.
Besides, the algorithm achieves the sublinear regret performance, which means it can gradually recommend the mostly preferred and matched courses to learners.
Unlike other existing algorithms, ours bounds the time complexity and space complexity linearly.
In addition, our devised storage module is expanded to the distributed-connected clouds, which can handle massive course storage problems from heterogenous sources.
Our experiment results verify the superiority of our algorithms when comparing with existing works in the big data setting.
