This article presents SLAM, an Automatic Solver for Lexical Metaphors like ?d\'eshabiller* une pomme?
(to undress* an apple).
SLAM calculates a conventional solution for these productions.
To carry on it, SLAM has to intersect the paradigmatic axis of the metaphorical verb ?d\'eshabiller*?, where ?peler?
(?to peel?)
comes closer, with a syntagmatic axis that comes from a corpus where ?peler une pomme?
(to peel an apple) is semantically and syntactically regular.
We test this model on DicoSyn, which is a ?small world?
network of synonyms, to compute the paradigmatic axis and on Frantext.20, a French corpus, to compute the syntagmatic axis.
Further, we evaluate the model with a sample of an experimental corpus of the database of Flexsem
