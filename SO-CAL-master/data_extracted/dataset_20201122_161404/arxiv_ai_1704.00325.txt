In this paper, we present a new algorithm for parallel Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS).
It is based on the pipeline pattern and allows flexible management of the control flow of the operations in parallel MCTS.
The pipeline pattern provides for the first structured parallel programming approach to MCTS.
Moreover, we propose a new lock-free tree data structure for parallel MCTS which removes synchronization overhead.
The Pipeline Pattern for Parallel MCTS algorithm (called 3PMCTS), scales very well to higher numbers of cores when compared to the existing methods.
