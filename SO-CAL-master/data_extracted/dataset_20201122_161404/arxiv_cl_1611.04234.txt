We focus on named entity recognition (NER) for Chinese social media.
With massive unlabeled text and quite limited labelled corpus, we propose a semi-supervised learning model based on B-LSTM neural network.
To take advantage of traditional methods in NER such as CRF, we combine transition probability with deep learning in our model.
To bridge the gap between label accuracy and F-score of NER, we construct a model which can be directly trained on F-score.
When considering the instability of F-score driven method and meaningful information provided by label accuracy, we propose an integrated method to train on both F-score and label accuracy.
Our integrated model yields 7.44\ percent improvement over previous state-of-the-art result.
