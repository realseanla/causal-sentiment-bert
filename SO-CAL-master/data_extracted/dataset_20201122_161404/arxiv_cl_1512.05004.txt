In this preliminary study, we examine whether random samples from within given Library of Congress Classification Outline areas yield significantly different topic models.
We find that models of subsamples can equal the topic similarity of models over the whole corpus.
As the sample size increases, topic distance decreases and topic overlap increases.
The requisite subsample size differs by field and by number of topics.
While this study focuses on only five areas, we find significant differences in the behavior of these areas that can only be investigated with large corpora like the Hathi Trust.
