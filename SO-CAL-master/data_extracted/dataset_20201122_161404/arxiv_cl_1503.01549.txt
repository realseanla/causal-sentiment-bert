The problem of spatiotemporal event visualization based on reports entails subtasks ranging from named entity recognition to relationship extraction and mapping of events.
We present an approach to event extraction that is driven by data mining and visualization goals, particularly thematic mapping and trend analysis.
This paper focuses on bridging the information extraction and visualization tasks and investigates topic modeling approaches.
We develop a static, finite topic model and examine the potential benefits and feasibility of extending this to dynamic topic modeling with a large number of topics and continuous time.
We describe an experimental test bed for event mapping that uses this end-to-end information retrieval system, and report preliminary results on a geoinformatics problem: tracking of methamphetamine lab seizure events across time and space.
