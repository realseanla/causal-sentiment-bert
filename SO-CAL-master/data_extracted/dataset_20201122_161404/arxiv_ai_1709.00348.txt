We study the problem of inferring the type of a networked device in a home network by leveraging low level traffic activity indicators seen at commodity home gateways.
We analyze a dataset of detailed device network activity obtained from 240 subscriber homes of a large European ISP and extract a number of traffic and spatial fingerprints for individual devices.
We develop a two level taxonomy to describe devices onto which we map individual devices using a number of heuristics.
We leverage the heuristically derived labels to train classifiers that distinguish device classes based on the traffic and spatial fingerprints of a device.
Our results show an accuracy level up to 91 percent for the coarse level category and up to 84 percent for the fine grained category.
By incorporating information from other sources (e.g., MAC OUI), we are able to further improve accuracy to above 97 percent and 92 percent, respectively.
Finally, we also extract a set of simple and human-readable rules that concisely capture the behaviour of these distinct device categories.
