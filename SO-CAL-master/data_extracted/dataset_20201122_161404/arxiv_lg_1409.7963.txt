In this work, we propose a novel and efficient method for articulated human pose estimation in videos using a convolutional network architecture, which incorporates both color and motion features.
We propose a new human body pose dataset, FLIC-motion, that extends the FLIC dataset with additional motion features.
We apply our architecture to this dataset and report significantly better performance than current state-of-the-art pose detection systems.
