Search is a major technique for planning.
It amounts to exploring a state space of planning domains typically modeled as a directed graph.
However, prohibitively large sizes of the search space make search expensive.
Developing better heuristic functions has been the main technique for improving search efficiency.
Nevertheless, recent studies have shown that improving heuristics alone has certain fundamental limits on improving search efficiency.
Recently, a new direction of research called partial order based reduction (POR) has been proposed as an alternative to improving heuristics.
POR has shown promise in speeding up searches.
