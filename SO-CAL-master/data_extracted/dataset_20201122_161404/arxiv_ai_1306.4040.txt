As penetration testing frameworks have evolved and have become more complex, the problem of controlling automatically the pentesting tool has become an important question.
This can be naturally addressed as an attack planning problem.
Previous approaches to this problem were based on modeling the actions and assets in the PDDL language, and using off-the-shelf AI tools to generate attack plans.
These approaches however are limited.
In particular, the planning is classical (the actions are deterministic) and thus not able to handle the uncertainty involved in this form of attack planning.
