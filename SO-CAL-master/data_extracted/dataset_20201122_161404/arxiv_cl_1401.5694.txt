This article considers the task of automatically inducing role-semantic annotations in the FrameNet paradigm for new languages.
We propose a general framework that is based on annotation projection, phrased as a graph optimization problem.
It is relatively inexpensive and has the potential to reduce the human effort involved in creating role-semantic resources.
Within this framework, we present projection models that exploit lexical and syntactic information.
We provide an experimental evaluation on an English-German parallel corpus which demonstrates the feasibility of inducing high-precision German semantic role annotation both for manually and automatically annotated English data.
