Combined with space-time coding, the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system explores space diversity.
It is a potential scheme to offer spectral efficiency and robust high data rate transmissions over frequency-selective fading channel.
However, space-time coding impairs the system ability to suppress interferences as the signals transmitted from two transmit antennas are superposed and interfered at the receiver antennas.
In this paper, we developed an adaptive beamforming based on least mean squared error algorithm and null deepening to combat co-channel interference (CCI) for the space-time coded OFDM (STC-OFDM) system.
To illustrate the performance of the presented approach, it is compared to the null steering beamformer which requires a prior knowledge of directions of arrival (DOAs).
The structure of space-time decoders are preserved although there is the use of beamformers before decoding.
By incorporating the proposed beamformer as a CCI canceller in the STC-OFDM systems, the performance improvement is achieved as shown in the simulation results.
