We consider the problem of recovering a low-rank tensor from a noisy observation.
Previous work has shown $O(n^{\lceil K/2\rceil/2})$ recovery guarantee for recovering a $K$th order rank one tensor of size $n\times ...\times n$ by an algorithm called recursive unfolding.
In this paper, we first improve this to $O(n^{K/4})$ by a much simpler approach but with a more careful analysis.
Then we propose a new norm based on the Kronecker products of factors obtained by the proposed simple estimator.
The imposed Kronecker structure of the new norm allows us to show a nearly ideal $O(\sqrt{n}+\sqrt{m})$ bound for the proposed subspace norm, in which the parameter $m$ controls the blend from the non-convex estimator to mode-wise nuclear norm minimization.
Furthermore we empirically demonstrate that with $m=O(1)$, the proposed norm achieves near ideal denoising performance.
