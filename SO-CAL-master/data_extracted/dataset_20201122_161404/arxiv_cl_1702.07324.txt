A recurrent neural network model of phonological pattern learning is proposed.
The model is a relatively simple neural network with one recurrent layer, and displays biases in learning that mimic observed biases in human learning.
Single-feature patterns are learned faster than two-feature patterns, and vowel or consonant-only patterns are learned faster than patterns involving vowels and consonants, mimicking the results of laboratory learning experiments.
In non-recurrent models, capturing these biases requires the use of alpha features or some other representation of repeated features, but with a recurrent neural network, these elaborations are not necessary.
