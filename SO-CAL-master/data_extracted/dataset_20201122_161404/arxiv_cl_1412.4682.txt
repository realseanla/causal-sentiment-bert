We study sentiment analysis beyond the typical granularity of polarity and instead use Plutchik's wheel of emotions model.
We introduce RBEM-Emo as an extension to the Rule-Based Emission Model algorithm to deduce such emotions from human-written messages.
We evaluate our approach on two different datasets and compare its performance with the current state-of-the-art techniques for emotion detection, including a recursive auto-encoder.
The results of the experimental study suggest that RBEM-Emo is a promising approach advancing the current state-of-the-art in emotion detection.
