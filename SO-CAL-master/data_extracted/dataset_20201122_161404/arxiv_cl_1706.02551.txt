We present a deterministic algorithm for Russian inflection.
This algorithm is implemented in a publicly available web-service www.passare.ru which provides functions for inflection of single words, word matching and synthesis of grammatically correct Russian text.
The inflectional functions have been tested against the annotated corpus of Russian language OpenCorpora.
