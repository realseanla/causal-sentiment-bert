The construction of a reference ontology for a large domain still remains an hard human task.
The process is sometimes assisted by software tools that facilitate the information extraction from a textual corpus.
Despite of the great use of XML Schema files on the internet and especially in the B2B domain, tools that offer a complete semantic analysis of XML schemas are really rare.
In this paper we introduce Janus, a tool for automatically building a reference knowledge base starting from XML Schema files.
Janus also provides different useful views to simplify B2B application integration.
