This paper presents an end-to-end framework for task-oriented dialog systems using a variant of Deep Recurrent Q-Networks (DRQN).
The model is able to interface with a relational database and jointly learn policies for both language understanding and dialog strategy.
Moreover, we propose a hybrid algorithm that combines the strength of reinforcement learning and supervised learning to achieve faster learning speed.
We evaluated the proposed model on a 20 Question Game conversational game simulator.
Results show that the proposed method outperforms the modular-based baseline and learns a distributed representation of the latent dialog state.
