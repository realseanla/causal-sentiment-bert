Random Indexing (RI) K-tree is the combination of two algorithms for clustering.
Many large scale problems exist in document clustering.
RI K-tree scales well with large inputs due to its low complexity.
It also exhibits features that are useful for managing a changing collection.
Furthermore, it solves previous issues with sparse document vectors when using K-tree.
The algorithms and data structures are defined, explained and motivated.
Specific modifications to K-tree are made for use with RI.
Experiments have been executed to measure quality.
The results indicate that RI K-tree improves document cluster quality over the original K-tree algorithm.
