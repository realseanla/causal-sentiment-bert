I suggest an approach that helps the online marketers to target their Gamification elements to users by modifying the order of the list of tasks that they send to users.
It is more realistic and flexible as it allows the model to learn more parameters when the online marketers collect more data.
The targeting approach is scalable and quick, and it can be used over streaming data.
