Usually, decision tree induction algorithms are limited to work with non relational data.
Given a record, they do not take into account other objects attributes even though they can provide valuable information for the learning task.
In this paper we present GGQ-ID3, a multi-relational decision tree learning algorithm that uses Generalized Graph Queries (GGQ) as predicates in the decision nodes.
GGQs allow to express complex patterns (including cycles) and they can be refined step-by-step.
Also, they can evaluate structures (not only single records) and perform Regular Pattern Matching.
GGQ are built dynamically (pattern mining) during the GGQ-ID3 tree construction process.
We will show how to use GGQ-ID3 to perform multi-relational machine learning keeping complexity under control.
Finally, some real examples of automatically obtained classification trees and semantic patterns are shown.
