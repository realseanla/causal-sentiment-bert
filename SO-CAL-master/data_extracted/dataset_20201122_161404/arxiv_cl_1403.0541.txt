Biological organisms are composed of numerous interconnected biochemical processes.
Diseases occur when normal functionality of these processes is disrupted.
Thus, understanding these biochemical processes and their interrelationships is a primary task in biomedical research and a prerequisite for diagnosing diseases, and drug development.
Scientists studying these processes have identified various pathways responsible for drug metabolism, and signal transduction, etc.
