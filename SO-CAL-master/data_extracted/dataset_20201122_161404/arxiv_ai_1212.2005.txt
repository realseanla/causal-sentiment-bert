Recent attempts to automate business processes and medical-treatment processes have uncovered the need for a formal framework that can accommodate not only temporal constraints, but also observations and actions with uncontrollable durations.
To meet this need, this paper defines a Conditional Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (CSTNU) that combines the simple temporal constraints from a Simple Temporal Network (STN) with the conditional nodes from a Conditional Simple Temporal Problem (CSTP) and the contingent links from a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU).
A notion of dynamic controllability for a CSTNU is defined that generalizes the dynamic consistency of a CTP and the dynamic controllability of an STNU.
The paper also presents some sound constraint-propagation rules for dynamic controllability that are expected to form the backbone of a dynamic-controllability-checking algorithm for CSTNUs.
