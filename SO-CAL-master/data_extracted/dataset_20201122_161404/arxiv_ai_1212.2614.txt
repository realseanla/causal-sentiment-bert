We use princiles of fuzzy logic to develop a general model representing several processes in a system's operation characterized by a degree of vagueness and/or uncertainy.
Further, we introduce three altenative measures of a fuzzy system's effectiveness connected to the above model.
An applcation is also developed for the Mathematical Modelling process illustrating our results.
