Matrix Completion is the problem of recovering an unknown real-valued low-rank matrix from a subsample of its entries.
Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random.
Are these assumptions necessary?
