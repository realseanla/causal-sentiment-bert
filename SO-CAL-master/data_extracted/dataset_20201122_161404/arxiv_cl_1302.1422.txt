The variation of word meaning according to the context leads us to enrich the type system of our syntactical and semantic analyser of French based on categorial grammars and Montague semantics (or lambda-DRT).
The main advantage of a deep semantic analyse is too represent meaning by logical formulae that can be easily used e.g.
for inferences.
Determiners and quantifiers play a fundamental role in the construction of those formulae.
But in our rich type system the usual semantic terms do not work.
We propose a solution ins- pired by the tau and epsilon operators of Hilbert, kinds of generic elements and choice functions.
This approach unifies the treatment of the different determi- ners and quantifiers as well as the dynamic binding of pronouns.
Above all, this fully computational view fits in well within the wide coverage parser Grail, both from a theoretical and a practical viewpoint.
