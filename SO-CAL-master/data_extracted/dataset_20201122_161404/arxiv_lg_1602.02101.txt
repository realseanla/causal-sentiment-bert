The Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm has recently regained popularity for machine learning applications due to its projection-free property and its ability to handle structured constraints.
However, in the stochastic learning setting, it is still relatively understudied compared to the gradient descent counterpart.
In this work, leveraging a recent variance reduction technique, we propose two stochastic Frank-Wolfe variants which substantially improve previous results in terms of the number of stochastic gradient evaluations needed to achieve $1-\epsilon$ accuracy.
For example, we improve from $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ to $O(\ln\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ if the objective function is smooth and strongly convex, and from $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^2})$ to $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{1.5}})$ if the objective function is smooth and Lipschitz.
The theoretical improvement is also observed in experiments on real-world datasets for a multiclass classification application.
