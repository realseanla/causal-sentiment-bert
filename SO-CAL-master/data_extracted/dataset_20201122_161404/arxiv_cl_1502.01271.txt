Given a set of terms from a given domain, how can we structure them into a taxonomy without manual intervention?
This is the task 17 of SemEval 2015.
Here we present our simple taxonomy structuring techniques which, despite their simplicity, ranked first in this 2015 benchmark.
We use large quantities of text (English Wikipedia) and simple heuristics such as term overlap and document and sentence co-occurrence to produce hypernym lists.
We describe these techniques and pre-sent an initial evaluation of results.
