Submodular maximization (SM) has become a silver bullet for a broad class of applications such as influence maximization, data summarization, top-$k$ representative queries, and recommendations.
In this paper, we study the SM problem in data streams.
Most existing algorithms for streaming SM only support the append-only model with cardinality constraints, which cannot meet the requirements of real-world problems considering either the data recency issues or more general $d$-knapsack constraints.
Therefore, we first propose an append-only streaming algorithm {\sc KnapStream} for SM subject to a $d$-knapsack constraint (SMDK).
Furthermore, we devise the {\sc KnapWindow} algorithm for SMDK over sliding windows to capture the recency constraints.
Theoretically, the proposed algorithms have constant approximation ratios for a fixed number of knapsacks and sublinear complexities.
We finally evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms in two real-world datasets.
The results show that the proposed algorithms achieve two orders of magnitude speedups over the greedy baseline in the batch setting while preserving high quality solutions.
