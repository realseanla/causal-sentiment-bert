In this paper we present a SOA (Service Oriented Architecture)-based platform, enabling the retrieval and analysis of big datasets stemming from social networking (SN) sites and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, collected by smart city applications and socially-aware data aggregation services.
A large set of city applications in the areas of Participating Urbanism, Augmented Reality and Sound-Mapping throughout participating cities is being applied, resulting into produced sets of millions of user-generated events and online SN reports fed into the RADICAL platform.
Moreover, we study the application of data analytics such as sentiment analysis to the combined IoT and SN data saved into an SQL database, further investigating algorithmic and configurations to minimize delays in dataset processing and results retrieval.
