Description Logics are widely used to describe knowledge bases.
Their purpose is to describe static knowledge.
Our goal, in the other hand, is to be able to do the same thing with dynamic knowledge.
To reach that objective we introduce substitution modifying concepts and roles.
We investigate the effect of adding such substitutions to the logic SROIQ, yielding SROIQsigma, and prove that the satisfiability of a property is still decidable in SROIQsigma.
