Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an expressive knowledge representation and reasoning framework.
Due to its rather simple syntax paired with high-performance solvers, ASP is interesting for industrial applications.
However, to err is human and thus debugging is an important activity during the development process.
Therefore, tools for debugging non-ground answer set programs are needed.
In this paper, we present a new graphical debugging interface for non-ground answer set programs.
The tool is based on the recently-introduced DWASP approach for debugging and it simplifies the interaction with the debugger.
Furthermore, the debugging interface is integrated in ASPIDE, a rich IDE for answer set programs.
With our extension ASPIDE turns into a full-fledged IDE by offering debugging support.
