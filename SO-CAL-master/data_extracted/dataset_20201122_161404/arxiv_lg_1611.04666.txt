In recent years, interest in recommender research has shifted from explicit feedback towards implicit feedback data.
A diversity of complex models has been proposed for a wide variety of applications.
Despite this, learning from implicit feedback is still computationally challenging.
So far, most work relies on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) solvers which are easy to derive, but in practice challenging to apply, especially for tasks with many items.
For the simple matrix factorization model, an efficient coordinate descent (CD) solver has been previously proposed.
However, efficient CD approaches have not been derived for more complex models.
