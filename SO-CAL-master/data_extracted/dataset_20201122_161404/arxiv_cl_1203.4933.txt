This paper gives a detail overview about the modified features selection in CRF (Conditional Random Field) based Manipuri POS (Part of Speech) tagging.
Selection of features is so important in CRF that the better are the features then the better are the outputs.
This work is an attempt or an experiment to make the previous work more efficient.
Multiple new features are tried to run the CRF and again tried with the Reduplicated Multiword Expression (RMWE) as another feature.
The CRF run with RMWE because Manipuri is rich of RMWE and identification of RMWE becomes one of the necessities to bring up the result of POS tagging.
The new CRF system shows a Recall of 78.22 percent, Precision of 73.15 percent and F-measure of 75.60 percent.
With the identification of RMWE and considering it as a feature makes an improvement to a Recall of 80.20 percent, Precision of 74.31 percent and F-measure of 77.14 percent.
