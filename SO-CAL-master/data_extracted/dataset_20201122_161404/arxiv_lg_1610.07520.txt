This work proposes a low complexity nonlinearity model and develops adaptive algorithms over it.
The model is based on the decomposable---or rank-one, in tensor language---Volterra kernels.
It may also be described as a product of FIR filters, which explains its low-complexity.
The rank-one model is also interesting because it comes from a well-posed problem in approximation theory.
The paper uses such model in an estimation theory context to develop an exact gradient-type algorithm, from which adaptive algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) filter and its data-reuse version---the TRUE-LMS---are derived.
Stability and convergence issues are addressed.
The algorithms are then tested in simulations, which show its good performance when compared to other nonlinear processing algorithms in the literature.
