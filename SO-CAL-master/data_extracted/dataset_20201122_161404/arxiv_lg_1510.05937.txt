The popular i-vector model represents speakers as lowdimensional continuous vectors (i-vectors), and hence is a way of continuous speaker embedding.
In this paper, we investigate binary speaker embedding, which transforms ivectors to binary vectors (codes) by a hash function.
We start from locality sensitive hashing (LSH), a simple binarization approach where binary codes are derived from a set of random hash functions.
A potential problem of LSH is that the randomly sampled hash functions might be suboptimal, we therefore propose an improved Hamming distance learning approach, where the hash function is learned by a variablesized block training that projects each dimension of the original i-vectors to variable-sized binary codes independently.
Our experiments show that binary speaker embedding can deliver competitive or even better results on both speaker verification and identification tasks, while the memory usage and the computation cost are significant reduced.
