Referring expression generation (REG) models that use speaker-dependent information require a considerable amount of training data produced by every individual speaker, or may otherwise perform poorly.
In this work we present a simple REG experiment that allows the use of larger training data sets by grouping speakers according to their overspecification preferences.
Intrinsic evaluation shows that this method generally outperforms the personalised method found in previous work.
