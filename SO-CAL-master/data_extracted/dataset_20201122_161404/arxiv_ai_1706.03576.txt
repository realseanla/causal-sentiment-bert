This is a contribution to the formalization of the concept of agents in multivariate Markov chains.
Agents are commonly defined as entities that act, perceive, and are goal-directed.
In a multivariate Markov chain (e.g.
a cellular automaton) the transition matrix completely determines the dynamics.
This seems to contradict the possibility of acting entities within such a system.
Here we present definitions of actions and perceptions within multivariate Markov chains based on entity-sets.
Entity-sets represent a largely independent choice of a set of spatiotemporal patterns that are considered as all the entities within the Markov chain.
For example, the entity-set can be chosen according to operational closure conditions or complete specific integration.
Importantly, the perception-action loop also induces an entity-set and is a multivariate Markov chain.
We then show that our definition of actions leads to non-heteronomy and that of perceptions specialize to the usual concept of perception in the perception-action loop.
