A very computationally-efficient Monte-Carlo algorithm for the calculation of Dempster-Shafer belief is described.
If Bel is the combination using Dempster's Rule of belief functions Bel, ..., Bel,7, then, for subset b of the frame C), Bel(b) can be calculated in time linear in 1(31 and m (given that the weight of conflict is bounded).
The algorithm can also be used to improve the complexity of the Shenoy-Shafer algorithms on Markov trees, and be generalised to calculate Dempster-Shafer Belief over other logics.
