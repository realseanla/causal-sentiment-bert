Load disaggregation based on aided linear integer programming (ALIP) is proposed.
We start with a conventional linear integer programming (IP) based disaggregation and enhance it in several ways.
The enhancements include additional constraints, correction based on a state diagram, median filtering, and linear programming-based refinement.
With the aid of these enhancements, the performance of IP-based disaggregation is significantly improved.
The proposed ALIP system relies only on the instantaneous load samples instead of waveform signatures, and hence does not crucially depend on high sampling frequency.
Experimental results show that the proposed ALIP system performs better than the conventional IP-based load disaggregation system.
