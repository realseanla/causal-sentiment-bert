Content on the Internet is heterogeneous and arises from various domains like News, Entertainment, Finance and Technology.
Understanding such content requires identifying named entities (persons, places and organizations) as one of the key steps.
Traditionally Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems have been built using available annotated datasets (like CoNLL, MUC) and demonstrate excellent performance.
However, these models fail to generalize onto other domains like Sports and Finance where conventions and language use can differ significantly.
Furthermore, several domains do not have large amounts of annotated labeled data for training robust Named Entity Recognition models.
A key step towards this challenge is to adapt models learned on domains where large amounts of annotated training data are available to domains with scarce annotated data.
