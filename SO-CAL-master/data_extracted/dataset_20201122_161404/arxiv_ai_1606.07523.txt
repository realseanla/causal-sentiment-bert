Information delivery in a network of agents is a key issue for large, complex systems that need to do so in a predictable, efficient manner.
The delivery of information in such multi-agent systems is typically implemented through routing protocols that determine how information flows through the network.
Different routing protocols exist each with its own benefits, but it is generally unclear which properties can be successfully combined within a given algorithm.
We approach this problem from the axiomatic point of view, i.e., we try to establish what are the properties we would seek to see in such a system, and examine the different properties which uniquely define common routing algorithms used today.
