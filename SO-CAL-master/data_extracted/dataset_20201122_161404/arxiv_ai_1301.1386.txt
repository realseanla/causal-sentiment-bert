This is a preliminary report on the work aimed at making CR-Prolog -- a version of ASP with consistency restoring rules -- more suitable for use in teaching and large applications.
First we describe a sorted version of CR-Prolog called SPARC.
Second, we translate a basic version of the CR-Prolog into the language of DLV and compare the performance with the state of the art CR-Prolog solver.
The results form the foundation for future more efficient and user friendly implementation of SPARC and shed some light on the relationship between two useful knowledge representation constructs: consistency restoring rules and weak constraints of DLV.
