Turkish Wikipedia Named-Entity Recognition and Text Categorization (TWNERTC) dataset is a collection of automatically categorized and annotated sentences obtained from Wikipedia.
We constructed large-scale gazetteers by using a graph crawler algorithm to extract relevant entity and domain information from a semantic knowledge base, Freebase.
The constructed gazetteers contains approximately 300K entities with thousands of fine-grained entity types under 77 different domains.
Since automated processes are prone to ambiguity, we also introduce two new content specific noise reduction methodologies.
Moreover, we map fine-grained entity types to the equivalent four coarse-grained types: person, loc, org, misc.
Eventually, we construct six different dataset versions and evaluate the quality of annotations by comparing ground truths from human annotators.
We make these datasets publicly available to support studies on Turkish named-entity recognition (NER) and text categorization (TC).
