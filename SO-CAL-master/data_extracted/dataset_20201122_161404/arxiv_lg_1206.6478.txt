In this paper we study output coding for multi-label prediction.
For a multi-label output coding to be discriminative, it is important that codewords for different label vectors are significantly different from each other.
In the meantime, unlike in traditional coding theory, codewords in output coding are to be predicted from the input, so it is also critical to have a predictable label encoding.
