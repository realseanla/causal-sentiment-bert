The highly influential framework of conceptual spaces provides a geometric way of representing knowledge.
It aims at bridging the gap between symbolic and subsymbolic processing.
Instances are represented by points in a high-dimensional space and concepts are represented by convex regions in this space.
In this paper, we present our approach towards grounding the dimensions of a conceptual space in latent spaces learned by an InfoGAN from unlabeled data.
