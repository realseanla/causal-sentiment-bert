This book-length article combines several peer reviewed papers and new material to analyze the issues of ethical artificial intelligence (AI).
The behavior of future AI systems can be described by mathematical equations, which are adapted to analyze possible unintended AI behaviors and ways that AI designs can avoid them.
This article also discusses how future AI will differ from current AI, the politics of AI, and the ultimate use of AI to help understand the nature of the universe and our place in it.
