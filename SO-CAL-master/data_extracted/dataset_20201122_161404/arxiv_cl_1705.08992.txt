This paper formulates a novel problem on graphs: find the minimal subset of edges in a fully connected graph, such that the resulting graph contains all spanning trees for a set of specifed sub-graphs.
This formulation is motivated by an un-supervised grammar induction problem from computational linguistics.
We present a reduction to some known problems and algorithms from graph theory, provide computational complexity results, and describe an approximation algorithm.
