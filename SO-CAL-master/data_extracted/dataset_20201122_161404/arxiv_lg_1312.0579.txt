Structured prediction plays a central role in machine learning applications from computational biology to computer vision.
These models require significantly more computation than unstructured models, and, in many applications, algorithms may need to make predictions within a computational budget or in an anytime fashion.
In this work we propose an anytime technique for learning structured prediction that, at training time, incorporates both structural elements and feature computation trade-offs that affect test-time inference.
We apply our technique to the challenging problem of scene understanding in computer vision and demonstrate efficient and anytime predictions that gradually improve towards state-of-the-art classification performance as the allotted time increases.
