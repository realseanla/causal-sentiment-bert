In June 2016, Apple announced that it will deploy differential privacy for some user data collection in order to ensure privacy of user data, even from Apple.
The details of Apple's approach remained sparse.
Although several patents have since appeared hinting at the algorithms that may be used to achieve differential privacy, they did not include a precise explanation of the approach taken to privacy parameter choice.
Such choice and the overall approach to privacy budget use and management are key questions for understanding the privacy protections provided by any deployment of differential privacy.
