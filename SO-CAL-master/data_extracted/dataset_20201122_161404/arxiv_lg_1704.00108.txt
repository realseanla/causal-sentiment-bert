Motivated by e-commerce, we study the online assortment optimization problem.
The seller offers an assortment, i.e.
a subset of products, to each arriving customer, who then purchases one or no product from her offered assortment.
A customer's purchase decision is governed by the underlying MultiNomial Logit (MNL) choice model.
The seller aims to maximize the total revenue in a finite sales horizon, subject to resource constraints and uncertainty in the MNL choice model.
We first propose an efficient online policy which incurs a regret $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, where $T$ is the number of customers in the sales horizon.
Then, we propose a UCB policy that achieves a regret $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$.
Both regret bounds are sublinear in the number of assortments.
