Collaborative approaches to network defense are being increasingly advocated, aiming to proactively predict and speed up detection of attacks.
In particular, a lot of attention has recently been given to the problem of predictive blacklisting, i.e., forecasting attack sources based on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) alerts contributed by different organizations.
While collaboration allows the discovery of groups of correlated attacks targeting similar victims, it also raises important privacy and security challenges, thus motivating privacy-preserving approaches to the problem.
Although recent work provides encouraging results on the feasibility of collaborative predictive blacklisting via limited data sharing, a number of open problems remain unaddressed, which this paper sets to address.
We introduce a privacy-friendly system for predictive blacklisting featuring a semi-trusted authority that clusters organizations based on the similarity of their logs, without access to these logs.
Entities in the same cluster then securely share relevant logs with each other, and build predictive blacklists.
