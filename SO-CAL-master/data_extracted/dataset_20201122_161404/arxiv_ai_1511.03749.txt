In this paper we show that the problem of checking consistency of a knowledge base in the Description Logic ALCM is ExpTime-complete.
The M stands for meta-modelling as defined by Motz, Rohrer and Severi.
To show our main result, we define an ExpTime Tableau algorithm as an extension of an algorithm for checking consistency of a knowledge base in ALC by Nguyen and Szalas.
