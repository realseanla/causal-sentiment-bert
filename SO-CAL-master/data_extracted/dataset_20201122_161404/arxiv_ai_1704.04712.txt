The rise of robotic applications has led to the generation of a huge volume of unstructured data, whereas the current cloud infrastructure was designed to process limited amounts of structured data.
To address this problem, we propose a learn-memorize-recall-reduce paradigm for robotic cloud computing.
The learning stage converts incoming unstructured data into structured data; the memorization stage provides effective storage for the massive amount of data; the recall stage provides efficient means to retrieve the raw data; while the reduction stage provides means to make sense of this massive amount of unstructured data with limited computing resources.
