Dempster-Shafer evidence theory is an efficient mathematical tool to deal with uncertain information.
In that theory, basic probability assignment (BPA) is the basic element for the expression and inference of uncertainty.
Decision-making based on BPA is still an open issue in Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.
In this paper, a novel approach of transforming basic probability assignments to probabilities is proposed based on Deng entropy which is a new measure for the uncertainty of BPA.
The principle of the proposed method is to minimize the difference of uncertainties involving in the given BPA and obtained probability distribution.
Numerical examples are given to show the proposed approach.
