The notion of events has occupied a central role in modeling and has an influence in computer science and philosophy.
Recent developments in diagrammatic modeling have made it possible to examine conceptual representation of events.
This paper explores some aspects of the notion of events that are produced by applying a new diagrammatic methodology with a focus on the interaction of events with such concepts as time and space, objects.
The proposed description applies to abstract machines where events form the dynamic phases of a system.
The results of this nontechnical research can be utilized in many fields where the notion of an event is typically used in interdisciplinary application.
