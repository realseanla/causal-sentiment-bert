In this paper we dealt with the comparison and linking between lexical resources with domain knowledge provided by ontologies.
It is one of the issues for the combination of the Semantic Web Ontologies and Text Mining.
We investigated the relations between the linguistics oriented and domain-specific semantics, by associating the GO biological process concepts to the FrameNet semantic frames.
The result shows the gaps between the linguistics-oriented and domain-specific semantics on the classification of events and the grouping of target words.
The result provides valuable information for the improvement of domain ontologies supporting for text mining systems.
And also, it will result in benefits to language understanding technology.
