Private Set Intersection (PSI) is usually implemented as a sequence of encryption rounds between users, whereas the present work implements PSI in a simpler fashion: each set only needs to be encrypted once, after which each pair of users go through one round of ordinary set comparison.
This can be orders of magnitude faster than ordinary PSI at the cost of some "fuzziness" in the matching, which may nonetheless be tolerable or even desirable.
This is demonstrated in the case where the sets consist of English words processed with WordNet.
