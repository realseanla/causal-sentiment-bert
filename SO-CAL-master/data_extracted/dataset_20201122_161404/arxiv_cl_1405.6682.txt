This paper re-investigates a lexical acquisition system initially developed for French.We show that, interestingly, the architecture of the system reproduces and implements the main components of Optimality Theory.
However, we formulate the hypothesis that some of its limitations are mainly due to a poor representation of the constraints used.
Finally, we show how a better representation of the constraints used would yield better results.
