We study a general task allocation problem, involving multiple agents that collaboratively accomplish tasks and where agents may fail to successfully complete the tasks assigned to them (known as execution uncertainty).
The goal is to choose an allocation that maximises social welfare while taking their execution uncertainty into account.
We show that this can be achieved by using the post-execution verification (PEV)-based mechanism if and only if agents' valuations satisfy a multilinearity condition.
We then consider a more complex setting where an agent's execution uncertainty is not completely predictable by the agent alone but aggregated from all agents' private opinions (known as trust).
We show that PEV-based mechanism with trust is still truthfully implementable if and only if the trust aggregation is multilinear.
