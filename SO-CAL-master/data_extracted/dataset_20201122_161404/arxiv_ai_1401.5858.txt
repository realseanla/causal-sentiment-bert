Planning is concerned with the automated solution of action sequencing problems described in declarative languages giving the action preconditions and effects.
One important application area for such technology is the creation of new processes in Business Process Management (BPM), which is essential in an ever more dynamic business environment.
A major obstacle for the application of Planning in this area lies in the modeling.
Obtaining a suitable model to plan with -- ideally a description in PDDL, the most commonly used planning language -- is often prohibitively complicated and/or costly.
Our core observation in this work is that this problem can be ameliorated by leveraging synergies with model-based software development.
Our application at SAP, one of the leading vendors of enterprise software, demonstrates that even one-to-one model re-use is possible.
