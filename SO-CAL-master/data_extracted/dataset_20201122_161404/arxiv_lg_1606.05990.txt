We propose a new training method for a feedforward neural network having the activation functions with the geometric contraction property.
The method consists of constructing a new functional that is less nonlinear in comparison with the classical functional by removing the nonlinearity of the activation functions from the output layer.
We validate this new method by a series of experiments that show an improved learning speed and also a better classification error.
