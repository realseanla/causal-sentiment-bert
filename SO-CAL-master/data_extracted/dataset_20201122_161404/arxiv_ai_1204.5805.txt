We present an automated solution for rapid diagnosis of client device problems in private cloud environments: the Intelligent Automated Client Diagnostic (IACD) system.
Clients are diagnosed with the aid of Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packet traces, by (i) observation of anomalous artifacts occurring as a result of each fault and (ii) subsequent use of the inference capabilities of soft-margin Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.
The IACD system features a modular design and is extendible to new faults, with detection capability unaffected by the TCP variant used at the client.
Experimental evaluation of the IACD system in a controlled environment demonstrated an overall diagnostic accuracy of 98 percent.
