Session-based recommendations are highly relevant in many modern on-line services (e.g.
e-commerce, video streaming) and recommendation settings.
Recurrent Neural Networks have recently been shown to perform very well in session-based settings.
While in many session-based recommendation domains user identifiers are hard to come by, there are also domains in which user profiles are readily available.
We propose a seamless way to personalize RNN models with cross-session information transfer and devise a hierarchical RNN model that relies end evolves latent hidden states of the RNN's across user sessions.
Results on two industry datasets show large improvements over the session-only RNN's.
