Social Internet content plays an increasingly critical role in many domains, including public health, disaster management, and politics.
However, its utility is sharply limited by lack of geographic information; for example, fewer than 1.6 percent of Twitter messages (tweets) contain a geotag.
We propose a scalable, content-based approach to estimate the location of tweets using a novel yet simple variant of gaussian mixture models tuned for this task.
Further, given that real-world applications depend on quantified uncertainty of such estimates, we propose novel metrics of accuracy, precision, and calibration, and we evaluate our approach accordingly.
Experiments on 13 million global, comprehensively multi-lingual tweets show that our approach yields reliable, well-calibrated results competitive with previous computationally intensive methods.
Our results also show that a relatively small number of training data are required for good estimates (roughly 30,000 tweets), and trained models are quite time-invariant (effective on tweets many weeks newer than the training set).
Finally, we offer an analysis of which types of content provide the most useful location signals.
