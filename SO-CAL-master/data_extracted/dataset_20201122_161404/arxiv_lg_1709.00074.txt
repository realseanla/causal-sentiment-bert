We discuss the feasibility of the following learning problem: given unmatched samples from two domains and nothing else, learn a mapping between the two, which preserves semantics.
Due to the lack of paired samples and without any definition of the semantic information, the problem might seem ill-posed.
Specifically, in typical cases, it seems possible to build infinitely many alternative mappings from every target mapping.
This apparent ambiguity stands in sharp contrast to the recent empirical success in solving this problem.
