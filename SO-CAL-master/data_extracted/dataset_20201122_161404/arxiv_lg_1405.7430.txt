BayesOpt is a library with state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods to solve nonlinear optimization, stochastic bandits or sequential experimental design problems.
Bayesian optimization is sample efficient by building a posterior distribution to capture the evidence and prior knowledge for the target function.
Built in standard C++, the library is extremely efficient while being portable and flexible.
It includes a common interface for C, C++, Python, Matlab and Octave.
