MRA (Multilingual Report Annotator) is a web application that translates Radiology text and annotates it with RadLex terms.
Its goal is to explore the solution of translating non-English Radiology reports as a way to solve the problem of most of the Text Mining tools being developed for English.
In this brief paper we explain the language barrier problem and shortly describe the application.
