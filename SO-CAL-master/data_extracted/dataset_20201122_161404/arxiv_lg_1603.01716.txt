In this paper, a novel approach to classifier ensemble creation is presented.
While other ensemble creation techniques are based on careful selection of existing classifiers or preprocessing of the data, the presented approach automatically creates an optimal labelling for a number of classifiers, which are then assigned to the original data instances and fed to classifiers.
The approach has been evaluated on high-dimensional biomedical datasets.
The results show that the approach outperformed individual approaches in all cases.
