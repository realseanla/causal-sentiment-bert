This paper presents a currently bilingual but potentially multilingual FrameNet-based grammar library implemented in Grammatical Framework.
The contribution of this paper is two-fold.
First, it offers a methodological approach to automatically generate the grammar based on semantico-syntactic valence patterns extracted from FrameNet-annotated corpora.
Second, it provides a proof of concept for two use cases illustrating how the acquired multilingual grammar can be exploited in different CNL applications in the domains of arts and tourism.
