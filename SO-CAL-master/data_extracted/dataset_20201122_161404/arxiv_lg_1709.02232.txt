An RNN-based forecasting approach is used to early detect anomalies in industrial multivariate time series data from a simulated Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP) with many cyber-attacks.
This work continues a previously proposed LSTM-based approach to the fault detection in simpler data.
It is considered necessary to adapt the RNN network to deal with data containing stochastic, stationary, transitive and a rich variety of anomalous behaviours.
There is particular focus on early detection with special NAB-metric.
A comparison with the DPCA approach is provided.
The generated data set is made publicly available.
