In this paper, we consider the problem of finding a minimum common partition of two strings (MCSP).
The problem has its application in genome comparison.
As it is an NP-hard, discrete combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a metaheuristic technique, namely, MAX-MIN ant system to solve this.
The experimental results are found to be promising.
