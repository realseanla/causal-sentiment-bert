Many real-world applications can be described as large-scale games of imperfect information.
To deal with these challenging domains, prior work has focused on computing Nash equilibria in a handcrafted abstraction of the domain.
In this paper we introduce the first scalable end-to-end approach to learning approximate Nash equilibria without any prior knowledge.
Our method combines fictitious self-play with deep reinforcement learning.
When applied to Leduc poker, Neural Fictitious Self-Play (NFSP) approached a Nash equilibrium, whereas common reinforcement learning methods diverged.
In Limit Texas Holdem, a poker game of real-world scale, NFSP learnt a competitive strategy that approached the performance of human experts and state-of-the-art methods.
