We describe a prototype dialogue response generation model for the customer service domain at Amazon.
The model, which is trained in a weakly supervised fashion, measures the similarity between customer questions and agent answers using a dual encoder network, a Siamese-like neural network architecture.
Answer templates are extracted from embeddings derived from past agent answers, without turn-by-turn annotations.
Responses to customer inquiries are generated by selecting the best template from the final set of templates.
We show that, in a closed domain like customer service, the selected templates cover $&gt;$70\ percent of past customer inquiries.
Furthermore, the relevance of the model-selected templates is significantly higher than templates selected by a standard tf-idf baseline.
