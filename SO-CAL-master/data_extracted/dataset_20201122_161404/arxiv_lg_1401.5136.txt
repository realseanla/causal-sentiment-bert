Over the past few years, Multi-Kernel Learning (MKL) has received significant attention among data-driven feature selection techniques in the context of kernel-based learning.
MKL formulations have been devised and solved for a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including Multi-Task Learning (MTL).
Solving different MKL formulations usually involves designing algorithms that are tailored to the problem at hand, which is, typically, a non-trivial accomplishment.
