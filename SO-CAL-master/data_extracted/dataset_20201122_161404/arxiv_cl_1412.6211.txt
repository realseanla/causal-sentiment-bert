Inspired by the authorship controversy of Dream of the Red Chamber and the application of machine learning in the study of literary stylometry, we develop a rigorous new method for the mathematical analysis of authorship by testing for a so-called chrono-divide in writing styles.
Our method incorporates some of the latest advances in the study of authorship attribution, particularly techniques from support vector machines.
By introducing the notion of relative frequency as a feature ranking metric our method proves to be highly effective and robust.
