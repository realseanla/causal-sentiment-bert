Agent programming is mostly a symbolic discipline and, as such, draws little benefits from probabilistic areas as machine learning and graphical models.
However, the greatest objective of agent research is the achievement of autonomy in dynamical and complex environments --- a goal that implies embracing uncertainty and therefore the entailed representations, algorithms and techniques.
This paper proposes an innovative and conflict free two layer approach to agent programming that uses already established methods and tools from both symbolic and probabilistic artificial intelligence.
Moreover, this framework is illustrated by means of a widely used agent programming example, GoldMiners.
