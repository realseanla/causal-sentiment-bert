In this article, I present the questions that I seek to answer in my PhD research.
I posit to analyze natural language text with the help of semantic annotations and mine important events for navigating large text corpora.
Semantic annotations such as named entities, geographic locations, and temporal expressions can help us mine events from the given corpora.
These events thus provide us with useful means to discover the locked knowledge in them.
I pose three problems that can help unlock this knowledge vault in semantically annotated text corpora: i. identifying important events; ii.
semantic search; and iii.
event analytics.
