In this paper we make a contribution to the unification of formal models of defeasible reasoning.
We present several translations between formal argumentation frameworks and nonmonotonic logics for reasoning with plausible assumptions.
More specifically, we translate adaptive logics into assumption-based argumentation and ASPIC+, ASPIC+ into assumption-based argumentation and a fragment of assumption-based argumentation into adaptive logics.
Adaptive logics are closely related to Makinson's default assumptions and to a significant class of systems within the tradition of preferential semantics in the vein of KLM and Shoham.
Thus, our results also provide close links between formal argumentation and the latter approaches.
