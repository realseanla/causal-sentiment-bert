This article provides an interesting exploration of character-level convolutional neural network solving Chinese corpus text classification problem.
We constructed a large-scale Chinese language dataset, and the result shows that character-level convolutional neural network works better on Chinese corpus than its corresponding pinyin format dataset.
This is the first time that character-level convolutional neural network applied to text classification problem.
