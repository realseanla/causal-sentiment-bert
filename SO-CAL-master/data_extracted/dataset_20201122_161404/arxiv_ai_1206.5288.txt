We present a functional framework for automated mechanism design based on a two-stage game model of strategic interaction between the designer and the mechanism participants, and apply it to several classes of two-player infinite games of incomplete information.
At the core of our framework is a black-box optimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidate mechanisms.
Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several application domains using various objective functions.
By comparing our results with known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best known mechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametric design of indirect mechanisms.
