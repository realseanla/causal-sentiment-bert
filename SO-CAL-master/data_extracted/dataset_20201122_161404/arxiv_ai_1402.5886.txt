How should we gather information to make effective decisions?
We address Bayesian active learning and experimental design problems, where we sequentially select tests to reduce uncertainty about a set of hypotheses.
Instead of minimizing uncertainty per se, we consider a set of overlapping decision regions of these hypotheses.
Our goal is to drive uncertainty into a single decision region as quickly as possible.
