Robust search procedures are a central component in the design of black-box constraint-programming solvers.
This paper proposes activity-based search, the idea of using the activity of variables during propagation to guide the search.
Activity-based search was compared experimentally to impact-based search and the WDEG heuristics.
Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that activity-based search is more robust than other heuristics and may produce significant improvements in performance.
