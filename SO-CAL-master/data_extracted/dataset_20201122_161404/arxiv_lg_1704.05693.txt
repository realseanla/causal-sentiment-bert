We study the problem of mapping an input image to a tied pair consisting of a vector of parameters and an image that is created using a graphical engine from the vector of parameters.
The mapping's objective is to have the output image as similar as possible to the input image.
During training, no supervision is given in the form of matching inputs and outputs.
