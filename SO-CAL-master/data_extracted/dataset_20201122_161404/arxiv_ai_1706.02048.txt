Epistemic logic with non-standard knowledge operators, especially the "knowing-value" operator, has recently gathered much attention.
With the "knowing-value" operator, we can express knowledge of individual variables, but not of the relations between them in general.
In this paper, we propose a new operator Kf to express knowledge of the functional dependencies between variables.
The semantics of this Kf operator uses a function domain which imposes a constraint on what counts as a functional dependency relation.
By adjusting this function domain, different interesting logics arise, and in this paper we axiomatize three such logics in a single agent setting.
Then we show how these three logics can be unified by allowing the function domain to vary relative to different agents and possible worlds.
A multiagent axiomatization is given in this case.
