Knowledge representation and reasoning capacities are vital to cognitive robotics because they provide higher level cognitive functions for reasoning about actions, environments, goals, perception, etc.
Although Answer Set Programming (ASP) is well suited for modelling such functions, there was so far no seamless way to use ASP in a robotic environment.
We address this shortcoming and show how a recently developed reactive ASP system can be harnessed to provide appropriate reasoning capacities within a robotic system.
To be more precise, we furnish a package integrating the reactive ASP solver oClingo with the popular open-source robotic middleware ROS.
The resulting system, ROSoClingo, provides a generic way by which an ASP program can be used to control the behaviour of a robot and to respond to the results of the robot's actions.
