The holy Quran is the holy book of the Muslims.
It contains information about many domains.
Often people search for particular concepts of holy Quran based on the relations among concepts.
An ontological modeling of holy Quran can be useful in such a scenario.
In this paper, we have modeled nature related concepts of holy Quran using OWL (Web Ontology Language) / RDF (Resource Description Framework).
Our methodology involves identifying nature related concepts mentioned in holy Quran and identifying relations among those concepts.
These concepts and relations are represented as classes/instances and properties of an OWL ontology.
Later, in the result section it is shown that, using the Ontological model, SPARQL queries can retrieve verses and concepts of interest.
Thus, this modeling helps semantic search and query on the holy Quran.
In this work, we have used English translation of the holy Quran by Sahih International, Protege OWL Editor and for querying we have used SPARQL.
