This article describes the systems jointly submitted by Institute for Infocomm (I$^2$R), the Laboratoire d'Informatique de l'Universit\'e du Maine (LIUM), Nanyang Technology University (NTU) and the University of Eastern Finland (UEF) for 2015 NIST Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE).
The submitted system is a fusion of nine sub-systems based on i-vectors extracted from different types of features.
Given the i-vectors, several classifiers are adopted for the language detection task including support vector machines (SVM), multi-class logistic regression (MCLR), Probabilistic Linear Discriminant Analysis (PLDA) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
