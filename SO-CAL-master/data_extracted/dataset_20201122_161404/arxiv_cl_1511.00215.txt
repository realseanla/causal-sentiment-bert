Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (BLSTM-RNN) has been shown to be very effective for modeling and predicting sequential data, e.g.
speech utterances or handwritten documents.
In this study, we propose to use BLSTM-RNN for a unified tagging solution that can be applied to various tagging tasks including part-of-speech tagging, chunking and named entity recognition.
Instead of exploiting specific features carefully optimized for each task, our solution only uses one set of task-independent features and internal representations learnt from unlabeled text for all tasks.Requiring no task specific knowledge or sophisticated feature engineering, our approach gets nearly state-of-the-art performance in all these three tagging tasks.
