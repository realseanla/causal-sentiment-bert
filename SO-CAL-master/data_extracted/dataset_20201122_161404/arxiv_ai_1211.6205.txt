In this paper, first we present a new explanation for the relation between logical circuits and artificial neural networks, logical circuits and fuzzy logic, and artificial neural networks and fuzzy inference systems.
Then, based on these results, we propose a new neuro-fuzzy computing system which can effectively be implemented on the memristor-crossbar structure.
One important feature of the proposed system is that its hardware can directly be trained using the Hebbian learning rule and without the need to any optimization.
The system also has a very good capability to deal with huge number of input-out training data without facing problems like overtraining.
