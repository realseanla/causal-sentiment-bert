The problem we address is the following: how can a user employ a predictive model that is held by a third party, without compromising private information.
For example, a hospital may wish to use a cloud service to predict the readmission risk of a patient.
However, due to regulations, the patient's medical files cannot be revealed.
The goal is to make an inference using the model, without jeopardizing the accuracy of the prediction or the privacy of the data.
