Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a well-established paradigm of declarative programming that has been developed in the field of non-monotonic reasoning and logic programming.
Advances in ASP solving technology are customarily assessed in competition events, as it happens for other closely-related problemsolving technologies such as SAT/SMT, QBF, Planning and Scheduling etc.
ASP Competitions are (usually) biennial events, but the 5th edition departs from this tradition in order to be present in the FLoC Olympic Games of the Vienna Summer of Logic (VSL) 2014, which will be the largest event in the history of logic.
