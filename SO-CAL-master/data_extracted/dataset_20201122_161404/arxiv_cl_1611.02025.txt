The timeline generation task summarises an entity's biography by selecting stories representing key events from a large pool of relevant documents.
This paper addresses the lack of a standard dataset and evaluative methodology for the problem.
We present and make publicly available a new dataset of 18,793 news articles covering 39 entities.
For each entity, we provide a gold standard timeline and a set of entity-related articles.
We propose ROUGE as an evaluation metric and validate our dataset by showing that top Google results outperform straw-man baselines.
