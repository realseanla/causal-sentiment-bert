It is today accepted that matrix factorization models allow a high quality of rating prediction in recommender systems.
However, a major drawback of matrix factorization is its static nature that results in a progressive declining of the accuracy of the predictions after each factorization.
This is due to the fact that the new obtained ratings are not taken into account until a new factorization is computed, which can not be done very often because of the high cost of matrix factorization.
