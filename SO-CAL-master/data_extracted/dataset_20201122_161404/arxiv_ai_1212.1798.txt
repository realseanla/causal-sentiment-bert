This paper describes a new approach allowing the generation of a simplified Biped gait.
This approach combines a classical dynamic modeling with an inverse kinematics' solver based on particle swarm optimization, PSO.
First, an inverted pendulum, IP, is used to obtain a simplified dynamic model of the robot and to compute the target position of a key point in biped locomotion, the Centre Of Mass, COM.
The proposed algorithm, called IK-PSO, Inverse Kinematics PSO, returns and inverse kinematics solution corresponding to that COM respecting the joints constraints.
In This paper the inertia weight PSO variant is used to generate a possible solution according to the stability based fitness function and a set of joints motions constraints.
The method is applied with success to a leg motion generation.
Since based on a pre-calculated COM, that satisfied the biped stability, the proposal allowed also to plan a walk with application on a small size biped robot.
