This paper presents the design and development of a proposed rule based Decision Support System that will help students in selecting the best suitable faculty/major decision while taking admission in Gomal University, Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan.
The basic idea of our approach is to design a model for testing and measuring the student capabilities like intelligence, understanding, comprehension, mathematical concepts plus his/her past academic record plus his/her intelligence level, and applying the module results to a rule-based decision support system to determine the compatibility of those capabilities with the available faculties/majors in Gomal University.
The result is shown as a list of suggested faculties/majors with the student capabilities and abilities.
