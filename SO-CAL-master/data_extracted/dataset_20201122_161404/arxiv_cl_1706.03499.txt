This paper describes the Stockholm University/University of Groningen (SU-RUG) system for the SIGMORPHON 2017 shared task on morphological inflection.
Our system is based on an attentional sequence-to-sequence neural network model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells, with joint training of morphological inflection and the inverse transformation, i.e.
lemmatization and morphological analysis.
Our system outperforms the baseline with a large margin, and our submission ranks as the 4th best team for the track we participate in (task 1, high-resource).
