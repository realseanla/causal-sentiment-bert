Many efforts have been dedicated to identifying restrictions on ontologies expressed as tuple-generating dependencies (tgds), a.k.a.
existential rules, that lead to the decidability for the problem of answering ontology-mediated queries (OMQs).
This has given rise to three families of formalisms: guarded, non-recursive, and sticky sets of tgds.
In this work, we study the containment problem for OMQs expressed in such formalisms, which is a key ingredient for solving static analysis tasks associated with them.
Our main contribution is the development of specially tailored techniques for OMQ containment under the classes of tgds stated above.
This enables us to obtain sharp complexity bounds for the problems at hand.
We also apply our techniques to pinpoint the complexity of problems associated with two emerging applications of OMQ containment: distribution over components and UCQ rewritability of OMQs.
