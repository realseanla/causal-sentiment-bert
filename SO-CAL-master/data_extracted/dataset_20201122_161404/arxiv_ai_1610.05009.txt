Accurate prediction of wind ramp events is critical for ensuring the reliability and stability of the power systems with high penetration of wind energy.
This paper proposes a classification based approach for estimating the future class of wind ramp event based on certain thresholds.
A parallelized gradient boosted regression tree based technique has been proposed to accurately classify the normal as well as rare extreme wind power ramp events.
The model has been validated using wind power data obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory database.
Performance comparison with several benchmark techniques indicates the superiority of the proposed technique in terms of superior classification accuracy.
