In this paper one presents new similarity, cardinality and entropy measures for bipolar fuzzy set and for its particular forms like intuitionistic, paraconsistent and fuzzy set.
All these are constructed in the framework of multi-valued representations and are based on a penta-valued logic that uses the following logical values: true, false, unknown, contradictory and ambiguous.
Also a new distance for bounded real interval was defined.
