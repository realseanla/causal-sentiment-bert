We consider the problem of performing community detection on a network, while maintaining privacy, assuming that the adversary has access to an auxiliary correlated network.
We ask the question "Does there exist a regime where the network cannot be deanonymized perfectly, yet the community structure could be learned?."
To answer this question, we derive information theoretic converses for the perfect deanonymization problem using the Stochastic Block Model and edge sub-sampling.
We also provide an almost tight achievability result for perfect deanonymization.
