Text summarization is a process to produce an abstract or a summary by selecting significant portion of the information from one or more texts.
In an automatic text summarization process, a text is given to the computer and the computer returns a shorter less redundant extract or abstract of the original text(s).
Many techniques have been developed for summarizing English text(s).
But, a very few attempts have been made for Bengali text summarization.
This paper presents a method for Bengali text summarization which extracts important sentences from a Bengali document to produce a summary.
