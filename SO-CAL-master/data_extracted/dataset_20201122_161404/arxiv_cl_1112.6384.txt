Grishin's generalization of Lambek's Syntactic Calculus combines a non-commutative multiplicative conjunction and its residuals (product, left and right division) with a dual family: multiplicative disjunction, right and left difference.
Interaction between these two families takes the form of linear distributivity principles.
We study proof nets for the Lambek-Grishin calculus and the correspondence between these nets and unfocused and focused versions of its sequent calculus.
