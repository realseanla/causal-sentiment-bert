Medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention problems are increasingly being addressed with deep-learning-based solutions.
This has resulted is substantial duplication of effort and incompatible infrastructure across many research groups.
This work presents the open-source NiftyNet platform for deep learning in medical imaging.
The ambition of NiftyNet is to accelerate and simplify the development of these solutions, and to provide a common mechanism for disseminating research outputs for the community to use, adapt and build upon.
This TensorFlow-based infrastructure provides a complete modular deep learning pipeline for a range of medical imaging applications including segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications with data loading, data augmentation, network architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics that are tailored to, and take advantage of, the idiosyncracies of medical image analysis and computer-assisted interventions.
