We classify digits of real-world house numbers using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets).
ConvNets are hierarchical feature learning neural networks whose structure is biologically inspired.
Unlike many popular vision approaches that are hand-designed, ConvNets can automatically learn a unique set of features optimized for a given task.
We augmented the traditional ConvNet architecture by learning multi-stage features and by using Lp pooling and establish a new state-of-the-art of 94.85 percent accuracy on the SVHN dataset (45.2 percent error improvement).
Furthermore, we analyze the benefits of different pooling methods and multi-stage features in ConvNets.
