This paper presents a Bayesian method for constructing Bayesian belief networks from a database of cases.
Potential applications include computer-assisted hypothesis testing, automated scientific discovery, and automated construction of probabilistic expert systems.
Results are presented of a preliminary evaluation of an algorithm for constructing a belief network from a database of cases.
We relate the methods in this paper to previous work, and we discuss open problems.
