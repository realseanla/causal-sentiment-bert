This paper shows how Long Short-term Memory recurrent neural networks can be used to generate complex sequences with long-range structure, simply by predicting one data point at a time.
The approach is demonstrated for text (where the data are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are real-valued).
It is then extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the network to condition its predictions on a text sequence.
The resulting system is able to generate highly realistic cursive handwriting in a wide variety of styles.
