This paper presents a state-of-the-art system for Vietnamese Named Entity Recognition (NER).
By incorporating automatic syntactic features with word embeddings as input for bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), our system, although simpler than some deep learning architectures, achieves a much better result for Vietnamese NER.
The proposed method achieves an overall F1 score of 92.05 percent on the test set of an evaluation campaign, organized in late 2016 by the Vietnamese Language and Speech Processing (VLSP) community.
Our named entity recognition system outperforms the best previous systems for Vietnamese NER by a large margin.
