With the accelerated development of robot technologies, optimal control becomes one of the central themes of research.
In traditional approaches, the controller, by its internal functionality, finds appropriate actions on the basis of the history of sensor values, guided by the goals, intentions, objectives, learning schemes, and so on planted into it.
The idea is that the controller controls the world---the body plus its environment---as reliably as possible.
This paper advocates for a new paradigm of control, obtained by making the world control its controller in the first place.
The paper presents a solution with a controller that is devoid of any functionalities of its own, given by a fixed, explicit and context-free function of the recent history of the sensor values.
When applying this controller to a muscle-tendon driven arm-shoulder system from the Myorobotics toolkit, we observe a vast variety of self-organized behavior patterns: when left alone, the arm realizes pseudo-random sequences of different poses but one can also manipulate the system into definite motion patterns.
But most interestingly, after attaching an object, the controller gets in a functional resonance with the object's internal dynamics: when given a half-filled bottle, the system spontaneously starts shaking the bottle so that maximum response from the dynamics of the water is being generated.
After attaching a pendulum to the arm, the controller drives the pendulum into a circular mode.
In this way, the robot discovers affordances of objects its body is interacting with.
We also discuss perspectives for using this controller paradigm for intention driven behavior generation.
