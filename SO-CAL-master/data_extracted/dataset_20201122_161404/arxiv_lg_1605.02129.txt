The Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 (DSTC 4) proposes several pilot tasks.
In this paper, we focus on the spoken language understanding pilot task, which consists of tagging a given utterance with speech acts and semantic slots.
We compare different classifiers: the best system obtains 0.52 and 0.67 F1-scores on the test set for speech act recognition for the tourist and the guide respectively, and 0.52 F1-score for semantic tagging for both the guide and the tourist.
