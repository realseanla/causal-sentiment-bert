We propose novel methods of solving two tasks using Convolutional Neural Networks, firstly the task of generating HDR map of a static scene using differently exposed LDR images of the scene captured using conventional cameras and secondly the task of finding an optimal tone mapping operator that would give a better score on the TMQI metric compared to the existing methods.
We quantitatively show the performance of our networks and illustrate the cases where our networks performs good as well as bad.
