This paper considers a general data-fitting problem over a networked system, in which many computing nodes are connected by an undirected graph.
This kind of problem can find many real-world applications and has been studied extensively in the literature.
However, existing solutions either need a central controller for information sharing or requires slot synchronization among different nodes, which increases the difficulty of practical implementations, especially for a very large and heterogeneous system.
