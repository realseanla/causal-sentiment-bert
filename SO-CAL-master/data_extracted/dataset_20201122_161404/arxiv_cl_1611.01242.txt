Recent work in semantic parsing for question answering has focused on long and complicated questions, many of which would seem unnatural if asked in a normal conversation between two humans.
In an effort to explore a conversational QA setting, we present a more realistic task: answering sequences of simple but inter-related questions.
We collect a dataset of 6,066 question sequences that inquire about semi-structured tables from Wikipedia, with 17,553 question-answer pairs in total.
Existing QA systems face two major problems when evaluated on our dataset: (1) handling questions that contain coreferences to previous questions or answers, and (2) matching words or phrases in a question to corresponding entries in the associated table.
We conclude by proposing strategies to handle both of these issues.
