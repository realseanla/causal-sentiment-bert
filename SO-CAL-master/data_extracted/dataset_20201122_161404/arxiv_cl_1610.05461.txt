The language that we produce reflects our personality, and various personal and demographic characteristics can be detected in natural language texts.
We focus on one particular personal trait, gender, and study how it is manifested in original texts and in translations.
We show that gender has a powerful, clear signal in originals, but this signal is obfuscated in human and machine translation.
We then propose simple domain-adaptation techniques that help retain the original gender traits in the translation outcome, without harming the quality of the translation, thereby creating more personalized machine translation systems.
