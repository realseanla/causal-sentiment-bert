This work describes a methodology to combine logic-based systems and connectionist systems.
Our approach uses finite truth valued {\L}ukasiewicz logic, where we take advantage of fact what in this type of logics every connective can be define by a neuron in an artificial network having by activation function the identity truncated to zero and one.
This allowed the injection of first-order formulas in a network architecture, and also simplified symbolic rule extraction.
