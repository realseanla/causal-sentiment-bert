This paper describes a new spoken dialog portal that connects systems produced by the spoken dialog academic research community and gives them access to real users.
We introduce a distributed, multi-modal, multi-agent prototype dialog framework that affords easy integration with various remote resources, ranging from end-to-end dialog systems to external knowledge APIs.
To date, the DialPort portal has successfully connected to the multi-domain spoken dialog system at Cambridge University, the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather API and the Yelp API.
