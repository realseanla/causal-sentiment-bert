This paper presents a hybrid dialog state tracker that combines a rule based and a machine learning based approach to belief state tracking.
Therefore, we call it a hybrid tracker.
The machine learning in our tracker is realized by a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network.
To our knowledge, our hybrid tracker sets a new state-of-the-art result for the Dialog State Tracking Challenge (DSTC) 2 dataset when the system uses only live SLU as its input.
