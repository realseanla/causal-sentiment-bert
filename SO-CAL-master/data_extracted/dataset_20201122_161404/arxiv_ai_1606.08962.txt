In this paper, a novel multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) methodology is presented for assessing and prioritizing medical tourism destinations in uncertain environment.
A systematic evaluation and assessment method is proposed by integrating rough number based AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) and rough number based MABAC (Multi-Attributive Border Approximation area Comparison).
Rough number is used to aggregate individual judgments and preferences to deal with vagueness in decision making due to limited data.
Rough AHP analyzes the relative importance of criteria based on their preferences given by experts.
Rough MABAC evaluates the alternative sites based on the criteria weights.
The proposed methodology is explained through a case study considering different cities for healthcare service in India.
The validity of the obtained ranking for the given decision making problem is established by testing criteria proposed by Wang and Triantaphyllou (2008) along with further analysis and discussion.
