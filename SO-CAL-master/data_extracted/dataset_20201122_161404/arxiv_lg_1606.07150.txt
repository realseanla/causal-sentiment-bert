It is well-known that malware constantly evolves so as to evade detection and this causes the entire malware population to be non-stationary.
Contrary to this fact, prior works on machine learning based Android malware detection have assumed that the distribution of the observed malware characteristics (i.e., features) do not change over time.
In this work, we address the problem of malware population drift and propose a novel online machine learning based framework, named DroidOL to handle it and effectively detect malware.
In order to perform accurate detection, security-sensitive behaviors are captured from apps in the form of inter-procedural control-flow sub-graph features using a state-of-the-art graph kernel.
In order to perform scalable detection and to adapt to the drift and evolution in malware population, an online passive-aggressive classifier is used.
