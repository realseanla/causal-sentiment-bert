Probabilistic programming is related to a compositional approach to stochastic modeling by switching from discrete to continuous time dynamics.
In continuous time, an operator-algebra semantics is available in which processes proceeding in parallel (and possibly interacting) have summed time-evolution operators.
From this foundation, algorithms for simulation, inference and model reduction may be systematically derived.
The useful consequences are potentially far-reaching in computational science, machine learning and beyond.
Hybrid compositional stochastic modeling/probabilistic programming approaches may also be possible.
