Observational studies are based on accurate assessment of human state.
A behavior recognition system that models interlocutors' state in real-time can significantly aid the mental health domain.
However, behavior recognition from speech remains a challenging task since it is difficult to find generalizable and representative features because of noisy and high-dimensional data, especially when data is limited and annotated coarsely and subjectively.
Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have shown promise in a wide range of machine learning tasks, but for Behavioral Signal Processing (BSP) tasks their application has been constrained due to limited quantity of data.
We propose a Sparsely-Connected and Disjointly-Trained DNN (SD-DNN) framework to deal with limited data.
First, we break the acoustic feature set into subsets and train multiple distinct classifiers.
Then, the hidden layers of these classifiers become parts of a deeper network that integrates all feature streams.
The overall system allows for full connectivity while limiting the number of parameters trained at any time and allows convergence possible with even limited data.
We present results on multiple behavior codes in the couples' therapy domain and demonstrate the benefits in behavior classification accuracy.
We also show the viability of this system towards live behavior annotations.
