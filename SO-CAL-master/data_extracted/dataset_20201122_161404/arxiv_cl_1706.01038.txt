Legal professionals worldwide are currently trying to get up-to-pace with the explosive growth in legal document availability through digital means.
This drives a need for high efficiency Legal Information Retrieval (IR) and Question Answering (QA) methods.
The IR task in particular has a set of unique challenges that invite the use of semantic motivated NLP techniques.
In this work, a two-stage method for Legal Information Retrieval is proposed, combining lexical statistics and distributional sentence representations in the context of Competition on Legal Information Extraction/Entailment (COLIEE).
The combination is done with the use of disambiguation rules, applied over the rankings obtained through n-gram statistics.
After the ranking is done, its results are evaluated for ambiguity, and disambiguation is done if a result is decided to be unreliable for a given query.
Competition and experimental results indicate small gains in overall retrieval performance using the proposed approach.
Additionally, an analysis of error and improvement cases is presented for a better understanding of the contributions.
