Recently deeplearning models have been shown to be capable of making remarkable performance in sentences and documents classification tasks.
In this work, we propose a novel framework called AC-BLSTM for modeling setences and documents, which combines the asymmetric convolution neural network (ACNN) with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BLSTM).
Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on all six tasks, including sentiment analysis, question type classification, and subjectivity classification.
