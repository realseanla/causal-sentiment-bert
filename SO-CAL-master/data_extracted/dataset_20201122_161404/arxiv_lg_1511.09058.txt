For distribution regression problem, where a bag of $x$--observations is mapped to a single $y$ value, a one--step solution is proposed.
The problem of random distribution to random value is transformed to random vector to random value by taking distribution moments of $x$ observations in a bag as random vector.
Then Radon--Nikodym or least squares theory can be applied, what give $y(x)$ estimator.
The probability distribution of $y$ is also obtained, what requires solving generalized eigenvalues problem, matrix spectrum (not depending on $x$) give possible $y$ outcomes and depending on $x$ probabilities of outcomes can be obtained by projecting the distribution with fixed $x$ value (delta--function) to corresponding eigenvector.
A library providing numerically stable polynomial basis for these calculations is available, what make the proposed approach practical.
