In the recent years a number of parameter-free algorithms for online linear optimization over Hilbert spaces and for learning with expert advice have been developed.
While these two families of algorithms might seem different to a distract eye, the proof methods are indeed very similar, making the reader wonder if such a connection is only accidental.
