Wikipedia entity pages are a valuable source of information for direct consumption and for knowledge-base construction, update and maintenance.
Facts in these entity pages are typically supported by references.
Recent studies show that as much as 20\ percent of the references are from online news sources.
However, many entity pages are incomplete even if relevant information is already available in existing news articles.
Even for the already present references, there is often a delay between the news article publication time and the reference time.
In this work, we therefore look at Wikipedia through the lens of news and propose a novel news-article suggestion task to improve news coverage in Wikipedia, and reduce the lag of newsworthy references.
Our work finds direct application, as a precursor, to Wikipedia page generation and knowledge-base acceleration tasks that rely on relevant and high quality input sources.
