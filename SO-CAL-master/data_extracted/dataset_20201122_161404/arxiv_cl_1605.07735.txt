The report presents the process of planning, designing and the development of a database of spoken children's speech whose native language is Bulgarian.
The proposed model is designed for children between the age of 4 and 6 without speech disorders, and reflects their specific capabilities.
At this age most children cannot read, there is no sustained concentration, they are emotional, etc.
The aim is to unite all the media information accompanying the recording and processing of spoken speech, thereby to facilitate the work of researchers in the field of speech recognition.
This database will be used for the development of systems for children's speech recognition, children's speech synthesis systems, games which allow voice control, etc.
As a result of the proposed model a prototype system for speech recognition is presented.
