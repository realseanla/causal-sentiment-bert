A particular case of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) was introduced at the beginning of the 2000s under the name of Echo State Networks (ESNs).
The ESN model overcomes the limitations during the training of the RNNs while introducing no significant disadvantages.
Although the model presents some well-identified drawbacks when the parameters are not well initialised.
The performance of an ESN is highly dependent on its internal parameters and pattern of connectivity of the hidden-hidden weights Often, the tuning of the network parameters can be hard and can impact in the accuracy of the models.
