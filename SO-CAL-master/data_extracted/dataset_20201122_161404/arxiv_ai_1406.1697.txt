Decision making is still an open issue in the application of Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.
A lot of works have been presented for it.
In the transferable belief model (TBM), pignistic probabilities based on the basic probability as- signments are used for decision making.
In this paper, multiscale probability transformation of basic probability assignment based on the belief function and the plausibility function is proposed, which is a generalization of the pignistic probability transformation.
In the multiscale probability function, a factor q based on the Tsallis entropy is used to make the multiscale prob- abilities diversified.
An example is shown that the multiscale probability transformation is more reasonable in the decision making.
