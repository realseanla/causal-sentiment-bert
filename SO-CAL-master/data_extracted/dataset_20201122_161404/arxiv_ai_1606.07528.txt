In this paper, we introduce a lightweight dynamic epistemic logical framework for automated planning under initial uncertainty.
We reduce plan verification and conformant planning to model checking problems of our logic.
We show that the model checking problem of the iteration-free fragment is PSPACE-complete.
By using two non-standard (but equivalent) semantics, we give novel model checking algorithms to the full language and the iteration-free language.
