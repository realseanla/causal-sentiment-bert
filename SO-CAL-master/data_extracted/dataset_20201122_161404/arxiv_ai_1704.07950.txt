In this extended abstract, we propose Structured Production Systems (SPS), which extend traditional production systems with well-formed syntactic structures.
Due to the richness of structures, structured production systems significantly enhance the expressive power as well as the flexibility of production systems, for instance, to handle uncertainty.
We show that different rule application strategies can be reduced into the basic one by utilizing structures.
Also, many fundamental approaches in computer science, including automata, grammar and logic, can be captured by structured production systems.
