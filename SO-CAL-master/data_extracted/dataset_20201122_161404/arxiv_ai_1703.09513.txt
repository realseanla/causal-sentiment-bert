The exponential explosion of the set of patterns is one of the main challenges in pattern mining.
This challenge is approached by introducing a constraint for pattern selection.
One of the first constraints proposed in pattern mining is support (frequency) of a pattern in a dataset.
Frequency is an anti-monotonic function, i.e., given an infrequent pattern, all its superpatterns are not frequent.
However, many other constraints for pattern selection are neither monotonic nor anti-monotonic, which makes it difficult to generate patterns satisfying these constraints.
