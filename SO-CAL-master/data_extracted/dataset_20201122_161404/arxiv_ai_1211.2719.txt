In cognitive sciences it is not uncommon to use various games effectively.
For example, in artificial intelligence, the RoboCup initiative was to set up to catalyse research on the field of autonomous agent technology.
In this paper, we introduce a similar soccer simulation initiative to try to investigate a model of human consciousness and a notion of reality in the form of a cognitive problem.
In addition, for example, the home pitch advantage and the objective role of the supporters could be naturally described and discussed in terms of this new soccer simulation model.
