Valuation based systems verifying an idempotent property are studied.
A partial order is defined between the valuations giving them a lattice structure.
Then, two different strategies are introduced to represent valuations: as infimum of the most informative valuations or as supremum of the least informative ones.
It is studied how to carry out computations with both representations in an efficient way.
The particular cases of finite sets and convex polytopes are considered.
