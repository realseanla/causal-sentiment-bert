Deep Learning's recent successes have mostly relied on Convolutional Networks, which exploit fundamental statistical properties of images, sounds and video data: the local stationarity and multi-scale compositional structure, that allows expressing long range interactions in terms of shorter, localized interactions.
However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities.
