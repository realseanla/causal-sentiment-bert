A new approach to the study of Generalized Graphs as semantic data structures using machine learning techniques is presented.
We show how vector representations maintaining semantic characteristics of the original data can be obtained from a given graph using neural encoding architectures and considering the topological properties of the graph.
Semantic features of these new representations are tested by using some machine learning tasks and new directions on efficient link discovery, entitity retrieval and long distance query methodologies on large relational datasets are investigated using real datasets.
