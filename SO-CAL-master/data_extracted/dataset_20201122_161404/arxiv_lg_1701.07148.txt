Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has shown a great success in many areas including complex image classification tasks.
However, they need a lot of memory and computational cost, which hinders them from running in relatively low-end smart devices such as smart phones.
We propose a CNN compression method based on CP-decomposition and Tensor Power Method.
We also propose an iterative fine tuning, with which we fine-tune the whole network after decomposing each layer, but before decomposing the next layer.
Significant reduction in memory and computation cost is achieved compared to state-of-the-art previous work with no more accuracy loss.
