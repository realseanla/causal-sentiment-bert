In real-time speech recognition applications, the latency is an important issue.
We have developed a character-level incremental speech recognition (ISR) system that responds quickly even during the speech, where the hypotheses are gradually improved while the speaking proceeds.
The algorithm employs a speech-to-character unidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN), which is end-to-end trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC), and an RNN-based character-level language model (LM).
The output values of the CTC-trained RNN are character-level probabilities, which are processed by beam search decoding.
The RNN LM augments the decoding by providing long-term dependency information.
We propose tree-based online beam search with additional depth-pruning, which enables the system to process infinitely long input speech with low latency.
This system not only responds quickly on speech but also can dictate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words according to pronunciation.
The proposed model achieves the word error rate (WER) of 8.90 percent on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Nov'92 20K evaluation set when trained on the WSJ SI-284 training set.
