This document should serve as a quick reference for and guide to the implementation of linear GQ($\lambda$), a gradient-based off-policy temporal-difference learning algorithm.
Explanation of the intuition and theory behind the algorithm are provided elsewhere (e.g., Maei &amp; Sutton 2010, Maei 2011).
If you questions or concerns about the content in this document or the attached java code please email Adam White (adam.white@ualberta.ca).
