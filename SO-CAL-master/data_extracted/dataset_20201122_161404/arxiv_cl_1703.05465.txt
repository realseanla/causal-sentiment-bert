This paper describes a neural-network model which performed competitively (top 6) at the SemEval 2017 cross-lingual Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task.
Our system employs an attention-based recurrent neural network model that optimizes the sentence similarity.
In this paper, we describe our participation in the multilingual STS task which measures similarity across English, Spanish, and Arabic.
