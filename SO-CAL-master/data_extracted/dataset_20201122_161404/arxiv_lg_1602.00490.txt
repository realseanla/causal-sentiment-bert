Previous research has shown that information can be extracted from encrypted multimedia streams.
This includes video titles classification of non HTTP adaptive streams (non-HAS).
This paper presents an algorithm for \emph{encrypted HTTP adaptive video streaming title classification}.
We evaluated our algorithm on a new YouTube popular videos dataset that was collected from the internet under real-world network conditions.
We provide the dataset and the crawler for future research.
Our algorithm's classification accuracy is 98\ percent.
