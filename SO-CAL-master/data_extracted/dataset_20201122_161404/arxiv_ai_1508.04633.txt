DAGitty is a software for drawing and analyzing causal diagrams, also known as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
Functions include identification of minimal sufficient adjustment sets for estimating causal effects, diagnosis of insufficient or invalid adjustment via the identification of biasing paths, identification of instrumental variables, and derivation of testable implications.
DAGitty is provided in the hope that it is useful for researchers and students in Epidemiology, Sociology, Psychology, and other empirical disciplines.
The software should run in any web browser that supports modern JavaScript, HTML, and SVG.
This is the user manual for DAGitty version 2.3.
The manual is updated with every release of a new stable version.
DAGitty is available at dagitty.net.
