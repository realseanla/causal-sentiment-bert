The research of personalized recommendation techniques today has mostly parted into two mainstream directions, i.e., the factorization-based approaches and topic models.
Practically, they aim to benefit from the numerical ratings and textual reviews, correspondingly, which compose two major information sources in various real-world systems.
However, although the two approaches are supposed to be correlated for their same goal of accurate recommendation, there still lacks a clear theoretical understanding of how their objective functions can be mathematically bridged to leverage the numerical ratings and textual reviews collectively, and why such a bridge is intuitively reasonable to match up their learning procedures for the rating prediction and top-N recommendation tasks, respectively.
