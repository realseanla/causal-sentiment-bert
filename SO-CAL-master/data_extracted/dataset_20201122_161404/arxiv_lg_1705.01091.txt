We consider a sequence of repeated prediction games and formally pass to the limit.
The supersolutions of the resulting non-linear parabolic partial differential equation are closely related to the potential functions in the sense of N.\,Cesa-Bianci, G.\,Lugosi (2003).
Any such supersolution gives an upper bound for forecaster's regret and suggests a potential-based prediction strategy, satisfying the Blackwell condition.
A conventional upper bound for the worst-case regret is justified by a simple verification argument.
