We propose Batch-Expansion Training (BET), a framework for running a batch optimizer on a gradually expanding dataset.
As opposed to stochastic approaches, batches do not need to be resampled i.i.d.
at every iteration, thus making BET more resource efficient in a distributed setting, and when disk-access is constrained.
Moreover, BET can be easily paired with most batch optimizers, does not require any parameter-tuning, and compares favorably to existing stochastic and batch methods.
We show that when the batch size grows exponentially with the number of outer iterations, BET achieves optimal $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon)$ data-access convergence rate for strongly convex objectives.
