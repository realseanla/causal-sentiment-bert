Many AI applications rely on knowledge about a relevant real-world domain that is encoded by means of some logical knowledge base (KB).
The most essential benefit of logical KBs is the opportunity to perform automatic reasoning to derive implicit knowledge or to answer complex queries about the modeled domain.
The feasibility of meaningful reasoning requires KBs to meet some minimal quality criteria such as logical consistency.
Without adequate tool assistance, the task of resolving violated quality criteria in KBs can be extremely tough even for domain experts, especially when the problematic KB includes a large number of logical formulas or comprises complicated logical formalisms.
