In probabilistic logic entailments, even moderate size problems can yield linear constraint systems with so many variables that exact methods are impractical.
This difficulty can be remedied in many cases of interest by introducing a three valued logic (true, false, and "don't care").
The three-valued approach allows the construction of "compressed" constraint systems which have the same solution sets as their two-valued counterparts, but which may involve dramatically fewer variables.
Techniques to calculate point estimates for the posterior probabilities of entailed sentences are discussed.
