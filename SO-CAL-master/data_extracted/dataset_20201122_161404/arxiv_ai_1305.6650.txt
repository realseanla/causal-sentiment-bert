Sensory inference under conditions of uncertainty is a major problem in both machine learning and computational neuroscience.
An important but poorly understood aspect of sensory processing is the role of active sensing.
Here, we present a Bayes-optimal inference and control framework for active sensing, C-DAC (Context-Dependent Active Controller).
Unlike previously proposed algorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information maximization (Infomax) [Butko &amp; Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy [Najemnik &amp; Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a combination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and effort.
We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to illustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial and optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly inadequate.
Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we present both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain context-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity.
These approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem involving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC and statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.
