Two extensions to the AMR smatch scoring script are presented.
The first extension com-bines the smatch scoring script with the C6.0 rule-based classifier to produce a human-readable report on the error patterns frequency observed in the scored AMR graphs.
This first extension results in 4 percent gain over the state-of-art CAMR baseline parser by adding to it a manually crafted wrapper fixing the identified CAMR parser errors.
The second extension combines a per-sentence smatch with an en-semble method for selecting the best AMR graph among the set of AMR graphs for the same sentence.
This second modification au-tomatically yields further 0.4 percent gain when ap-plied to outputs of two nondeterministic AMR parsers: a CAMR+wrapper parser and a novel character-level neural translation AMR parser.
For AMR parsing task the character-level neural translation attains surprising 7 percent gain over the carefully optimized word-level neural translation.
Overall, we achieve smatch F1=62 percent on the SemEval-2016 official scor-ing set and F1=67 percent on the LDC2015E86 test set.
