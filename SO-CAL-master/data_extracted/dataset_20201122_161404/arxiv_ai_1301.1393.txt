We present alternative definitions of the first-order stable model semantics and its extension to incorporate generalized quantifiers by referring to the familiar notion of a reduct instead of referring to the SM operator in the original definitions.
Also, we extend the FLP stable model semantics to allow generalized quantifiers by referring to an operator that is similar to the $\sm$ operator.
For a reasonable syntactic class of logic programs, we show that the two stable model semantics of generalized quantifiers are interchangeable.
