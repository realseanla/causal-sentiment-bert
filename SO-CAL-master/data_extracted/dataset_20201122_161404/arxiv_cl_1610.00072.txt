Classical translation models constrain the space of possible outputs by selecting a subset of translation rules based on the input sentence.
Recent work on improving the efficiency of neural translation models adopted a similar strategy by restricting the output vocabulary to a subset of likely candidates given the source.
In this paper we experiment with context and embedding-based selection methods and extend previous work by examining speed and accuracy trade-offs in more detail.
We show that decoding time on CPUs can be reduced by up to 90 percent and training time by 25 percent on the WMT15 English-German and WMT16 English-Romanian tasks at the same or only negligible change in accuracy.
This brings the time to decode with a state of the art neural translation system to just over 140 msec per sentence on a single CPU core for English-German.
