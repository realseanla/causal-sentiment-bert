In this paper, we propose two new features for estimating phrase based machine translation parameters.
We only use monolingual data with the assumption that the phrase table is given to us, but all of its scores have been removed.Our method is based on two recently introduced neural network vector representation models for words and sentences.
It is the first use of these models in an end to end phrase based machine translation system.
Scores obtained from our method can recover more than 80 percent of BLEU loss caused by removing phrase table probabilities.
We also show that our features combined with the phrase table probabilities improve the BLEU score by 0.74 points
