Fixed-point optimization of deep neural networks plays an important role in hardware based design and low-power implementations.
Many deep neural networks show fairly good performance even with 2- or 3-bit precision when quantized weights are fine-tuned by retraining.
We propose an improved fixedpoint optimization algorithm that estimates the quantization step size dynamically during the retraining.
In addition, a gradual quantization scheme is also tested, which sequentially applies fixed-point optimizations from high- to low-precision.
The experiments are conducted for feed-forward deep neural networks (FFDNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
