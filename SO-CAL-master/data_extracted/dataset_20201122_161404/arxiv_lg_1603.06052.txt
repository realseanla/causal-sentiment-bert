The Nystr\"om method has long been popular for scaling up kernel methods.
However, successful use of Nystr\"om depends crucially on the selected landmarks.
We consider landmark selection by using a Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to tractably select a diverse subset from the columns of an input kernel matrix.
We prove that the landmarks selected using DPP sampling enjoy guaranteed error bounds; subsequently, we illustrate impact of DPP-sampled landmarks on kernel ridge regression.
Moreover, we show how to efficiently sample from a DPP in linear time using a fast mixing (under certain constraints) Markov chain, which makes the overall procedure practical.
Empirical results support our theoretical analysis: DPP-based landmark selection shows performance superior to existing approaches.
