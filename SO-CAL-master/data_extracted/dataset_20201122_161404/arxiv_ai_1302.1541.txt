Stochastic algorithms are among the best for solving computationally hard search and reasoning problems.
The runtime of such procedures is characterized by a random variable.
Different algorithms give rise to different probability distributions.
One can take advantage of such differences by combining several algorithms into a portfolio, and running them in parallel or interleaving them on a single processor.
We provide a detailed evaluation of the portfolio approach on distributions of hard combinatorial search problems.
We show under what conditions the protfolio approach can have a dramatic computational advantage over the best traditional methods.
