Traditional manifold learning algorithms often bear an assumption that the local neighborhood of any point on embedded manifold is roughly equal to the tangent space at that point without considering the curvature.
The curvature indifferent way of manifold processing often makes traditional dimension reduction poorly neighborhood preserving.
To overcome this drawback we propose a new algorithm called RF-ML to perform an operation on the manifold with help of Ricci flow before reducing the dimension of manifold.
