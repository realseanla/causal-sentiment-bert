We introduce a natural generalization of submodular set cover and exact active learning with a finite hypothesis class (query learning).
We call this new problem interactive submodular set cover.
Applications include advertising in social networks with hidden information.
We give an approximation guarantee for a greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which matches up to constant factors.
We also discuss the adaptivity gap for the problem and present encouraging early experimental results.
