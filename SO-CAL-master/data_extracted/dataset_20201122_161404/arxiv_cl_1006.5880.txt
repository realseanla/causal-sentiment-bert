The Right Frontier Constraint (RFC), as a constraint on the attachment of new constituents to an existing discourse structure, has important implications for the interpretation of anaphoric elements in discourse and for Machine Learning (ML) approaches to learning discourse structures.
In this paper we provide strong empirical support for SDRT's version of RFC.
The analysis of about 100 doubly annotated documents by five different naive annotators shows that SDRT's RFC is respected about 95 percent of the time.
The qualitative analysis of presumed violations that we have performed shows that they are either click-errors or structural misconceptions.
