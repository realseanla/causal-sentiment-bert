In the data mining field many clustering methods have been proposed, yet standard versions do not take into account uncertain databases.
This paper deals with a new approach to cluster uncertain data by using a hierarchical clustering defined within the belief function framework.
The main objective of the belief hierarchical clustering is to allow an object to belong to one or several clusters.
To each belonging, a degree of belief is associated, and clusters are combined based on the pignistic properties.
Experiments with real uncertain data show that our proposed method can be considered as a propitious tool.
