In this paper, we propose an efficient semidefinite programming (SDP) approach to worst-case linear discriminant analysis (WLDA).
Compared with the traditional LDA, WLDA considers the dimensionality reduction problem from the worst-case viewpoint, which is in general more robust for classification.
However, the original problem of WLDA is non-convex and difficult to optimize.
In this paper, we reformulate the optimization problem of WLDA into a sequence of semidefinite feasibility problems.
To efficiently solve the semidefinite feasibility problems, we design a new scalable optimization method with quasi-Newton methods and eigen-decomposition being the core components.
The proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than standard interior-point based SDP solvers.
