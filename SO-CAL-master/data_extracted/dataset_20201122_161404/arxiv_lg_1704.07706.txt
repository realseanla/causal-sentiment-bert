Performance and high availability have become increasingly important drivers, amongst other drivers, for user retention in the context of web services such as social networks, and web search.
Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance.
Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is non-trivial.
