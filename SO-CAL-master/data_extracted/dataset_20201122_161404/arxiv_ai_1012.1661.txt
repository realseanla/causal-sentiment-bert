Ondex is a data integration and visualization platform developed to support Systems Biology Research.
At its core is a data model based on two main principles: first, all information can be represented as a graph and, second, all elements of the graph can be annotated with ontologies.
This data model is conformant to the Semantic Web framework, in particular to RDF, and therefore Ondex is ideally positioned as a platform that can exploit the semantic web.
