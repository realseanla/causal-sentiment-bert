Abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs) are a powerful generalisation of Dung's abstract argumentation frameworks.
In this paper we present an answer set programming based software system, called DIAMOND (DIAlectical MOdels eNcoDing).
It translates ADFs into answer set programs whose stable models correspond to models of the ADF with respect to several semantics (i.e.
admissible, complete, stable, grounded).
