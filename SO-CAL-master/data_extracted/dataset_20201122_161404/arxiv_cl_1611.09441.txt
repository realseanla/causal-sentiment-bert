Analysing sentiment of tweets is important as it helps to determine the users' opinion.
Knowing people's opinion is crucial for several purposes starting from gathering knowledge about customer base, e-governance, campaigning and many more.
In this report, we aim to develop a system to detect the sentiment from tweets.
We employ several linguistic features along with some other external sources of information to detect the sentiment of a tweet.
We show that augmenting the 140 character-long tweet with information harvested from external urls shared in the tweet as well as Social Media features enhances the sentiment prediction accuracy significantly.
