We present Net2Vec, a flexible high-performance platform that allows the execution of deep learning algorithms in the communication network.
Net2Vec is able to capture data from the network at more than 60Gbps, transform it into meaningful tuples and apply predictions over the tuples in real time.
This platform can be used for different purposes ranging from traffic classification to network performance analysis.
