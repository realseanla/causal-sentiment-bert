This report presents a general model of the architecture of information systems for the speech recognition of children.
It presents a model of the speech data stream and how it works.
The result of these studies and presented veins architectural model shows that research needs to be focused on acoustic-phonetic modeling in order to improve the quality of children's speech recognition and the sustainability of the systems to noise and changes in transmission environment.
Another important aspect is the development of more accurate algorithms for modeling of spontaneous child speech.
