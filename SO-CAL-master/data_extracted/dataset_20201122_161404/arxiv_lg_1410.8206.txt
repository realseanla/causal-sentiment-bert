Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has recently attracted a lot of attention due to the very high performance achieved by deep neural networks in other domains.
An inherent weakness in existing NMT systems is their inability to correctly translate rare words: end-to-end NMTs tend to have relatively small vocabularies with a single "unknown-word" symbol representing every possible out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word.
In this paper, we propose and implement a simple technique to address this problem.
We train an NMT system on data that is augmented by the output of a word alignment algorithm, allowing the NMT system to output, for each OOV word in the target sentence, its corresponding word in the source sentence.
This information is later utilized in a post-processing step that translates every OOV word using a dictionary.
Our experiments on the WMT'14 English to French translation task show that this simple method provides a substantial improvement over an equivalent NMT system that does not use this technique.
The performance of our system achieves a BLEU score of 36.9, which improves the previous best end-to-end NMT by 2.1 points.
Our model matches the performance of the state-of-the-art system while using three times less data.
