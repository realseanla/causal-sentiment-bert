We present a max-margin nonparametric latent feature model, which unites the ideas of max-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics to discover discriminative latent features for link prediction and automatically infer the unknown latent social dimension.
By minimizing a hinge-loss using the linear expectation operator, we can perform posterior inference efficiently without dealing with a highly nonlinear link likelihood function; by using a fully-Bayesian formulation, we can avoid tuning regularization constants.
Experimental results on real datasets appear to demonstrate the benefits inherited from max-margin learning and fully-Bayesian nonparametric inference.
