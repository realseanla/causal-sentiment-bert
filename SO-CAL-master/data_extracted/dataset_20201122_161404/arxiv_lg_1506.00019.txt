Countless learning tasks require awareness of time.
Image captioning, speech synthesis, and video game playing all require that a model generate sequences of outputs.
In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and music information retrieval, a model must learn from sequences of inputs.
Significantly more interactive tasks, such as natural language translation, engaging in dialogue, and robotic control, often demand both.
