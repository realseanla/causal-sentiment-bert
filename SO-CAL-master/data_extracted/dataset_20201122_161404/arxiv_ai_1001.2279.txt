Mamdani Fuzzy Model is an important technique in Computational Intelligence (CI) study.
This paper presents an implementation of a supervised learning method based on membership function training in the context of Mamdani fuzzy models.
Specifically, auto zoom function of a digital camera is modelled using Mamdani technique.
The performance of control method is verified through a series of simulation and numerical results are provided as illustrations.
