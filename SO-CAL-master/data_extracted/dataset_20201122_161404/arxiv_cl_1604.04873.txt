This paper describes an experimental approach to Detection of Minimal Semantic Units and their Meaning (DiMSUM), explored within the framework of SemEval 2016 Task 10.
The approach is primarily based on a combination of word embeddings and parserbased features, and employs unidirectional incremental computation of compositional embeddings for multiword expressions.
