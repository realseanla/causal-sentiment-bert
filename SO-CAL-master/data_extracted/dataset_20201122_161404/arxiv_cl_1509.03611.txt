We describe bilingual English-French and English-German parallel corpora in which the direction of translation is accurately and reliably annotated.
The corpus is diverse, consisting of parliamentary proceedings, literary works, transcripts of TED talks and political commentary.
It will be instrumental for research of translationese and its applications to (human and machine) translation; specifically, it can be used for the task of translationese identification, a research direction that enjoys a growing interest in recent years.
To evaluate the quality of the corpus, we replicate and expand on previous results of supervised identification of translationese, and further extend the experiments to additional datasets, including an additional language pair, and exploiting bilingual information.
