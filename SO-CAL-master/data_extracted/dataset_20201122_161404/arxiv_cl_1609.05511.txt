Multilinear Grammar (MLG) is an approach to integrating the many different syntagmatic structures of language into a coherent architecture, the Rank-Interpretation Architecture.
The architecture defines ranks from discourse structure through utterances, phrasal structures, word structures to speech sounds.
Each rank has its own specific kind of prosodic-phonetic interpretation and semantic-pragmatic interpretation.
Common to models of all these subdomains are models based on regular languages, and processors with finite working memory.
