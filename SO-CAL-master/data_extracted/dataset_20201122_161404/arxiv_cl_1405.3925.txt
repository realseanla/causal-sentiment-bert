In recent years, new developments in the area of lexicography have altered not only the management, processing and publishing of lexicographical data, but also created new types of products such as electronic dictionaries and thesauri.
These expand the range of possible uses of lexical data and support users with more flexibility, for instance in assisting human translation.
In this article, we give a short and easy-to-understand introduction to the problematic nature of the storage, display and interpretation of lexical data.
We then describe the main methods and specifications used to build and represent lexical data.
This paper is targeted for the following groups of people: linguists, lexicographers, IT specialists, computer linguists and all others who wish to learn more about the modelling, representation and visualization of lexical knowledge.
This paper is written in two languages: French and German.
