We consider online learning of ensembles of portfolio selection algorithms and aim to regularize risk by encouraging diversification with respect to a predefined risk-driven grouping of stocks.
Our procedure uses online convex optimization to control capital allocation to underlying investment algorithms while encouraging non-sparsity over the given grouping.
We prove a logarithmic regret for this procedure with respect to the best-in-hindsight ensemble.
We applied the procedure with known mean-reversion portfolio selection algorithms using the standard GICS industry sector grouping.
Empirical Experimental results showed an impressive percentage increase of risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio).
