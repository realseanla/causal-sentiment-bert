This paper proposes Monte Carlo Action Programming, a programming language framework for autonomous systems that act in large probabilistic state spaces with high branching factors.
It comprises formal syntax and semantics of a nondeterministic action programming language.
The language is interpreted stochastically via Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Effectiveness of the approach is shown empirically.
