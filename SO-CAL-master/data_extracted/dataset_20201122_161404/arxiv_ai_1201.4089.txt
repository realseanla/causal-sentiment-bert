This paper provides a self-contained first introduction to description logics (DLs).
The main concepts and features are explained with examples before syntax and semantics of the DL SROIQ are defined in detail.
Additional sections review light-weight DL languages, discuss the relationship to the Web Ontology Language OWL and give pointers to further reading.
