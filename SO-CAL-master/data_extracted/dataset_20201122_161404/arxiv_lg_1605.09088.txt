We present a Bayesian sequential decision-making formulation of the information filtering problem, in which an algorithm presents items (news articles, scientific papers, tweets) arriving in a stream, and learns relevance from user feedback on presented items.
We model user preferences using a Bayesian linear model, similar in spirit to a Bayesian linear bandit.
We compute a computational upper bound on the value of the optimal policy, which allows computing an optimality gap for implementable policies.
We then use this analysis as motivation in introducing a pair of new Decompose-Then-Decide (DTD) heuristic policies, DTD-Dynamic-Programming (DTD-DP) and DTD-Upper-Confidence-Bound (DTD-UCB).
We compare DTD-DP and DTD-UCB against several benchmarks on real and simulated data, demonstrating significant improvement, and show that the achieved performance is close to the upper bound.
