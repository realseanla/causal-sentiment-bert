We present a probabilistic extension of the description logic $\mathcal{ALC}$ for reasoning about statistical knowledge.
We consider conditional statements over proportions of the domain and are interested in the probabilistic-logical consequences of these proportions.
After introducing some general reasoning problems and analyzing their properties, we present first algorithms and complexity results for reasoning in some fragments of Statistical $\mathcal{ALC}$.
