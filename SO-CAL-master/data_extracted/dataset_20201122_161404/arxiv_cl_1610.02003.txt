Machine translation is the discipline concerned with developing automated tools for translating from one human language to another.
Statistical machine translation (SMT) is the dominant paradigm in this field.
In SMT, translations are generated by means of statistical models whose parameters are learned from bilingual data.
Scalability is a key concern in SMT, as one would like to make use of as much data as possible to train better translation systems.
