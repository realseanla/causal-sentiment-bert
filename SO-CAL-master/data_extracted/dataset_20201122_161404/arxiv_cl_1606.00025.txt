In this paper, we outline an approach to build graph based reverse dictionaries using word definitions.
A reverse dictionary takes a phrase as an input and outputs a list of words semantically similar to that phrase, and is a solution to the Tip of the Tongue problem.
We use a distance based similarity measure, computed on the graph, to assess the similarity between a word and the input phrase.
We compare the performance of our approach with the Onelook Reverse Dictionary and a distributional semantics method based on word2vec, and show that our approach is much better than the distributional semantics method, and as good as Onelook's.
