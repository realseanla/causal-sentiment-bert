Recently there has been growing interest in building active visual object recognizers, as opposed to the usual passive recognizers which classifies a given static image into a predefined set of object categories.
In this paper we propose to generalize these recently proposed end-to-end active visual recognizers into a controller-recognizer framework.
A model in the controller-recognizer framework consists of a controller, which interfaces with an external manipulator, and a recognizer which classifies the visual input adjusted by the manipulator.
We describe two most recently proposed controller-recognizer models--recurrent attention model and spatial transformer network-- as representative examples of controller-recognizer models.
Based on this description we observe that most existing end-to-end controller-recognizers tightly, or completely, couple a controller and recognizer.
We ask a question whether this tight coupling is necessary, and try to answer this empirically by building a controller-recognizer model with a decoupled controller and recognizer.
Our experiments revealed that it is not always necessary to tightly couple them and that by decoupling a controller and recognizer, there is a possibility of building a generic controller that is pretrained and works together with any subsequent recognizer.
