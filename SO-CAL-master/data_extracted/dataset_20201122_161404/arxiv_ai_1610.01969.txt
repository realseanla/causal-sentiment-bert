Many malware families utilize domain generation algorithms (DGAs) to establish command and control (C&amp;C) connections.
While there are many methods to pseudorandomly generate domains, we focus in this paper on detecting (and generating) domains on a per-domain basis which provides a simple and flexible means to detect known DGA families.
Recent machine learning approaches to DGA detection have been successful on fairly simplistic DGAs, many of which produce names of fixed length.
However, models trained on limited datasets are somewhat blind to new DGA variants.
