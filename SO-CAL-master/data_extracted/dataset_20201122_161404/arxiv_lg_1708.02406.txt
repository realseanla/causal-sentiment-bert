Conditional probabilities are a core concept in machine learning.
For example, optimal prediction of a label $Y$ given an input $X$ corresponds to maximizing the conditional probability of $Y$ given $X$.
A common approach to inference tasks is learning a model of conditional probabilities.
However, these models are often based on strong assumptions (e.g., log-linear models), and hence their estimate of conditional probabilities is not robust and is highly dependent on the validity of their assumptions.
