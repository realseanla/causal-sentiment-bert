Today's artificial assistants are typically prompted to perform tasks through direct, imperative commands such as \emph{Set a timer} or \emph{Pick up the box}.
However, to progress toward more natural exchanges between humans and these assistants, it is important to understand the way non-imperative utterances can indirectly elicit action of an addressee.
In this paper, we investigate command types in the setting of a grounded, collaborative game.
We focus on a less understood family of utterances for eliciting agent action, locatives like \emph{The chair is in the other room}, and demonstrate how these utterances indirectly command in specific game state contexts.
Our work shows that models with domain-specific grounding can effectively realize the pragmatic reasoning that is necessary for more robust natural language interaction with robots.
