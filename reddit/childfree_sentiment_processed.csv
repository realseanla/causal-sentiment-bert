gez71p8,"So, this year I've been having thoughts that I might be bi. I'll spare you the details on them, what matters is that they appeared out of nowhere without explanation, they stayed, and they were constant. Anyway, I decided that I wouldn't know for sure unless I try so last week I decided to actually do it, I found a guy online and I gave him a blowjob. 

I learned two things from that experience:

1. Blowjobs are actually quite difficult than I imagined and I have gained a lot more respect for people who give them. How difficult was it for me you may ask? My biochemistry course in college felt easier because in that class I was not battling a huge gag reflex during research assignments and tests. 

2. I am absolutely __not__ bi.",25,0,train

A lot of people like that I do that, mostly because none of my co-workers do it. But this one old guy I had never seen before, or if I had I don't remember him, he's emptying his cart and as the lot was empty except his cart, I did my usual thing and stood a short distance away because of the virus, but he sees me and freaks out. He starts barking, ""Get out of here! I don't like you!"" and mumbled something about the cart, then he went to the opposite side of his car from where he started loading and when he finished, rather than leaving it near there and driving away like a normal, sane person, he shoved it away from himself towards the corral he was parked by in an attempt to keep it away from me, ran back into his car, and sped away.

And exploitative. The world of child acting is already a grey enough area with parents profiting hugely from their child's labour, but putting it all out on youtube.

I mean when you have celebrity couples that deliberately don't share their kids lives. No celebrity that I can think of pre-social media ever shared the sheer amount of stuff that some of these parents do.

And we still don't know the long term effect. We don't know how it will impact these children in 18 years trying to apply for college, to have the interviewer look up a video of them getting told off for setting the cat on fire at age 8. We don't know how it's going to be for couple's dating, only to look up videos from 15 years ago and take issue with something said that otherwise would have been a forgotten memory.

gfpghmt,"I know a couple who started IVF in mid spring (you may recognize that as around the time of the initial spike in the US) and announced a pregnancy about a month and a half ago. I was dumbfounded by this. First off, they're like, 26. There's zero rush at that age. Second off, we were at a point in the pandemic where we were seeing just how bad it actually is, so there isn't even the excuse of thinking this would be over in a couple weeks.

I vented about this to a couple friends who don't know the couple. One of them wants kids but is usually reasonable, and one of them is also CF. The responses I got:

* The CF friend told me that 26 is pushing it as far as getting pregnant, and she can understand why you'd do IVF at that point because you're ""running out of time"". To be fair to her, she comes from a family where she's the only one who wasn't pregnant by 21 or so, and her siblings are in their 20s and early 30s with 3+ kids each. She's basically the old maid at 27 with no kids and no plans to have them. Still, 26 is nowhere fucking close to ""running out of time"". I can see that argument for something like 36, but not 26.

* My other friend told me that I'm discriminating against parents and need to stop hating parents so much. Dude, I never said I hate parents. I said I don't get why the fuck you'd do IVF in the middle of a global pandemic. I told him if they want to be parents that badly during something like this, why not go through the adoption process and help a kid in need? His counter was that adoption is expensive and I'm being unrealistic. I pointed out that IVF is also expensive and got ""you don't understand and will never understand because you don't want kids."" I took that as getting a last word in because he didn't have a counter to that. Whatever, we changed the subject and never brought it up again.

It's ridiculous how much some people's brains turn off when baybees are involved. These are the same people who were like ""idk about getting the tattoo you've been waiting for forever now, you don't want to subject yourself to unnecessary medical things during a pandemic..."", but apparently getting pregnant through fertility treatments in the same circumstances is a-ok despite also unnecessarily subjecting yourself to potential medical issues.

gfo3yut,"Hi!

I think, to me, one of the biggest things is the general shift in the situation of society. In the past, for all of human history, each extra human born was essentially to the betterment for everybody in society. Each extra human would:

- On average, have a better life than those of the generation before it

- Would help to grow and develop society

- Would further ensure the survival of that particular society

- Would increase their parent's economic security, especially in their later years


Whereas now, due to limited resources etc, we seem to be reaching a point where that status quo is beginning to flip to the opposite.

- On average, each child born today can expect to have a worse quality of life than those of the generation before it

- Is increasing the burden on society as resources are becoming limited and the Earth's capacity to sustain our population is faltering

- On average, each extra child is therefore decreasing the odds of survival for society

- Children now decrease the economic security of the parents, rather than increase, as the cost of child-rearing has risen sharply and continues to accelerate sharper still. Healthcare and security in later life is now more achievable for those without children than those with

I think it does help also to realise that, whilst we do have a built in need to have sex, there is in fact no evidence for any built in biological or instinctive need for us to have children. Rather, such feelings are entirely a cultural thing, a product of our cultural beliefs and upbringing, which may have in turn perhaps ultimately been influenced by our governments wanting their citizens to reproduce for the increased economic and military power that each extra human provided! Historically, there hasn't been as much evidence for humans on the whole thinking the same way about children. For the vast majority of human history, they were somewhat unavoidable (unless you remained abstinent) and were accepted as such, some loved them, some didn't, many parents routinely abandoned their kids, neglected them, or had them merely to do labour for them. So it may help to consider that the recent cultural zeitgeist/popularity around having children and the image of the nuclear family has only existed for roughly the last 100 years or so, may have been influenced by governmental media propaganda, and now seems to be on it's way to probably changing again, on a somewhat natural course. If in the future, theres a big nuclear war or something and most of humanity is wiped out, you might find that the cultural status quo starts to shift back to having as many children as possible haha.

There has also been a lot of studies conducted in recent years that do go against general cultural belief in their findings, tending to show that on average, couples without children are in fact, on the whole, happier than those without!

gfnytow,"Kids cost a lot. Literally thousands of dollars per year, and for the first 1-4 years, a good chunk of that cost is just shit like diapers/pull-ups, wipes, baby food, and formula. You can be spending upwards of $200 - $400 a month on just those items ALONE depending on brand and your child's needs (sometimes, you're stuck with the pricier crap if they're allergic to an ingredient in any of the above, have sensitive skin, etc., and some babies go through diapers faster than others. Even cloth diapers are going to have extra costs like laundering and maintenance) before factoring in shit like clothes, daycare, school supplies, toys, etc.

Now imagine what else you can do with that money: go to school, go on a trip you've always wanted to go on, buy a house, save for retirement, invest, donate to a charity you love, buy things for your hobbies, etc. I make a decent living. I could not afford to do some of the things I like doing (good art supplies aren't cheap, and pre-lockdown, I could take a week off work and visit a friend) if I had kids.

I would also suggest Googling and reading the Lemon Clot Essay (warning: a little graphic) which goes into what it's *actually* like after childbirth if you were thinking of having your own. Then imagine going through that with an unsupportive spouse, which is an unfortunate reality for some women who *do* want kids. Not having to deal with that in and of itself is a benefit.

The only thing more valuable than money is time, and kids take a lot of it. Trust me, as I came from a large family: kids need a LOT of attention. You are also going to spending a LOT of time repeating yourself: reading the same books over and over again, playing with the same toys and games they like, helping them potty train, disciplining over and over again until they get it. When they're younger, you'll be having to run after them, putting them down for naps, juggling how to run your daily errands while accounting for your child's needs (and Satan help you if they haven't had a chance to nap that day, and the errands take longer than expected. After parents outright not disciplining their kids, this is probably the second biggest reason for public outbursts: the child is tired/overstimulated, and is too young to communicate it effectively). You think you have more hours in the day than you actually do until the end of the day comes.

And that's before touching on how if you weren't lucky enough to get an easy infant, you're going to have teach them to sleep on a schedule, and that means many rough and sleepless nights. If the baby has colic or special needs, that can make this already unpleasant experience even worse. I work night shifts, and I've helped my mom with cranky babies who wouldn't settle down. I'll take the night shift over the baby every single time.

Think of the free time you have now, and what you do with it. While it's possible to balance work, hobbies, and kids (many of my friends with kids have figured it out), your free time is going to get drastically cut short. If you have things you value your free time for (hobbies, going out, quiet night at home, just resting after work without the expectation to do more than cook dinner and wind down, etc.), you need to think long and hard about if that time is worth sacrificing to you, because it WILL be a sacrifice.

As far as not having kids some of my major reasons are not wanting to have a child with a disability and as a special education teacher knowing full well how much work children are and the variety of needs they can have. The financial aspects of raising a child are an absolute deal-breaker for me. I'm in my late 30s and just now feeling financially comfortable. I'm also a bit of a control freak and I know that I would be a worrywart, helicopter type parent. If I had children this would result in my mental health deteriorating rapidly and severely. I feel like a lot of couples... Because I work with a ton of families...idealize having a cute little baby but they don't think through to tweens and the teenage years. They don't think about the potential impact on their mental health and their marriage.

Just like CF people don't want to be pushed into a life with children the other way applies too.

We have plenty of time to spend alone and together, and not to be TMI but the sex is phenomenal, and our intimacy as a couple keeps growing. 
Being a parent fundamentally changes who you are, as well as the person you married. You have no way of knowing if you would still be compatible after a child. As a parent your (finite) time and emotional and financial resources get redirected to your child instead of each other and your marriage suffers.

Have you considered putting a budget for financing college and adding a child and all childcare-related expenses into the mix to better understand what it's like to try to accommodate both?

Have you considered what it's like to study at a foreign university with children in tow? My advisor, who has several sons between the ages of 5-15 did something similar-ish (went on sabbatical to Germany), and sadly had a miserable time because of the challenges of trying to do such things with kids in tow. Specifically, as a foreign national, she didn't have access to proper educational resources (at least one of her boys has autism spectrum disorder) while in Germany and her boys struggled with cultural and language barriers.",3,0,train
gfoxf5y,"Hi, friend! I'm sorry you're struggling! I hope this community helps! 
Reasons We are Child Free:

We prefer spending time together rather than running after children. 

I work with children and am tired of them by the time I'm home. 

Money is a lot more abundant without children. 

The world doesn't need any more children. We have plenty in foster care who need a home with love. 

Ways I've Accepted Being CF even though I Love Kids:

I devote my time to working with kids and making them better. I work in a school. 

I have plenty of nieces and nephews which are great short term substitutes, which remind me how peaceful my life is without children. 

I remind myself society's expectation for me to have children is unfair. I am the owner of this body and this life. 

I remind myself how wonderful it is to come home and sit on the couch naked with my husband. We eat dinner and just relax instead of cooking for 3+ people and having to make sure everyone is cared for. 

It was really difficult for me to accept at first because society just adds it as the next expectation for a woman after she's married. I never really wanted kids, but I'm a nurturer by nature. I even felt guilty for not wanting kids because I would be a wonderful mom (I'm told so all the time.). However, I've spent lots of time in therapy discussing my need to please others and not take my own needs and desires into consideration. Having children would just be another people pleasing act without myself in mind. 

Please know that you can interact with children without being a mother. It's wonderful to help kids grow up without compromising your lifestyle. Good luck! I hope you find peace!",3,0,train

gfpe5v1,"I can't really think of any reasons in general that haven't already been mentioned, and a lot of those have been my reasons for not wanting kids. My reasons have actually shifted and/or changed as I have gotten older (34F and known I didn't want kids since I was about 12), and the main reason now is that my husband and I have worked so hard on our relationship to get to where we are, and I am not willing to sacrifice that relationship for anyone, including kids. 

As someone else mentioned, we can list reasons all day long not to have kids, but you should definitely be asking yourself why you would WANT them. I've asked some of my mom friends (the ones who can have an open and honest conversation about this) why they wanted kids, and they can't really think of any particular reason other than ""it's just what you do"".

gfpleat,"The financial cost of having just one kid is essentially the cost of having a second mortgage every month. Instead of spending that extra $1500-$2000 a month on just a single kid (assuming that kid is neurotypical, not special needs or medically ill or anything else that could quickly double or even quadruple your monthly cost), think of everything you could spend that money on instead! Maybe a private beach house, or a reclusive mountain getaway? Several extra vacations each year? And those vacations would be doing everything you want to do, not limited to whatever ""kid friendly"" activities happen to be in the area you're visiting. You have the option to pamper yourself like no other parent can, cause unlike them, you can actually afford it.   


You're also free to not work jobs that would enable you to afford that extra monthly mortgage cost. You could actually make the choice between having a career that makes you happy, instead of defaulting to whatever career actually pays the bills, or killing your chances at any future career by becoming a stay at home mom because the monthly cost of daycare would cost more than you'd earn at any regular job in any given month. You could both save to retire earlier, or be financially secure enough that should one of you get laid off or need to stop working for any reason, you can still stay afloat financially. It's a lot easier to avoid massive financial hardship when you only have to worry about a household of 2 adults, and not a household of 2 adults and 3 children.   


Finally, and I think this is probably the biggest positive point you should consider, you will never be forced into single parenthood. One of my default questions for anyone who wants to become a parent is, ""Would you still want to be a parent if it meant being a single parent?"" Even if they say yes to that, I clarify, ""Even if it meant being a single parent of a special needs, disabled, or severely ill child?"" The sad fact is, life is unpredictable. Your partner could leave, or die, become overwhelmed by the needs of the child and refuse to contribute, become disabled and be unable to contribute, or any number of other reasons that would force either parent into a 100% caretaker role. Sometimes it's done out of malicious resentment because the reality of parenting is worse than anticipated, other times it's simply an accident, like the sudden death of a partner. If one or both partners aren't prepared for the possibility of becoming that 100% caretaker, if their want to be a parent is conditional on the idea of the workload being split among both partners, then they should not become parents. Parenting is non-stop, thankless hard work with a minimum legal duration of 18 years, and anyone not fully ready to take on all of the sacrifices involved will resent being forced to make those non-stop sacrifices pretty quickly. If your idea of parenthood was hinging on the idea of an eternal equal partnership, and not ever entertaining the idea that you might suddenly be left to care for your children all by yourself because your partner suddenly died, then you just dodged a massive bullet.",2,0,train

I also think it's inappropriate that your husband seems to have unilaterally made this huge choice for both of you. 
That being said, I don't think it's helpful to try an convince you that being childfree is amazing if it's not something you really want.  It might be more helpful to start from the other direction and ask yourself why you want kids? What about it appeals to you? Is that realistic? Have you thought about all the negatives?

I would say the great majority of the families I know with more than one child have experienced one of the issues I list. Don't tell yourself ""That won't be me."" That's what the *many* people I know whose child has died told themselves, and it WAS them one day. Don't tell yourself ""I'll be a *great* parent, I just know it! And my kids won't have problems.""

This realization becomes just a *little* bit more clear to *some* parents because when they have children, suddenly, their lives ""becomes their children"" - ie they have the experience of becoming ""one"" with their children, and hence, lose that sense of self that necessarily comes with insecurity and emptiness - but it certainly doesn't mean that they become enlightened, loving beings.

We all worked in a converted granny annex at the end of the boss' property (small business) and the boss let his 3 kids (oldest was 5 or 6) run wild. They often came into the office unattended while the boss was in his office in his house. 

I had a lull in my workload and I noticed the brats were acting up (typing on computers - we've had a 'kid deleted something important' episode before, grabbing random documents to scribble on and generally interrupting everyone).

By this point, the whole team knew I disliked kids and particularly didn't like these unruly brats. But, I had some spare time and I felt bad for the co-workers that were getting interrupted.

Its not necessarily a coincidence that parents that ate like this tend to target the same-gendered child. I looked/sounded like my mother and so she saw me as an extension/do-over/rival all at once. Your husband's dad might have felt the same.

My brother was abused too but he was mostly just neglected emotionally because he wasn't academically gifted (nothing for her to brag about) and was less confrontational (it's not easy to start a fight with someone that doesn't fight back like I did).

>Toxic people seem to know how to ferret out the more empathic and vulnerable people better than anybody. 

My mother being toxic is what made me more empathetic (too empathetic really) because I was groomed to be her emotional support animal - I had to tune in from the age of 7 or 8 to her emotional needs and ensure they were met to avoid negative results from her. Now I'm cursed with being too in tune with everyone else's emotions while my own are incomprehensible to me.

>That is a great mentality to have, I just crumble lol.

I had my depressed/suicidal-thoughts/self-harm phase as a teenager, my husband (highschool bf) saved me from that and, somewhat unknowingly, helped me to unlock my inner rage. He showed me that I should unleash my deep anger at those responsible (my parents) rather than lock inside at myself.

Anyway, one girl was 19 and had a two year old, her boyfriend was cheating on her (he was also 32, but that's a whole separate story), but he made literally 5 times as much as she did, so she was scared to leave him and have to move back in with her parents. The other girl was 25 and had a newborn. They were both kind of out of shape, always exhausted, and also just bad at their jobs. Like it was a small, casual venue, the menu changed weekly but there were only ever 3 options - a vegetarian or vegan thing, a standard thing, and an ""allergy friendly thing"" that was literally always cheese,nut,mustard, and gluten free risotto. The star vegetable changed every week, but it was always some form of risotto. The bar served lager, cider, wine, or Guinness. Your non alcoholic options were water or coke. So you'd think memorising the menu would take like 30 seconds, but without fail they'd tell the customers we had stuff we didn't, then freak out when an annoyed customer didn't have their food 30 minutes later and was demanding a refund.

On an average night I'd have PS10 - 20 in tips, they'd have maybe PS5, and half the time they'd have to give that back to the bar because they'd counted change wrong and the till was short. 

I wasn't the best waitress to ever waitress or anything, but I got to work, wrote the menu down on the back of my order pad, and was generally polite to people. I'd flirt with some of the single guys that came in, and they'd pretty much always give me an extra PS1 or so on each drink order. I wasn't over the top, but I got people the food they ordered soon after they ordered it and I was generally competent. 

I also befriended a lot of the kitchen staff, because I speak (some, bad) French, and a couple of the guys were from France. My manager really liked me, and I'd always get out of random stuff I hated doing. Nothing major, just ""girls, you two go clear plates at tables 21 - 24. Steph, you go behind the bar for now. There was cottage pie today."" I'm vegetarian and touching meat grosses me out, manager noticed I was gagging a bit clearing once, so he never made me do it when there was mince or gravy. I'd still be given a job, but obviously gave the impression I was getting the better role. 

Chef would always set aside risotto and vegetarian mains for me, the girls always got the anonymous meat slop left over. If there wasn't any risotto left, chef would ask me what I wanted and make it for me, even if it wasn't on the menu. Dude literally made me tortillas once because I complained that I missed nice Mexican food. 

None of it was against the rules, one of the perks of working there was free food, but we weren't supposed to request special food, it was whatever the kitchen felt like feeding us that day. 

But it didn't take long for the girls to start rumours that I was sleeping with the manager, sleeping with the chef, sleeping with the customers, and stealing from the till.

They demanded we start splitting tips evenly, they wanted first choice of food because they're always so hungry and tired from their children, and demanded me and the other childfree wait staff do all the heavy lifting, they both wanted to pour pints all shift (and wanted to sit while they did it. Behind a bar that had like 4 square feet of space and only needed one person at a time).

 Luckily my manager shut that down pretty quickly and I had enough friends at work who made similar amounts in tips, so it was easy enough to prove that all our tills were even at the end of the night and we could all say ee'd seen the others get cash directly from customers, so the other girls had done nothing to deserve even splits (some customers would even say things alo.g the lines of ""this is for YOU. Don't share with the girl who forgot my order 3 times"")  but it still had to be investigated because they made a formal complaint to the company that owned the venue. 

My manager got sick of them at some point and ended up sending them to work in reception, where there are *no* tips, fewer ways to fuck up, and also no heating, but the door opens every time somebody walks in front of it. 

I ended up moving and getting a job that pays slightly better with more sociable hours, so I don't really know how they're doing now, but I know they still work there and my friends who are still there say my old manager still refuses to put them back in the restaurant.",14,0,train

eventually child services got involved with the kids being bounced around and their dad having a record. they didn't want the dad to have the kids at all anymore, so they started contacting family members to take them.

when they called me i just said no. my mom tried to lay the guilt trip on me.

the way i viewed it was that these two kids might have had a better chance at life if they went into foster care. they didn't - my mom got them, their dad signed papers for my mom and step-dad to have custody. so they stopped getting ripped from one home and tossed into another. but with the life these kids had up until that point they had a lot of issues that they needed therapy for. they got none of that. they didn't even finish high school, which was why i kind of wanted them to end up in foster care. my family doesn't have a great track record of finishing school.

You don't want kids, ever. And you love her, and you gave her all the support and help for her to become a successful adult, and part of being an adult is making responsible choices.

Telling her you cannot be a part of that plan is only fair, the right thing to do even, so she can make responsible choices.

gfpz3vm,"I've done some writing (either fanfiction or semi fiction) and I encountered this as well. 

One Character was genetically enhanced against her will and she escaped thanks to two women who became her friends (and later one becomes her wife). The folks that experimented on her managed to secure her fertility as well as the fertility of two other male test subjects (as the experimentation process usually leaves them sterile). She eventually gets sterilized to prevent and children should she ever gets recaptured (she does and she gets the last laugh). That's just in the main story, not the AU. 

The other story I'm writing is based off a certain game (guess which) that has the main protagonist as a resurrected being who has to use her abilities to help a group of similarly gifted individuals protect the remains of civilization. No one knows if these individuals can have biological children, but she has no interest in raising children as she's focused on defeating the next threat and mentoring a man who's eventually resurrected and can't remember the sins he's committed in his past life. She's a badass former soldier who curses, carries around a sword, wrapped a heavy sniper in the bones of a now dead worm god and tends to style her hair up with static that she generates. Her biggest fear is that someday she may not be resurrected when she dies, and worries that her girlfriend made the wrong choice in partners and may be better off seeing out someone who wasn't resurrected. 

In both cases, both are women who see themselves as unfit for motherhood and instead tend to follow a violent soldier like life. One fears her genetic altering may cause unintended consequences (along with not wanting to be an incubator for the big bads), the other's resurrected by a paracausal being and despite still being human, doesn't see herself as a potential partner for either mortal or resurrected beings. 

The genetically modified character explains this to a friendly medic who agrees that it's not right to have such a thing imposed on her. The Resurrected woman mentions it to her friend (the one who resurrected her) when he mentions that he can't tell what's exactly on her mind through their symbiotic link, but he knows whatever it is, it's bothering her.

Girl bestie, we met when we were 10 and I transferred schools to where she was. Rescued her from bullies on the first day of school. Almost 40 years later, we still are in touch here and there.

We were extreme opposites: I was a tough little tomboy girl, she was all pigtails and dolls and skirts.

We were inseparable. 

She had parents who did weird stuff, like cared where she was, and make sure she had food. I was unwanted and ignored. Days could go by without me seeing my parents.

Her parents never judged and neither did she. Imo - I am who I am today because of their (brief) influence in my life. I stayed there a lot. 

Her dad would transform their garden into a skating rink in winter and we made entire houses and forts with mazes on that rink. They had a huge yard and their home was home.

Mine was cold and empty. It was very rare she stayed at my place, though she did sometimes. 

I moved around a lot and we lost touch somewhere around age 16, with our last letter (no email then!) when she had her first son. She sent me a photo and I moved yet again and we lost touch for almost 20 years.

I joined FB late and don't use it, but the brief time I was on, she found me. We met up in person at age 44. 

She's a mom of 4. Her hubby is a master carpenter, she home schooled her kids until grade 10. She's now a grandma.

She was shocked I had stood by my rhetoric of never having kids (which I declared at 9).

She's done good and I'm proud of her. She and her hubby are best friends and do very well, and they give back to their community. Their kids are all good kids and responsible. 

She always wanted to be a mom, as long as I've known her. Her kids are grown and gone (maybe 1 at home still?) so she's become a foster parent for babies who have special needs, addicted at birth, etc - the ones who get left behind.

She's the ONLY person, of all the people in my life I've met, that I would say - she needs to be a mom, and her hubby a father. That's what they're here to do kinda thing.

For starters, my parents are an excellent example. They are both great parents and super involved.

Mom cooks 60% of the time, but dad works more hours, both take us to medical appointments, mom does the washing (but again, dad works longer hours) and we have a maid for cleaning (i don't live in the US and in my country childcare and housecleaning are not expensive). My father and i love watching movies and tv shows together and i love going to the theater and book fairs with my mother.

This in regards to raising me (20F) and my brother (17M). In regards to them as a couple, they are awesome too. Since i was 12 (my mother got breast cancer that year and know she is fine) they travel on their own like twice a year and once with us (my brother and i don't resent them at all for leaving us behind, maybe just a little when my mother went to greece with my grandma last year because I've wanted to go to greece since i was 13 and fell in love with greek mythology). Also, they made sure to go on date nights (they rarely left us with family, family isn't obliged to take care of us, childcare isn't expensive in my country, and when i was like 13 thay would prepare food and leave us alone, which i loved). They have a very strong relationship and as soon as my brother and i finish college, and move out, they plan on traveling even more.

Also, I've asked them if they could do it all over, if they would have children, and they said absolutely, they loved having children (and respect my desire to remain childfree).

Btw, in my country is normal to live with your parents untill you finish college.

I was nervous, also. My nurse asked me if I had any concerns when I checked in and was getting my IV, and I explained how I was scared of the anesthesia. The anesthesiologist came over to talk about my fears, and she gave me an anti-anxiety med to help. She did a great job. A few insights:

- I recommend having someone you trust there to help you get dressed for at least two days. Putting on underwear is no joke!

- When standing, press a pillow against your stomach. The pressure helps.

- As someone above already stated, wear loose clothes and be liberal with your pain meds.

- Prepare meals ahead of surgery or have someone around to cook for you.

- I know this will sound strange, but I asked my surgeon if there was any chance of seeing pictures of my ovaries. She took a ton of pics of the inside of my abdomen and printed them out for me. It was gross but cool. If you have such an inclination, you can ask.

Love is based on respect, complete and TOTAL respect for who some is, exactly how they are and who they are and the life they have lived and the experiences they have and who they love -- the whole person.

To love someone you must respect them for who they love.

To love someone you must respect their actual life and their dreams. Not the life you wish they had.

To love someone you can't just want sliver of their life-- all the while spending every day seething inside and dying to toss the rest of their life and person into the garbage bin.

You can never respect him and therefore can never love him for real. You are already disgusted by who he is, resent the life he has lived, and cannot accept that he loves his child. 

You cannot wish the child away, and wish his love for the child away, because that is who he is.

You: ""So we have made a decision together. We have decided that if you wish to continue to be a part of our lives moving forward, and wish to have us around during your old age, and want us to visit you in the nursing home someday, we require you to begin weekly therapy.""

Sis: ""here's how this is going to work. We have identified three therapists in your area, we require you to contact at least one of them within 7 days, decide which one you want to see, and have your first session within 10 days. You will need to email us verifiable proof of your appointment, and a photo of the office when you arrive and leave, with timestamps. We have created an email address that we will both have access to where you will send all of your verification material. You will then continue to attend weekly sessions for the next year.""

You: ""And to ensure you comply with these requirements, there is one more part of this. Until you have completed 90 days of sessions, without fail, emailing the same proof each time to that address, we will have no contact with you, and will remove you from social. This will give you the next three months alone to focus on yourself. At the end of those three months, we will speak with the therapist to verify that you are working hard and making progress. If that goes well, we may consider resuming some contact on a limited and probationary basis. Something like a monthly zoom call with the three of us for 15 minutes.""

Sis: If you continue to make progress in therapy, we may be willing to add additional contact, such as having coffee every few months. If things go well over the next few years, and therapy shows great progress, then you will have the opportunity to earn your way back into our lives.

You: Finally, to be clear on the most important thing: if you choose not to go to therapy then we have made the decision that we are done, and today will be our final goodbye. If you are not willing to get better, then we simply need to move on with our lives, and you can figure out what you want to do with your own life without us. 

Sis: This isn't negotiable. You either do it, or you will never be part of our lives again.

You: OK, well we have said what we have to say. Here is the paper with the therapists names and the email box of where to send your proof. We will check the email box in 10 days to see if you have provided the information required. If we do not see that, then we will stop checking the inbox for good and get on with our lives.

Sis: We both hope that you will make the right decision. However, if you do not, then this will be our final goodbye, and we wish you good luck with your future life.

There are two notable examples of this! 

As a result of low visibility, sex workers do face quite a few problems! We're talkin' rampant exploitation, abusive stigma and every other problem that comes with working off record.

gfmz0e4,"I think a few things in your comment are problematic. 

We're absolutely NOT responsible for the family of others. Atleast, I'd make the argument not in the US or similar individualist cultures. 

There are simply ""billions of problems that could go wrong"" for anyone browsing online. Weither or not they're a child is irrelevant. 

Yeah, Sensitive content is sensitive content. But the content and it's creator shouldn't be forced underground because of irresponsible browsing-- even if those ""undeveloped brains"" have a chance of stumbling across it. 

Because that IS what I am talking about. I am specifically complaining about the erasure of adult content and the culture that goes with it. I'm talking about a distinct lack of legitimate, reputable platforms for adult consumers.

 I'm certainly not saying that 'family friendly' content shouldn't exist, rather it shouldn't be a expected. 

When the interests of 'child safety' conflicts with those of others, how do you prioritize them? 

Picking the former simply because they're kids isn't responsible. It's just biased. That's what I'm talking about.

I grew up in a broke household with a mentally ill parent and both parents did not know how to handle stress well at all. I didn't have the worst childhood, but it was still stressful and hard. I was such an anxious child and still struggle with certain things now as an adult in my early 40s. I definitely believe my parents should not have had kids and the universe must have agreed because there were many, many miscarriages before me, yet they kept trying and ended up having three kids.
