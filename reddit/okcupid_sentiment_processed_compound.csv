gfpy5r3,"I had my first date in seven months and it was great. In a (not very deep) sea of boring messages that I couldn't be bothered in responding to, she messaged me a good one and we chatted all week and then met up yesterday.

Was like immediately talking to an old friend. Easy and fun and friendly. We're gonna do it again.

Last date before this was ok but kind of confusing and not that interesting (it was in March at the beginning of COVID and we just let it die because shit was hard enough back then). The date before that was truly awful. Really awful, scarringly bad. So I've been a bit off dating since.

Even if nothing comes of this, I'm delighted to have had the experience.

Here's the actual story though:

I posted last week about how OKC was sending those emails saying they'd turn off my profile if I didn't log in and I was at the point where I really didn't care, and people here helpfully pointed out that it was just spam nonsense and they'd never turn off my profile. 

I've noticed though, that when they send that note, I ALWAYS get a like or a message notification the next day so I assume they show my profile to a bunch of people.

Date from yesterday admitted that she had liked my profile a while back and creeped it a few times without sending a message. She was also ambivalent about dating. Then one day, my profile disappeared and she found herself feeling sad about it and realized that meant she should have sent a message. I presume it came back up in her feed because OKC was trying to manipulate me back into activity, and it worked!

So we're able to connect on our shared experience being manipulated by OKCs desperate attempts to stay afloat and relevant during these crazy times.",6,-0.967,train

As for catfish, never have I ever shown up to see a different person than their photos.  Most of my dates were regular, interesting boring people.  I was smart about asking out only people who I could see clearly in their photos and as such I don't think I ever had a date with someone who was even particularly heavier or older looking than their photos and I'd say the majority were better looking in person.

Including my now wife who is inept at selfies, but absolutely stunning.

I think people who put their best foot forward and have something to offer, avoid common pitfalls can have a good time online dating.   If you have major flaws, live in low population density areas, don't know how to interact with other humans, or have a massive misunderstanding of your ""league"" you'll have a bad time (your league isn't what you see in the mirror, it's the people who want to date you).

I live in a crappy sububan area (SF bay area) for dating where most people my age are married already, and the single women tend to be kinda boring and few and far between unless I wanted to drive 45 minutes to an hour so it took a while for me.

Since his roommate was there I wasn't expecting anything to really happen. However he had kissed me and since I was feeling ok about that date so I kissed back. Now I'm not very experienced so making out was still new to me. We made out and somehow I ended up on top of him on the couch. I ended that about a minute in and we started watching a movie.

>It happened a second time and I let it go a little longer. This time though I was getting a little uncomfortable with how fast things were going. I had started texting some of my friends in a group chat hopping he would get the hint. However he did it a third time and even though I felt a little uncomfortable I didn't know how to say stop or really express that I didn't want anything to happen. It escalated quickly to the point where he was grinding on me and I was responding but I still wasn't really comfortable and I let it slide because I chalked it up to not being experienced.

&nbsp;

>I tried pushing him back a little to get him to see I wanted to stop and after the fourth or fifth time I had gotten off and went to the bathroom. Now at this time I came back and made an excuse about needing to get up early in the morning. But as I was trying to gather my thoughts and try to tell him I was leaving that moment he kissed me again and I still didn't know how to really say no or stop it and it got heavy pretty quickly. I was confused because I had wanted to stop but not stop at the same time. It lead to him humping me after he got my to lay on the couch and I let it go on for about five minutes before I pushed him off and said I needed to go that moment.

&nbsp;

>I'm not sure what to do now because he texted that he wanted to hang out again and I'm a little ashamed that I let it get as far as it did without stopping it. I just want to know how to let him know I don't really want to see him again because the pushing. I'm ashamed and mad at myself that I didn't stop it when I got uncomfortable the first time.

Oh get this, alcohol also doesn't work because I apparently can't get drunk because I have high tolerance to it.

As someone who has used both free and paid dating sites/apps (and had little luck on both so far, but I keep trying), I would be keen to believe a paid site will be more ""serious"" than a free one. On free apps/sites, you see many profiles of people who subscribed impulsively and then never check their account again ; or people who just don't bother to complete their profile. On paid sites, most people tend to make a little effort because they paid in order to be able to use it, so they want to get most out of it. Having to pay for a service generally filters out non-serious people in general to some extent, if someone is not serious about dating (s)he won't pay obviously. 

By that I'm not saying that paid sites are the best thing the internet has to offer ; I had little luck on paid websites so far. But in general, it seems people bother just a little bit more than the average user on a free website.

As a user, you *probably* want to find someone, or someones, and ultimately delete the app once you've found what you're looking for. The ""ideal"" version of the app is one that immediately finds whatever type of connection you're looking for and is subsequently deleted.

gf4sdd3,"I can relate to how you are feeling. It's so much easier to look at this from the outside and think of it rationally. When feelings and emotions are involved, it becomes a much more difficult circumstance to navigate.

It's best to remember that the words and thoughts expressed from one person to another may not always be received in the same way that they were intended by the person offering them. An example is a conversation about future desires. One person may say what they would like in a relationship, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the person wants it with that other person right at that moment. I can hear that she wants to be married and have kids, but that doesn't mean she is ready to enter a serious relationship leading to marriage with me right at that moment. Another example is where two people become playful and flirtatious. I learned myself when I first re-entered the dating scene in August that playful and flirtatious does not always mean the other person is ready to do the playful and flirtatious actions with me. 

There is high likelihood that this person is having the same conversation with other guys that she is having with you. Is this intended to have you feeling jealous? Absolutely not. I am not trying to cause you to have jealous feelings and she is not seeking to make you jealous. It is a matter of one's approach to dating. Some people cast feelers in several directions, entertaining the company of several people until one rises above the rest. The other common approach is to message a few people then stick to communicating with one where common interests seem to exist. 

With someone who is testing the waters of several different guys, the worst thing you can do is appear insecure. A woman like this is usually very self-assured and desires a man who has a high self-confidence and chooses her among several options. Don't go to any extreme. Continue messaging her as normal and just play Joe Cool. The best thing you can do is appeal to the things that she desires most. Show her that you have been listening. Don't be the emotional needy guy. One of two things will happen: Either she will choose to pursue things with you further or she will choose to pursue things with another guy. It's dating and nothing personal. 

If you feel like conversations are stagnating and that wheels are just spinning, without coming across as needy, be open about wanting to proceed beyond simple conversations. Ask if she has the same desire. If she is really into you, she will tell you up front or be playfully coy. If she isn't interested, you will either get no response or a cold answer. 

The worst possible thing to do is becoming emotionally attached based on casual conversations without having actually met. More than likely you are going to be much deeper in than she. There is only one place for that type of situation to go, which is your feelings hurt. 

Truthfully, I think you are dealing with someone who senses that you are becoming attached harder and faster than she prefers. She is putting space between so that she doesn't give you the impression that she is as into you as you are into her. She will keep coming back because you are offering something that she enjoys. If the situation continues as it is, she will eventually choose another guy over you because you are lower on the list. 

If playing it cool and doing your best to seem be appealing doesn't seem to move the needle in your favor, you can do one of two extremes: Take her approach and just text whenever it seems convenient while exploring other options, or go for the homerun (strikeout likely) by pursuing her as hard as ever. With the first, unless she really wants an standoffish guy, you won't win her over. With the second, it will only work if she really likes you more than the other guys messaging her nad she is simply waiting for you to make a move. 

If it were me, I would go for broke and either you win her or get ghosted by her. Either way, you aren't wasting much time with someone with whom you really are not going anywhere.

this is tactical strategy to get people to stay on and stay active. with so many frustrated and stressed(no work, financial issues, infections on high surge, being lonely)  people are on and off because they want but dont want. its toxic like social media, and people feel they need to break from it, so they do. and hence the message to get back on. no users, no activity, havent you noticed the same people even though you swiped left on them multiple times? when the mass of thje world was in lockdown people were on. then seeing how toxic and being weary to even meet and date, many just said its not priority to date with all the other issues they have as well. 

so its just a tactic used the last 6 months or so. they need users to keep the site going. and as unfortunate as the situation is with feeling lonely, and with the daily infection rate and deaths, most people are just waiting things out. when vaccines get spread for the masses, its when people will feel more confident. and now with the flu added in, and being cold outside, there isnt many good options for meeting.

he went for fun, even asking her to come along. she expressed concern about minimizing contact and gatherings and the guy was all about the partying. that says the whole picture. people are very selfish and irresponsible and you can clearly see it. the USA, the strongest in the medical industry by far in the world could have single handedly suppressed the numbers down faster then any country, yet with all the antimaskers and ""its just a flu"" anti protests, so many unfortunate deaths. it really is so sad.

gfdvqxv,"Hey Reggie 

This is going to sound harsh, but here we go. 

You need to decided what you want, a decent hit rate which will result in actual dates or being completely honest and truthful and getting few to no dates. Neither of those are the right or wrong decision, but seeing as you are asking for advice then I suspect it's the former rather than the later. 

Ever heard the saying ""Be attractive, don't be unattractive"". I don't think people really quite get what that means. You can't do a great deal about the first half (that's not suggesting you are not attractive), but the second half you can do plenty. In a dating profile you need to find a balance between giving people enough information to initiate contact, but tone down those things that will immediately rule you out. It's certainly the case that the visual part is important (see chadfishing) but once you do match the importance of your profile will kick in. 

I completely respect that fact you are Pan-sexual/Demi-sexual, but you need to understand that alone on a profile will limit your available matches drastically. You will essentially need to pick a side here (or have two profiles) if you want to get a decent match rate. That doesn't mean not being true to yourself at all, it just means that you don't want to put up barriers for people before you even meet. For my mind neither of those definitions are exclusionary (in fact the reverse), but for many people they will come across as such. 

I think overall your profile reads well, but I would strongly suggest dropping the ""my coming out story"", it just comes across as deeply negative and again exclusionary. You mention androgynous and feminine men, that will have a very limiting effect on matches. I'm saying this because I'm taking your Pan-sexuality at face value and that you don't want to just date those sorts of people (yes you go on to expand, but most people will drop out at that point). 

You have marked as monogamous which has informed my advice as above. If I'm in  a monogamous relationship with somebody it doesn't matter to me if they are hetro, bi, pan whatever, all I'm interested in is if they are attracted to me. The important part is the relationship between those two people. I can't remember all the options available, but I'm pretty sure there is a ""looking for men"" ""looking for women"" option, which would be truthful in your situation. 

I'd also drop the Gunpla section. It's as legitimate as any hobby, but even you in that text know how it's possibly perceived as you attempt to justify it. Unless a hobby is going to draw people in or it's going to limit your dates (i.e. sorry can't make this weekend, building some Gunpla again) then leave it out. Again you are going to get a lot more misses based on it than you are hits.

things she did right:

1. seems like her profile is good
2. replied and asked a generic question

things she did wrong

1. did not answer your question, implies she didnt read your messages
2. I think this was either sarcasm gone wrong in text + with someone you dont know  OR intentional assholish behavior disguised as sarcasm because they dont mind you un-matching them as they're not that interested to begin with. 

I would move on if you want someone to match your energy. I unmatch when I get 1 word answers for 3-4 back and forth texts because it then becomes an interview and not a convo.

She didn't acknowledge anything you said.  At the very least, that tells you that she doesn't want to communicate in the way that you opened the conversation.  She is redirecting the conversation (and its pace) in a way that feels more comfortable for her.  There's nothing wrong with that, but the dig wasn't necessary.

I'm a F34, so perhaps I'm interpreting it through my own lens.  But if wrote a thoughtful message and a guy replied to me that way, I wouldn't be interested in his arrogance and lack of effort.

Second: she responded, which means she's interested  in continuing the conversation. Her question was generic af, sure, but this is the part most people suck at. Being interested without coming off as weird, or clingy, or desperate is an incredibly difficult line to walk. Especially considering most people doing online dating are likely already a little more socially awkward.

If you like her, go with it. If she's a rude person, that'll be obvious with more interactions. If she's not interested she wouldn't have replied.

I mostly agree about judging a person's tone over text, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it ""essentially impossible."" I'd go with ""error prone."" Come to think of it, I'm not sure I'm capable of reading _without_ judging tone! The reason is that when I read, I do so with my internal monologue, which necessarily has a tone. It can be bland and monotone, but since it's basically a voice in my head, it needs _some_ tone in order for the words to be read at all. When you read and write, do you not ""hear"" each word in your head? Because that's what I'm trying to describe.

genahsl,"I mean, I think that ""who I am"" is a range of modes. I can be quirky and excitable, intense and serious, laid back and accepting, emotional and soft, playful and jokey... But I think everybody is like this. Not that we all have the same range of modes, but that everybody is _some_ range of modes.

You know how different rooms have different resonances? Where if you hum at exactly the right pitch, it fills the whole room in a peculiar way? I guess my theory is that people are kinda like that, except we all have more than one resonance. A major part of the dating process is discovering each other's resonances one by one, seeing how many of them we have in common, and making sure neither of us have any that the other finds grating.

So, it's not about ""learning the universal laws of dating."" I think there are some basic, reliable _heuristics_ that everybody should know, but not laws. There's no safe or guaranteed formula for any of this. All we can really do - and all we should want to do - is see if we resonate with/to each other. That means focusing on their personality as an individual, which is almost the exact opposite of focusing on universal laws. It's a completely different approach to communication and interaction.

All of this is to say that sometimes it'll feel right to lead with my quirky side, and sometimes it'll feel right to lead with some other side. What feels right will always be guided by something from their profile/personality that resonated with some part of me. It isn't a foolproof process, but I think it's the best process for the goals of dating. (Or it works for me and my goals, at least.)

Write something like ""I'd love to hear from you so don't hesitate to contact me, I find confident women who take the inititative very attractive"" and ""I prefer phone calls and video chats over texts, so it's a plus if you're the same!"" 

(And put down an actual song title or two for the jam, ""I'll jam to anything"" makes you sound rather generic and boring. ""My favorite song to jam to is [title(s)] by [artist(s)], but I'll generally jam to anything"" is better. Say which soccer team is your favorite? Mention some games you like (are you an avid WoW player or do you play mostly single player games?). You say you're a funny person who makes people laugh, but there's not a single joke in your profile. :( ""I prefer phone calls and video chats over texts, so much like the Swizz flag it's a big plus if you're the same!"" for example.

Finance, career, and education aren't everything, but it should be somewhat comparable for a couple to be compatible.

Also, depends on whether male or female. Men tend to be more comfortable being the bread-winner, so it might not be an issue. On the other hand, some men might feel emasculated if the woman (assume hetero relationship) earned significantly more.

If it were to have worked for me, I would have needed to be at a much greater comfort level knowing that I would always pay most or all of the rent, bills, day to day expenses, vacation expenses, everything.  A mistake I made early on was treating it like one day she would pay me back, so I kept count to some extent, having faith that she'd get on her feet one day.

Never ever get into a relationship where one owes the other money on the basis of the subject of the purchase being a recurring shared expense like housing.

I think when this works out it's because the higher income partner expects nothing in return and doesn't keep count, and I think this takes a level of financial security on the part of the higher-income partner that is very higher-than-average.

Semi-related: I also think it's a bad idea to have a huge division of roles and responsibilities/labor in a relationship, *unless* it's what I described above where both parties are comfortable living on a large single income and the other is down for SAHF/SAHM lifestyle.

gef6wwc,"Yes I would be okay with it as long as we both pay our fair share, as in 50-50 in shared expense such as housing or whatever events we host or attend. That gives partners who have an income disparity encouragement not to go overboard and spend too much money where one feels like they owe the other something or the other owes them something.

Keep the standard of living / expenses at the level of the lowest earning partner in the relationship like in things like vacations, housing cars. That way the income disparity doesn't become an issue, because from the start your partner or you aren't going to feel entitled to live beyond your own means simply because of the relationship.

Its like many things in life whether its computers, cars, etc... its best to build a system that is in tune with each other, but if not then the over performing component needs to throttle down to match the performance of the lowest performing component. If everyone on the freeway is driving 60 mph, it doesn't matter if your car can drive 400 mph, you drive at 60 mph also so you don't collide into another car. If you have RAM modules 
in a computer or network interface cards that runs at different speeds on a network the faster component always throttles down to match the slower component. This should be the same for any relationship, expend equal amount of time and commitment when and wherever possible even if one person can potentially do more. Only time you should expend more than your partner expending is if it is personal thing.

For instance if you are going to a restaurant for a date you should chose a place both of you can comfortably afford and enjoy without breaking the other person's bank. If you both pay for what you order then you are living within your means. If you are going to order something way more expensive and not willing to share it cause you feel like you are being used or its going to be a unbalanced trade then order something closer to their price point. For instance if they order a $15 pasta dish and you order a $100 steak dish, if you aren't going to share at all then I see no problem with disparity cause you are paying for yourself. But if you are know that are going to want to share then order something closer to their price range that you won't be hesitant to share. Or for instance something like shoes, your partner buys only shoes below $40, while you buy $200 shoes. It shouldn't be a problem since your shoes are a personal thing that aren't shared. But if you go hiking with your partner or have a shared pet that regularly destroys your expensive shoes while your partner doesn't care cause theirs are cheap and they consider them disposable then you should probably buy cheaper shoes that you are willing to treat as disposable also to match the situation.

If you have kids then set a limit that each partner can spend on the kid so there isn't any favoritism where one parent spoils the kid finicially while the other one always has to say no because they can't keep up with the gifts, etc.",0,0.9795,test

Men send unsolicited, sexually explicit photos because he wants her to think of him in a provocative, sexually explicit way.... and he may believe she is not likely to think of him in that way if he posted, on a dating profile, a picture of himself in swim trunks.

ge5ux6y,"> **Date Lab update: At the time, they were living in the moment. Now what?**

> Success in dating is typically measured in profits. The dates that yield a surplus or the potential of one -- relationships, emotions, simply more dates -- are the good ones. The dead-ends yield zilch or worse. This line of thinking makes sense for the efficient-minded, but our Date Lab specimens this week make a good case for the joy of the self-contained date in a pairing that's most likely going nowhere. A proper date for dating's sake.

> Flo Low showed up wielding her enthusiasm like a bouquet. Her name is something of a misnomer, as her energy flow is through the roof. She is the kind of person who makes eye contact in the grocery store, who pops into random bars solo and starts chatting with the people around her, who suggested to her date that they jump in the CityCenterDC fountain during their Date Lab photo shoot.


> ""I'm not gonna do that"" was the reaction of Sam Fishman, who conceded that while he had been excited for the date, he didn't quite sport Flo's zero-to-all-in zeal. ""She started to rock immediately,"" Sam recalled. Flo's energy helped gloss over the considerable age difference between them: She's 38, and he's 24. Both said they were immediately aware of it; neither said that it ultimately mattered. It did nothing to interfere with attraction, and later both gushed about their good time.

> They met in May at Fig & Olive, where they sipped cocktails and shared the Mediterranean sampler app. She ordered the Chilean bass; he, the chicken. Sam reported that Flo talked a lot, but he noticed her listening, too; big, icebreaker-y ""Miss America questions"" were crucial elements of her repertoire. Flo said that because Sam immediately put her at ease and seemed unflappable, she felt comfortable to probe.

> ""She asked me stuff about dating that I was really not excited to be talking about,"" said Sam. ""On a first date, I don't want to talk about ex-girlfriends."" So when Flo asked Sam, ""Have you ever had your heart broken?"" he responded, ""I think not,"" and kept it moving. He did acknowledge, however, that Flo's prying was ""super well intentioned.""
Flo and Sam. (Daniele Seiss/The Washington Post)

> Flo, who manages a fellowship for Israeli artists at U.S. universities, felt a sense of do-gooder kinship with Sam, who works on Latin American issues at a democracy-promotion organization. They found they both dig the Mexican classical guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela. They're both Jewish, though Flo sensed that cultural identity is way more central to her lifestyle than it is for Sam.

> By all accounts, things were going great. So after completing dinner (and downing three drinks each in the process), they decided to move things elsewhere. They walked to the bar Jackpot in Chinatown, where they finally broached the age issue. ""I just said, 'I'm older than you,' "" said Flo. ""And I think he said, 'Probably.' And I said, 'Is that an issue for you?' And he said, 'No.' ""

> And so, it wasn't. A basketball game was on at the bar, and Flo, who's not a fan, told Sam, who is, that he'd have to hold her hand through it. She apparently didn't just mean that figuratively. Throughout the rest of the night, which stretched on for several more hours and featured some whiskey shots, they slowly magnetized. They sat closer. Arms rested against arms. At one point, Sam put his arm on the back of her chair.

> Flo was transparent about her attraction to Sam, whom she described as ""really cute"" and well put-together. Sam was a little more nebulous. (Kids these days!) He said that he went out of his way before the age discussion to not give any clues as to how young he is, and that he also didn't want to reveal that he was planning an imminent move to New York. He didn't want to break the mood. But at the same time, he didn't feel a romantic spark. And yet still, he described Flo as ""very attractive,"" both physically and socially.
AD

> So what gives? Even Sam had a hard time putting his finger on why he behaved as he did, but the best I could tease out of him was that he was enjoying the fun of flirtation and living in the moment.

> Flo was too. She's at a different stage in life, ready to settle down, but she didn't need the date to be anything other than what it was. She set out to have a fun evening. Mission accomplished. ""It made me feel really good about dating,"" she said.

> After over six hours together, Sam walked Flo home. Before they parted, they kissed. Flo took a page from Sam's book and declined to describe the nature and intensity of said kiss. ""A lady never tells"" is how she left it.
Rate the date

> Flo: 5 [out of 5]. ""It will be in the legendary column of great first dates.""

> Sam: 4.5. ""Easy. No doubt about it.""

> **Update**

To many the answer may seem obvious to just have fun. Nothing wrong with that, until you close in on 30 and find yourself unfulfilled relationally, while realizing that your number of active adult years are waning. Here is the reality: If you put off seeking an actual relationship to have some fun now, you will be 30+ by the time you switch back to relationship-seeking mode. It's similar to going to college and quitting for a bit. No one does that and goes back after a semester or two. No, it becomes several years before getting back in school. Dating at 30+ becomes a different beast from dating at 20-something.

I'd text ""No worries, good luck!"" which projects no anger or disappointment and serves 2 purposes. If she's genuinely busy and wants to see you - this won't deter her from contacting you again (as opposed to ""OK...

Also I think the other commenters calling your mindset ""toxic"" is harsh; validation or ""last resort"" is generally why people lead other people on. Like it would really only be toxic if you aggressively accuse her of leading you on, only because it's rude and she doesn't owe you honesty. But you're not wrong in thinking these are her motives and it's really only being smart and savvy. People either like the attention of other people being into them or don't have other options that actually excite them and are considering settling for someone they aren't actually into. That's just standard dating lol. Most people know how they feel about other people like right off the bat and will move past the awkwardness of rejecting a person because it's obvious rejecting someone as soon as possible is the kindest possible thing you can do. 


If I'm not super into someone, then I know it's not worth leading them on and let them know right off the bat either through really clear signals or just straight up telling them if they haven't gotten the hint. 


Granted most people don't approach dating with much intention and lead other people on to at least some extent. Also who knows maybe some previous person she dated came along and she had more history with them or she just hasn't let them go (it's kinda far fetched but it's probably happened to someone lol). That's why we gotta be forgiving of other people because dating is super awkward and confusing for everyone involved. 

I would just say something small like ""oh no worries maybe another time"" but don't expect her to text back. If she does great, but in all brutal honesty if she were interested she most likely would have suggested an alternative day immediately and you wouldn't be left wondering.

Like I said before she's a great human being! I would love to be with someone with her. There's not really that much chemistry between us. I thinks it's more of a physical attraction she has towards me and the things I do ( Muay Thai, I'm fit, i write poetry as a hobby, and I talked to her about meditation and how I started writing my own thoughts in a journal because I've read several books that it's a healthy thing to do). Which is cool it doesn't bother me. I take it as a compliment. She's also done with college and has a full time job and on top of that she works for 2 non profit organizations. I find her attractive because of her personality ( I even told her that). She knows that I haven't finished school I even told her that I'm barely starting to take clases to get my bachelors in nutrition. She still continued to show interest and talk to me.

It's all too easy for a man to be accused of sexual harassment.  In today's hypersensitive work environment, a mere accusation is enough for the man to lose his job.  Try explaining that to your next employer.

Especially if a woman is dating someone who may help progress her career.  How would that look in the eyes of her coworkers?

I worked in a very very male environment in a business that was technically my family's (Cooked in a restaurant). College was me collecting a really tough set of subjects (Bio, Chem, Physics, Mathematics). So the only time you got to date was on night outs...

gdtd9ii,"I suppose it depends on your definition of ""easy."" 

The two things that are ""easier"" about online are testing availability (no need to spend time and effort getting acquainted before even probing out whether they are even single) and meeting people you have nothing in common with. One of those is an advantage; the other I am not yet convinced is really that great an advantage. Meeting people you actually have something in common with is much easier offline, in that people generally gather together based on common interest; I can just go to the climbing gym, or a festival, or a club event, to meet a bunch of people I automatically have something in common with. Online dating sorts for gender and availability only; every other venue sorts for everything but those things. 

I would imagine if you are a totally generic person with no consequential hobbies or interest aside from the general thrust of mainstream culture, perhaps in that scenario online dating might be generally ""easier"" than offline. I don't know anyone like that - and thank god. I would probably die of boredom trying to have a conversation with such a person.

And yes, I'm about the same age. It isn't as easy as it was in school, but ""ease"" isn't how I would describe the problem anyway. The problem isn't ""meeting people."" Its meeting the right people.

Two two worlds are literally the opposite. There's no overlap. *Either* I know in advance that they're single, and I start with a vacuum of all other useful data, *or* I start out knowing that they are attractive and we have something in common, but I have to figure out that one admittedly critical detail... with the known cost that, most of the time, it will mean investing effort and emotional energy in learning that they are not single. 

But online, I still have to waste a lot of emotional energy on people who are ultimately not worth the effort. 

At least in real life, there are other interesting outcomes, like I still have fun at the venue even if I don't leave with a romantic prospect, or the person becomes a valued friend even if they aren't a romantic prospect. With online dating, upon matching with someone who turns out not to be viable, I gain nothing but frustration. 

At the moment, I am in the midst of an online dating relapse, and boy is it frustrating. Yes, women are single, and yes, they are talking to me, but none of them are viable prospects in any way. Most of my matches are women whose profiles I just hadn't looked at that closely before swiping, but after matching I discover there's zero likelihood of anything in common or actual attraction. And/or, we talk and I quickly learn we have nothing in common in terms of interests or values. 

I have frustrating experiences in person too. Tonight at the dog park, I approached someone who looked enticing from behind, based mostly on her hair and legs, only to (instantaneously) learn that she was obviously too young... and then from there annoyingly too interested in my dog, who never seems to attract the right ones. Most of the women I meet at the dog park turn out not to be single, but at least I know they are moderately active and love dogs... a starting point I don't get on Tinder.

The other issue here is your putting all your focus and attention into this one girl that may or may not be interested. I don't think that's healthy. If you are direct and you tell her and she's not interested the rest of the group will all find out and it'll for sure be awkward at least for a little while.

It is just You and L are dating. If you get rejected while Awkward  would only change the relationship between you and L. Some weird ""heys"" and ""sups"" later and your back to things as normal. What your really afraid of in My opinion isn't rejection, But shooting your shot and not getting any payoff, Not only that but coming out of this thing worst off. So instead of facing the awkwardness and embarrassment. You rather retreat and cutoff all ties.

We didn't play in the casinos or walk the strip. We tried to be as conscious of those around us as possible. However at the end of the day I refuse to live my life absolutely petrified of this virus. I'll do what I can to protect everyone else from catching anything from me, but this was also planned before we started to see the re-spike or ""second wave"". So we made sure our tests were negative before going, so we couldn't infect those around us. We also drove out, so no airports with tons of people.",11,-0.8902,dev

I'm not going to pretend it's perfect, but my primary concern was I was not willing to sacrifice my pets because someone who didn't have to interact or care for them in any way told me I needed to. Which was his cousins, NOT EVEN HIS GRANDMOTHER!!

It basically came down to the fact my animals are not hurting anything where they are, she's in a completely separate house, they don't go in that house, and are very well cared for. If they wanted the animals gone I would be leaving with them and in turn my husband would have left to and then there really would have been no one to care for his grandmother. I didn't want that. No one wanted that. It was a stupid point for them to push and I think they realized it. 

I should also preface this with the fact I manage an animal shelter, I have a lot of ""rejects"" that would be difficult or impossible to rehome, and I see dogs and cats dying everyday due to lack of space.

One of the key factors the algorithm for swipe dating apps uses to show you to more women is how old your account is. New accounts on apps like Tinder and Bumble are greatly prioritized over older accounts. 
 
One of the techniques the guys who helped me write the new Ultimate Online Dating Manual use is that every few weeks or months, they delete their accounts on these apps completely and start new ones. (Sometimes they even create new Facebook accounts and make new accounts from there, though that takes a little more work and time.)
 
Doing this ensures your account is constantly ""fresh"" and doesn't suffer from the degradation of old swipe app accounts.

The first one suggests people focus on what THEY think and feel about a person.

(Clearly she was unhappy and not getting what she needed, but she was frozen waiting for him to make a decision rather than focusing on her perception of the relationship.)

Whereas I think the third one is all about moving on when they show signs they're not interested. You could even add this to #1--YOU shouldn't like someone who's not interested in you because it sucks and you deserve more. And in the example above, that was one of the problems.

Yes, for the women who love fishing and/or love motorcycles those photos absolutely hit the mark, and those photos would actually be key for them to find their like-minded new partner... So, it's smart to include SOME of those, in hopes of finding those women.. 

Funny but probably true:  if you did a sociological study on what gender + age group responds with the most enthusiasm and interest to photos of men with fish, and men next to motorcycles, it's probably 12 year-old boys, ha ha!  Not adult single women. 

Again,  yes, I concede that if I were a motorcycle loving, fishing-loving man, I'd post SOME of those pics in hopes of finding a woman who felt the same way...

The problem is that you're full of wrong premises. You see, beyond your social chain of bitter rejected females, there are women with different tastes. If a girl have pics behind a chess board or anything related to chess I will assume that's one of her main personal interests, so if a guy that also loves chess finds her profile they're way more likely to have good chemistry than someone who dislikes it. As well as dancing, gaming, singing or even... fishing. You're clearly projecting your own ultra sensitivity of an animal you regard as disgusting and labelling the entire context. If you don't enjoy fishing, that's ok, you're a free person, but don't imply it's vanity or repulsive, it will only make you superfluous. Not all pics are meant to be sexual, some can relate to personal hobbies too. The vast majority of women's profiles is a cringeworthy, lackluster freak show of inauthenticity and blandness, so at least I'd like to be different and show deeper traits of my personality via pics of what I like to do in my free time. I don't think wanting to date people with things in common is that much of a war crime.

As for my experience with lots of women, from different origins with different personalities, not single one didn't absolutely love a good pair of pecs and abs that will compensate your lack of laundry sink at home. What if that person has the personality you will fall in love with ? Would you discredit this possibility just because of a laid back pic of him chilling with his mates after taking care of his health ? How ironic for you to talk about vanity. You're most likely overweight with deep body insecurities. Maybe you should learn a thing or two from these men and hit the gym every once a in while ?

gd8rd4o,"If you're looking to make money, a free dating website is the way to go. Free websites are plenty profitable through ads. And a free dating website is going to have many more users than a paid site. So from a ""making money"" point of view, you're still going to want to make it a free site. And most free sites try to double-dip with paid extra features to maximize profits.

The old okcupid model is one that clearly worked from both a business model perspective and from a functioning dating website perspective. The biggest hurdle to recreating it is simply getting lucky enough to get popular. There are lots of great ideas out there in the form of websites, but it takes a certain amount of luck to get popular enough that you hit a critical mass and start growing and become ""known"" that thats a good website to use. 

From the end-user perspective, the biggest thing a free dating website (when I say website, i mean website and/or app) needs, is an owner or ownership group that is committed to making it a good tool and not committed solely to making money. That's pretty much it. All websites are going to suck if their goal is to simply wring out as much money from single people as possible. OKCupid's original owners once wrote an article how paid dating sites have backwards incentives to keep you single so you'll keep paying to use the website, and okcupid has no such incentives. But of course that is nonsense. Whether users are paying a monthly fee directly or whether the site is free and paid for by ads, the cash flow is the same. Site owners make money the more people use the site, the longs people remain single, the more they'll use the site. If all users find someone special in a week, then on any given week, there will not be very many users and the site will not make money. So all dating sites have backwards incentives. You need an owner that to some degree doesn't care about that, and cares primarily about making the site the best at what it is, the best dating site in this case. 

And in a way, facebook dating actually has the least worst incentives in this department. You're already a facebook users and you will keep being one when you get in a relationship. So with facebook it's more about giving you one more thing to do to try to keep you using facebook. Which is still better incentive than ""if we keep this user single, they'll keep browsing profiles and giving us ad impressions"".

Now this is kind of a separate topic but in terms of the details of actually making this hypothetic site GOOD, there are a lot of things you could do. You could have search filters for a minimum profile character count and minimum number of photos. These could be default. You could work out a statistical way to rate peoples messages based on how many they send and how long they are, and also potentially how often they get replies. You could come up with an internal score of how ""good"" a message is. And then better messages could float to the top in someone's inbox. Along with messages that pass those same search filters like at least 3 pictures, and at least 200 characters. Features like that would encourage people to put in real effort. And having ""full inboxes"" wouldn't really be a problem because the system could do a pretty good job of separating the crap from the good stuff. Plus even with no such system, I would argue that the ""full inbox"" problem was still much less of a problem than the current problem of ""people don't see your messages, you might as well be talking to a wall"".",0,0.9992000000000001,train

If you treat the other person with respect and no expectations, you'll find people eventually who are on your wavelength. Just take it easy, be honest, and don't feel like anyone owes you their time.

I always saw a ton of people matching 90% or more, but take the percentages with a grain of salt.

Online gives people security in anonymity and ghosting avoids awkwardness/awkward conversation.  But again, it takes just a second to say ""This has been fun but I don't think we can take this further.  I wish you luck,"" or something like that if you truly don't feel the potential.

Disappearing and then coming back is a symptom that they're lonely, too.  You're a security blanket, and you'll make them laugh, feel better, and they'll ghost again.

if she had potential in her career so she could get out of it, or she had a nice set plan on paying things off etc then that would also help. we can cheap out on dates and plan what to do that wouldnt dig her hole bigger.

gcp2c0o,"Debt is very complex, and is something that always had me worried with my ex, and is something I think about while dating right now.  It was not only the amount of debt, but the attitude toward spending money and accumulating more debt without a means to pay it off reliably or quickly, or making a budget for it.  There are really three kinds of debts to really consider:

1.  College debt.  Most people that I'd be interested in will probably have some college debt (unless they had scholarships), so on one hand is justifiable debt.  However, there is always a look at their major and school they went to.  $40k in debt from a state school and earning a decent enough income is OK.  $80k+ from schools like University of Phoenix making eh to OK income can be problematic because career advancement and mobility becomes a very real factor.  

2.  Car debts.  My ex bought a nice car that, while the monthly payments could be paid, it did leave things tighter than they needed to be.  It's not ""considerable debt,"" but it cost more than my own college education with a much higher APY than a college loan.  Objectively, that kind of spending is irresponsible, and I think speaks to the spirit of that OKC question.  It is also indicative of an unpleasant financial future and leveraging debt inappropriately.

3.  Credit card debts.  I've read horror stories on Reddit about large credit card debts, heard stories form friends about a SO with crazy CC debt, and I'm 99% sure my ex had her own CCs closed on her.  I grew up with both my parents iterating how important it is to not spend more than I can't pay off at the end of the period (though I obviously learned the hard way on why like the best of us).  CC debt can get out of hand very quickly, and shows a lack of budgeting and financial restraint if someone is way underwater.  It WILL become a big part of your life if you take things to the next level with someone.  

With these things in mind, it's seeing how much debt is justifiable, and how much more money you're willing to put into basic things within the relationship than the other person (food, vacations, rent, utilities, etc).  As another person also said, when it comes to a serious relationship--especially marriage--their debt will impact you just as much, especially for joint acquisitions like buying a house.  If two people have their finances under control, things are far easier on the relationship and a major area of stress and cause for breakups/divorce is no longer present.  If finances are not under control, it is something that WILL come up at least once a month and be an ongoing issue in the relationship.",4,-0.629,train

With that being said, debt is a touchy subject. It is something that I think about a lot. My last relationship was just me having to support myself and my partner at the time because he coped with his issues by spending money beyond his means and trying to impress the Jones'. It was exhausting and frustrating to be expected to foot the bill for years while he got to have all these nice things for himself. My concerns going forward have been 1. does the person commonly spend beyond their means for things simply for optics? (nice cars, expensive products) 2. does the person expect me to foot the bill for their living habits? I think it gets a bit murky because then it falls to: what items would be considered items for optics? I don't like looking at someone and judging what they buy and make, and try to be understanding.

Idk why everyone is treating you like you're an idiot. It can take a literal decade of dating women to even begin to fully comprehend all these bullshit 'hints' and 'signs'.

The good news is that women that live by these kinds of things aren't worth your time in the first place. They're inconsiderate of others, unconfident in themselves, and worst of all generally dishonest.

People that are honest and real will never have a problem saying things straight up.

The best advice I can give, after ~20 years of dating is: **Start off being the person who cares more, then switch to being the person who cares equally, until its a serious relationship.** 

Doesn't mean you need to change your personality or anything about yourself. But just be sure if you're gonna put time and effort into something, that the other person is doing the same.

People that are actually interested and worth our time will show interest and put in the time.

Like - If you regularly message a paragraph and they respond with 2 words - Out of kindness you should respond with two words, then watch them disappear.

Move on to the next one.

If you try to set up a date and they don't seem totally interested, tell them to let you know when they wanna hang out and never bring it up yourself again.

Move on to the next one.

Women get so much attention that it's boring to them. So if you're the one guy who doesn't seem to really care that much, they're gonna be interested since you're different.

Though, keep those types as nothing more than fuck buddies. Like I was saying, they're not the real ones.

Also, disclaimer: I may get hate for some of the things said in this comment, but on everything I love and believe in it's all based on my actual personal experiences with more women than I can count from all over the US. Maybe it's different with foreign women, idk.

It's such a double standard that many women expect men to pick up on these ""hints"". But somehow we're in the wrong for expecting you to talk to us straight.

And* by definition they're not even hints, they're obscure responses that we can see time and time again don't actually communicate what you think they do.

**Bottom line:** If you don't want to hang out/talk to a guy - just say so. Beating around the bush to protect your own emotions from the occasional guy that is rude about it is completely selfish to the majority of men who would appreciate a straight up response so they can know to move on.

    b. No streaming originals

    c. No two day run propaganda docs about how the liberals are destroying the country

    d. No three day run movies about firefighters finding Jesus

    e. No strange art films about the thoughts of fetuses as they are being aborted that ran in the art house off K Street and you saw to impress the batista at your favorite Starbucks.



2) They must have been released between OCTOBER 1, 1990 and SEPTEMBER 30, 2020. 



3) All genres are welcome and encouraged. Musicals? Tighten those tenor clamps.. Kids? You know we do wrong by them constantly. Horror? The gore the merrier!! Romance? It just isn't a real Turkey Day without Katherine Heigl showing up. Comedy?? Does anything hurt more than unfunny jokes?? Docs? Western? Action? Drama? Allof it!

gc5d6wg,"This happened to me from the opposite perspective: 

I once dated a single mother for a few weeks, and during one of the early (2nd or 3rd) dates, an issue came up with her child or childcare. She had to stop the date and tend to the issue, and when I asked what was happening, it sounded like it would only take an hour or so to fix it. So, since I was in no particular hurry, and I'd been enjoying our date anyways, I offered to drive her where she needed to be, and to wait for her until she was done. She seemed surprised by my offer, but accepted.

So we did just that, and ended up waiting about 1.5 hours for her. While I waited, I just pulled out a book I had in my car and  passed the time easily. Afterwards, when she returned to the car and we started driving to a restaurant to continue the date, she sat in silence for a few minutes. 

Then suddenly she asked me, ""OP, why are you being so nice to me?"" 

To which, I brilliantly replied, ""Huh?""

Basically, she wanted to know why I was being so nice, what was my ulterior motives? She asked something like ""I don't understand why you drove me and waited for me... what are you after?""

I was kinda flabbergasted, to be honest. I'm don't recall what I responded. To me, when I decided to date a single mother, I knew that their kid is probably their first priority (rightly so)... so if I want to date one, I should be ready and willing to take that into consideration, and act/react appropriately if it comes up, right? I mean this seemed so obvious, that I didn't even really think about it ahead of time, that was just how it had to be.

Well, we ended up only going on another date or two, but something seemed different, like some spark was lost. We didn't continue any kind of relationship afterwards, so not sure what happened to her, but it always made me wonder, was it because she thought I had some weird motive? Was I TOO nice? It also made me wonder what kind of assholes she'd been seeing up until that point, that my small act of understanding seemed so out of proportion...",7,0.9897,train

I think what the author is saying is that if you were actually meant to be with the first girl you would have already made a pass at her before deciding to move on with another girl, not moved on with another girl at all, or left the new relationship once you realized the girl you loved had mutual feelings.

I had a spell in my early 20s, having graduated into a recession that affected my field overly hard, where 18 months out I was stuck in a low skill contract position in my field after a year of temp work, using almost nothing I learned in my degree, busting my ass just to try to get a break and ""catch up"" with peers who managed to land a job only a few months prior to me. I was making less than half they did, but I managed to squirrel away enough to cover the inevitable emergencies.

That made me unhappy, and I let it make me bitter. I did not realize this until a very close friend set me up with a very attractive woman in a group setting. We chatted, joked, etc, I thought all was well...

Well, she didn't give me the time of day. ""He seems really bitter"" was evidently most of the one sentence given to my friend, and he gave it to me straight. Cue some introspection, it was hard to draw the line between being unhappy about something and letting it affect everything else.

I wouldnt dismiss what he said. he may be off the charts but I wouldnt be shocked if it were true. look at snowden. 
the tracking itself, ONLY on your phone, is a huge cause for concern. you have no idea how youre being tracked and can be located to within 6 feet. at all times. even if youre indoors and with the phone off and no gps signal. 
ever hear of wifi triangulation? 
people are naive and readily give info to the big 4 companies and have no idea how they are tracked and have NO privacy. your mic can be turned on, your camera as well to spy. zoom is a chinese company and they can look through any cam session they want. 
you have a full list of every info on you be it google fb MS and apple. one way or the other. through emails through chat through your posts through the phone location tracking (again, it doesnt matter if your phone is off) etc.

Apparently w/o A-List there is a limit on swipes but it's set at such a high number I forget what it is (but has also been discussed in the sub) which it makes it essentially unlimited.

Back when there was a search button that was the only way I used the site and what I recommended everybody to do.  But it is gone and griping about it here isn't going to change that.  Instead I have learned to use the Questions tab and the keyword search.  It isn't quite the same as it used to be, but it eliminates all that doubletake swiping nonsense.

nonsense. there is no such thing as missed opportunity. it may be a good thing as you missed the ""opportunity"" to not get infected. 

if it doesnt feel right, listen to your intuition. if its guys trying to convince you to date, well thats because they are mostly pursuing and want to meet. its mostly the guys who are getting very edgy because of not meeting. 

""Nobody can have casual sex right now women who are irritated by men who want this"" on one hand women also want to meet and have relationships or sex, but guys do pressure about it. 

as a guy, I dont want to meet. I dont want to get infected and sit at home in isolation...or worse. im willing to forgo dating at the moment. many restaurants are still closed and other things as well. even sitting in a restaurant with others worries me. people eating (no masks) and breath droplets are all in the air. no shows atm, no jazz clubs to goto, so no thanks. 

its a bad loop. the site also causes much frustration. the site is crippled which puts stress on people. people are nervous about the pandemic, everyone is stressed and people have huge walls up. guys and girls both have bad communications skills. tons of confusion. he matched me but didnt write me, situations that lead to more frustrations. and it escalates more and more. its not a calm situation because of 2 forces. the pandemic, and okc sabatoging users from a good experience. I see your frustration

listen to your intuition...it MUST feel right. the guy will be patient and understanding and youll try a work around. but you have to check who hes around day to day. because if he lives with other people, and hes around other people, its something to think about. not necessarily worry. symptoms take mostly up to a week to show. so if he met you now, and has contact with others daily..he himself wouldnt know if he is infected till a few days later.

thats why i wont date at THIS time. I date single moms. they have kids who are with other kids and she in her work. they opened schools twice after 2 lockdowns. within 2 weeks they were all closed. kids infected the teachers. a lot of asymptomatic kids unfortunately

I said it before and will say it again, you cannot rely on humans to do the right thing. people are selfish and greedy and think about what they want diregarding guidelines or thinking about others besides their own wants. 

vaccines should start in mid/late december. that will get many people excited. the line will be so long. many wont get it at first. and thats also good. if some get and some dont, then those peopke are those you wont get infected from and as soon as more get vaccined, the less the virus has to infect and it will diminish.

gbcxnsn,"I've read a lot of stories and quite a number of studies. There are common threads, but each story is different, and there are a number of them.

But one thing that compounds them is the use of the word virgin as an insult, or when it's used with condescension, as though it's a challenge to a man's masculinity, or in the case of a woman, her desirability. It's sex-shaming on the level of being called a slut; it suggests that one's sexual habits define who they are, how social they are (or fail to be), and so on. It's why people in their late twenties and early thirties might give up: *if they find out I'm a virgin, they might nope out...*

I would suggest that if you want to learn more about other people, keep your questions on point - leave your experience out of it unless the conversation goes in that direction. A virgin needn't be put into a position to justify their virginity, and you don't need to justify what you don't know by talking about why your experience is different. Just like in life, if you want to know something about someone else, give them the space. I promise that there are few virgins who will condescend by saying *""Jesus... 16 partner? No WONDER you have no clue!"",* but perhaps more who might think *""Welp, here's another one already telling me about all the sex they're having!""*.

But enough of that: I lost my virginity in my mid thirties. A few years prior to that I started to consider that it might be possible to be nobody's type. And prior to that, I tried, but just didn't land many dates. I could make excuses: I was a high school dropout and didn't to the whole post-secondary thing. I was overweight. I was an IT contractor for a long time, which meant that I mostly worked on my own, so there was little contact with people. And I wasn't great at promoting myself because I lacked the confidence, which meant little business, and therefore little money to socialize with.

What changed was realizing that I needed help, getting that help - welfare for a year - and then getting a regular job. But that didn't fix the emotional problems I had. I realized that I needed deeper supports, got them, and (skipping the details), I had a few breakthroughs that helped me to realize that I was pushing people away and never giving people the chance to choose me - professionally, and in my social life.

I lost it a few weeks later to a friend.

I'm in my late thirties now, and working at a respected educational institution. That isn't because of sex - sex didn't cure me - but because I learned a lot about myself. I've had a few partners since then, with some great experiences, and some... not so great.

But sex didn't help me build a career; realizing what my potential was and, to steal a cliche, discovering self-love did. Because prior to getting help, I kinda didn't have faith in myself.

For some of these people, they feel hostility to their own virginity in part because they perceive that having sex is something *normies* just do. In that sense they feel that they are marginalized. They are easy targets of the incel cult; after all, if they share points A, B, and C with a self-described Incel, why can't point D, E, and F be them as well?

They don't perceive not having sex as a choice; rather they perceive it as something people choose not to do - with them, specifically. And since they tie that sense of being normal to having sex, they must therefore not be normal.

When the film *The Forty Year-old Virgin* came out, it became cliche to not want to be that guy. The lesson that people miss is that it's normal to *not* have sex, just as it's normal to have sex. His friends were supportive in the way they might be if it were about taking a roller coaster. His anxiety and his hesitation to change is what keeps him from finding a lover.

The primary barriers to getting both of you to either one of those ""next level"" of trust/engagement is comfort, familiarity, trust. Right? So if I start out new conversations ""what's your number"" or ""send pics"", that's going nowhere.

I never put a ton of thought into being clever or overthink it. Low key works for me. I try not to come on too strong.

It is astounding to me how common it is for chats to follow this format, whether I approached them or they approached me:

1. Me: salutation, amusing comment, ask question (non-generic, tailored to profile interests)

2. Her: answers question about herself.

3. (Insert sound of crickets chirping, while I pause to see if she's going to ask me anything about myself.)

4. Return to #1, rinse, repeat.

Many women will happily follow this format for pretty much as long as you would like. I finally decided that, if they have not asked me anything at all about myself by the fifth, no later than sixth exchange of messages... I clock out.

Once in a while I'll drop a not so subtle hint, like ""gosh, I feel like I'm conducting an interview, even though I don't really look like Barbara Walters. She's got better hair."" (I'm bald). This is usually good for a lol, and an overhead flight of the hint.

gb7tz67,"I think the key is to distance yourself from the concept of swipe culture right away.

Every single person has their passions, and that's what i always look for in the profiles - because they might be mutual passions or maybe something i have never done or tried or even known about. 

The woman i am dating now asked me amazing questions in order to get to know who i really am from day one of us messaging. She asked about cooking. I asked her about where a photo in her profile was taken because i loved the street art. That led us to talking about travel and food in general. Things we loved and enjoyed. 

Then she asked about horror movies because i mentioned it on my profile and she hadn't seen many, she asked me about fine art because i mentioned my BFA, she asked me about my favorite post-punk music because i mentioned it in my profile as well. These were all really good and safe questions - it demonstrated she had read my profile or remembered things i had mentioned early on and she wanted more DEPTH in order to understand why they were important to me, and to learn more about something she didn't know anything about. It demonstrated that she wanted to know what i THINK. I asked her about skydiving, about where she had traveled abroad and about what instruments she played. We ended up talking about music, about places we wish we could go abroad and then places we loved locally - which then lead us to arrange our first date. 

Not once did i mention a single physical feature. I never called her any terms of endearment like hon or dear. All that came later, naturally and even then i waited until she did herself so i knew she would be comfortable. 

The key to conversation is to ask people about themselves, the key to continuing conversations is to PAY ATTENTION and genuinely be interested in getting to know the person.

Emotions are complicated, science doesn't even really understand them, it's slanted heavily in favor of people putting up good fronts instead of being genuine and honest ( which is bad in an actual relationship), and everyone wants someone put together, when in truth we're all flailing around trying to figure out life.

This reads to me like he's highly insecure and can't stand the idea of being single. Which is relatable, but are huge red flags. Dating, even relationships in general, incur a substantial amount of risk to be in. You give up a lot of agency and power to someone else, it's inherently going to be uncertain. But he padded his ""gamble"" by making more than one, that way he's less likely to ""lose"". Also, this is highly dishonest, even if it's by omission. You actually dodged a bullet, if my evaluation is even close to accurate.

It helps to keep in mind that as a generation as a whole, we have a HUGE problem with self-esteem, coupled with high levels of anxiety and depression, mean that what most people are looking for is someone to make them feel better about themselves. That's not inherently a bad thing, but for most people it's a coping mechanism, so the relationship itself is very unhealthy.

Also, I empathize. I've ""clicked"" with a fair number of women, and they never go very far. If I don't get ghosted I get a flimsy ""reason"" (which is fair, guys suck at being rejected, I don't blame women for having to be careful about doing it), despite things seemingly going really well for a few months.

gbfje8g,"On your original post:

I think the issue of simultaneous dating comes down to whether one can or can't do it. I personally find dating multiple people at the same time nearly impossible, but many can do that quite alright. Finding that they have been one of many may feel disappointing to those of us who are only able to meaningfully interact with a single person when looking for a romantic match, but that's the way it often is.

On ghosting, I'd say that a person is only ghosting you if they're not responding to your messages of the kind that are supposed to / would usually prompt a reply. It appears that he has responded and given you a straightforward answer too? Maybe this was just a case of neither party messaging the other, but if you had messaged them following the most recent date and they had not replied, they had indeed ghosted you. If that was the case, well, people do what they will. Our task in this is to find those who will what would bring us together.

I haven't read the others' comments, so this may just be repeating what has already been said here. Otherwise, I hope this makes sense :).
