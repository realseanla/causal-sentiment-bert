>According to the order unsealed by Howell, federal prosecutors in Washington said they had obtained evidence of a bribery scheme in which someone ""would offer a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence"".
  
  
>The Justice Department had to ask Howell's permission to view certain electronic communications between a lawyer and clients, who were not identified. Howell granted the request in August, saying attorney-client privilege did not apply in that instance.
  
  
>US District Judge Beryl Howell has released a heavily redacted order that described what she called a ""bribery-for-pardon"" investigation.
  
  
>CNN reported officials had raided unidentified offices and seized documents and more than 50 devices, including iPhones, tablets, laptops, and hard drives.
  
  
>Prosecutors had said they planned to ""confront"" three unnamed individuals with the communications and finish their investigation.

  
  
>Presidents enjoy wide latitude under the US constitution in pardoning people convicted of federal crimes.

Edgar and Vonna Jo Gregory pardonsEdit

In March 2000, Bill Clinton pardoned Edgar and Vonna Jo Gregory, owners of the carnival company United Shows International, for charges of bank fraud from a 1982 conviction. Although the couple had already been released from prison, the prior conviction prevented them from doing business in certain American states. First Lady Hillary Clinton's youngest brother, Tony Rodham, was an acquaintance of the Gregorys, and had lobbied Clinton on their behalf.[15] In October 2006, the group Judicial Watch filed a request with the U.S. Justice Department for an investigation, alleging that Rodham had received $107,000 from the Gregorys for the pardons in the form of loans that were never repaid, as part of a quid pro quo scheme.[16]",0,0,train

Barr does not have complete control over every single thing that happens at the DOJ. Yes he's the head, but if he interfered in every single investigation that Trump wanted him to, he'd have a mutiny on his hands as his entire department would quit on him. The DOJ has a very long history of operating as independently as possible and the career prosecutors and investigators that work for or with the DOJ take that very seriously. 

Barr has absolutely pushed for bullshit investigations, and he's definitely influenced some to end early (like the Mueller investigation). But he can't stop every single investigation. He just can't. Not while maintaining any semblance of authority within his department.

In fact it seems to have gotten to the point that some parts of the DOJ are already more or less mutinying against him in their own quiet respectful ways. Some groups like the SDNY within the DOJ appear to be insisting that they continue to investigate what they believe is worth investigating, regardless of what Barr and Trump think. And their challenge to Barr is basically ""if you want me to stop investigating Trump and his businesses, you'll have to fire me.""  And Barr has fired some people. But the investigations don't stop because they just get handed off to someone else. Barr would have to burn the department to the ground firing everyone all the way down to the mail clerks before he'd actually get those investigations to stop. He has generally found it easier to try to delay those investigations rather than stop them outright.

The institutions that our country is built on are robust and are damned hard to get rid of in 4 years. The damage done to them is going to take a long time to fix, but Trump never stood a chance of completely uprooting them. He lacked the know-how and the popular will of the people.",1,0,test

Also, while a President *might* be able to pardon someone for doing something illegal that he ordered, it's unlikely that he can pardon himself, for just that reason. So he could still probably be brought up on murder conspiracy charges.

And, you know, the simple solution is just not to vote for a President that has no ethics.",0,0,test
gece0hd,"But that is what Impeachment is for...

That's literally what it was designed for. Congress can Impeach a President for any reason. Subsequently the Senate can find the President guilty of any Impeachment charges and remove them from office.

This is why the Founding Fathers made Impeachment. The President does not have to break a written statute. No where did they even suggest that and no where does it stipulate that in the Constitution. The House of Representatives could charge a President with something like ""Unbecoming of an Officer"" or some shit and the Senate is well within their Constitutional power to convict and remove. 

Let's talk about preemptive pardons. You cannot do that. To receive a pardon you have to have been convicted of a crime first. It doesn't make any sense to preemptively pardon since our legal system follows ""innocent until proven guilty"". 

Trump cannot preemptively pardon himself because he needs to be charged with a crime (Impeachment) and convicted (removed from office). The Founding Fathers thought of this loophole 244 years ago.

Edit: for others to see about Nixon and citations why the President cannot preemptively Pardoned.

Nixon was never charged to begin with

It's a moot point with Nixon. Had he been charged the Pardon would have been challenged. Since he was never charged it was never challenged.

Furthermore, the Constitution says directly:

> The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of impeachment.

Key word in Section 2 Clause 1 is ""offenses"". The definition for ""offense"" is provided by 18 U.S. Code SS 3156

>the term ""offense"" means any criminal offense, other than an offense triable by court-martial, military commission, provost court, or other military tribunal, which is in violation of an Act of Congress and is triable in any court established by Act of Congress;

A more lay person's definition

>a breach of a law or rule; an illegal act.

This means ""offenses"" in Section 2 Clause 1 is referring to convictions as a person that has yet to be convicted is not in ""breach of a law"" by following ""innocent until proven guilty"" aka Presumption of Innocence.

Therefore the President can only pardon someone that has been convicted.",0,0,train

On the one hand, he has committed more crimes than most of the incarcerated population of the country and should absolutely be prosecuted for it. To not prosecute is to send a message to the next crazy fascist that there are no consequences, thus allowing their worst instincts to come forth. Also, to not prosecute is to lose and alienate a large segment of the democrative/progressive population that absolutely wants to see justice done. 

On the other hand, to prosecute him is to play right into the narrative he has been pushing for 5 years, which is that the establishment is against him and the deep state is out to get him. This narrative is already believed by over 70 million people, so it is fair to say it will have traction. This on top of the fact these people also believe that Biden is an illegitimate president and so anything that comes from his administration (even if not ordered by him) is by definition persecution of poor Trump. Trump is already a demigod in the eyes of these people and, should he go to jail under ""false pretenses"" he will become a martyr ""the likes of which the world has never seen"" (last part to be read in Trump voice); and the last time a bunch of people believed in a martyr we ended up with catholicism.

If he is prosecuted with a case that is less than air-tight, and he beats it and walks away without consequences (impeachment vibes) then he will basically be invincible and that will propel him to the stratosphere of political power and mass appeal.

That on top of norms, the look on the international stage, etc, etc. Long story short, all answers are wrong answers and there is no easy way out.

Many other presidents were criticized heavily for what they did in office. But Trump took lying and pissing people off to a new level.

I'm going to bet 100% chance he pardon's himself, family and a few select others.  

My thoughts are that his general actions during his time will be largely untouchable because of his status as a president and likely an incoming pardon.  The exception being the Ukraine thing because he was impeached over it which may mean a pardon may not cover it.  That said I think the majority of his troubles will be state level crimes and then his associates who have no protection flipping on him to implicate him on crimes that were never known of.

gebyati,Mainers are fearful of outsiders. Collins made sure to play into that nonsense.,0,0,test
geby70f,"From what I can gather, it happened for a few reasons.

If an individual running for higher office is from out of state, they often have to overcome huge prejudice.  Gideon is from Rhode island, and even though she has lived in the state for close to 16 years now, that will still dominate her identity.  People from Maine use the term ""from away"" to describe people not born in the state, and it's had huge cultural and political implications.

Angus King is from Virginia, but he's done well for himself because he split the vote running for governor back in 1994, and was able to overcome such prejudice partly because of it.

There is also still a lot of cultural memory in the state of Maine for Rockefeller Republicans, pre-Reagan Republicans that were much more centrist and progressive compared to today's Republicans.  Pro-choice, less emphasis on religion, and someone and so forth.  Collins to many is still seen as the last vestige of that era, an era which Maine has taken pride in.  They gave us Republicans Olympia Snowe and even Margaret Chase Smith who stood up to the red scare, one of the few Republicans to do so.

As a final point, and this one's more anecdotal, most of the people I talked to just felt that Gideon's ads were too much on the offensive.  People really didn't like the way she was coming off, and that is a very important and how much the state's going to support you. Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump back in the primaries, and Joe Biden beat Donald Trump partly because of this mentality.  Many people voted for both Joe Biden and Susan Collins, Republicans and Democrats alike.  And that's because they thought both of them presented themselves in a more genuine manner, plus the points from above  I don't know quite how to properly measure that though, but that's just the take I've gotten from talking to numerous people here.  I think it became obvious to the Gideon campaign in the last week or so, because she dropped the attack ads and just started thanking people for considering her. It was honestly a bit weird.

It's complex, but it's in part due to all of this. If the Democrats were able to put up someone who was from Maine, but also made a platform based upon who she is rather than who she isn't they probably would have done better.",1,0,train

If Trump just threw that in an S&P500 index fund he would be extremely rich without working a day of his life. With $400m startup easy money would include:

* Casinos -- proven easy money Trump went bankrupt with them HOW?
* Real estate -- buying normal real estate, slums and crap would have netted Trump 10s to 100s of billions of dollars. But no, Trump wanted expensive, gaudy stuff, so he didn't make much money in real estate.
* Illegal drug trade -- importing and transporting drugs is highly lucrative. Reddit used to repost every week how Pablo Escobar paid $2,500 a month on rubber bands just to hold his money together. That is a shitload of money.

Edgar and Vonna Jo Gregory pardonsEdit

In March 2000, Bill Clinton pardoned Edgar and Vonna Jo Gregory, owners of the carnival company United Shows International, for charges of bank fraud from a 1982 conviction. Although the couple had already been released from prison, the prior conviction prevented them from doing business in certain American states. First Lady Hillary Clinton's youngest brother, Tony Rodham, was an acquaintance of the Gregorys, and had lobbied Clinton on their behalf.[15] In October 2006, the group Judicial Watch filed a request with the U.S. Justice Department for an investigation, alleging that Rodham had received $107,000 from the Gregorys for the pardons in the form of loans that were never repaid, as part of a quid pro quo scheme.[16]",0,0,train

The real hoot about the originalist doctrine is how plain it is to see that our lawmakers haven't always been tremendously clear.

Did they include all the proven quote hoaxes unquote about the Russiagate nothingburger in his impeachment? They did. Because why wouldn't you. 

An often overlooked point of his extorting the Ukrainian president is this minor tangent: generally, world leaders are pretty up to date on world events, so they know Putin controls Trump with debt and Eastern Europe altogether with the threat of violence, and thus the obvious unspoken clause to Trump's request for dirt on Biden was ""plus if you don't, you're as good as dead -- daddy told me so and I got kind of turned on just by his sheer confidence when he said it the man is a sexual junglecat"" Modest conjecture on a closed topic.

What I've learned from the last four years is as long as your party controls one of the houses of Congress, especially the Senate, it doesn't matter what you do. The scary thing is that Trump, as you noted, is an idiot. What happens when it's an intelligent authoritarian in the same position?

gedw3d7,"I remained concerned about state charges, for a few reasons:

A state AG has a vested personal interest in getting either a guilty plea or a conviction from a former POTUS (to my knowledge it has never happened) - it would make their career. What they don't have is a meaningful interest in an aggressive sentencing, and that means a plea deal could mean a slap on the wrist.

Secondly, I believe Trump wants to live out his days at Mar-a-Lago, and that a judge would give him house arrest in lieu of prison time. I also believe that Trump has properly separated his financial past from his financial future, so any attempt to bury him under fines will only see him casting off his real estate and reality TV life and replacing it with a political media career. In short, I don't believe the legal system will be able to make Trump see meaningful punishment. 

Third, political capital is a real concept to consider, and it takes a hell of a lot at the state level to fight a POTUS when he's convinced half the country that he is innocent. Even if states like NY vote blue, they have plenty of Republicans woven into their political and business power structure.

geceruc,"> My understanding was that a President cannot pardon themselves.

That's why I said try. There's a lot of arguments saying why he can't do it, but there's nothing actually stopping him, so he's almost definitely going to try. Someone with standing would then have to bring it to court saying he can't do that. I assume this would be the DOJ under Biden. It would eventually go to SCOTUS and they would decide if it's constitutional or not. 1/3 of the SCOTUS is appointed by him, so I don't have confidence that he will be stopped, unless they are willing to think the damage this can do in the future

>What about crimes currently in progress? E.g. x has an illegal bank account at the time of the pardon, but does not close it before being pardoned. So, was the existence of the account pardoned, or just its use beforehand?

I think he can only pardon himself for what he's already done, so if he pardons himself for an illegal bank account, and then he keeps using the bank account, I think any use after would not be part of the pardon. That would almost definitely be something also taken to court, though. In that case, he DOJ would arrest him for his continued illegal use and say it's not covered in the pardon because it hadn't happened yet, and Trump would be the one to fight it up to SCOTUS to decide and he would claim it's the behavior he outlined in the pardon. I don't think he could win that, though

I'm not a lawyer, but I've read and watched a lot of stuff, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt lol.

But the idea isn't that suddenly a pardoned person has a change of heart. The idea is that if the person has pled guilt for a particular crime, they can no longer incriminate themself of that crime and therefore don't have protections against compulsion of testimony that would otherwise do so. So an interested party in court could potentially subpoena the pardoned person for their testimony against another individual complicit in the same crime.

So yeah, it's a series of dominoes based on what is currently a Schrodinger's confession of guilt. We'll never know until it goes to SCOTUS.

He won because the people of Maine *voted him in* lol. There's literally no way to get around the fact that Mainers elected a blatant racist not once but *twice*.

gedv4vb,"I'm assuming you meant to say ""he never won with *over* 50% of the vote"". That sentence doesn't really make a whole lot of sense given the context of the post. If you actually did mean to say 'under 50% of the vote' then I'm confused about what you mean. 

Anyway: Yes, it's true he never won with 50% of the vote. But that doesn't matter. That's not the point and I think you know that. 

The point is he won nearly 50% of the vote his *second* term. He was literally within a few points of 50%. That's *after* he'd already been blatantly and openly racist for 4 years. Mainers were very aware of his racism and yet almost 50% of them voted for him. And he won. In fact, he won greater percentage of people his second time around. 

I'm in one of the states below you and watched the LePage stuff unfold with horror. The whole region did. Maine really surprised a lot of by revealing an ugly side of itself. I'm confused by you guys in the comment section trying to defend the election of  LePage and spin it as proof that Maine doesn't have a racism problem. He was elected 6 years ago. Not 50. Not even 30. **6 years ago**. The nearly 50% of people who voted for an open racist didn't suddenly vanish from Maine.

I frequently visit Maine. I love spending time there. And I get the impulse to defend the place you live against these kinds of accusations but trying to spin the LePage stuff is not the way to go about it. Not defending it at all is the way to go about it. It's better to acknowledge that yeah, Maine might have a little more of a racism problem than other places in the US. That way you can work to *fix* the problem. Ignoring it does nothing but maintain the status quo. It also puts you in the awkward position of having to defend and make excuses for racism. I doubt you want to literally shield racists, right? That's sort of exactly what you're doing with these excuses.

Edit: Just looked it up. LePage got 37.6% of the vote in 2010 and 48.2% in 2014. He was governor until last year serving nearly 10 years. Some of his actions: he refused to attend MLK Jr. day, he told the NAACP to ""kiss his butt"" after rejecting several invitations from them, he said asylum seekers brought in disease, he courted sov cit groups, he said that Obama hates white people. That's all before he won a second term with, again, 48% of the vote. His most infamous comment: 

>	(Drug dealers) are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty; these types of guys, they come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we have to deal with down the road.

There's a ton of questions still in the air and it seems supplies will be limited at least.

From the article:

>The CDC vaccine program playbook says that for planning purposes, state and local health agencies should assume ""limited COVID-19 vaccine doses may be available by early November 2020"" if a vaccine is authorized or licensed by the FDA. The playbook says vaccine supplies may increase substantially in 2021.  
>  
>That limited initial supply is expected to go to health care workers, other essential workers and people at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19.  
>  
>Administration sites may be limited early on to target particular populations and storage requirements. Later, sites could expand to include pediatric and adult health care providers and pharmacies.

I think I might actually know the group you're referring to. 

I'm not familiar with details beyond public information but I'll speculate: 
1.) There were many changes to the program at various points in time, leading borrowers to be treated differently depending on the timing of their initial application. Thus, this might be completely legal. 
2.) Regulating bodies such as the SBA only have so much capacity. Put simply, it's not hard to believe that a business could get away with something like that - but it's possible they'll be found out during an audit. Fun fact, the SBA has said that all loans over $1m (or maybe 2? Can't remember rn) WILL be audited. 
3.) By taking steps like increasing pay and claiming each franchise as separate entities, it's heavily dependent on factors such as how their taxes are filled, but they were probably able to meet the legal requirements to qualify and were given a loan on that basis alone (with the assumption that the money would be used in accordance with legal guidance for receiving PPP loans)",0,0,train
geffx2t,"Just wanted to add. If that group is eventually found to have done something wrong, they could face some serious legal repercussions. Many entities and individuals are already dealing with the consequences of gaming the ppp system.

They'll probably catch up someday though, which leads back to my bottom line that banks are terrified of being reprimanded so most aren't gaming the system (or doing so for their clients).

gefr2tq,"This is a perfect illustrates why Trickle Down Economics is a fraudulent concept. Trickle Down  dictates that the $1 mill windfall should have made its way down the line to the employees, or at least gone to expand the office and grow the business so it can hire more employees (""create jobs"").

What actually happens in nearly 100% of such cases, is that the owner accumulates that excess as profit. It NEVER trickles down, which why the stock market is at 30,000, while workers make essentially the same as in 1974 (when the tax code was re-written to favor the wealthy at the expense of the middle/ working class), and the minimum wage has been raised only TWICE in 23 years, for a total of $2.25. It goes straight into the owner's personal investment portfolio as profit, where it is essentially dead money that does relatively little to drive the economy. 

Which is why the tax code needs to be re-written once again, but this time to favor the middle/ working class at the expense of the wealthy. It is time to try Trickle UP Economics, in which money is limited at the top, and is shared with the workers who do the actual work and create the value for the corporation. The workers won't just accumulate it, they'll spend it on houses, furniture, vacations, restaurants, cars, etc. If they do accumulate it, it will only be deferred to retirement, when it will be spent then. All of that drives the economy hard, making it grow.

But isn't that unfair to the rich people? Not at all. All those houses, cars, vacations, etc. are sold by the rich, so all they are doing by making sure the working class isn't squeezed too tight is making sure there is an endless supply of customers for their products. The money that you give to the workers will still end up up in the rich man's personal portfolio, it will just grease the economy on the way to getting there.

This in turn led to the banks prioritizing existing and larger customers (higher loan amount = higher fee for the bank- I believe the actual percentage fee were lower for higher loans but in any case it was higher dollar amounts for larger loans), which led to all the commotion where people were worried about the money running out, small businesses that most needed help not being able to secure a loan, etc. 

Like I said, the whole thing was a shitshow - they finalized the guidelines on a Thursday I believe, and Mnuchin told everyone to go apply for the loans that Friday.

*****
> Welp, now his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, a man the president pardoned just last week for &quot;Any and all possible offenses&quot; related to the Mueller probe, has endorsed a call for the president to &quot;Temporarily suspend the Constitution,&quot; &quot;Declare limited martial law,&quot; have &quot;The military oversee a national re-vote,&quot; and &quot;Silence the destructive media.&quot; Wow! Sounds a bit like a coup.

> Maybe the best part is the idea that you can have &quot;Limited&quot; martial law, or that suspending the Constitution would just be &quot;Temporary,&quot; or that the only organization that could oversee a legitimate election-read: one where Donald Trump wins-is the military.

> The military is not some repository of Real American sentiment-Donald Trump enjoys broad disapproval in the armed forces, including at the officer level, so it&#039;s not likely the army or navy will participate in the president&#039;s plot to overturn the election.

The Republican aligned police departments across the country will not change their affiliation, allegiance or their behaviour when Biden takes office.

We do know they're aligned with Trump. We also know it's a pervasive issue due to the number of police forces engaging in unlawful behaviour to assist Trump supporters.

The military may well be needed to protect the American People from the police and insurrectionists. It's going to be a long couple of months without a net, and it would make a lot of sense for Republicans to act before Biden is inaugurated, if they're going to.

Criminal convictions and morality - unfortunately - in our modern society have no relationship to one another.  


The issue with someone like Flynn is he has repeatedly displayed amoral psychological pathologies.  For many mental illnesses we still have no treatment, and for others we do have treatment but our society isn't set up to incentivize people to get help and/or we deny people medical treatment because its not profitable.  Flynn and people like him have shown themselves to be psychologically dangerous; it has nothing to do with criminal conviction history.  Frankly having ""convicted felon"" as a pseudo-prerequisite for amorality permits undue amnesty for dangerous psychopaths that aren't breaking laws.  It allows people to escape serious conversations about dangerous behavioral inclinations by saying ""What crime have I committed?""  


Anyway using the term ""convicted felon"" needlessly slurs millions of people that our modern society would by-and-large agree are not amoral \*or\* dangerous.

>In the months following the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln struggled to preserve the Union. Many objected to Lincoln's extraordinary use of Presidential authority, in particular his suspension of the right of ""Habeas Corpus"". On June 12, 1863 Lincoln defended his extreme measures in a letter published in the New York Times. Citing Article I of the Constitution he argued: ""Ours is a case of rebellion...in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that 'the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it', is the provision which specifically applies to our present case.""

Attacking federal buildings and police, cowardly punching innocent people in the back of the head, assaulting people just eating in restaurants, and burning minority-owned businesses to the ground. All with elected officials in Democrat/Socialist-controlled cities openly encouraging this planned violence against civilians and businesses. Then, to advance their cause, these socialists are acting to ""Defund the Police,"" creating chaos and suspending the rule of law that protects millions of average, and particularly minority, Americans. The results being massive increases in violent crime and deaths in our cities and the destruction of small businesses orchestrated by those politicians and leftist groups, many [funded by domestic and international communists](https://wethepeopleconvention.org/articles/DemSocialistsParty-Ownedby-China).

No one voted for these things that were hidden from the majority of Americans by the corrupt media. Not only do we have corrupt media, like in Lincoln's day, we have a new and more sinister form of media in Big Tech, actively censoring free speech and promoting leftist propaganda to blind our citizens to their real goals and the real consequences of their actions - the end of America as we have known it.

A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people. Federal candidates only. Paper ballots. No computers. Hand-counted with both parties watching every vote. Only registered voters. Photo ID to prove residence. Conducted safely with everyone wearing masks and six feet apart, just like we did in Ohio. Only then can the winning candidate be accepted as legitimate by a true majority of We the People who must give our consent to be justly governed! Unfortunately we are at a point where we can only trust our military to do this because our corrupt political class and courts have proven their inability to act fairly and within the law.

What's the centrists plan for black lives matter?  It can't be nothing.  I have very little idea of what Biden's actual plan is.  And if Biden's and the majority of the Democratic Party's Plan for justice reform starts and stops with just saying ""black lives matter"" then everyone else is going to fill in all that ambiguity.  Whether it be the activists who are calling for defunding the police or it be republicans who saying democrats are going to abolish the police.  If democrats can not drive a narrative or message then they will be slaves to those who can and do.  It's shocking that we are still having this discussion 10 years after the rise of the tea party.

The only narrative that democrats have been able to successfully weaponize has been healthcare.  Something that literally relies on people's lives being at stake so obviously it's a winning message.

Edit: I'll say that I find it interesting that about 5 or so people have said ""just look at his website"".  That's not a narrative. If your narrative is ""go look it up yourself"" then you're going to lose.  It's so surprising that that even needs to be said.  That's like basic marketing.

SHE IS REDEFINING WHAT LGBTQ+ EQUALITY LOOKS LIKE

Addressing the issue head on during Pride Month in New York, AOC gave a speech breaking down the LGBTQ+ policies she would introduce to move towards equality in the community. Namely, making PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) widely available, tackling disproportionate levels of homelessness amongst LGBTQ+ youth and ensuring protections against transgender people in police custody.

Though perhaps her biggest hurdle has been fighting for The Equality Act on behalf of the LGBTQ+community. This bill, if passed, would enshrine civil rights protections to the LGBT community as federal law, which has twice failed on Capitol Hill, leaving 30 states without protections for the community and putting LGBTQ+ individuals at risk of discrimination in housing and workplaces.
________________________________________

In January of 2019, AOC helped raise money for trans youth. When YouTuber Harry Brewis hosted a Donkey Kong 64 livestream to garner funds for Mermaids, an organization that supports transgender children, Ocasio-Cortez called in to support and discuss trans rights amid the government shutdown at the time. With her help, the digital event raised more than $300,000 for the organization. 
________________________________________

In February of 2019, Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) unveiled plans for the Green New Deal, proposed legislation that aims to address both climate and economic inequality in the U.S. The initial proposal outlined policies that would help the country achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, invest in infrastructure that would help create jobs and promote social justice and equality. Since the unveiling, AOC has emphasized that the Green New Deal should be implemented in a way that doesn't exclude marginalized communities and that addresses climate change in the long run. 
________________________________________

Ocasio-Cortez went back to her bartending roots this May to show solidarity for tipped workers in the service industry. She stood behind the bar again to help spread awareness for the Raise the Wage Act, which would put an end to below-minimum wages for tipped workers in bars and restaurants. The event was put together by an organization called Restaurant Opportunities Centers United. The group urged New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to institute the wage act in the past and believed AOC could help get their cause more attention. They were right.

gef57tv,"From Joe Biden's website:

[https://joebiden.com/justice/#](https://joebiden.com/justice/#)

The Biden Plan for Strengthening America's Commitment to Justice is based on several core principles:

* **We can and must reduce the number of people incarcerated in this country while also reducing crime.** No one should be incarcerated for drug use alone. Instead, they should be diverted to drug courts and treatment. Reducing the number of incarcerated individuals will reduce federal spending on incarceration. These savings should be reinvested in the communities impacted by mass incarceration.
* **Our criminal justice system cannot be just unless we root out the racial, gender, and income-based disparities in the system.** Black mothers and fathers should feel confident that their children are safe walking the streets of America. And, when a police officer pins on that shield and walks out the door, the officer's family should know they'll come home at the end of the day. Additionally, women and children are uniquely impacted by the criminal justice system, and the system needs to address their unique needs.
* **Our criminal justice system must be focused on redemption and rehabilitation.** Making sure formerly incarcerated individuals have the opportunity to be productive members of our society is not only the right thing to do, it will also grow our economy.
* **No one should be profiteering off of our criminal justice system.**

Biden calls for the immediate passage of Congressman Bobby Scott's [SAFE Justice Act](https://bobbyscott.house.gov/SAFEJusticeAct), an evidence-based, comprehensive bill to reform our criminal justice system ""[from front-end sentencing reform to back-end release policies](https://bobbyscott.house.gov/SAFEJusticeAct)."" The Biden Plan will also go further. Biden will take bold action to reduce our prison population, create a more just society, and make our communities safer, by:

* Preventing crime and providing opportunities for all.
* Eliminating racial disparities and ensuring fair sentences.
* Offering second chances.
* Reducing violence in our communities and supporting survivors of violence.

Republicans took full advantage of this to substitute their imaginations for reality. Nobody is immune, but they're extreme. They actively value dishonesty like decent people value honesty. It's difficult to accept.

What pisses me off is the Democratic denial. Democrats are enablers to Republican abusers. It's so pervasive, even here on reddit. Any thread that touches on the idea of reforms is met by Democratic commenters making Republican arguments for them. They argue Republicans wouldn't like the changes, or they wouldn't go along with the changes. This is echoed at the federal level by Biden's repeated calls for unity and cooperation with Republicans. He is negotiating with fascists. They're going to use him. That's what they do.

Democrats are so worried about their imaginary self image they won't enforce the law. This has to change before anything else can change, because if prosecution has become persecution then rule of law is truly dead, and there exists no remaining moral reason not to take justice into our own hands. There's nobody to save the People but themselves. How many times must we despair at our history before we learn. Fascism must be fought head on. Fascism must be fought with honesty.",0,0,test
gef99ux,"That's stupid. I get your frustration..I feel it all the time. But I have to realize it's the same part of me that used to throw myself into the floor and scream in grocery stores. The emotions behind it are real. But ultimately, its the impulse to pout, and that's not a mature rational strategy (no matter how tempting it is)

Places do *not* generally get more democratic and more liberal after government implosion. It's the direct opposite - leftist revolutions intended to push things left sometimes leave a vacuum of power that's filled with authoritianism. 

There are ways to be critical.of the DNC without shooting federal representation  to fight conservatives in the face. One thing is to support primary challengers. The DNC maintains control partially though the purse strings and they penalize challengers. Making it clear that people without the DNC backing can still get funding and have political viability sends a powerful message. Engage in grassroots organizing. 

There's a psychological phenomena that's basically voter burn out.. when people get super emotionally invested and then theres no effect, it tends to lead to suppressed voting behaviors for multiple election cycles. Again, it's human. Everyone does it..but it's not rational. It's literally just our monkey brain getting pissed we never got our sweet dopamine and reminding us to file it away that elections don't feel good and therefore aren't worth our time. But we have to challenge monkey brain and.remind ourself that *most* challengers do take multiple attempts to get through. AOC got lucky by having a candidate who *really* fumbled the ball and having stronger connections to local longstanding grassroots organizers . And she's said that every progressive win makes it easier for the next win, and that for the movement to work they're going to spend a lot of time hitting walls. *That's* the truth. Sanders doesn't want people to stop voting democrats. Markey, AOC, omar, talib ....nobody experienced in dc who wants to take down the establishment Dems think letting republicans win makes that easier. Not one. 

We need to keep encouraging good candidates to run as challengers and fund them, and fund grassroots organizations which do not have to roll over to the DNC in order to get funding, and we need to do community based *real world* outreach. Social media is important for spreading the message and giving visibility to issues, but getting people to actually vote is still very much an irl activity.

gefh8ai,">When was centrism needed, and for what purpose?

Supposedly, ""centrism"" aka neo-liberalism aka free market Capitalism, was needed in developing countries because the market solution spurs great innovation, growth, efficiency and economic development. But even that is only half true, because a lot of that development was done through IMF loans which cannot be repaid, and many of the resources in Africa for example, are simply exploited and explored by 1st world countries/corporations which get the best part of that exchange. Pay low wages abroad, move the resources into your country. 

Some even say that pretending like Capitalism is good for these countries is a bit of a fallacy, because the quality of life enjoyed by 1st World western countries is inherently, to an extent, dependent on importing and exploiting those resources abroad. And that while that relationship keeps on existing, those countries won't truly develop and meet their real potential.

>Why have we progressed beyond that?

In modern first world countries, neo-liberalism is a zombie ideology. It's dead in the sense that it's irrational and unnecessary (and it will be replaced eventually), but it's well alive in the sense that rich people prop it up because it's in their interests to maintain it. It doesn't really exist to spur great innovation and economical development, it's more of a pretense for billionaires to have an excuse to exist. There is no reason why the wealthiest country on earth cannot afford universal healthcare, as an example. And many of the nordic countries have proven models to be followed - people live better, even with high taxation and such. The overcommodification of anything and everything is a US-centric capitalist tendency that is increasingly unnecessary on a world that is more and more dominated by AI and automation. We're slowly transitioning to a post-scarcity world, if you will. And in that world, the question is not about whether we have the resources, it's about how we distribute them.",0,0,train

""I've held off on writing this for fear of my emotions getting the best of me; Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the Presidential race. 

Anger, sadness, and outrage are but a few of the things I've felt since yesterday, and finding the words to express my disappointment has been difficult. Love or hate the man, I've found that while everyone can agree or disagree on many of his policies, few can argue against his character. Sanders' record of caring about the American people is indisputable - racism, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and many other issues that went against the norms for their time periods - voting for, or against, issues of civil rights before they became props for political theater - were his stock in trade. Bernie has always been on the right side of history. To find a man like that in politics, especially in today's political climate, is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's hope in a time when too many people have none. A lot of people were betting their all on that hope, myself included. 

My generation, the millennials, are categorized in a variety of ways by the media. We're patronizingly told about how the world works and what we should/could do to ""pick ourselves up by the bootstraps""; go to school, get a decent paying job, buy a house - strive for ""The American dream"", but that all went to shit. Having to try and explain inflation, or minimum wage, or cost of living to people pontificating about ""when I was your age"" is both frustrating, and disheartening. Trying to make an entire generation understand that today's world isn't the one in which they grew up, but now includes the culmination of all information at our fingertips with the internet; instant communication; data as an instantaneous public resource; a world more connected than at any time in history; but with expectations set in the faded realities of 10, 20, even 30 years ago, while politicians fight tooth and nail to keep it that way. We've learned, definitively, that the ""adults"" aren't always right. We've been fed false promises and told to accept a constantly moving target as a measure of our success, and new generations are being rapidly lost to that current. 

Millennials and Gen Z are the generations of the disillusioned, people unwilling to take things at face value anymore because the ""adults"" deal in bad faith; an education doesn't mean a well-paying job, it means crushing debt at the moment we're striking out on our own; medical care, when we can access it, adds to that debt and locks us into jobs that pay a fraction of what they did when our parents were our age; governments and corporations engage in open corruption designed to benefit from the suppression of wages - to have someone on ""our"" side, someone who spoke honestly and passionately, and acted consistently on behalf of the people whose most basic needs have been discounted as privilege - that was the message and hope Bernie Sanders gave to me.
We've watched since 2016 as the policies Bernie has pushed for years, slowly be adopted by the DNC. This pandemic has brought to light the lies we've been fed over our economy and who truly are our ""backbone"". Its not the corporations we bail out ever few years, or the politicians trying to keep the status quo. Its the people at the bottom supporting the whole structure. The times of ""meeting in the middle"" are gone. The reason nothing gets better is because for all the compromising the DNC does, none of it is with progressives. Its always with Republicans. Democrats act entitled to the progressive vote without actually giving progressives anything to vote for. The DNC is conservative, the GOP are insane, and the left has no representation. Change has to start somewhere with a voice and call to action. It started with Bernie, how the DNC responds will decide for me. 
They have to EARN my vote.""

Everything starts January 20th, 2021. Whether or not I will vote for a party that holds none of the values I stand for purely because it's the ""lesser"" of two evils.

So regardless of anything, I agree with this. I don't know it will really have the impact you are hoping for though (although it will help). 

I live in Oregon, we have arguably one of the easiest voting systems in the country. Assuming you are of age and a citizen we automatically register you if you get a state ID. If you don't get a state ID you can register online (this does require mailing in a signed form though). You can also update your registration online with no issues.

When it's time for an election every single registered voter is mailed a ballot 2-3 weeks prior to election day and is provided with a voters pamphlet with candidate info, ballot initiative info, etc. You fill it out at your leisure and then either mail it or drop it in a dropbox. The only caveat is it has to arrive by election day so at a certain point it's not safe to mail. 

Even with all that we have a hard time getting youth (18-29) participation above 40%. Now don't get me wrong, that's still way better than most of the country but we also have a high turnout most of the time (in the general election this year we hit 79% turn out which was actually a decrease from 2008,2012, and 2016). 

My point is that making it easier to vote does increase the youth turn out but it also increases everyone's turn out. The youth STILL vote at a lower rate than other demographics even if voting is super easy for them. 

As a semi-young person (early 30s) I think the best thing we could do is eliminate first past the post. 80% of the people I knew who didn't vote when I was still considered (youth) was because they didn't think their vote mattered. If we had STAR or RCV that would at least be a little better. I also think making the electoral college allocation be proportional to how the state votes is a better system.

No. You can't. One example of dozens if not hundreds: M4A has demonstrated widespread popularity in a number of polls whether it be primary exit polls, general election exit polls, or just garden variety public opinion polls. Roughly 70% of the voting American public including something like 49% of registered republicans support some version of M4A depending on the wording of the poll, and these numbers skew even higher when looking at registered democrats in isolation.

And yet, we can't even begin to have that discussion during the largest national health crisis in a century because the party has already negotiated itself down to a public option. This is after Sanders put together the largest small-donor war-chest and grassroots volunteer organization in American history. It bears repeating that this is after 250,000 of our fellow citizens have died and over 10M have been infected. If under such circumstances the party is not willing to seriously entertain the most comprehensive possible reform of a healthcare system which is obviously failing than it never will. 

People are correct to be completely burned out and feel as though both the party and the American government are failing them because they are.

Biden himself said he'd veto a successful M4A vote which has overwhelming bipartisan public support but is framed as progressive.

You don't purchase votes, and you don't get more votes simply because you have more money. And yet we measure a candidates success in money raised. This is because, both historically and currently, money lets you spread your message more widely and effectively, and your ability to raise it suggests something about your ability to attract support. But there are plenty of voters out there with no money to donate to candidates or causes at all, who still get a vote on election day (absent economic suppression, which is another issue) that are not represented by any fundraising numbers. And it's entirely possible for a large block of voters to have a party or candidate preference that is uninformed or unchanged by anything money can buy. If we take away any metric from fundraising, perhaps we should look at total numbers of individual donors, which, while still not a complete picture, is much higher for progressives than for any other ideological block.

On the subject of voting being unaffected by spending, perhaps a big part of the reason younger people don't vote is that the things fundraising money gets spent on simply don't reach us. I saw maybe four political ads total this year, mostly at my parent's house, because I don't watch TV at mine. Nor do I listen to radio, in the car or otherwise. If they try to reach me online, I run adblocker on my browser. I used a junk email to donate, because I don't want to be on any mailing lists. I don't answer phone numbers I don't know, so I've never gotten a phone bank call. I think I'm fairly typical of someone of my generation (younger millennial, a couple years off from Gen Z.) What good has all that money spent ever done to communicate to me and people like me?

Meanwhile, there are newer ways of reaching out to voters today that cost no money at all. Just look at the mileage Trump, and even AOC have gotten out of Twitter. And these days, AOC, joined by several other progressives, is breaking new ground with Twitch, and gaming, something no politician has ever even attempted before.

With M4A, workers' healthcare wouldn't be at the whim of the capitalist class, who largely make decisions in what they can skim off the top rather than what meets peoples' needs.

it's gonna select its representatives to the convention and to
the state party. And, as a matter of fact -- and that case was
decided in the early '80s, the Republican Party in Florida was
a minority party. So they said, Well, it might not make sense
to the party to have one republican/one vote as a matter of
committee representation, because we have to attract the votes
of democrats.
And so -- but that's for the party to decide. The
Court's not gonna get into that. Here, you have something far
more inchoate, your Honor, which is this purported -- this
claim that the party acted without evenhandedness and
impartiality. That -- even to define what constitutes
evenhandedness and impartiality really would already drag the
Court well into a political question and a question of how the
party runs its own affairs. 
The party could have favored a candidate. I'll put it

The ongoing polarization of politics in the USA is directly connected to the progress of racial equality. When white people were the only ones benefitting, programs such as land grants and other forms of welfare were less controversial. Even today, if you poll white approval of programs for the poor, their approval drops by double digits if pictures of black people are used to promote said programs.

As racial equality has slowly progressed, the fiction of bipartisanship has become farther and farther out of reach- the Democrats are by no means sufficiently progressive on this issue, but they are far more so than the GOP is, and that's why they will never agree on anything again. 

The two-party system has morphed into a two-*faction* system now, each with increasingly divergent values and goals for the nation. This was not always the case, however.

The association's move helped pave the way for Mylan Specialty, maker of EpiPens, to develop a near monopoly in school nurses' offices. Eleven states drafted laws requiring epinephrine auto-injectors. Nearly every other state recommended schools stock them after what the White House called the ""EpiPen Law"" in 2013 gave funding preference to those that did.

gefnrgy,"> She is engaged with her voters more than Joe ever has been.

Not sure where to begin but here we go:

1. AOC represents an insanely blue district. A district where Ds out number Rs by 6:1 (+29). She received 110,318 votes in 2018. She received 152,661 votes in 2020. Those are her voters.
2. Manchin represents the WHOLE state of WV. A very RED state. A state that voted +~40% for Trump in 2020. Manchin received 399,908 voters in 2012. He received 290,510 votes in 2018 (he won by less than 20K).
3. Just for fun, look at how well Capito in winning re-election in the Senate in WV. 
3. As for legislation, which actually matters, [here is AOC's history:](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/alexandria_ocasio_cortez/412804/report-card/2019)

- Got their bills out of committee the least often compared to New York Delegation (tied with 1 other)
Most bills and resolutions languish in committee without any action. Ocasio-Cortez introduced 0 bills in 2019 that got past committee and to the floor for consideration.
- Ocasio-Cortez introduced 0 bills that became law, including via incorporation into other measures, in 2019.
- Ocasio-Cortez held a leadership position on 0 committees and 0 subcommittees, as either a chair (majority party) or ranking member (minority party), at the end of the session.
- Ranked the 5th bottom/follower compared to New York Delegation
- Got the 6th fewest cosponsors on their bills compared to New York Delegation

-

She has less voters, she has done less, she represents a smaller and very blue district. Perhaps we should give the Senator some credit for being a D in a very RED State.",0,0,train

Do you know how rare it is for junior REPRESENTATIVES to have as much sway and power in legislating as AOC does? It is precisely because of how she manages her messaging that she has achieved this. Both her and Obama are atypical in that it usually takes multiple terms to have the seat at the table they earned.

geevtxx,"> No, it is a logical fallacy in all cases.

Whataboutism is a real rhetorical technique, specifically used to deflect criticism. Pointing it out is only fallacious if inaccurate. Whataboutism itself is fallacious, usually because it serves as either a non-sequiter, a straw man, or an ad hominem attack.z in this case, kind of all three.

> When someone says ""If you care so much about X, how come you support it when Y does it?"" they are pointing out an inconsistency in your argument.

They might (not in the case in question, but in some cases) be pointing out that you have a double standard. Or they might be drawing a false equivalency. Or they might be totally changing the subject. It depends on the context. In all cases, though, they are failing to engage your argument on its merits and changing the subject.

> They are saying that it's not ""X"" that you are concerned about, it's actually something else, and we need to refocus on that instead.

No, they're saying ""I don't wish to engage with your argument, so let's refocus on an unrelated point that I believes undermines your credibility.""

> In this case, ""You don't care about Twitter usage, this is about something else, let's instead debate that."" 

This example is very instructive, because it is explicitly not that. The people criticizing AOC about Twitter use also criticized Trump. So, this employment of whataboutism can't even rightly pretend to actually be concerned about how they treated Trump's use of Twitter. From that standpoint, they are being completely consistent.

> The purpose of the ""accusing others of whataboutism fallacy"" is to stop the conversation without talking about the ""something else"".

In this case especially, the ""something else"" is a full-on straw man. It's not usually so clearly a pile of horseshit as this, but the purpose is always to change the subject and/or attack the credibility of the person making the argument without discussing the merits of the argument itself. 

> In this case, the something else is what Twitter is being actually used for, not just the use of the medium, which could be good or bad. So if we say ""Hey you aren't upset when XYZ person uses Twitter"" 

Nobody in the entire Western world who doesn't work for Trump or Fox News has been cool with his use of Twitter. This is a non-sequiter, a strawman, and an ad hominem argument. The entire purpose of which was to avoid engaging with The criticism. Note: I am not bothering to stake out a position on the specific criticism, because the whatabout argument is stupid and wrong either way.

> that is to say, ""It's not Twitter usage that you are actually opposing, it's AOC's progressive policies, so let's debate that instead and not be dishonest""

That is an ad hominem attack, and does not engage the criticism. Questioning motives without engaging the argument is like Logical Fallacy 101. It's also just generally a bad faith argument.

geez2m7,"I think you have me mixed up with someone who gives a toss about what moderates and the establishment thinks, or that wants to preserve the status quo in any way.

Messaging is not the same thing as *action*. In order for meaningful police reform of any kind to occur, Republicans pretty much by definition are not going to be involved- meaning that winning elections is more than slightly important. ""Defund the Police"" doesn't *have* to be endorsed by a candidate in a competitive district for it to be used to paint them as an undesirable radical, and turn the low-information vote against them.

This is a question of power, first and foremost, and cementing power that is sympathetic to our cause means we need to care about the messaging being used. Normal people don't actually read up on basically anything- slogans and chants are about the sum total of their exposure to much of anything, especially leftist policies. This being the case, if the only thing random voters see is a slogan that, on the surface, appears to *strongly* clash with their values- well, that's how you ensure they will vote GOP in droves.

On the other hand, if the headline catchphrases being used are more cagey and intelligent- *even though the underlying policy goals are still to demolish the policing establishment entirely*, low-information voters won't be able to watch a 15-second news clip and come away with the wrong impression.

It's pretty weird that this point isn't glaringly obvious- the general public and status quo run on basically zero actual information about the state of the world, and their opposition is generally characterized by sound bites. In a sound-bite dominated media world- *use soundbites that don't energize Republican voters*.

""Defund the Police"" isn't a bad slogan because the cause itself is wrong- the police in their current form need to be essentially wiped away entirely. But explaining why requires far more time than a news outlet is willing to give anyone willing to explain it. Catchphrases that are less easy to mischaracterize make it easy to organize without energizing the opposition nearly as much.

Edit:

> The point of messaging is, first and foremost, to convey what you mean,

This is a simplistic and pretty naive view. Messaging is used for many things- unification, explanation, etc. Most importantly, messaging is how you communicate with people who are not on your side, or are entirely uninterested in the issue. Messaging is a *tool*, and should be treated as such. Word choice is important, and picking the right ones enables you to push back against being mischaracterized, helps with painting your opponents as uncharitably as possible, and can be used to control the conversation in a way that favors *you*, and not the other side.

The right knows this very well, and dozens of books have been written on the rhetorical power of fascism and adjacent ideologies. The left in the USA has abdicated it's responsibility to weaponize rhetoric in the appropriate manner and divide, deplatform, and characterize our opposition in the worst possible light.

Words are the most powerful weapon you can use, when used properly. I desperately hope more people on the left become more skilled with their rhetorical ability, and more tactical in their usage of messaging to control the conversation, because at the present time, the right *utterly dominates* the national discourse when discussing policing.",0,0,train

gefdsra,"> That go for both sides?

Not at all. Fox News was explicitly created as a Republican propaganda machine by Roger Ailes and Rupert Murdoch in order to prevent another Nixon situation where a Republican president might actually be held accountable by a public disapproving of their corruption.

CNN and MSNBC were not at all created in this way. They obviously favor the Democratic Party in as much as real news programs need to support basic facts of reality to an extent and of the two major parties the Democrats are the only ones that are willing to bandy with reality, but the chief concerns of CNN and MSNBC are profits. They prefer sensationalism because that's what gets people watching and seeing commercials. That means more ""breaking news"" segments making mountains out of molehills, and it means more ""debate"" segments where instead of just presenting facts as-is they'll have a ""panel"" to ""discuss"" issues, usually with one or two presenting facts, a few paid right-wing representatives giving ""alternative interpretations"", and a ""centrist"" trying to find a ""middle ground"" between objective reality and the concocted nonsense in the name of ""fairness"".

There's a massive false dichotomy at work as well - just because Fox is far-right propaganda doesn't mean there's any equal opposite for the left, as much as they'll insist on calling CNN ""socialist"", they're anything but.

Another disagreement is that much of your argument assumes that the Democratic Party is inherently progressive, but just cagey about it, rather than beholden to the same entrenched interests which want to maintain the status quo, but sporadically shamed into progress by popular malcontent.

Like with the civil rights movement, strident protest is an essential component of that progress, and if protesters lead with focus tested, compromised demands, they're guaranteed to get less than what they're asking for.

Third, any attempt to depower the police will be detected and magnified by Right Wing media no matter what label you hide it under. Fox News has managed to turn conservative policy like the ACA and carbon taxes into civilizational threats worth shutting governments down over. What makes you think they would be stumped by ""rebuild"" or ""fix"" the police? They'll see right through it, and then tell their audience that Antifa and MS-13 (remember when that was a thing?) are coming for their daughters.

IF the Democratic Party actually wants to reduce the power of police, then it should, well ahead of elections, explain to voters why this policy is reasonable and desirable, instead of trying to pull a fast one on them.

The Right does this all the time, no matter how awful their policies are, which is why, for example, Republicans spent decades getting their base invested into controlling the SCOTUS to defeat Roe v. Wade, while Democrat voters still lived in a fantasy world where justices are apolitical, impartial technicians above it all.

3. Address gerrymandering and voter suppression tactics.
4. Dilute/diminish/eliminate the influence of money on government and elections. This means working on regulating lobbying and campaign finance.
5. We need to bring down the barriers to public service so that average citizens can run for office. The barriers are likely related to financial risk and create a perverse system where government is run almost entirely by wealthy people and old people.
6. Bolster public education. Every person in the country has the job of citizen, which requires education in order to make informed decisions. This education goes beyond what is necessary for an individual to get a job and therefore it must be publicly funded and have some minimum public direction.
7. Address the influence of money on the information ecosystem. This includes social media and journalism. We must find a way to reduce the impact of advertising, billionaire ownership, and profit motives on these. We need to find a way to increase options and reduce consolidation in these areas. Also methods for dealing with shills, impersonators, and bots need to be looked into.

I agree. I think it is important to keep in mind that we are the bosses. Many of us probably have/had bad bosses before. One kind of bad bosses are the ones who demand us to get results beyond our power, like a restaurant manager demands a cashier to increase the sales. (EDIT: although POTUS is more like CEO of a company, the company still has a board of directors who are the CEO's bosses. The dynamic is similar.) Things are even more complicated when there are far more bosses than servants. Our servants not only may have insufficient power, they may also have bosses with opposite demands. To make things worse, our servants may have coworkers who obstruct or sabotage their works. 

Part of being good bosses is to recognize these limitations and reward our servants accordingly. There are relatively few good bosses, but we should learn to be ones because our democracy depends on it.

I believe that if Democratic Party has full control, they tend to deliver big. It doesn't matter whether the democrats are progressive or moderate. What matter is there are enough of them to deny veto power from Republican Party. Here is an example at [state level](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2020/3/12/21172836/virginia-renewable-energy-100-percent-clean).

>There's a story to be told about the long process of organizing and policy development that went into this bill, the broad support from business groups, municipalities, and civic groups, and the tireless work by a few key legislators and advocacy organizations, but the top-line story of the bill is fairly simple: Virginians elected Democratic majorities.
>
>The Democrats in the Virginia legislature have wanted to take action on climate, guns, abortion, and health care for years. Now they have majorities and they are going for it, passing bills (including lots of other energy bills) at a dizzying rate.

If Lincoln had lived, he would likely have been able to manage the tension among the various factions of the Republican party while also pursuing a more cohesive Reconstruction strategy. Radical Republicans in Congress wouldn't have had to work so hard to pass civil rights legislation, and probably would have been able to get something like the Enforcement Acts passed earlier.

As it happened, Andrew Johnson was far too lenient on the former Confederate states, which allowed white supremacy to fester, to the point where President Grant had to deal with the problem by force. Then the Republican Party began to falter in its resolve, which led to the failure of Reconstruction in 1877. The withdrawal of federal troops meant civil rights legislation was no longer enforced, which allowed white supremacists to re-establish political control in their states- partly via terrorism and partly via technically-legal means.

Point being: prosecuting former Confederates definitely wouldn't have been sufficient, because white supremacism was totally ingrained in Southern culture.

I know I would feel a lot better knowing that I won't be crushed by student loans or lose healthcare access if I have a car accident or lose my job. And I know we will be back in the Paris climate accord by January 21st.

You can say whatever you want about Biden being less progressive than Sanders would have been. You're likely correct. Biden tends to move with the center of the Democratic party, while Sanders at it's far left edges or beyond as one would expect as he is an independent who caucuses with the Democratic party.

But to say that Biden eliminated all chance of progressive reform is not just wrong, it's silly.

It's also unhelpful. Progressives and other left groups have an important role to play in a Biden presidency. We are part of the Democratic party and are here to push him as far left as we can. It is going to take a lot of effort, and we won't ever be able to entirely stop holding them to their promises. The only way to ensure we get nothing is to give up and say the problem can't be fixed.

If you want to be part of the Bernie or Bust dead-enders, that's your call.

If he's recusing himself from cases then that certainly speaks to him having biases, but I do honestly believe at this point Biden is going to struggle filling the massive holes Trump has left open and building for 4 years and we are going to see some less than optimistic choices, but choices that I believe Biden is going to make that will work in the long term of reversing the damage Trump and the GOP have caused.

geff1a3,"Yes. My dad happened to write his thesis on this and he always talked about it, so here's how this works:

There's this thing called the Laffer Curve, which is a measure of the relation between taxation and government revenue. 

If the government doesn't tax anything the revenue is, of course, zero. If the government taxes 100% then people will either evade taxes or just not work at all. 

So what the government wants to do is just find the point at which people pay the most in taxes before they start to evade taxes or stop working. 

Now, what is happening to the really rich is that relative to the rest of the population they do not pay the same. While everyone else will be taxed at a rate nearing the maximum in the Laffer curve, the really rich have seemed to escape it. 

[The graph in this NYT article ](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/06/opinion/income-tax-rate-wealthy.html) is a great visualisation of what is happening. You see the curve go up nicely, as is expected, but then as we get to the top percentiles the curve, for some reason, not only flattens out but goes down substantially. That drop is what Biden is trying to tackle with his new tax plan. So the people who earn just over 400k will most likely see a slight increase in taxes but nothing really drastic, and the ultra rich will see their taxes go up massively because they're the ones sitting in that drop that shouldn't exist.",0,0,train

2. Elections are run by the states, not the Federal government. The President has no ability to affect elections in any way. The President does not declare winners or losers of elections, nor does the President call for elections.
3. The President cannot establish martial law at the Federal level.

The military cannot act as law enforcement nor can the military arrest citizens unless the citizen committed a crime against the military or on military soil (like a base).

Caesar didn't create the Roman Empire through some kind of genius master plan or even clever scheming, he basically accidentally fell into it as he desperately tried to avoid being held responsible for his crimes.

Trump is about to try for a coup, not as the end of a plan set in motion years ago, but because he doesn't have any other choice if he wants to stay out of prison. The fact that saving his own skin could cost massive loss of life and property for others doesn't matter to him, as long as he remains in power and not in prison he'll have accomplished his goals.

Luckily, there is a major difference between Trump and Caesar, which is that Caesar not only had political power, but massive military power in the form of multiple full legions and popular support from the people.

With our tests clear and in hand, (and our 3 year old with us) we could then be allowed to quarantine at our home instead of a resort. 

Trust me when I say, sailing here was not a pleasure cruise by any means.  Just think of confining yourself, your spouse/gf/bf to one of the smallest rooms in your place for two weeks. Now, that floor is always moving and rolling.  There is a white noise generator going 24/7.   You have a toddler to care for as well...and you can't leave the room.

We had one port we could stop at, we were allowed off the boat for about an hour to get COVID testing done, and then were escorted directly back and had to stay anchored in a bay waiting for our test results.  Then we had another few days at sea to get to St Lucia.

Just saying, please don't assume this was for fun or it was a care free trip where we ate caviar and drank champaign along the way. This really was highly stressful for us.  We left with a hurricane rolling up the gulf towards the US, had to deal with the US coast guard a couple of times along the way, ran out of motion sickness meds about halfway through our trip, had to constantly be on the look out for storms popping up out of nowhere, ships and other boats sailing without proper lighting, watch out for shipping that would run us over and not even realize they did so, and a 3 year old who got tired of being at sea within hours of setting out, and try not to get on each other's nerves (thankfully, that wasn't hard to do)",0,0,train

It's upsetting, and it's impossible to discuss.

And now let's say there is an election going on between two drastically different candidates in this regard.  One supporting one opposed.

The pro-choice candidates supporters are extremely vocal and outright hostile.  And due to some forum post you made in the past that has been misconstrued, they are making threats to you.

The candidate themselves largely doesn't acknowledge this behavior, and wouldn't because they need that base to support them anyway.

Personally, I hope anyway, I would continue to support the candidate. Because an attack on me individually is absolute shit but the importance of pro-choice freedoms is critical.  The fact that some of the supporters are unbelievable idiots doesn't necessarily take away from whether or not women should have rights to their own bodies.

And how much leverage some of their arguments have over people. For example my relatives back home rely on SSI and Medicare to get by. And they absolutely know that the Republican party actively seeks to diminish or dismantle those programs, yet they still vote Republican down ballot every year. 

Why? Because they are evangelical Christians and firmly believe that democrats are history's biggest mass murders due to abortion, and are also socialist. They would never even consider voting for a democrat. Its just not an option to them.

This is just one example, but I've heard numerous ""single issues"" that keep people voting Republican despite not really liking Republicans.
