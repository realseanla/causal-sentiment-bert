But man the heartburn is constant this last week  and nothing is helping. I started Prilosec last night ( Gastro Dr said I could take it both morning and night for 14 days along with Pepcid complete for more immediate relief) hopefully that's all the long term effects I will have but who knows?  

No idea how I got it I fallow all the guild lines and everyone in my ""bubble"" who tested positive had to have gotten it from me based on the timeline. 

I guess even wearing a mask and washing my hands until they are raw didn't help me the one time. Maybe I rubbed my eye at the grocery store after touching something someone coughed on. 

I feel so guilty I got everyone sick. Some of them were pretty miserable and still are not recovering very well.

If there is anything I have learned, it is that it is a complete luck of the draw for us who try to do everything right. When I tested positive, I was so distraught. I thought I did everything right. The only thing I couldn't control was that I had to take my girls into childcare. When I tested positive I new it had to have been from my daughters. I felt so guilty. I kept thinking that it was my fault one or both of them got infected. I was so mad at myself for not fighting harder to keep them at home. But Everyone I knew still had their kids in daycare and schools are open where I live. I kept them home for months and it really hurt my job performance, as well as my husbands, so we decided to take them in. After I got sick, I kept thinking, what if there are long term effects, what if my girls can't have kids because of this. When I say my mind wandered while isolated, it WANDERED. Incidentally both of them have been perfectly fine and my husband tested negative. People have been calling to check up on me... people who made fun of me and called me ""bubble girl"". They were all so shocked that I got it. They were shocked because they have been way less cautious than me, going to restaurants and bars, having family and friends over for get togethers for months.

gfoh7b8,"Hey everyone. 

So about a week ago, I started getting a metal taste in my mouth that would come and go. Didn't think much of it except that it was annoying as heck. Otherwise felt fine! I have IBS-C and SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth). I've had weird symptoms on and off for a while due to SIBO, so I tied it to that. Fast forward to Tuesday of this week. I had a really bad itchy nose. The air in our apartment is DRY. Like bad. I'm also allergy sensitive so I figured it was allergies. Then last night I began noticing that my nose was becoming a bit more wet, but not drippy. I also felt my throat getting scratchy. Again, I figured this was allergies. Benadryl didn't do a thing. I can't take cold medicine as it always sends me into a flare, so I haven't taken that as of yet. 

This morning, I woke up with a 99.7 temperature. My throat was still irritated feeling and I noticed that my shoulders were extremely tight and sore. Like bricks. I felt energized, however. Today was a bad mental health day so I did some crying, and my nose was extremely runny from that, but then never recovered. It just stayed runny and stuffy, and now at 2:58 am I cannot breathe out of it at all. Nausea has kicked into high gear and I have zero appetite and feel my stomach hurting and grumbly. It's very uneasy, like I'm going to throw up or have diarrhea or both. Temp came down, but my body still feels hot. Other than the nausea, my nose is completely stuffed and my throat irritation comes and goes. We do have a window open because I'm hot. 

I've been tested for Covid 4 times in the past (for different reasons) and all times were negative. Testing is becoming very hard to get in my state (Oregon) due to high demand. Many places also require a virtual visit first. The soonest I can get anything anywhere is late on Tuesday. 

I'm curious if anyone believes this could be Covid or just a cold/allergies. The only way to be sure is get tested, so maybe I'll just sign up for something on Tuesday. To me this seems a bit more extreme for the allergy side. I genuinely feel a bit sick. I do have energy but tomorrow I'm sure I'll feel like shit as I can't sleep due to the nausea and inability to fuckin breathe. This sucks. I really did not want this before Christmas. My husband and I don't go anywhere and we do pickup or delivery for everything. I did get my haircut exactly 14 days ago, so there is that. I was desperate as my hair kept falling out and needed some serious TLC due to SIBO, but I understand this was a risk. Otherwise, we've been quarantining since this started.",3,-0.992,test

This morning I have diarrhea and am still dizzy but I know I'm just running on empty.

I have a test scheduled for tomorrow but I am so scared because I just started a new job and I've been unemployed since March. Idk how to communicate to my boss or what to do.

There was another strain of coronavirus going through the US in first few months of 2020 & late 2019. That was part of a much heavier strain  of the ""flu"" virus. Obviously SARS-CoV2 is also a coronavirus but it's has long standing deleterious effects & its biology is non well known (probably cause it's new). SARS-CoV2 is causing the COVID-19 pandemic, other strains of coronavirus are not the cause of COVID-19 pandemic. 

Very much possible that you got one of the lighter versions of coronavirus / flu infections in March & then later on got the actual COVID-19 infection after thanksgiving. Second wave of infection has widely been reported to be a lot more intense among majority patients. So in the case that if you don't have PCR proof that your infection in March was really COVID-19, I would safely guess what you got on Thanksgiving was your first infection. I would DEFINITELY take precaution to not get reinfected again. That's might turn out to be very risky.

If you're struggling with hydration make sure you get electrolytes/salts to go with the water you are drinking.

I've been recommending that to everyone I know who got covid, it doesn't get talked about a lot but having the right electrolyte balance can make a huge difference to how you feel and your body's ability to fight off a bug.

I had extemely mild symptoms...but I hoped online and did a bunch of research. I automatically assumed the worst. When I lost my taste/smell it made me panic even more, due to the fact some people never regain it. My mind automatically jumped to the worst conclusion. Fast forward a week, and I have 0 symptoms. My taste and smell are almost back to normal. Bottom line...don't panic and just focus on getting better. You'll be okay. Don't let your mind race to conclusions.

gfqhly0,"31 M here.  My wife and I both had it back in mid July through early August.  Of the two of us, I drew the short straw and managed to cross off just about every symptom on the list with concerning gusto.

She recovered a bit faster than I; my active case lasting for about a month.  I would say personally I felt I was on the road to recovery about one month after we were released from isolation.  However, we both had a remission on feeling better with the wildfire smoke (return of fatigue and symptoms similar to asthma).

Factoring in that extra time, I would say I was more or less recovered early to mid October.  I've been able to exercise from about that time.  Started off with short walks and eventually moved on to longer run/walks and resistance training.  I was even able to do some hunting/hiking in November, although it definitely took a lot more out of me than normal.

As for the heart rate issue, it's definitely worth asking your provider if it's a point of concern.  When I was actively sick, I know on some days my blood oxygen level dipped into the low 90% and just sitting could cause my heartrate to sit at the 80-90 bpm range.  Moving around could cause it to easily spike into the 110-120 range.

gfqc3q8,"I'm not a medical doctor, so I can't provide any feedback on the treatment itself. Just as a quick explanation of the treatment itself, though - the monoclonal antibody is kind of like the foam padding you might put on sharp corners around the house when you have toddlers. It blocks the tip of the spike protein that the virus uses to invade cells, reducing the percentage of virus particles that can successfully be replicated. Studies have found that early in the course of disease this is particularly helpful, as it slows the growth of the infection during its exponential expansion phase (where the virus can rapidly double and double again). Later in the course of disease, the symptoms are more often due to our own immune systems responding to the presence of the virus - here, the monoclonal antibody wouldn't yield much benefit, but it also wouldn't harm the patient. Because the antibody specifically binds to the viral spike protein, it's not going to cause any other issues.

I would talk to your doctor about their recommendation when you go in - it sounds like your father might have been fortunate enough to have a mild course of disease, but doctors will give feedback that's informed by population-level statistics (I.e. for other patients in his situation, with his co-morbidities, etc how did their disease progress and/or respond to this treatment).

I work a highly physical job where many days I'm the only one in my position, so yeah I was right there moving around heavy pallets all by myself while sniffling and coughing and in pain. When my positive test came back, I tried the whole ""bed rest"" thing, but again I lead a pretty active life coupled with my ADHD so I was up and about the whole time, even with the muscle aches I still gotta be up. This all made it really easy for me to bounce back and jump into working out.

I saw an article someone posted to a fitness sub about people who are active dropping dead from blood clots when they try to return to physical activity. I got scared and called my doctor, who said that due to how new this disease is, there isn't any long-term well-backed research. According to the CDC-approved data, there is nothing special about COVID that is triggering blood clots or anything else that is getting posted online, but having certain underlying conditions is what triggers it. Another trigger is staying in the same position for too long, which is why the average office worker has a higher chance of developing blood clots vs a school teacher who is on their feet moving around all day. So, being on bed rest can cause blood clot complications since you've stayed in the same position for a very long time.

Due to my medical history and the fact that I continued to be active while dealing with COVID, my doctor says I do not have any activity limitations and as long as I feel fine I should continue my journey to normalcy. She did mention that for the average person who gets sick and puts themselves on bed rest, they should practice great caution when returning to physical activity post COVID because the disease is so unpredictable at this point.

My favorite thing my doctor said during the call is is ""anytime you are presented an option to progress forward towards normalcy or move backwards towards regression, you should always choose to return to normalcy.""",5,0.9832000000000001,train

""This is a hypothesis, but it's also similar to the concept underlying live vaccinations,"" DeConde said. ""At low dosage and at a distant site of inoculation, the host can generate an immune response without severe infection.""

I've had COVID for almost two weeks. My symptoms have completely disappeared. My taste/smell are almost back to normal. 

My biggest word of advice? Don't panic. Focus on taking care of yourself and getting back to being healthy. Don't google your symptoms. You're more than likely gonna be okay...so don't stress yourself out too much. Don't overthink. Take it day by day. 

If it will make you feel any better, look up ""6 COVID types"" and you can figure out what type of COVID you have. Sounds like yours is very mild.

I'm on day 6 now and slowly starting to recover. I know it seems scary, but she's going to be okay.

Do you need to take it seriously? Absolutely. Do you need to fear she's going to drop dead tomorrow? No.

Just make sure she can do what she wants. If she wants to sleep, let her sleep. She's probably not going to want to eat. She must. Very bland things without a lot of texture worked better for me because of the inability to taste.

Yogurt and toast with peanut butter works fine. LOTS of liquids. Water, OJ, apple juice, that sort of thing.

It's unlikely she'll eat more than that. She's going to cough. It's okay too. Coughing is GOOD. It's how our bodies get rid of junk.

Fever, body aches - any of the symptoms she gets, the only two you need to watch: that her fever doesn't get dangerously high (mine went on for 4 days), but above all, that she can breathe.

Her breathing might rattle or squeak sometimes, and that's okay. If she can't get walk to the kitchen and get a glass of water, and then talk without gasping for air (it'll make her cough some too), then keep a closer eye on it.

If she can't take a deep breath, that's when you'll need some help.

But in the meantime, warm showers. Even boiling water with a towel over her head to capture steam will help - but not often. You don't want her to have pneumonia or wet lungs. Just get stuff loosened up.

She'll probably get a brutal migraine for a few days (especially if she's a coffee drinker). A couple of Tylenol are okay.

If she takes any meds regularly, make sure she still takes them - you might have to help with that because of sleeping a lot (if she gets hit hard enough like I did), she'll have no idea what time or day it is.

Most of all, just let her relax and rest, as stress free as possible. Don't panic until you need to panic because it doesn't help anything.

He's on day 15 and hasn't had a fever for 5 days in a row now and his cough has improved though he still coughs a little hard. His oxygen levels went back up to 98% and his heart rate was in the 8os all two weeks. Besides his regular meds, he took baby aspirin, vitamin C, vitamin D, Zinc, and for the past 3 yrs hes been eating a clove of garlic everyday and the juice of a lemon. He also drank pedialyte, water and powerade. I made him a tea concoction that had garlic, ginger,  lemon, honey , and cayenne pepper, he drank that every other day bc its quite potent but it helped him with his cough. He also did breathing exercises. He's still experiencing fatigued , he likes to exercise and today he tried to do push-ups and he got dizzy. He needs to take it easy. 
 It's good that your mom is coughing, she's exercising her lungs and getting rid of any mucus.

I was given steroids and a supplemental inhaler (advair) that helped a lot. He said he was seeing a lot of Covid patients developing breathing issues about two weeks in. 

I am a teacher and we are teaching online now. I went back to work half days last week. I'm afraid I'm heading toward long Covid because of the fatigue, weakness, and continued asthma complications. At least the pounding headaches are starting to fade.

There hadn't been any positive cases in their facility and we made a plan that once they did have a positive case we would try to figure out a way to keep them home. Well, my daughter came home with a clear runny nose one day. I thought it was just a small allergy thing. I used the nose Frieda on her. If you don't know what that is, look it up. Even though I thought it probably wasn't covid I still took a test to be sure. My first test came back negative (6 days after her coming home with the runny nose). The day I got my results back, I started feeling symptoms. I scheduled another test and started isolating. The second test came back positive. Besides that runny nose, she was completely fine. My other daughter was also completely fine. My husband has had 2 negative tests. So here is what I believe- children most of the time show little to know symptoms. I believe I got covid from my daughter who had to have picked it up at daycare. The facility believes they have no cases, but they obviously do. I also believe it is hard for kids to spread it to adults. My husband was around her and she sneezed directly in his face more than a few times (she's 18 months) and he is completely fine. I think the only reason I got it, is because I used that stupid nose Frieda on her, and basically sucked the virus directly into my lungs.

Other than the hives that varied in severity (very mild to extreme) over the next four days he only had a very minor runny nose and was possibly more tired than normal. He's had a few more episodes of the hives but the doctor said that was likely to happen for up to two weeks. 

We believe our 2 month old may have also been positive (she didn't get tested) as she was very congested when her dad first became sick. She was congested for a week but had no other symptoms (no fever or trouble breathing as long as we kept her nose clear). 

A friend's four-year-old just tested positive after coming into contact at daycare. He had a fever for one day but was fine otherwise. A week or so after testing positive he broke out into a rash. He's had the same rash (not hives) appear earlier this year (also virus related).",2,-0.4848,train

It's not like, say, a pregnancy test - you could get a false positive on those by being on certain medications or having cancer or something else that causes your body to produce the hormone the test is looking for.

But with Covid, the tests are looking for antibodies or the virus's RNA. There's no way to have either of those in your body for any other reason *but* a Covid infection.

Your grandmother almost certainly has Covid, I'm sorry to say - and unless they have been rigorously separating from each other, they probably both do.

HOWEVER, people should talk to their doctors about any and all supplements they think about taking!  Lots of things, even things that might seem benign can cause issues you do not foresee.

You, who interacted with them last Sunday, are told you're safe, but the person was infectious and didn't know it. Or they lied about when they started to feel sick. The outcome is the same. It sounds like they either found someone else he infected or evidence that he developed symptoms earlier than first reported. The school or his parents might have lied to the authorities. 

This is an extremely unusual virus in that the incubation period is so long and a large portion of the people who catch it never experience symptoms but they can spread it just as well as the sickest people can. We also shed the MOST virus in those 2-3 days before we develop symptoms. It's just weird.

gfjg5we,"I just have to say, so much of your story is spot on to my experience. You've actually articulated it better than I've been able to. I try to explain it to my spouse and loved ones but after 9 months of never ending symptoms, I barely voice it anymore.

 I believe I contracted Covid-19 in March and it's been such a crazy long journey and endless stream of symptoms. Dizziness, heart thumping, breathing issues, insomnia, fatigue, etc. To sum it up, I tell those who ask that I had one body that I knew and loved my whole life up until March but post getting sick, I just don't recognize it, I can't rely on it, and just doesn't feel quite right like it used to. 

2 things I wanted to highlight that have really affected me that I don't hear many people talk about; just in case anyone out there has had a similar experience. 

1) How the difficulty breathing, heart palpitations, and overall trouble that I feel in my chest (of varying degrees at different times) brings that anxiety and sense of dread with it. Am I having a heart attack? Is this spell of difficult breathing the beginning of the end? I need more air. If this worsens will I need the ER? A ventilator?! Will my chest and breathing be like this forever? After 6 months of this my nerves were absolutely shot. 10 months later I'm more used to the varying symptoms when they arise but still get anxious every once in a while when they come on stronger than ""usual"" for no apparent reason. Also, I just can't bring myself to care as much and spend that emotional energy anymore. I find myself thinking well if this gets really bad, what happens happens. All I can do is monitor it and act accordingly. Which is kind of a sad but necessary place to get to considering it's my life and health. Also, I've had MRI's, EKG, Chest Scan, and blood tests along the way. My doc and cardiologist said everything looked normal. 

2) I'm a fit 41 year old guy. I've missed working out badly this year. Since July I've tried to start working out again. I've tried and stopped 5/6 times. Cardio is tough. I'm in LA and the fires and air quality this year made cardio a tough proposition. I can go light but not enough to sweat or I'm gasping for air and experiencing chest issues for the next day. So I try to weight train. I have a little set up at home. I can go light over a couple of days but if I ever train enough to get good and sore, I'll start experiencing flu like symptoms and It'll put me out for 5 days. Not like the full blown flu. More like the day before where you think, ""am I getting sick?"" I weight train very light for 4 days and then increase weight/reps. As soon as I do, I get sore and it feels good until I wake up the next morning feeling terrible. I'll have to stop it all together for a week. 5 times in a row this has happened and it's driving me crazy.

Anyway, you're not alone in your experience. On one hand I recognize others have it worse off than me and many have even lost their lives. But I do mourn for my old body and the days of waking up feeling good and full of energy. I wish you all the best. Take care of yourself and here's to hoping our health only gets better from here.",2,-0.5734,train
gfkeayz,"Sounds like you and I share many of the same symptoms.  Doctors are beginning to suspect pots or a version of dysautonomia.  I'm currently seeing a cardiologist but we have yet to work up to a tilt table test.

Anyways, originally doctors thought I had an autoimmune issue as my body reacted to Covid in different ways.  First it was my heavy head, then it was postural blood pressure issues, then it was ear pressure and facial tightness, then major GI issues a month after this all started.

Don't stop telling people, I'm sure my family is sick of hearing about it, but there will be more coming with these symptoms and I hope we can figure out treatment or something to just keep it bearable.

I'm not old enough to try it, I can't tell you if it works, but otherwise everyone I've encountered (and myself) have been stick like this for weeks to months. It definitely sucks, and i lost a lot of weight at first, but there are some foods that fine. We'll have to learn to compromise if we want to live.

Avoid mint, meat, fish, coffee, rice, and fried stuff at all costs- those are the worst offenders to most people. I can eat fried stuff just fine, so you can try it to have more stuff to, but to a lot of people it's bad. 

Things like grapes, apples, and oranges taste the same to me, as well as a lot of cheese-based things. Milk is probably fine, too. 

Marshmallows and chocolate are good to most people too, though don't be too sure of chocolate- it started tasting horrid after a bit too.

People are saying to switch to smoothies, so that you can get nutrients- but any drink that isn't pure water or milk tastes like petrol so I'd rather not. I started taking a multivitamin instead.

Living like this this sucks- and people will not understand because I guess it's impossible to process that everything doesn't just smell *wrong* but also *rancid* and vomit-inducing without having experienced it.

It's a relatively new thing, so maybe in a few months, we'll all suddenly get better, or research will figure out how to help us.

Worst case scenario, start eating with you nose plugged. I know it sucks, but again-

This is the biggest factor.  For instance, here in Minnesota, something like 70,000 people in their twenties have been diagnosed (and probably another 70,000 were totally asymptomatic and never get a test) and there have been eight deaths.

3. Genetic stuff that they're only starting to untangle and that is not visible from the ""surface"" - ie, a doctor can't just examine someone and say ""because you have \[this condition\] you must also have \[this genetic situation\]""
4. Presumably other things like initial viral load, blood type (type O appears to have some weak protective effect but this gets overstated)

You are still recovering though, even though you are past 10 days. People often have another flare-up of symptoms around 10 to 12 days. But she cannot infect you or make you sicker.

Like you, I don't know how I contracted it.  I went the other way, though.  I live in a pretty restrictive state where the kind of rule following you mention is near universal.  It hasn't stopped or deterred transmission.

gfgrse5,"The best advice I can give you is to take care of yourself. This virus sucks. No one can deny that. Take zinc, vitamin D, and vitamin C, and a multivitamin if you aren't already. Drinks lots of water and hot beverages. Make sure you get up and move around a little bit each day. I have been told to make sure you take deep breaths a couple of times a day. Supposedly it helps prevent pneumonia. If you are having trouble breathing, lay on your stomach in the ""prone"" position.

For the loss of smell, I did an essential oil thing my sister called ""smell training"". It sounds hokey but I have most of my smell back. Pick two or three things (or essential oils) that you know the smell of really well. A couple of times a day, deeply inhale that scent and think about what it smells like for like 10 seconds. I did this with lavender, rose, and eucalyptus essential oils. I got my smell and taste back in three days. Again, it might be hokey but it worked for me and my sister.

Trace back from your earliest memories of her, and write about all the good times and special moments you shared together. Fill her in on some secrets that she might not have known about! 


Tell her about your plans for the future. She probably like to hear about them. 


Tell her how much she meant to you. How much of a difference she made in your life. 


Tell her that you wouldn't be the person you are today without her, and that you'll give your best damn shot at leading a good life. 


Tell her, ""Thank you.""

I tasted something from each of the the five different taste modalities to see how my tongue reacted and I was really surprised to discover that in spite of not being able to taste or smell any flavors, I was able to easily recognize each of the 5 basic tastes.    
    
* Saltiness: Salt
* Bitterness: Lemon Peel
* Sweetness: Sugar
* Sourness:  Lime Juice
* Savoriness (Umami): Worcestershire Sauce
    
In each case, the modality showed up loud and clear, even though I can't taste any flavors at all.  I'm pretty sure I would be able to identify all five in a blind tasting.  I believe that the strange tastes I have in my mouth are usually the basis of one of those five. I ate some of my wife's delicious Italian soup and although I could not taste any of the flavors, I was bombarded with a salty impression.

I am a long hauler and posted in this sub back in March. I posted a very long fever fuelled dairy that's pretty funny actually. And I included a list at the end of everything that helped me through the rough patches.

Keep up with vitamin D,C zinc, possibly niacin (long haulers are working on this at the moment) 
Quercetin Omega 3 CoQ10 81Mg low dose aspirin. 

Consider coconut water as hydration and electrolyte replacement 

Drink lots of fluids. Replace whatever fluid leaves your body right away. 

Rest. It will come in waves. As in you may feel like you are over it and it will wrecking ball right back again. Rest rest rest. No gym no runs no window washing. 

When a surge comes over with brutal SOB, chill. Just stay as calm as possible. Those panic hormones will exacerbate the SOB.  Ride the wave out calmly. Use meditation. 

If SOB is really had there are techniques. A whole bunch of them. (I posted in the sub March about them all)

Eat. Covid says otherwise but f that. Cells need repairing and food equals the building blocks. 

There are lots of other suggestions but this will get you a wee jump start.

This is Pfizer's plan. Moderna wants to keep the blinding and reverse the vaccines, so everyone will have received both the vaccine and placebo but will not know in what order. This reduces the impact of participants' own behavior influencing infection rates.

gfdh15c,"Yes. Browse/search this forum: lots of anecdotal reports of reinfections are coming in these days. Mostly after 5+ months but some earlier. Couple of days ago someone posted a huge list of links to more official reports of reinfections in a comment on one of those reinfection posts. 

Starts to look increasingly similar to other (common cold) human coronaviruses: reinfections with those are rather rare within the first half year but quite common after 1-3 years. Coronaviruses do not nearly mutate as avidly as influenza viruses, but they appear to have other tricks to pull this off.

(Note: most colds are actually caused by a large variety (hundreds) of different viruses, such as rhinoviruses; but about 10-15% are caused by one of the four different common cold human coronaviruses, and at least some of those are well-known to make repeated annoying visits in people's lives.)

Depending on whether reinfections can still lead to the life-threatening severe form of the disease, and whether the R0 remains high or not, this may or may not be a problem, and may or may not mean we'll need to get re-vaccinated every year, or will need better vaccines, or both. 

Time will tell. In the meantime, all you can do is try to get lots of sleep and get well.",4,0.6691,train

gfeva9d,"One issue with this, many of those anecdotal reports need to be taken with a grain of salt. 

Cold and flu season lasts all the way through April/May in many areas. With a lack of testing capability in March - May 2020 and beyond, many people were treated as presumptive positive without a confirmed test.

Because the symptoms of COVID are similar to literally hundreds of other infections, it is entirely possible that they had a different viral infection and were still told to quarantine - as there just isn't a lot that can be done to test specifically or treat them.

Without confirmed testing, it is impossible to say with certainty that any significant portion of them are true cases of confirmed reinfections.

Currently there are only a few hundred confirmed reinfections, at most, worldwide.",1,0.7906000000000001,train
gfgr2ys,"Well, before the winter wave took off, I presumed the same, based on similar arguments, but unfortunately, it just doesn't seem to be true. 

The emerging anecdotal reports I was referring to by now include plenty of *twice* PCR test-confirmed cases, with full recovery and PCR-negative in between. 

Moreover the winter wave is rapidly accumulating new hard data supporting these anecdotal reports. 

For example. Sweden reported mid-November that 150 people who had had PCR-confirmed COVID in the first wave (and recovered), caught it *again* in the second wave. That may not seem much, but actually, statistically, it is quite a lot, for the following reason. Sweden had about 70K confirmed cases in their first wave (~ March 1 until July 1), i.e. 0.7% of the population. They had about 100K confirmed cases in the second wave starting ~ Oct 1 at the time of that report (~ Nov 15). Let us assume first for simplicity that the probability of exposure in the second wave is approximately uncorrelated with having caught covid in the first wave. Then, *if* there was *no* post-infection immunity whatsoever left after 3 months, you'd expect 0.7% of those 100K second-wave cases until then, i.e. 700 cases, to consist of PCR-confirmed reinfections. The actual number, 150, was about 5 times less than that, suggesting a risk reduction by a factor of 5, on a time scale of about half a year. Or, in the vaccine lingo used these days: a protection efficacy of 80%, quite in line with phase 3 vaccine trial data so far (which,  keep in mind, have been running for a considerably shorter amount of time than half a year). 

Now, you could argue that those who got COVID in the first wave probably had a considerably higher exposure probability, including during the second wave, than the general population (eg due to the kind of work they are doing). Let's say 2 to 4 times higher. Then the above naive risk reduction estimate would get corrected from a factor 5 to a factor of 10 to 20, ie 90-95% protection efficacy, on a time scale of about half a year. That is as good as the Pfizer/Moderna vaccine performed on a time scale of 3 months. Indeed this would be fully in line with expectations: protection offered by vaccines is rarely stronger (on average) than protection offered by getting (and recovering from) the disease itself. 

So, for sure, what this data (and vaccine trial data) suggests, is that getting COVID once offers significant protection for at least half a year, something like 80%-95%. But, evidently, it is not at all like, say, measles, which after getting it once provides ~100% protection for the rest of your life. 

As for protection on longer time scales, like a year or two, either by vaccines or  infection: well, we'll know when that amount of time has passed. 

My guess is that COVID is here to stay, but that vaccinations (and maybe mutations) will degrade it over the next year or so to something of no more concern, overall, than the seasonal flu, or perhaps even the common cold. But my guess is as good as yours. 

It is what it is. We don't get to choose reality. More data will bring more clarity, and more time will bring more data.",2,0.8952,train

For mild cases (which yours seems to be) the guidance I have seen is that you should be quarantines for at least 10-14 days from the days symptoms were first observed.

&#x200B;

The US CDC suggests that you can be with others after ALL of the follows are true:

* At least 10 days since symptoms first appeared **and**
* At least 24 hours with no fever without fever-reducing medication **and**
* Other symptoms of COVID-19 are improving. ==> Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months after recovery and need not delay the end of isolation  <==

Other countries (which all have lower case counts) suggest longer isolation periods, such as 14 for Canada (last time I checked).",3,-0.5481,train

Some tips:
- A blood oxygen meter helps a ton especially if you're anxious about breathing issues.
- If you live with others, keep your physical distance and wear masks. If you have a separate bathroom use it. Quarantine yourself in a spare room in the meantime.
- I kept a log of my symptoms for my quarantine period and a list of medicines and other things that helped me feel better (i.e. walking around the backyard in the sun, meditating, etc..)

gfecr55,"We must be few and far between, haven't met another super smeller in the wild yet. I say I have the nose of a bloodhound because I can smell things others can't and some scents are so pungent to me it almost causes an allergic asthma response. So when I had my coffee yesterday (I add milk, honey, and salt cause I'm weird does make perfect salty sweet though) and all I tasted was slightly bitter water I knew something was up.

Rewind to last Thursday/Friday I started experiencing extreme body/muscle fatigue where the more I moved the more tired my muscles got and would lock down but there was no pain. It continued into the weekend and come Sunday afternoon had the husband take me to urgent care. There is an outbreak of covid at my work right now, at least 10 people have popped positive in the last week, so urgent care gave me covid test and sent me on my way with a letter excusing me from work while waiting for results. Test came back Tuesday night I was negative, I'm still experiencing the fatigue and have had some slight congestion but I have a bad dust allergy thought it was due to that. Went back to work Wednesday and then yesterday noticed the change in taste and smell.

I can taste bitter and sour but no salty or sweet. I can smell some things like my husband's deodorant which typically would be way to strong for me and I can't stand it. Haven't completely lost taste and smell but greatly diminished. I informed the nurse on staff at work and she said with my other symptoms wasn't warrant enough for me to get tested again. Well I messaged my Dr about the change and she immediately had me go get tested again that was yesterday afternoon. Waiting for 2nd test results. Just ate an apple and it tasted like sour water. If it isn't covid it still sucks ass.

Apologies for the long reply it's been aggravating not knowing what's going on but now finding others that also have changed smell and taste makes me feel more like I do have covid. I hope you all get well and nothing serious comes from this.",2,0.8422000000000001,test

The good news is we know a LOT more about the virus now than we did in march. Everyone who is sick should do the following to give yourself the best chance of fighting this:

- Absolutely no caffeine, alcohol, or any other drugs that can affect the heart/blood pressure, or your blood vessel dilation, for up to a month after your symptoms are gone. Big correlations between all the above and much worse symptoms, much longer recoveries, and post-recovery blood clotting. If you're like me and a heavy coffee drinker, switching to something like green tea can work well to stave off withdrawls without adding too much caffeine to your system.

- Suppliment zinc, vitamin C, vitamin D daily at normal amounts.

- 1G of Lysine an hour before breakfast, 1G of lysine a 3PM, ideally on an empty stomach both times to help with absorbption. Recent studies have linked Lysine to much faster, less serious recoveries.

The hysteria over reinfection needs to stop. It is incredibly rare, and it is too soon to even tell. If your infections were less than 6 months apart, it is most likely NOT a reinfection. Even if you received a negative test in between. People can shed viral DNA/RNA for months, but it is not active virus.

gf9bgpi,"I understand why people would say that it still is rare, despite the increasing number of stories.  Here's why I think these are just the tip of the iceberg:

1.  Of the tens of millions of people who have caught it, the opportunity for reinfection is necessarily still low:  they need to have had it in the  first (spring) wave -- had enough time to recover -- and then still been in a location for the second (fall/winter) wave where there was opportunity to catch it.  This knocks out many of the Asian countries that got the virus under control (no opportunity for reinfection).  In the US, many of the hard-hit blue states from the first wave also lowered their numbers, so people there had less of an opportunity to catch it again (though that will change through the winter).  It also knocks out the millions of first-time covid patients who caught it during the second wave.  For those people, not enough time has passed to have an opportunity for reinfection.   So *the population of people who could have already been re-infected is really a much smaller number than the full population of people who have ever caught covid.*

2.  The stories of spouses who have gotten reinfected (I think about me and my husband as an example):  these are genetically unrelated individuals both getting reinfected at the same time.  Yes, there are environmental similarities, but I think cases like these strongly suggest that we're not looking at ""certain pre-disposed individuals"" who may get reinfected.  I think it suggests a general human response to coronaviruses, when given the opportunity for reinfection after a period of time.

3.  The tens of millions of cases of coronavirus around the world include a large number of mild or asymptomatic cases who were tested due to contact tracing or for other, non-symptomatic reasons.  If those individuals were infected again and were mild or asymptomatic, they would not be getting a test to find out.  (It also raises the possibility that people who were asymptomatic back in the spring but who have symptomatic covid now are actually reinfected rather than first-timers).  

4.  Finally, these are only the stories that I, as one person, have been keeping track of over the past couple of months from Reddit.  I'm not doing a thorough search.  It also doesn't include all the anecdotal cases of reinfection that people are sharing in comments or on personal experience posts.   Moreover, these news stories only reflect cases that specifically got to the press.  It reminds me of early in the pandemic when we were told it was ""exceedingly rare"" to catch SARS-COV-2 in a western country... well, that's only because we weren't testing.  When you start testing (or looking around for something), you may find it's a lot more common.  These, I think, are just the tip of the iceberg, and for every case of reinfection that is being reported, there must be an immense number of them that are not..",4,0.9336000000000001,train

They all come and go and the fatigue only usually hits me after work and it goes away if I nap but yesterday I didn't have to. I didn't really have or notice any fatigue up until that point but I was bajscally resting for 2 weeks and felt fine and went to work so maybe it could be my body re adjusting 

And im just over hit week 3 since my symptoms started. I absolutely terrified that I'll be a long hauler :/ I know there are lots of people who have recovery symptoms for a few months and get better but we don't really see those kind of posts on reddit.",2,-0.9813000000000001,train

And thats alittle odd they don't give her an xray to see if she has pnuemonia or something like that?

Part of me wants to just go an get checked but my doctor told me to only go if my symptoms get worse as she didn't think I have if based on what I told her.

Do you have sense of smell? Taste? 

And all of those things are completely understandable. We've all been trying out best to not catch this virus. Every symptom has gone thru our radar as possible covid and finally getting it can be so overwhelming. The goal I think from the outside looking in is trying your best to stay positive. Know your body is strong enough and is made it beat this. You are young and have that at your advantage. It's just really important to focus on drinking plenty of fluids, no junk food just yet, eat every meal, breathing exercises!! And as time goes on we'll see what else we can learn. 

I hope your anxiety gets better. I know you got this. I personally had to do meditation everyday for a month. And as someone who had been feeling like maybe I was in psychosis I'm finally okay. Also cutting caffeine and sugar out of my diet. Cutting a lot of toxic people. Leaving my job. Read read read read.

It started coming back last week and it's slowly improved. It seems most people report their smell and taste are one of the last things to lose and it means your recovering but my gf and I lost it pretty early on and my dad never did.

Its also usually means you have a milder form of it as they found alot of people who were never lost their smell and taste generally had worse outcomes but its not  clear cut case either way of course. 

And yeah I've been seeing my therapist once am otnh via video call and it's been helping but I haven't talked to her since just before I got covid so I should probably book an appointment with her.

She's probably gonna hwy mad at me for being on health forums and what not about covid because it definitely isn't good for me haha.

I would say just make sure you keep up with your oxygen reader and continue to monitor your symptoms. 

Her taste also left a couple days in and her smell has not returned. She can taste tho some stuff. And yay hopefully it just takes time and we're on the mild case side. Also side note we're a seven person family. And only she caught it somehow. We know where she got it but not sure how no one else thankfully didn't get it.

Apprently your the most contagious two days before your symptoms show but how are you supposed to know when that is? My younger brother and his gf were fine because they were at her place and if only we stayed at my girlfriends parents place before but who knows I could have been the one that got it.

But based on symptoms is was likely my mom as her only symptom was lost of taste and smell for two days (started the day I got sick and my dad was sick a day before I was but he didn't tell me as he ""only had a sore throat"" but yeah I cant be mad because life happens.


and thanks I will  update you but it seems my chest pain didnt really happen today which is  a good sign i take it but the fatigue muscle pain and headache were pretty bad it felt flu like almost.

gfavcm9,"Taking a baby aspirin daily will reduce your risk of clots - this is clotting prophylaxis that many hospitals use.  If you don't have baby aspirin, a couple of days of regular aspirin (or a half regular aspirin, you can split them) until you can get some won't hurt.  You don't want to take aspirin every day forever as it raises bleeding risk, but for the next couple of months until you're really out of the woods with covid it will help.

This is unproven and just my spec, but blood clots come from endothelial dysfunction, so things that support endothelial function may help at the margins - green or black tea every day (decaf if caffeine gives you trouble) and vitamin D, for instance. If you google around for ""endothelial support"", you can find some respectable recommendations from real medical sources.  These aren't magic but they have been shown to reduce stroke risk.

Strokes and cardiac arrest in young people are still very rare. It's a possibility and it is scary, but very, very few young people die of covid. A relative of mine had a pulmonary embolism after a mild case \*but is all right now\*.

I have a panic disorder and for my body, it was like my body would trick itself into having attacks. 

I started taking baby aspirin and a ton of vitamins as well to help with the anxiety. I bought a pulse ox; only once did it dip below 90% and that was because I was panicking in a dr's office. The Dr literally rechecked like two minutes later and i was back at 96%. The anxiety truly has been the worst thing for me bc of the unpredictablity and possibilities of what could happen.

I ended up buying the olly brand vitamin gummies for stress. They seem to help me in the morning when I take them. I also try to stick to B, C, & D. Zinc has been harder to find in my area but I use lozanges to help as well.

Sixty thousand people in their thirties have had COVID and there have been 27 deaths. In fact, given that at least half of the cases are probably still going undiagnosed (asymptomatic, minor symptoms that resolve quickly so people assume it was a cold, difficulty accessing tests, etc), it's probably more like 140,000 people in their twenties have had COVID, etc. 

Each of those is one death too many and if we'd handled this like Australia, Vietnam or Canada we'd have cut those numbers way down.  But from a personal risk standpoint, your risk of death is low, especially since you're past the crisis point.

IIRC, the majority of young people who have strokes or heart attacks from covid are young-for-covid, so they're in their mid thirties or forties - people who would not normally be having strokes or heart attacks, but not pop-culture-young.

Fluids! Pedialyte has helped me so much. Mucinex, emergen-c, lots of water. 
Focus on minimizing the mucus build up use all the healthy remedies you know.
I want to say moving around is really good too but once you're really sick it becomes a struggle to get up. They don't need to stay active but don't let them rot on a bed or sofa. I found getting up when I feel my worst helps me feel in control!
Monitor closely their symptoms, blood oxygen level etc. 
I do recommend keeping a distance. It spreads super fast and is unpleasant. If you want to really take care of your parents keep yourself healthy while you still are.

It was incredibly frustrating to hear my boyfriend admit that he didn't wear one this one time, because no one else did.

His meeting did however last more than an hour, and they were in a smaller space with no social distancing. (Multiple dings.....the unfortunate part is this is a local law enforcement agency.....like c'mon guys. Take it seriously!)

Wednesday: Quarantined. More cough. Chills every so often. His spirits were high. Just normal sickness.

Covid probable here: everybody in the house (stepdad,mom,me) exhibiting symptoms, on 12/1/20 my step-dad went to his parents who both tested positive for Covid.

 12/8 Starting Tuesday night and Wednesday I got the slightest little pricking sensation in the back of my throat which would warrant a cough every so often but was also just more of an annoyance. This was accompanied by chills. I was also drowsy dating back to Thursday/Friday of last week. 

 Last night however I began to get a sensation around my sternum that has remained there since. No coughing or anything but it is borderline painful, not by much though. My chest feels tighter and the feeling has persisted. The only reasons why I would think heartburn however are because I consumed a heavy amount of CheezIts. Those things aren't a joke.

People can be very infectious prior to symptom onset, it is possible that someone with a long incubation period could infect someone else, who then has a much shorter incubation period and displays symptoms before the infector. The time period between the infector developing symptoms and the infectee developing symptoms is called the serial interval. In the above example the serial interval would actually be negative. There are studies that show this may occur in 10% of transmissions. So it is still much more likely for the infector to develop symptoms first.",4,-0.25,train

One, I drink about twice the recommended amount of water per day for my body weight and I keep my salt intake up.  This seems to reduce the symptoms almost entirely on most days.

Two, I found one medical journal discussing solutions for Orthostatic Hypotension (low blood pressure on standing that causes people to faint), and one method sounded goofy but actually works quite well for me.  Any time I stand up and my heart starts racing and I get light-headed, I tighten my butt cheeks, thighs, and calves.  The theory is that this pushes blood up towards the heart and brain and prevents the drop in blood pressure.  It seems to get my heart rate to return to normal after I do it as well.

The other thing is that I'm fairly active, I don't own a car and travel by bike, and have a day job as a bike messenger.  I've found that consistent moderate exercise helps, but overdoing it makes things worse.",3,0.6284000000000001,train

gf5n6p3,"POTS does make me FEEL short of breath but as far as i've noticed, it doesn't really lower my o2. I cant really tell if it's just packaged in with tachycardia of course, being tachy just makes me breathe harder, but I certainly feel short of breath with POTS and do when exercising. 

Honestly, if you're walking around with a 120 hr it doesn't sound unlike POTS and since they've ruled out other conditions with all the testing, I think I'd call your cardiologist and specifically ask about POTS and a tilt table test. Beta blockers is already my medication personally but there are some other meds they do offer if this isn't doing enough for you. 

1. You absolutely must stay hydrated. People with POTS need to be drinking around 3 liters of water a day, it's a lot, but it helps the most in symptom management. In my worst tachycardia episodes, I just lay and sip water until it improves. NEVER LET YOURSELF be dehydrated. That's gonna be one of the worst things you can do. 

2. Salt, but talk to your doctor about this first. People with high blood pressure shouldn't be adding salt to their diet but if you have POTS with low BP, we also add a lot of sodium to our diet because the sodium + water increases blood volume and the more blood volume, the better your symptoms will be. Again, talk to your doctor first, make sure there isn't anything in your medical history that should prevent you from doing this and specifically mention the POTS because any cardiologist familiar with POTS will be able to give you a plan for your sodium intake. My cardiologist actually wanted to set me up with a dietician just to figure out how to make my diet more salty LOL so they help with this too. 

3. STAY COOL I can't stress enough that besides being dehydrated, heat is the thing that makes POTS worse and you may even notice you get hot way quicker than you used to especially with exercise. Even in the dead of winter, I work out with my AC blasting. When I leave my house, I bring ice packs. If youre having a tachy episode, grab an ice pack and sit with it. Don't take hot showers, I know, that sucks but a cooler shower will leave you feeling better afterward. Just generally stay cool and cool yourself down when your symptomatic. 

4. Just lay down if youre symptomatic at all, flat on your back. Don't even bother sitting up until your heart rate is under control, laying down is going to be the position you need to be in during an episode. 


And I totally get the inability to exercise, believe you me I think we all with POTS have suffered through that. But my advice to you now is if traditional exercise is not possible, try to at least do very very simple ""exercises"" in bed laying down. Just little leg lifts, some arm circles in bed. I know it doesn't feel like much but you have to REALLY work back up to exercise with POTS and it's going to be tiny increments. I did physical therapy at first and then when I could upgrade from easy exercises laying down, I had to start on my recumbent bike for like 3 minutes. Three minutes! And two of those minutes were warm-up and cool down lol! It's rough but you just keep inching and inching and doing at least A LITTLE BIT of exercise each day is what is going to improve POTS.

gf7l00h,"As someone with dysautonomia (the umbrella term that POTS falls under), it is mostly just lifestyle changes. My cardiologist has me increasing salt intake (I have low BP), wearing compression leggings, staying hydrated and exercising. If it gets more severe, you can take beta blockers or other medications, but you really need to work with your doctor because all of the meds for POTS have side effects that can worsen other conditions, or can interact with other medications. I'm not currently taking any medications, but I drink a lot of LiquidIV (like super Gatorade) and that has been the biggest improvement for me. Compression stockings are supposed to be helpful too but I have hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos and I find that getting them on causes me to dislocate fingers and toes.

I usually manage it by treating the symptoms rather than the feeling of anxiety IE I know Im only anxious because my heart is racing so I'll try to slow my heart rate down by drinking water, laying down, cooling myself down, etc. 

But I would also recommend therapy, my therapist treats several patients with POTS for anxiety. They definitely go hand in hand and a therapist can give you both concrete ways to get your heart rate calmed down and coping skills for the panic!",2,0.8754000000000001,train

gf8mrky,"I'm on day 4 of symptoms as well (dunno when I was exposed). The first day I had chills and a fever of roughly 100.5. I felt very tired and fell asleep during the day which is pretty rare for me. Second day I felt back to normal with no fever but my face was reddish as if I had a fever. I coughed randomly maybe 6 times total that day. 

Third day I felt totally normal except I felt like my breathing was a bit tight plus some coughing and some muscle aches especially in the arms. Day four (today) I feel the same as yesterday (minus the muscle aches) but my nose is a little sensitive and stuffy. I feel like my sense of smell isn't quite as good but taste is the same.

Edit:

Day 5: cough is worse and coughing up phlegm at times (which I then spit out). Shortness of breathe - roughly 90% of normal capacity

Feeling a little fatigued and my eyes feels a bit weird but don't know how to describe it. Nose continues to feel sensitive and I've sneezed 5 times already today. Overall I still feel okay.  I've mainly been locked in my room. In the latter part of the day I realized my sense of smell is mostly gone but taste is still there. I feel fatigued.

Day 6: I got worried about my breathing as it appeared to worsen since I was having trouble getting a ""good"" breath. This may have been due to anxiety. I was able to get an inhaler (albuterol) via an online doctor which helped me relax a little. The inhaler helps a little but may be placebo. My sense of smell is pretty much gone. Mild fatigue and muscle aches. Nose continues to feel very sensitive in the nostrils.

Day 7: last night I woke up  in the middle of the night very sweaty and was shaking. After a minute my entire body was shaking but it then if subsided after a couple of minutes. Super weird experience. This morning I feel totally fine with mild shortness of breath . Shortness of breath tends to worsen as it gets closer to nighttime.

Days 5-10: Bouts of extreme fatigue, appetite loss, mild cough, complete loss of smell/taste

Although I have no cough, no sore throat, and I can tell my breathing is a little off but not concerning enough. One thing that stands out is how weak and shaky I am and how my brain feels extremely foggy, I couldn't even stand earlier and I had a fainting episode after leaving my house for the first time in a while.
