You cannot do that. To receive a pardon you have to have been convicted of a crime first. It doesn't make any sense to preemptively pardon since our legal system follows \"innocent until proven guilty\". \n\nTrump cannot preemptively pardon himself because he needs to be charged with a crime (Impeachment) and convicted (removed from office). The Founding Fathers thought of this loophole 244 years ago.\n\nEdit: for others to see about Nixon and citations why the President cannot preemptively Pardoned.\n\nNixon was never charged to begin with\n\nIt's a moot point with Nixon. Had he been charged the Pardon would have been challenged. Since he was never charged it was never challenged.\n\nFurthermore, the Constitution says directly:\n\n> The President ... shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of impeachment.\n\nKey word in Section 2 Clause 1 is \"offenses\". The definition for \"offense\" is provided by 18 U.S. Code SS 3156\n\n>the term \"offense\" means any criminal offense, other than an offense triable by court-martial, military commission, provost court, or other military tribunal, which is in violation of an Act of Congress and is triable in any court established by Act of Congress;\n\nA more lay person's definition\n\n>a breach of a law or rule; an illegal act.\n\nThis means \"offenses\" in Section 2 Clause 1 is referring to convictions as a person that has yet to be convicted is not in \"breach of a law\" by following \"innocent until proven guilty\" aka Presumption of Innocence.\n\nTherefore the President can only pardon someone that has been convicted.", "score": 0, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.124, "neu": 0.791, "pos": 0.084, "compound": -0.9368}}, "gebs1vj": {"comment": "They're availing themselves of the justice system now to reject the will of the people.\n\nThe people of the united states will have *our* day in court and avail *ourselves* of the justice system one this criminal administration is out of office.", "score": 6, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.126, "neu": 0.694, "pos": 0.18, "compound": 0.4404}}, "gedjfwb": {"comment": "If for no other reason than to help balance the budget.

Gideon is from Rhode island, and even though she has lived in the state for close to 16 years now, that will still dominate her identity.  People from Maine use the term \"from away\" to describe people not born in the state, and it's had huge cultural and political implications.\n\nAngus King is from Virginia, but he's done well for himself because he split the vote running for governor back in 1994, and was able to overcome such prejudice partly because of it.\n\nThere is also still a lot of cultural memory in the state of Maine for Rockefeller Republicans, pre-Reagan Republicans that were much more centrist and progressive compared to today's Republicans.  Pro-choice, less emphasis on religion, and someone and so forth.  Collins to many is still seen as the last vestige of that era, an era which Maine has taken pride in.  They gave us Republicans Olympia Snowe and even Margaret Chase Smith who stood up to the red scare, one of the few Republicans to do so.\n\nAs a final point, and this one's more anecdotal, most of the people I talked to just felt that Gideon's ads were too much on the offensive.  People really didn't like the way she was coming off, and that is a very important and how much the state's going to support you. Ted Cruz beat Donald Trump back in the primaries, and Joe Biden beat Donald Trump partly because of this mentality.  Many people voted for both Joe Biden and Susan Collins, Republicans and Democrats alike.  And that's because they thought both of them presented themselves in a more genuine manner, plus the points from above  I don't know quite how to properly measure that though, but that's just the take I've gotten from talking to numerous people here.  I think it became obvious to the Gideon campaign in the last week or so, because she dropped the attack ads and just started thanking people for considering her. It was honestly a bit weird.\n\nIt's complex, but it's in part due to all of this.

That's not the point and I think you know that. \n\nThe point is he won nearly 50% of the vote his *second* term. He was literally within a few points of 50%. That's *after* he'd already been blatantly and openly racist for 4 years. Mainers were very aware of his racism and yet almost 50% of them voted for him. And he won. In fact, he won greater percentage of people his second time around. \n\nI'm in one of the states below you and watched the LePage stuff unfold with horror. The whole region did. Maine really surprised a lot of by revealing an ugly side of itself. I'm confused by you guys in the comment section trying to defend the election of  LePage and spin it as proof that Maine doesn't have a racism problem. He was elected 6 years ago. Not 50. Not even 30. **6 years ago**. The nearly 50% of people who voted for an open racist didn't suddenly vanish from Maine.\n\nI frequently visit Maine. I love spending time there. And I get the impulse to defend the place you live against these kinds of accusations but trying to spin the LePage stuff is not the way to go about it. Not defending it at all is the way to go about it. It's better to acknowledge that yeah, Maine might have a little more of a racism problem than other places in the US. That way you can work to *fix* the problem. Ignoring it does nothing but maintain the status quo. It also puts you in the awkward position of having to defend and make excuses for racism. I doubt you want to literally shield racists, right? That's sort of exactly what you're doing with these excuses.\n\nEdit: Just looked it up. LePage got 37.6% of the vote in 2010 and 48.2% in 2014. He was governor until last year serving nearly 10 years. Some of his actions: he refused to attend MLK Jr. day, he told the NAACP to \"kiss his butt\" after rejecting several invitations from them, he said asylum seekers brought in disease, he courted sov cit groups, he said that Obama hates white people. That's all before he won a second term with, again, 48% of the vote.

Trickle Down  dictates that the $1 mill windfall should have made its way down the line to the employees, or at least gone to expand the office and grow the business so it can hire more employees (\"create jobs\").\n\nWhat actually happens in nearly 100% of such cases, is that the owner accumulates that excess as profit. It NEVER trickles down, which why the stock market is at 30,000, while workers make essentially the same as in 1974 (when the tax code was re-written to favor the wealthy at the expense of the middle/ working class), and the minimum wage has been raised only TWICE in 23 years, for a total of $2.25.

It is time to try Trickle UP Economics, in which money is limited at the top, and is shared with the workers who do the actual work and create the value for the corporation. The workers won't just accumulate it, they'll spend it on houses, furniture, vacations, restaurants, cars, etc. If they do accumulate it, it will only be deferred to retirement, when it will be spent then. All of that drives the economy hard, making it grow.\n\nBut isn't that unfair to the rich people? Not at all. All those houses, cars, vacations, etc. are sold by the rich, so all they are doing by making sure the working class isn't squeezed too tight is making sure there is an endless supply of customers for their products.

Warning: the cognitive dissonance from all the projection might give you a headache.\n\n>**Exercising Extraordinary Authority in Defense of Our Vote**  \n**May be Required because Martial Law is better than Civil War!**  \n>  \n>In the months following the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln struggled to preserve the Union. Many objected to Lincoln's extraordinary use of Presidential authority, in particular his suspension of the right of \"Habeas Corpus\". On June 12, 1863 Lincoln defended his extreme measures in a letter published in the New York Times. Citing Article I of the Constitution he argued: \"Ours is a case of rebellion...in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that 'the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it', is the provision which specifically applies to our present case.\"  \n>  \n>We have well-funded, armed and trained marxists in ANTIFA and BLM strategically positioned in our major cities acting openly with violence to silence opposition to their anti-American agenda. Attacking federal buildings and police, cowardly punching innocent people in the back of the head, assaulting people just eating in restaurants, and burning minority-owned businesses to the ground. All with elected officials in Democrat/Socialist-controlled cities openly encouraging this planned violence against civilians and businesses. Then, to advance their cause, these socialists are acting to \"Defund the Police,\" creating chaos and suspending the rule of law that protects millions of average, and particularly minority, Americans. The results being massive increases in violent crime and deaths in our cities and the destruction of small businesses orchestrated by those politicians and leftist groups, many [funded by domestic and international communists](https://wethepeopleconvention.org/articles/DemSocialistsParty-Ownedby-China). We are literally under attack from within!  \n>  \n>Then there are admitted Democrat/Socialist federal officials plotting to finish gutting the US Constitution after 100 years of trying. They promise to take away critical individual rights like free speech, religious freedom and the 2nd Amendment; destroy states rights by eliminating the electoral college and more; pack the Supreme Court with activist anti-constitutionalist judges who will make law from the bench; give the right to vote to tens of millions of non-Americans; and open our borders to more illegals which will reduce wages. No one voted for these things that were hidden from the majority of Americans by the corrupt media. Not only do we have corrupt media, like in Lincoln's day, we have a new and more sinister form of media in Big Tech, actively censoring free speech and promoting leftist propaganda to blind our citizens to their real goals and the real consequences of their actions - the end of America as we have known it.  \n>  \n>The Socialist Left has been openly working to destroy the United States since Obama promised and tried to \"transform\" America in 2008-16, and having been stopped by the will of the American people, they openly staged a four year long coup attempt to remove the duly elected President. Culminating in this corrupt and [provably fraudulent current election](https://wethepeopleconvention.org/articles/Voter-Fraud-Compilation-Page) planned to illegally and un-constitutionally deny the American people their most sacred honor, right and privilege - which is the right to elect their Representatives! How can we have a Representative Republic if we cannot hold fair elections to elect our Representatives? There is no doubt that this attempted stealing of these elections again \"is a case of rebellion...in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion\" that requires exercising extraordinary authority to preserve our Union.  \n>  \n>President Trump, you and every other official in our local, state and federal governments, and everyone in law enforcement and in our military have sworn an oath that says \"I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\" It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it. The enemies are within our gates and our Constitution and Nation are in real risk of being lost to this socialist/communist invasion unless you act decisively.  \n>  \n>At least half of all Americans do not and will not accept this fraudulent election because of the eyewitness testimony, and the material, statistical and mathematical evidence of [OVERWHELMING fraud](https://wethepeopleconvention.org/articles/Voter-Fraud-Compilation-Page). The other half will not accept the outcome if the courts see the evidence of fraud and rightfully overturn the election! The Left has literally been planning riots just for that occasion for months. We the People must not and WILL NOT cede our exclusive Constitutional right to elect our Representatives to judges, lawyers, courts, Governors, Secretary's of State, Congress, corrupt election officials and local politicians, the corrupt media - or Leftist threats of violence! It is OUR EXCLUSIVE RIGHT to decide our Representatives not theirs! Therefore, We the People MUST demand a NEW and fair national vote, a vote that all Americans can trust and live by regardless of the winner! Without a fair vote, we fear, with good reason, the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent. Gun sales are at an all time high and [40% are first time gun owners](https://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/retailers-40-of-2020-gun-buyers-are-first-timers-and-40-of-those-are-female/) looking to defend themselves, their property, and their rights. Therefore, Mr. President you must act now before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our Union.  \n>  \n>When the legislators, courts and/or Congress fail to do their duty under the 12th Amendment, you must be ready Mr. President to immediately declare a limited form of Martial Law, and temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections, for the sole purpose of having the military oversee a national re-vote. A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people. Federal candidates only. Paper ballots. No computers. Hand-counted with both parties watching every vote. Only registered voters. Photo ID to prove residence. Conducted safely with everyone wearing masks and six feet apart, just like we did in Ohio. Only then can the winning candidate be accepted as legitimate by a true majority of We the People who must give our consent to be justly governed! Unfortunately we are at a point where we can only trust our military to do this because our corrupt political class and courts have proven their inability to act fairly and within the law.  \n>  \n>You must also act, like Lincoln did, to silence the destructive media's one-sided propaganda designed and [proven to influence the election outcome](https://wethepeopleconvention.org/articles/Media-Bias-Cost-Trump), and end the unlawful censorship of Big Tech, to restore the confidence of the American People in our electoral process or we cannot continue as a nation. Failure to do so could result in massive violence and destruction on a level not seen since the Civil War. Limited Martial Law is clearly a better option than Civil War!  \n>  \n>Many will object to these actions, as they did in Lincoln's day, but we assure you that We the People understand that no less action will suffice to prevent the loss of our Constitutional right to vote and preserve our Republic. It is time to honor your oath, Mr. President. It is time for you to boldly act to save our nation as Lincoln did. We the People will support a national re-vote.

And, when a police officer pins on that shield and walks out the door, the officer's family should know they'll come home at the end of the day. Additionally, women and children are uniquely impacted by the criminal justice system, and the system needs to address their unique needs.\n* **Our criminal justice system must be focused on redemption and rehabilitation.** Making sure formerly incarcerated individuals have the opportunity to be productive members of our society is not only the right thing to do, it will also grow our economy.\n* **No one should be profiteering off of our criminal justice system.**\n\nBiden calls for the immediate passage of Congressman Bobby Scott's [SAFE Justice Act](https://bobbyscott.house.gov/SAFEJusticeAct), an evidence-based, comprehensive bill to reform our criminal justice system \"[from front-end sentencing reform to back-end release policies](https://bobbyscott.house.gov/SAFEJusticeAct).\" The Biden Plan will also go further.

Love or hate the man, I've found that while everyone can agree or disagree on many of his policies, few can argue against his character. Sanders' record of caring about the American people is indisputable - racism, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and many other issues that went against the norms for their time periods - voting for, or against, issues of civil rights before they became props for political theater - were his stock in trade. Bernie has always been on the right side of history. To find a man like that in politics, especially in today's political climate, is more than just a breath of fresh air, it's hope in a time when too many people have none. A lot of people were betting their all on that hope, myself included. \n\nMy generation, the millennials, are categorized in a variety of ways by the media. We're patronizingly told about how the world works and what we should/could do to \"pick ourselves up by the bootstraps\"; go to school, get a decent paying job, buy a house - strive for \"The American dream\", but that all went to shit. Having to try and explain inflation, or minimum wage, or cost of living to people pontificating about \"when I was your age\" is both frustrating, and disheartening. Trying to make an entire generation understand that today's world isn't the one in which they grew up, but now includes the culmination of all information at our fingertips with the internet; instant communication; data as an instantaneous public resource; a world more connected than at any time in history; but with expectations set in the faded realities of 10, 20, even 30 years ago, while politicians fight tooth and nail to keep it that way. We've learned, definitively, that the \"adults\" aren't always right. We've been fed false promises and told to accept a constantly moving target as a measure of our success, and new generations are being rapidly lost to that current. \n\nMillennials and Gen Z are the generations of the disillusioned, people unwilling to take things at face value anymore because the \"adults\" deal in bad faith; an education doesn't mean a well-paying job, it means crushing debt at the moment we're striking out on our own; medical care, when we can access it, adds to that debt and locks us into jobs that pay a fraction of what they did when our parents were our age; governments and corporations engage in open corruption designed to benefit from the suppression of wages - to have someone on \"our\" side, someone who spoke honestly and passionately, and acted consistently on behalf of the people whose most basic needs have been discounted as privilege - that was the message and hope Bernie Sanders gave to me.\nWe've watched since 2016 as the policies Bernie has pushed for years, slowly be adopted by the DNC. This pandemic has brought to light the lies we've been fed over our economy and who truly are our \"backbone\". Its not the corporations we bail out ever few years, or the politicians trying to keep the status quo. Its the people at the bottom supporting the whole structure. The times of \"meeting in the middle\" are gone. The reason nothing gets better is because for all the compromising the DNC does, none of it is with progressives. Its always with Republicans. Democrats act entitled to the progressive vote without actually giving progressives anything to vote for. The DNC is conservative, the GOP are insane, and the left has no representation. Change has to start somewhere with a voice and call to action. It started with Bernie, how the DNC responds will decide for me. \nThey have to EARN my vote.\"\n\nEverything starts January 20th, 2021. Whether or not I will vote for a party that holds none of the values I stand for purely because it's the \"lesser\" of two evils. Biden and the Democratic party have the chance to make actual change coming into this presidency.

I don't know it will really have the impact you are hoping for though (although it will help). \n\nI live in Oregon, we have arguably one of the easiest voting systems in the country. Assuming you are of age and a citizen we automatically register you if you get a state ID. If you don't get a state ID you can register online (this does require mailing in a signed form though). You can also update your registration online with no issues.\n\nWhen it's time for an election every single registered voter is mailed a ballot 2-3 weeks prior to election day and is provided with a voters pamphlet with candidate info, ballot initiative info, etc. You fill it out at your leisure and then either mail it or drop it in a dropbox. The only caveat is it has to arrive by election day so at a certain point it's not safe to mail. \n\nEven with all that we have a hard time getting youth (18-29) participation above 40%. Now don't get me wrong, that's still way better than most of the country but we also have a high turnout most of the time (in the general election this year we hit 79% turn out which was actually a decrease from 2008,2012, and 2016). \n\nMy point is that making it easier to vote does increase the youth turn out but it also increases everyone's turn out. The youth STILL vote at a lower rate than other demographics even if voting is super easy for them. \n\nAs a semi-young person (early 30s) I think the best thing we could do is eliminate first past the post. 80% of the people I knew who didn't vote when I was still considered (youth) was because they didn't think their vote mattered. If we had STAR or RCV that would at least be a little better. I also think making the electoral college allocation be proportional to how the state votes is a better system.

And yet we measure a candidates success in money raised. This is because, both historically and currently, money lets you spread your message more widely and effectively, and your ability to raise it suggests something about your ability to attract support. But there are plenty of voters out there with no money to donate to candidates or causes at all, who still get a vote on election day (absent economic suppression, which is another issue) that are not represented by any fundraising numbers. And it's entirely possible for a large block of voters to have a party or candidate preference that is uninformed or unchanged by anything money can buy. If we take away any metric from fundraising, perhaps we should look at total numbers of individual donors, which, while still not a complete picture, is much higher for progressives than for any other ideological block.\n\nOn the subject of voting being unaffected by spending, perhaps a big part of the reason younger people don't vote is that the things fundraising money gets spent on simply don't reach us. I saw maybe four political ads total this year, mostly at my parent's house, because I don't watch TV at mine. Nor do I listen to radio, in the car or otherwise.

In order for meaningful police reform of any kind to occur, Republicans pretty much by definition are not going to be involved- meaning that winning elections is more than slightly important. \"Defund the Police\" doesn't *have* to be endorsed by a candidate in a competitive district for it to be used to paint them as an undesirable radical, and turn the low-information vote against them.\n\nThis is a question of power, first and foremost, and cementing power that is sympathetic to our cause means we need to care about the messaging being used. Normal people don't actually read up on basically anything- slogans and chants are about the sum total of their exposure to much of anything, especially leftist policies. This being the case, if the only thing random voters see is a slogan that, on the surface, appears to *strongly* clash with their values- well, that's how you ensure they will vote GOP in droves.\n\nOn the other hand, if the headline catchphrases being used are more cagey and intelligent- *even though the underlying policy goals are still to demolish the policing establishment entirely*, low-information voters won't be able to watch a 15-second news clip and come away with the wrong impression.\n\nIt's pretty weird that this point isn't glaringly obvious- the general public and status quo run on basically zero actual information about the state of the world, and their opposition is generally characterized by sound bites. In a sound-bite dominated media world- *use soundbites that don't energize Republican voters*.\n\n\"Defund the Police\" isn't a bad slogan because the cause itself is wrong- the police in their current form need to be essentially wiped away entirely. But explaining why requires far more time than a news outlet is willing to give anyone willing to explain it. Catchphrases that are less easy to mischaracterize make it easy to organize without energizing the opposition nearly as much.\n\nEdit:\n\n> The point of messaging is, first and foremost, to convey what you mean,\n\nThis is a simplistic and pretty naive view. Messaging is used for many things- unification, explanation, etc. Most importantly, messaging is how you communicate with people who are not on your side, or are entirely uninterested in the issue. Messaging is a *tool*, and should be treated as such. Word choice is important, and picking the right ones enables you to push back against being mischaracterized, helps with painting your opponents as uncharitably as possible, and can be used to control the conversation in a way that favors *you*, and not the other side.\n\nThe right knows this very well, and dozens of books have been written on the rhetorical power of fascism and adjacent ideologies. The left in the USA has abdicated it's responsibility to weaponize rhetoric in the appropriate manner and divide, deplatform, and characterize our opposition in the worst possible light.\n\nWords are the most powerful weapon you can use, when used properly. I desperately hope more people on the left become more skilled with their rhetorical ability, and more tactical in their usage of messaging to control the conversation, because at the present time, the right *utterly dominates* the national discourse when discussing policing.", "score": 1, "sentiment_all": {"neg": 0.044, "neu": 0.836, "pos": 0.12, "compound": 0.991}}, "geegv9m": {"comment": "Manchin is one of the few ttempting to work on a bipartisan bill for COVID relief.

This education goes beyond what is necessary for an individual to get a job and therefore it must be publicly funded and have some minimum public direction.\n7.

(EDIT: although POTUS is more like CEO of a company, the company still has a board of directors who are the CEO's bosses. The dynamic is similar.) Things are even more complicated when there are far more bosses than servants. Our servants not only may have insufficient power, they may also have bosses with opposite demands. To make things worse, our servants may have coworkers who obstruct or sabotage their works. \n\nPart of being good bosses is to recognize these limitations and reward our servants accordingly. There are relatively few good bosses, but we should learn to be ones because our democracy depends on it.\n\nI believe that if Democratic Party has full control, they tend to deliver big.

If the government taxes 100% then people will either evade taxes or just not work at all. \n\nSo what the government wants to do is just find the point at which people pay the most in taxes before they start to evade taxes or stop working. \n\nNow, what is happening to the really rich is that relative to the rest of the population they do not pay the same.

Watkins' tweets have been shared tens of thousands of times.  \n>  \n>The videos were posted on YouTube by another well-known QAnon influencer, and they've been viewed more than 400,000 times.   \n>  \n>What the videos actually show, as a Gwinnett County Government spokesperson would clarify later, is the Dominion contractor producing a report from one of the machines and using a laptop to read the data, because third-party software cannot be installed on the voting machines.  \n>  \n>But such details didn't matter to Watkins, who urged his 325,000 Twitter followers to share the videos. While Watkins didn't identify the Dominion worker, he likely knew that his followers would do the work for him.  \n>  \n>And within a couple of hours, the contractor's name was being shared on fringe message board 4chan, and from there it was shared widely on Twitter, as well as on numerous right-wing sites like Parler.  \n>  \n>On the rabidly pro-Trump forum TheDonald, one user posted the contractor's name with a link to an image of a noose. A comment beneath the post pointed out that the image of the noose was now the number one search result for the contractor's name on Google images.  \n>  \n>\"The straw that broke the camel's back today is this 20-year-old contractor for a voting system company just trying to do his job,\" Sterling said Tuesday evening. \"I talked to Dominion today, and they said he's one of the better ones they got.
